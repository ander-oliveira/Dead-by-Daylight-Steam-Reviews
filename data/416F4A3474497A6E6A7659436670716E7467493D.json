As a killer you need to sacrifice a survivor by hooking the to meat hook (which is weird...) or you can kill them by using a perk that is unique for some killer or by an offering called mori. Survivor need to escape a trial by fixing the 5 generator the open the exit gate and escape or using a hatch ( hatch will respawn depend on fixed generator and survivor left in the trial).\n\n\nMatch Started\n\n    Right now there 24 survivor and 24 killer some of killer or survivor are from other franchises like halloween, left 4 dead, stranger things, scream, texas chainsaw massacare, saw, evil dead, a nightmare on elm street, and silent hill  Each killer and survivor has their own unique perk which can help them to for their objective, well sometimes some killer or survivor perk are useless. Some perk will have synergy with other perk there's many option to combine them. Killer have their own unique power which can help in the trial, some killer will have and easy power for you to mastering that skill, but some killer have a hard power for you to master it. \n\n\nPerk Example\n\n    The trial start in a realms there 15 realms each has a various enviroment and  based on a killer. Survivor and killer will spawn randomly in the realm. Survivor are in the third person and the killer in first person. This make survivor more aware of their current area and a killer will makes more difficult to chase survivor because limited visualibility. Survivor can bring item to trial ther medkit, toolbox, map and a key Different item will unlock interaction which can help you in trial. Item can also have add on, this add on will improve usefullness of that item. Killer can also have an add on for their power it can improve a killer unique power.\n\nPlot\n\n    Basically entity an unkown evil force abduct some people it can be a killer a survivor and they must play trial endlessly to satisfy the entity which death is no an escape, the entitiy block the gateway of death so they can back to entity world again. They are dissapearing from the world without a trace. Each Survivor and killer has their own background story.\n\nAudio\n\n    Audio of this game is great, map have their own unique ambience sound. You can hear a footstep when walking or survivor breathing when you near them. Some survivor have their own unique chasing sound when chasing survivor. When a killer near survivor it's will give a heartbeat sound which make you feel on terror is the killer is going to you or not.\n\nGraphic\n\n    Graphic was great but not somewhat very eye catching scenery or whatever its using unreal engine 4 And using preset to change the graphic low-ultra. When you put graphic to ultra sometimes it make some map more darker which make killer more harder to locate survivor, well you can exploit it by using low setting and if you a survivor in ultra setting sometimes can be a cons because you think that spot is good hiding place but the killer in low mode and can see you there.\n\nConclusion\n\n    Dead by daylight for me is something new and fresh gameplay it worked for me because i really like horror games, its not that very repetitive because you will be facing a different killer or survivor with different playstyles. Each player has their own strategy to playing this games. Overall i really recomend this games. It may be hard when you first time play it, but after you familiarize with it you will get into it. Maybe you try the mobile version of this games its free although its not fully describe the pc version. Dead by daylight avaible in steam and console (PS4, XB 1 and Switch)\n\nThank you for reading!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1606826393,"timestamp_updated":1608277740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81364790","author":{"steamid":"76561198082132690","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":23068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11877,"last_played":1658412896},"language":"russian","review":"Феерический багованый, безбалансное калище.

The learning curve is huge, and the \"ranking system\" still doesn't work, so newer players may struggle at first.\n- The community can be very toxic if you don't play exactly how they think you should.\n- BUGS (there are always some, but as of right now, the biggest one that I've dealt with is parties breaking every now and again in survive with friends.)\n- Extremely grindy at the beginning until you unlock every available characters teachable perks. This will take time and patience. \n\nOverall, I love this game. By no means is it perfect, and there are plenty of days that it pisses me off. Even still, I come back to it day in and day out, and I personally have no plans of stopping anytime soon. The game is addicting, even in its worst of patches.","timestamp_created":1606819243,"timestamp_updated":1606819243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81352415","author":{"steamid":"76561198974308475","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":16057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2527,"last_played":1652908704},"language":"russian","review":"ТОП","timestamp_created":1606819207,"timestamp_updated":1606819207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81352081","author":{"steamid":"76561198967971279","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":774,"last_played":1649911560},"language":"portuguese","review":"Melhor game <3","timestamp_created":1606818993,"timestamp_updated":1606818993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81352063","author":{"steamid":"76561198811153061","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1653577235},"language":"turkish","review":"full campliyolar oç evlatları","timestamp_created":1606818988,"timestamp_updated":1606818988,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81351744","author":{"steamid":"76561198239982096","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3188,"last_played":1638633055},"language":"polish","review":"fajna","timestamp_created":1606818783,"timestamp_updated":1606818783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81351637","author":{"steamid":"76561198362481141","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15276,"last_played":1611743635},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1606818711,"timestamp_updated":1606818711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81351464","author":{"steamid":"76561198286323722","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":27871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":213,"playtime_at_review":12551,"last_played":1660264388},"language":"english","review":"poge","timestamp_created":1606818603,"timestamp_updated":1606818603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81351169","author":{"steamid":"76561198285141923","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1637596219},"language":"turkish","review":":)","timestamp_created":1606818438,"timestamp_updated":1613496126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81351014","author":{"steamid":"76561198817818348","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8117,"last_played":1655148714},"language":"english","review":"Toxic Community, Shit Teammates...

You can play as a nasty vomit lady to your energetic angsty teen trying to stab people.\n\nThe survivors cannot fight back. Survivors can only palette slam the killers with randomized palettes on the map  to momentarily stun the killer & click clack their flashlight to temporarily blind the killers. The longer the chase- the more time you get for your team to complete hit boxes to escape! Fun to play with the right people.

[/b]\n\nThis game has such a fun premise and so much potential to be great, despite the mediocre 'tony hawk pro skater' tier graphics and the overall simplicity, but it just falls short in so many ways. The biggest issue is matchmaking. I'm not sure how on my first day playing the game I was getting matched with level 5+ Survivors and Level 1 killers, but that happened several times. As I ranked up more it got a little better, but it's still so sporadic and random. There can't be any kind of level cap because I've been literally matched with a level 1 as a level 20.\n\nMore irritating is that there appears to be no server region system. It's always a coin flip if you're going to be playing a functional game with players in the same area or get stuck with continuous lagfest with some dude across the world, essentially warping you right back into the killer's arms every 10 seconds when you try and run from them. For a game that is completely centered around a Ranked, competitive online experience, Matchmaking should be their highest priority. I've never played a game with worse matchmaking servers than this. I've never had any issue playing games online before, but this game seems to disconnect me constantly and best of all, you get penalized with a time delay every time the game disconnects you. It always seems to disconnect me when I am winning, yet the penalty for disconnect keeps rising when it should be obvious I am not disconnecting by choice. This is such a ridiculous system.\n\nThe Game is labeled as 'asymmetric' but as a lover of asymmetric puzzles, this game just feels unbalanced most of the time. Some Killers, Survivors and Perks are just inherently better than others and there's really nothing more to it. The balance between Killer and Survivor is so far off it's not even funny, to the point where it either feels like you had no chance at winning because everything is stacked against you, or the match is so easy you feel underwhelmed and like you didn't earn a victory at all. Whether you win or lose, you're just left feeling unsatisfied.   \n\nAnd icing on the cake is that the game is filled to the brim with absurd amounts of paid DLC, so much that if you wanted to have all the characters you'd have to pay well over $120 in DLC alone, not to mention cosmetics and other microtransactions. The Devs ask Triple A pricing and constant pay walls for a game that utimately feels like it's still in pre-alpha.\n\nNot recommended UNLESS it is on sale AND you have friends to play custom matches with, because the matchmaking is so wildly inconsistent. 25% of the time you have the time of your lives and laugh with your friends and encounter great players, and the other 75% of the time it's just such a dumpster fire of bugs, crashes, imbalanced gameplay and exploitative players who body block or camp/farm for points instead of playing the game.","timestamp_created":1606814557,"timestamp_updated":1606842989,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tIznjvYCfpqntgI="}
