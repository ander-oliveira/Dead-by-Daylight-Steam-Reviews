Всё что вы будете делать это бегать вокруг куч мусора, разбивать доски и перелазить через оконные проёмы. Игра приносит хоть какое-то удовольствие первые часов 5-10, потом начинается ад. После каждой катки не зависимо от того как вы отыграли на вас будут выливаться кучи помоев. Вы будете гореть от того что не смогли никого поймать, а кого поймали не смогли донести даже до крюка. В игре из 11 маньяков что-то могут 2-3, остальные существуют не понятно зачем. Баланс сдвинут в сторону выживших и это всегда будет так - 80% базы это выжившие поэтому разработчики всегда будут на их стороне. Игра за маньяка это постоянный стресс, и вы скорее будете ощущать себя жертвой, которая молиться о том чтобы выжившие поскорее вышли через ворота, а не приседали там 20 минут.\n\nЕсли вы хотите купить эту игру чтобы поиграть за выжившего, то все что вы будете делать это чинить генераторы и бегать вокруг всё тех же куч мусора. Отличие от маньяка в том, что первые 5-10 часов игра вряд ли будет приносить удовольствие: вас будут постоянно ловить (хотя только в это время вы будете ощущать хоть какой-то страх перед маньяком), но потом вы сможете стать одним из тех, кто водит огромного мужика с мачете вокруг сарая 20 минут.\n\nУ игры есть потенциал, но он полностью загублен наплевательским отношением разработчиков ко всему, начиная балансом и заканчивая отвратительным коммьюнити. Игра приносит хоть какое-то удовольствие только первые несколько часов, как только вы разберётесь что к чему пропадает большая часть того что обещает эта игра: атмосфера, ощущение силы у убийцы, ощущение страха у выжившего. Остается только беготня вокруг мусора, разбивание досок и починка генераторов. В эту игру лучше поиграть 8-10 часов, как в любой нынешний сингл, а потом просто забыть о ней навсегда.","timestamp_created":1527399666,"timestamp_updated":1527399666,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547773063182830811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42300297","author":{"steamid":"76561198316403284","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":235,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1660468671},"language":"schinese","review":"现在亚服匹配不到人，只能进美服。其余的都还好。","timestamp_created":1527399605,"timestamp_updated":1527399605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42300278","author":{"steamid":"76561198404711479","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":734,"last_played":1573928352},"language":"english","review":"I have been playing this game for over a year as a Killer Main player and I have seen the developers  consistently hamstring, makes things harder and remove any kind of benefit or desire to play as a Killer Main player.\n\nFor example, for my Killer Main character my Field of View (FOV) is about 40 degrees!!

Started playing in 2016 with the alpha build, left my first negative review in 2018 and updated it in 2019 (still negative). 700 extra hours later and it’s time for another update. My updates have increasingly focused on developer Behaviour Interactive’s (BHVR) role in DBD’s development, which should tell you where the problems lie because, at this point, DBD’s a decent game, but it’s being managed atrociously and has been for a long time.\n\n[h1]BHVR[/h1]\n\nThat's right, a whole section just for them.\n\nDBD is BHVR’s first (and only remaining) full game release. Historically, they made ports for well-known titles and finally took a punt by paying a few million for the rights to produce DBD. Now they’ve got a staff of around 700, most of which likely work on DBD, and they’re utterly incapable of putting out a single update that doesn’t break a bunch of mechanics or introduce a litany of bugs. In DBD’s genesis, I was forgiving of BHVR’s slapdash releases and slipshod attempts at balancing the meta, but the game’s been out for five years now. In that time, BHVR has made literally millions from DBD (I saw one article last year that indicated they’d made around $434m), and yet they can’t be bothered to address the game’s health whatsoever. It took them years to figure out that there were way too many pallets on maps, which, if you played just [i]five[/i] matches as Killer, was blindingly obvious; how do you not see this as a developer? Killers like Freddy took almost two years to receive complete reworks to make them competitively viable, and the forums screamed the entire time about how bad he was. I'm not saying take the diehard community's word for it, but there's no smoke without fire. How do you not see this? When a new update comes out then you can expect a whole slew of insane bugs to come with it... EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I don’t expect perfect first time, but we're multiple years from release and the company has obviously grown in thanks to DBD's success and yet they STILL cannot put out even a mostly bugfree update. It's just embarrassing now. [i]How do you not see this?[/i]\n\nAnother recent example: colourblindness options took a combination of four years of player requests, a dedicated redditor posting weekly memes about it for a [i]YEAR[/i], and an industry professional publicly calling BHVR out before they [i]finally[/i] added colourblindness settings that most other games have on release. Even worse, they had the absolute cheek to claim that they’d been “working on it for months” when they’d previously dismissed demands for it as a complete non-priority. This is utterly disgusting.\n\nMore issues: one update broke the outlines on generators that made it nearly impossible for some players to see and, instead of instantly reverting the update, it was in there for months. What else? Completely unnecessarily they announced a HUD change, which almost no one asked for and wasn’t needed. It, admittedly, had two good new features, but came at the apparent cost of splitting the previously combined elements to instead be all over the screen. So you had to look in multiple areas to understand the game state. When these flaws were pointed out then BHVR (quite petulantly) claimed this had taken “months of work” and they couldn’t [b][i]possibly[/i][/b] consider walking it back or making changes. Are you serious? It was literally just moving the locations of some features. I’m no developer but I’m confident you can just move back the location of HUD elements in – and I’ll be generous here – two weeks, but probably [i]considerably[/i] less than that. Oh, and, btw, they did eventually cave to pressure (despite saying they wouldn’t) and found a compromise that was basically enough like the original they could’ve just left everything as it was in the first place.\n\nOh and some people have hacked the in-game reporting system (which BHVR basically admits does nothing) to show a list of really disgusting and racist language at any player that tried to report those players for hacking. I’m pretty sure this one’s been in the game for months now and BHVR just shrug their shoulders.\n\nI’ve often felt that DBD started as a fun little joke of a game and then it got big. Really big. I think its success took BHVR by surprise. The initial flimsy game architecture that they threw together to get the design off the ground in 2016 collapses at the mere whisper of a new DLC, patch, or basically any change whatsoever. The game critically needs an infrastructural overhaul to improve stability and tackle optimisation and bugs, which are rife and continue to show up in droves with each new patch. For instance, the Nemesis DLC came with a new map that was taken out of rotation a day after release as it had stability issues. BHVR all but admits that their quality control and playtesting is non-existent as they chase a relentless release schedule for more money.\n\nBHVR is the kid in the class that acts out constantly, and we’re the teachers and parents that continue to allow it because we don’t want to give up the loveable aspects of the game we enjoy. And that’s the heart of the issue: DBD has no competition. BHVR can do whatever they like because there’s nowhere else to go in retaliation. Competition would force BHVR to shape up, but most similar games don’t have the funding or fail to execute the mechanics to make them worth playing. Thus BHVR continues to sit tyrannically on its throne treating the playerbase however it damn well pleases.\n\nSigh.\n\n[h1]The Actual Game[/h1]\n\nDevelopers aside, at this point in its life, DBD is actually a very solid game. Balance is at the best point it’s been, build options are wider than ever, in-game quests give you reasons to keep playing, and the gameplay itself – while still stale – has been refined enough that you get a fun game out of nearly every match. \n\nYou should know that DBD is NOT a thriller/horror game, it’s an action game with a horror theme, which means it’s rarely scary, and, more often than not, the action is slapstick and silly. When the Killer’s on your tail then get ready to run around a car three times because that’s the way the action plays out. It’s silly, but it’s very telling of the kind of action game DBD is. You’ll feel the fantasy of hunting or being hunted for your first hours with the game, but it’ll soon wear off when you realise Survivors have a relatively relaxed gameplay experience. Meanwhile, Killers are under constant stress to perform or face of a ton of hate mail and in-game taunting from the Survivors.\n\nFurthermore, the game’s baseline design is entirely propped up by perk-based bonuses players select pre-game to alter match mechanics in some way. Generators completing too fast? Take Ruin. Killer focusing you? Take Decisive Strike. Killer camping hooks to secure kills? Borrowed Time. Some of these things, at this point, should just be baseline game elements. But then lower skill players would probably lose out and enjoy games less, so BHVR stands by and does nothing because they’re scared to hurt their profits instead of actually make the game better.\n\nHowever, despite all I've said about BHVR’s appalling management, the crazy thing about Dead by Daylight is... I keep playing? The game idea itself is still thrilling and, over time, it's finally reached a state that’s bizarrely addictive to play. It's also stressful, frustrating and HORRIFICALLY toxic in places, but I play on anyway... On that note, the toxicity's been there since day one and BHVR still hasn't implemented anything close to an effective reporting system. How? It's clearly an issue and you've had years to think on it. Get your act together, BHVR.\n\nIn short, I'm saying don't get DBD because the developers are a total clown fiesta, but it can also be fantastic fun often enough (particularly with friends) if you don't mind putting up with some of the most ridiculously appalling game design execution ever.","timestamp_created":1527388327,"timestamp_updated":1632184763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":496,"votes_funny":41,"weighted_vote_score":"0.820677995681762695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42297108","author":{"steamid":"76561198452191943","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1545689602},"language":"spanish","review":"hola comunidad de dead by daylight me acabo de descargar el juego pero cuando lo trato de iniciar el juego manda un aviso diciendo (easy anti-cheat cannot run if driver signature enforcement has been disabled) fácil ejecución de trampas si la ejecución de la firma del disco ha sido deshabilitada me han recomendado este juego pero la verdad no se como se arregle este problema","timestamp_created":1527388288,"timestamp_updated":1527388288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42296982","author":{"steamid":"76561198343568022","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":4935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":799,"last_played":1620306245},"language":"english","review":"I played this game for free on the weekend. \"It's free so why not give it a go?\" I thought.\nI was only going to play it for a hour or two then jump back into dark souls remastered.\nAfter playing for six hours straight, I forced myself to turn it off and go to sleep.\nSo...yeah, I bought the game.

Every other killer can be looped and chased around the map for death and there is nothing you can do about it.\n\nThere is a youtuber called Marth 88 who tested this. In his tests, with coordination and meta perks 98/100 killers DID NOT PIP UP AGAINST THEM.\n\nTHIS MEANS THAT THE WINRATE OF KILLERS AGAINST A SKILLED, COORDINATED TEAM WITH META PERKS IS 2% !!! TWO FUKCING PERCENT! And this is an evidenced, proper, scientific study, not an opinion piece, you cannot challenge it without a similar sample size of your own.\n\nYet, the devs refuse to address this. The rationale is simple: there are 4x as many people playing survivor as killer. So they will continue to balance the game to make it entertaining for survivors. Nothing else matters. \n\nStomping a group of randoms is fun, but a coordinate team will make your life hell and there is NOTHING you can do about it.\n\nAvoid like the plague.","timestamp_created":1527378295,"timestamp_updated":1555167226,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42294447","author":{"steamid":"76561198181804977","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1625594985},"language":"spanish","review":"Alto juegoooo, muy divertido y te sentis re zarpado cuando boludeas al asesino.\nPD: Aguante el myers","timestamp_created":1527378137,"timestamp_updated":1606612808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42294308","author":{"steamid":"76561198097805153","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":102,"playtime_at_review":21625,"last_played":1659683770},"language":"schinese","review":"非对称性游戏的鼻祖，紧张刺激又不失娱乐性，游戏玩法和体验都很不错，很耐玩的游戏，适合休闲玩家！一把游戏10-15分钟，不会太久，很像小时候的捉迷藏！很好的创意！","timestamp_created":1527377646,"timestamp_updated":1527377646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550949931144714355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42294297","author":{"steamid":"76561197986327183","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":142,"playtime_forever":7470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4040,"last_played":1532883322},"language":"english","review":"Edit 12.06.2018, now it has microtransactions.... https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409933984\n-\nThe community and devs are toxic af.

Наконец-то мои руки дошли до этой игры... До моего фаворита... До той игры, которую я благославляю... Начну с того, что я достаточно преданный фанат этой игры. Взять только мои написанные руководства, среди которых есть достаточно знаменитое руководство про взаимодействие Удачи в игре. Я играю в неё с Бета релиза... Тогда она была ещё совсем маленькой и никому не нужной. Помню, когда все только учились играть, каждый придумывал миф о какой-то вещи, каком-то персонаже, о какой-то локации... Но на самом деле, пасхалок просто нет и не было никогда. Везде всё всегда было прямо и без какого-либо подтекста. Взять только раздувание мифа о том, что Эйс, как персонаж, имеет увеличенную удачу. Всё это ху*ня. Эхх... Ностальгия... Эта игра меня затягивала глубоко в свой омут во времена выхода новых глав... Добавление Майкла... Все ныли, что он Имба, а потом все начали ныть, что он слабый... Девсы даже глазом не моргнули на это. Они забили на это болт и просто ждали. Нерф Ведьмы... Бафф доктора... Нерф Кожаного лица... Бафф Призрака... Все эти мгновенья остались в моей памяти навсегда... Помню то время, когда я, будучи обычной кепкой, только сел за эту игру... Клодетт... Мой первый выживший... Я не умел играть... Умирал постоянно... Но с практикой мне удалось вытянуться из этого де*ьма... Сначала я дико боялся этой игры... Для меня это был Экшен-Хоррор... Я ссался от каждого звука... А сейчас для меня это обычная Бегалка-Соревнование между убийцей и выжившем... Вот бы вернуться в 2016 год и испытать те ощущения снова... \n\nЛадно, с предисловием я закончил. Теперь конкретно об игре: Это по задумке - Хоррор-Экшен. Тут все должны ср*ться. Но нет. После суток часов в игре, ты начинаешь привыкать к резкостям и тебе уже ничего не страшно. Сама игра - не нововведение. Такой подобный жанр уже был. Взять только White Noise 2 или её пра-пра-прадеда - Damned. В эти игры я тоже играл. Но они были... Хм... Слишком простыми чтоли? Там всё было как-то мрачно... А тут... Тут веселье! Канадцы хорошо постарались! Эта игра может тянуть на лучшую Канадскую игру за всю историю игр Канады. Да не, перебор. Взять хотя бы серию Ассасинов или Splinter Cell. Вот это по-настоящему лучшие игры. Геймплей для начала сложный, не  спорю. Много новичков уходят, так как из-за неумения играть, они попросту умирают и делают RageQuit из игры навсегда, что печально. Подборка предметов, система прокачки достаточно оригинальные. Система с Перками не Оригинальная (взять любое MMORPG), но зато реализована очень классно!\n\nКоммьюнити состоит из двух людей: Школьники (ну они везде) и нормальные взрослые люди. Так как зачастую первых больше, чем вторых, то после матча можно узреть ряд оскорблений в свою сторону. Это удручает. За то тут нету микрфона! Слава богу, что его нет. Иначе бы игра была бы полностю испорченная, как Пятница 13. \n\nКонтент - Регулярен. Как в Радуге. Каждые 3 месяца выходят по новой главе. И это круто! Всегда есть шанс вернуться в неё обратно после перерыва. Есть какой-то стимул. \n\nС онлайном тут всё хорошо, проблем никаких нету. Всегда есть убийцы и всегда есть выжившие. Матч по моему мнению ищется довольно быстро.\n \nОптимизация есть. Баги в Геймплее, почти отсутствуют, но... Лаги в лобби, главном меню, вылеты, краши и прочая фигня с серверами, раздражает. Этому нужен жесткий Клининг. Без него никак!\n\nЛадно, к плюсам и минусам:\n\nПлюсы: \n-Интересный Геймплей\n-Оригинальная задумка\n-Отличная реализация жанра\n-Хорошая оптимизация \n-Отсутствие микрофона!\n-Контент\n-Постоянный онлайн и его прирост\n\nСпорно:\n-Коммьюнити (так как микро-то нету, а чат есть)\n\nМинусы:\n-Лаги, баги, вылеты с серверами\n\nОвералл: \n\n9,2 баллов из 10 \n\nИгра обязательна к покупке!

A lot of people are angry because of reworks and the Developers are getting hate because people can't solve their own problems. People don't want nerfs that hurt them or buffs that help the enemy and get angry and frustrated that the developers are actually TRYING (Not always succeeding) to help balance the game and make it a fun experience for all.\n\nThat being said, the game is quite fun. Gameplay is a system of cat and mouse chasing, where you must repair the generators and escape without being caught and killed. This vanilla experience is altered as you will gain perks and items to use against the survivors or killer which alter gameplay. Overall, the game is quite interesting based on the unique take of the multiplayer horror genre. \n\nMake a game where you aren't getting scares from things jumping out, but the everlasting dread that creeps into your heart when you are finishing a gen and slowly hear a heartbeat.... Walking towards you.... It knows where you are... and it will get you... or they will walk past you, kick the gen, and keep going as your friends across the map just blew up a generator three times in a row like idiots. The game is not traditional horror, as you aren't scared by the killer, you aren't scared by getting caught. The scare comes from progression towards the exit and somebody alerting the killer and leading the killer to you.\n\nKillers have a harder time then you would think however. In a one versus one match, Killer just needs to find the survivor and hook them once. However, with four survivors, all of them being able to do generators, means that the killer has to be cunning and use their ability to mess with the survivors, keep them off generators, and keep them away from the exits. These are more often the masochistic players, as they are basically gluttons for punishment from the community. \n\nThe DLCs are great, and hold amazing perks behind them. With some, you get amazing perks, such as BBQ and Chili from Leatherface which increases Bloodpoint payout, the currency of the game, then you have some like Myers whom are higher levels of play killers that have abilities that are amazing. The only exception is the Nightmare on Elm Street DLC and the Cosmetic DLCs. When Freddy was introduced, he was viewed as OP, so he got nerfed to Hell, but is currently facing a possible rework. Then the Cosmetics don't do anything. If you do want to spend money on this game for cosmetics: go with Charity Case, it is for charity, so good cause, am I right?\n\nNow, you are going to hear the community is toxic. Yeah, that is basically it, as a lot of players will be total jerks and will leave you behind or will have bad manners and teabag. However, that is only around 20-40% of players, and honestly, everyone else is pretty open and cool. 20-15 is the learning period for new players now, and is where you will make most of your friends or meet the cool and friendly survivors, even if some of them are quite angry (I apologize in advance if you see me in game, I usually get angry because I just get tunneled so hard around half the time, and the other half, people teabag)\n\nThis game is a great game overall, and is just limited by the Development team and how the player base is overall shattered and confused.\n\n If you are looking to buy this game, wait until there is a sale, pick it up for around ten dollars, and see about getting your friends to join you. If you really love the game and enjoy it, buy DLC packs and help teach the next generation of players. \n\nIf you hate it, just refund it and write a review detailing what was bad and what was good, that will help give out a pro/con for the game. I praised it, but I didn't give it much flak. This is because I think that the game gets too much crap from people who are angry at the developers, or people who play the game and don't like specific things. \n\nMy recommendation: Watch some videos of gameplay for both Killer and Survivor. If you like what you see, try it out. If you don't like it, refund it, then write a review with pros and cons. If you do, write a review to help people understand all of the issues or be willing to teach people how to play the game.","timestamp_created":1527359069,"timestamp_updated":1533622896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tLvszuMCfZ6ooQE="}
