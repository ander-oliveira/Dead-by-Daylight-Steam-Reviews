played this game for about twelve hours and already see a glaring problem. This game is complete garbage in some aspects.  Here are some pros and cons.   \n\n[Pros]\n\nPlaying survivors actually conveys a sense of fear and dread at times, not actual fear, but fear of losing them sick rank progression points and potential blood points. (essentially XP.) \n\nKillers are unique, and interesting to play as, despite some clearly being better than others. (The nurse being clearly amazingly good, if you can understand her.) \n\nThe game is oddly... hard to find stale, despite spamming game after game, the consumable add-ons and offerings add a layer of replayability and lack of staleness.\n\n[Cons]\n\n[Killers.]\n\nListen, survivors, once they get easy access to flashlights and batteries... are fucking insane. I've played five games so far, level 20 into trapper, rank eighteen. Trapper is a solid pick, but is weaker than the high tier killers,  this would be fine if skill mattered into whether i get to have fun in all of my games. When i actually am able to have fun due to my skill, it's because none of the survivors brought flashlights and batteries. Survivors can group, easily pick up gens, move to the next, and stomp you. I downed two survivors, they didn't even worry, just waited for me to pick one up, flashlighted me due to the fact there was no nearby wall... and i dropped the survivor who instantly healed due to a poor game mechanic, and then immediately lost him and had to chase him again. Therefore giving more time for them to do gens. It took me a solid Five MINUTES. of just hitting, and picking up survivors, to finally  get one dead. There isn't any intrinsic lack of skill to me, they literally face camped me as the killer, and i felt more scared to play than i ever did as a survivor. This really makes killers feel unfun, and non-scary to play as. Now this is due to the fact i don't have the perk and offering to reduce flashlight stun and build up, but that shouldn't be required to have fun even at my low level...\n\n[survivors]\n\nSurvivors... just feel unfun to play as, unless you completely stomp the killer, honestly, it feels unfun for the game to hinge on three other people unless you have the godly perks. Teamwork and altruism will crush any killer. Borrowed time decisive strike and sprint burst? Dang, well i guess we're just gonna completely stomp the killer as our Dwight runs leadership so we can speed through our 5 gens in less time than it takes for one hooked teammate to die. If you like challenge, play without items, or item add-ons, allowing RNG and chests to actually give you that edge with a sense of risk. otherwise it feels like it's too easy to hardstomp.\n\n[TL;DR]\nKillers are horrendously perk and item locked in the early game compared to survivors. Early survivors with no perk and no item are harshly under-relevent unless they know how to play well. Killers are horrendously irrelevant to late game survivors... even with some decent perks.\n\nSurvivors are fun, but eventually become dull to the fact they can hardstomp easily.\n\n\n[Final Thoughts]\nThis game is worth it to buy on sale, for every time i get flashlight assholes, i will get two or three games of people who are normal, and one or two games of altruistic good players.  then about four or three games of people who play hyper altruistic without any sense of safety and easily let me decimate them.  In total, the game is good as a whole, but the small bits and pieces make either the survivor late game... or the killer early game... horrendous.","timestamp_created":1518850094,"timestamp_updated":1518850094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40147534","author":{"steamid":"76561198273309000","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1434,"last_played":1625490970},"language":"russian","review":"zbc","timestamp_created":1518849713,"timestamp_updated":1518849713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40147446","author":{"steamid":"76561198099665788","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":12475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5891,"last_played":1611989254},"language":"schinese","review":"玩之前以为是猫鼠游戏，就不是特别感兴趣。直到玩了以后才发现并不是人毫无反抗能力的猫鼠游戏。人可以用手电筒照屠夫，用板子砸屠夫。总的来说还是非常有趣的，制作组也一直关注游戏的平衡性。除了被强行守尸无解以外，没有什么游戏模式上的硬伤。对中国玩家态度也比较友好，虽然国内不让播了，但是玩家还是有很多。非常值得一试。","timestamp_created":1518849378,"timestamp_updated":1518849378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40147335","author":{"steamid":"76561198403427285","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":4357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1637026406},"language":"koreana","review":"tlqkf겜","timestamp_created":1518848969,"timestamp_updated":1626895537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609933257102966309","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40147326","author":{"steamid":"76561198395744305","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":61053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25627,"last_played":1633969547},"language":"english","review":"ay nit may prestik bek :x","timestamp_created":1518848923,"timestamp_updated":1518848923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40147057","author":{"steamid":"76561198355436451","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1656301580},"language":"thai","review":"เข้าไม่ได้ติด error","timestamp_created":1518848042,"timestamp_updated":1518848042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40146857","author":{"steamid":"76561198202215801","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":6027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":779,"last_played":1637695536},"language":"russian","review":"Сразу скажу игра мне понравилась рекомендую!

Nurse（複数あるキラーの一体）を極めた使い手のみです。\n\nこのゲームには他者と意思疎通を行う機能（ボイチャ）がありません。わずかにエモーションがありますが、もっぱら煽りに使われるだけで意思疎通はできないのです。\n当たり前です。そんな簡単に連携取れたらバランス崩壊じゃないですか。\nしかし、フレンドと一緒に遊ぶ機能で特定の人と一緒にマッチングし、Discordなど外部ツールで意思疎通ができたら...？\nこのゲームをやっていない人には理解できないかもしれませんが、この意思疎通ができるという一点があまりにも大きすぎるのです。\n\nこのゲームはキラー1人VS生存者4人の非対称対戦ゲームです。\nですが、生存者が連携しなくてもパークというスキルと知識をフル活用すれば生き残れるのです。見えないところで他の生存者が何をしているのか、キラーが何をしているのかわからないからこそこのゲームは楽しめます。状況を確認できる術は目視か画面左下の生存者の負傷状態でしか確認できません。\n[ケース1]\n生存者の一人が負傷した！→キラーと追いかけっこしてるから発電機を直そう！→発電機はどこ？他の生存者は？負傷している生存者はどこで追いかけっこしてる？\n[ケース2]\nキラーに見つかった！逃げないと！→他の生存者はどこ？擦り付けないようにしないと！ or 発電機はどこ？発電機の近くで追いかけっこしたら他の生存者が修理しにくい\n[ケース3]\nキラーを発見！こちらにはまだ気づいていない→違うところへ向かったけど、他の生存者はどこ？キラーは次にどこへ向かう？\n\n上記のようなケースはボイスチャットパーティ（以下VC）であれば完全に解決します。どこで何をしているのか、キラーがどこで何をしているのか意思疎通しておけば誰かが追いかけっこしている間に発電機を修理しきって脱出ゲートを開放することくらい容易いのです。\nそして脱出ゲートが開いたら煽りタイムの開幕！思う存分にキラーを煽る煽る！！勝確だからね！！！ヒャッハー！！！！\nなワケですよ。\n楽しいでしょうねぇ。仲間と連携感に浸りながら相手をフルボッコにして煽れるんですから。\n前述したThe Nurseならば鬼ごっこを拒否したムーブでVC相手でもなんとかなるんですが、普通の徒歩キラーでは毎回こんな感じです。\n\nVCがいかにクソかはわかっていただけたでしょうか？\n野良パーティ相手ならば多少はマシになりますが、どうあがいてもキラーが不利なことには変わりありません。\nキラーから逃げるためのオブジェクトとして板と窓の二つがあるのですが、現状でもまだまだ多いです。\n\nそして生存者側の逃走テクニックとしてグルグルがあります。\n魔法陣じゃないですよ。同じところをぐるぐる回って追いかけっこするんです。\nなぜなら、生存者とキラーでは体の当たり判定が違うんです。\nキラーってデカいんだから当たり前じゃんと思うかもしれませんが、そうじゃないんです。キラーは隠れ肥満なのですよ。一番わかりやすいのが板スタンです。どう見ても板が当たってない距離なのに当たります。\nだから何？と思うかもしれませんが、グルグルする上でとんでもないディスアドバンテージなのですよ。\n簡単に言えば徒競走でのトラックです。生存者は当たり判定が小さいのでグルグルというトラックの内側を走れます。一方キラーは当たり判定がデカいのでトラックの外側を走らされます。\nつまり、直線を走るよりグルグルしたほうがずっと時間を稼げるのです。\n\nそれでもグルグル回っているだけではキラーの方が足が速いため追いつかれますが、追いつかれる前に板があれば？窓があれば？\nもっと時間を稼げます。時間を稼げば他の生存者が発電機を修理します。修理しきって脱出ゲートを開けば勝ち確です。もはやただのクソゲーです。このクソゲーを拒否できるのはThe Nurseだけです。\n高ランク帯のキラーがナースしかいない！と文句を言う輩がいますが当たり前です。そこまでランクを上げられるくらいにプレイできるキラーがThe Nurseくらいしかいないんですから。\n\nこのゲームをやろうと思っている人はまずプレイ動画や配信を見てからにしましょう。それから決めても遅くはないはずです。\nそれでもやる！というのであれば生存者から始めてください。\n\n最後に、他のレビュアーも言っていますがキラーを煽らないでください。煽るなダメゼッタイ\n\n2018/7/30追記\nちょこちょこアップデートが配信されてはいますが、正直言って「開発はやる気あるのか？？」と疑うレベルです。そもそもキラーが苦しいのでテコ入れできないかという要望に対する返答が「Go civ（シビリゼーションでもプレイしろやｗｗｗ）」ですからね、当然かもしれません。\n確かに初心者狩りが無くなるように、pipが没収されてもランク16より下（ランク17～20の初心者帯のこと）には下がらなくなるなどの調整を行うようですが、、、肝心の部分がま～～～ったく手付かずです。\n\n1.VCPT\n上記のレビューでも挙げましたが、圧倒的アドバンテージであるVCに対する規制が全くありません。だめだこりゃ。\n\n2.発電機の修理速度\nキラーが生存者一人をダウンさせたところで残り発電機が5機→2,3機なんてことがザラ。ここにツールボックスがあればもっと早くなります。要するに発電機の修理速度が早すぎるんですよ。どないせぇと？\n\n3.板や窓\n未だに多いです。もちろん少なめのマップもありますが、基本的には多いです。徒歩キラーが少ないのも当たり前。板を倒すタイミングに調整が入って以前のようなワープ板倒しはできなくなりましたが、それなら早めに倒せばいいだけ。改善といえば改善ではあるけど、板が多くちゃ意味が無い。\n\n4.Decisive StrikeやSelf Careなどの生存者のパーク調整\n調整するとは言いましたが後回しで9月とのこと。期待できそうにないです。\nこれら生存者のパークがどれだけ環境を支配しているのかわからないんでしょうね。そりゃ生放送でライト当てられてリザルトで「noob killer」と言われるや否やライトを弱体化させるようなエアプ開発ですからね。あ～あ。\n\n総評：いまだにクソゲー状態です。もう惰性でやってる感じですわ、ハイ。","timestamp_created":1518839895,"timestamp_updated":1532877942,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":77,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.71136927604675293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40144339","author":{"steamid":"76561198001155266","num_games_owned":1102,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":18426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4425,"last_played":1656965717},"language":"brazilian","review":"AMO

I can only see this game being fun at the low to mid level, if you are fine with that then so be it. But this game at the high level is horribly balanced and is not fun in the slightest. The developers have sought it upon themselves to poorly implement an MMR system in a game where it's competitive game play is a joke. For killers you only have a few selection of  viable killers to play if you remotely want to have a chance to play and even then your success is determined by the map generation. For survivors map generation is key as well but more often than not it's hardly an issue since high skill survivors can still give you a run for your money with little resources. Both roles perk choices are now reduced to about 10ish perks for each side for use since everyone is full try-hard with MMR and about 80% of perks don't provide enough value to warrant use for most people. In addition, almost every match killers are equipping their best addons (items that improve a killers power) with some borderline game breaking combos and survivors using their best items, med-kits being the most game altering now since a killers greatest tool is spreading pressure and this nullifies it quite a bit. Quite frequently now you'll see at least two survivors using them. The game-play is also mind numbingly boring since now people see the strength of just pre-throwing every pallet, not giving you a opportunity to hit them and not attempting to mind-game. No hits means no downs, no downs means no pressure, no pressure means 3 other people are doing generators while you chase another. Pretty soon the match is over in five minutes because people are also using the time people are hooked to squeeze out gen progress and almost only saving when you are about to reach your second hook state. Ignoring healing is also favored for gen progress.  Again this is mostly at the high level that I am talking about. Before MMR my play-style varied, most of the time I played to get the most points possible. My win condition in my eyes was getting the most points for both roles. I also like to just goof around, meme if you will, and hopefully get a laugh out of survivors and killers. When I would get a high skill survivor or survivors I would change my play-style to match. MMR now means less goofing and less unique and interesting perk/addon combinations for killer and survivors. There is also a huge imbalance when on comms with other people playing survivor, the game was never balanced around this fact and it is a glaring issue that will probably never be rectified. \n\nThe choices the developers continue to make are increasingly questionable and deaf, showing how little the people behind design decisions understand their own game. They value player feedback very little, taking the \"We know better\" route more often than not. There have also been statements saying that they mostly work on the game when the feel like it and almost every patch they break the game in numerous of ways. Bugs vary in broken-ness either being funny visuals or outright ruining game-play, the former being the most common. PTB (player test build) is more for giving streamers new content to show off than actual player feedback and preemptive bug fixing.  \n\nI recommend this game if you have friends to play with and are interested in a unique 4v1 asymmetrical game that no other company has really nailed down quite yet (however a new title called VHS by Hellbent games looks promising). There is also a huge grind involved with getting all perks for both killer and survivor so be prepared for that as well. In the long run I have lost hope for this game, it could be that I've just played too much but I don't see myself returning to this wonderful mess of a game. Just kidding I'm addicted and I'll still come back every so often until I find a better alternative, VHS please let me play you already.","timestamp_created":1518824425,"timestamp_updated":1653804780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40140153","author":{"steamid":"76561198061921887","num_games_owned":677,"num_reviews":141,"playtime_forever":14944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4708,"last_played":1657440239},"language":"schinese","review":"试玩了一下 头晕得不行 只能退款。哎。。。\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n2019.01.31\n好多DLC眼红入了一波，话说杨教授是真的好玩，哈哈哈哈\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n2020.06.02\n说实话,这游戏弃了回,回了弃,每次都是因为国人的外挂车队.\n本身车队就大幅降低单排游戏体验,更何况是外挂车队/刷点车队.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n2022.02.11\n国人是真tm恶心,蹲着跑得比三阶段屠夫都快...见一个举报一个,先举报后玩.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n2022.06.09\n国人的大张伟比带蜘蛛的小白脸跑得快是真的离谱,真tm恶心啊,gg.\n不bb了,删游戏之前我要用小叮当挂几个.","timestamp_created":1518823904,"timestamp_updated":1654726798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40140106","author":{"steamid":"76561198132917874","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":34371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11841,"last_played":1629526524},"language":"english","review":"So youre looking at dead by daylight and you want to know is it worth it?

Like survivors sprints can be easily tracked by tracks visible only to killer\nThen you start getting perks...\nAnd you start hitting skill checks 99% of the time \nThen you start getting good at great skill checks\n\nThen you start watching youtube videos on how to get better, or just to watch more experienced people.\nThen you take a wholistic view of the game once you put the time into it\nOnce you get past the introduction, and go into the longterm play\nDoesn't even take that long. I started to notice at hour 20...\nKillers are not only by themselves. But everything is stacked against them\nThey can only chase 1 person. during the whole time that 1 person runs (which due to pallets, props, combined with the massively different hitbox differences, even though the killer is faster (except the nurse since she can blink) the survivors are faster in small loops due to having to cover a smaller circumference, like a racetrack) Then they get the long stun on a pallet if they mess up. Sure the killer can give up and try to hunt the others. but that just frees up the survivor to do other things, and they have to waste time finding new survivors. once you get to higher level play, survivors will rarely mess up. and the game is entirely based on survivors messing up. (Oh, and since the game has no chat. It makes it harder to work as a team right? NOPE. Since you can queue with friends. People can have outside game voice chat. So not only will killers be pegged by 4 people watching them in order to have better chances at juking, tons of 2nd chance survivor perks. Many ways to blind and stun. Survivors having the major benefit of playing 3rd person against a 1st person behemoth (its possible to hide from killer by hugging and crouching at their legs) \nThere's this entire meme about patches aiming to fix the issue of killers actually being able to win the game\nAnd you can see why\nAnd since killers only get up in rank based on the sacrifices\nYou get a shortage of killers at higher ranks\nAnd killers are the hosts of matches....\nLet that sink in.\nBy getting good/competitive you get less chances to play if you're a survivor\nIf you're a killer main, your competitive ranking will hit a much higher wall.\n\nI'd say this is a great game for those who want to just mess around and have fun\nBut if you're a competitive person\nOr someone who just gets good at games\nCurrently, for a game that is supposed to use the idea of false hope in order to drive fear \nThere's none of that for survivors\nand just frustation for killers","timestamp_created":1518817448,"timestamp_updated":1518817448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536335587501525879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40137965","author":{"steamid":"76561198359085477","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8402,"last_played":1653064506},"language":"schinese","review":"为毛新年更新后时不我待没办法触发了。屠夫都贴我脸上了。","timestamp_created":1518817074,"timestamp_updated":1518817074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40137419","author":{"steamid":"76561198096507274","num_games_owned":971,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":9991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8872,"last_played":1656181927},"language":"brazilian","review":"Cool game now.","timestamp_created":1518815578,"timestamp_updated":1542860896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631510734558105469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40137368","author":{"steamid":"76561198044995518","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":23737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15776,"last_played":1657745064},"language":"english","review":"Playing Dead By Daylight as a Killer main under Behavior Digital Inc is like being a rat in the cage of a sadistic mad scientist.
