Es gibt aber auch ein dickes \"ABER!\" an dieser stelle.\n\nPro:\n-Sound ist gut. Grade das mit der Killermusik find ich ganz toll und auch sonst sehr gut hinbekommen.\n-Atmosphäre ist super. Genau was ich mir erhofft habe. Schleichen,wegrennen,hervor trauen. All das ist recht unterhaltsam. Es ist halt ein Hide and Seek game.\n-Charaktere sind gut ausgearbeitet und ich finde das mit den verschiedenen Perks für verschiedene Charaktere recht cool.\n\nKons:\n-Balancing. Hier ist wohl der größte Kon von allen. Es ist einfach nicht vorhanden. Die Perks der surviver sind in 90% der fälle gefühlt nutzlos bis auf einige wenige die man immerwieder sieht einfach weils die einzig nützlichen sind. Der Killer hingegen bekommt Perks die ab nem gewissen Level einfach ein Free win sind. Wen man dan noch die Perks der verschiedenen Killer kombinier ist eh schon alles verloren.\n-Matchmacking. Noch ein sehr großer Kon. Es ist kaum vorhanden.Wie oft habe ich mit ner Gruppe aus Rang 20ern gegen einen Rang 1 Killer gespielt?Ich habe sowieso das gefühl wen man Killern begegnet ist er entweder Rang 20-18 oder Rang 1. Zudem kommen unheimlich lange Warteschlangen die einfach lachhaft sind wen man dan länger in der Warteschlange als im eigentlichen Spiel ist.\n-CAMPER! Ja ihr! Ihr Camper. Euch meine ich jetzt.Ihr seit die absolut unterste Stufe von Online Spielern. Euch sollte man aus jedem Spiel perma bannen weils einfach nur so feige ist und zeigt das ihr zu beschissen seit irgendwas auf die reihe zu bekommen. Man sollte abzugspunkte für euch einrichten. Den ehrlich in jedem zweiten spiel hat man einen Campenden Killer was gerade wen man mit Premades spielt echt frustet weil man immer den einen zurück lassen muss.\n\nDas spiel hat potential und macht sicher einige Sachen gut. Jedoch happert es an den Grundpfeilern für ein Faires spiel. Als Surviver hat man eh schon nichts das man gegen den Killer tun kann den sind wir ehrlich diese Taschenlampe ist absolut Useless. Der Killer hingegen bekommt ein ganzes Arsenal an\"Ich fuck euch ab\" perks die einen Sieg teils einfach so gut wie unmöglich machen. Dazu kommen die offensichtlichen Cheater die dan über die halbe Map auf einen zugelaufen kommen und straight wissen hinter welchem Baum oder was auch immer man steht. Die neue Melde funktion wird hoffentlich da nun ein wenig Ruhe rein bringen.\n\nFazit:Wen den Survivern in der Zukunft vieleicht ein paar Sinnvollere Perks gegeben werden dan wird das spiel auf jedenfall für beide Seiten ein spass. Ich habe beides schon gespielt und muss ehrlich zugeben ich habe als Killer teils mitleid mit den Survivern und lasse sie entkommen einfach weil es mir so unendlich fies vor kommt wie sie sich anstrengen aber halt einfach nicht gegen die Openes des Killer ankommen. Jedoch macht es genau was es machen soll. Kalter Rückenschauer,Panik,Schocker und einfach ein tolles Horror Fealing und mit freunden zusammen auch echt spass.....auch wen man nicht immer gewinnt.","timestamp_created":1481201785,"timestamp_updated":1481201785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28252041","author":{"steamid":"76561198209602651","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13121,"last_played":1626431995},"language":"russian","review":"Negrbl

Надо было вернуть деньги сразу же, а не ждать у моря погоды, в чем я искренне раскаиваюсь. Этой игрой раработчики показали нам все свои \"таланты\" и свое отношение к игрокам. Я не спорю, задумка интересная. Посмотрев пару обзоров на ютубе, я повелся, глаза загорелись, ну и купил, ожидая от игры очень многого. Идея действительно отичная. НО своим наплевательским отношением к тем, кто в эту игру играет, разработчики угробили не только желание покупать данный продукт, но и свою репутацию. Скорее всего, как только DbD окончательно загнется, будущее разработчиков ств=анет весьма и весьма безоблачным. Мне просто хочется элементарных извинений. Хотя, сам виноват.

RIP Fatone aka \"Grocery Woman\"\n\n*Month's later. It's a good game, but it is too difficult to find a match. My friends and I will easily wait 30 minutes before a game lobby even shows up. When it works it's good, but there are too many times when it simply does not work.\n\n**About 2 months after 1st comment update. My friends cannot launch the game, My game takes a while to find a lobby and then I am most likely dropped. In the few times I have got in a game I constantly rubberband and am almost unable to play the game. I do not know what has happened because this used to be one of, if not, my favourite games to play, but I cannot hold the same feeling anymore. I hold out hope that My friends and I can play together again, but with each passing day my faith is being diminished.\n\n*Patch 1.5.0 Update\nFinally my friends can play with me again. This is enough for me to give a positive review for now, but there are issues and here is what I want to see in the future. 1.) Dedicated servers. Lag is a constant issue that makes it hard to play, but not completely impossible for me. 2.) Debuffing the killer. The recent update seems to have geared the game heavily in the killers favor. I have recently found that a new killer can easily sweep games, even against fully tiered survivors. Killers still camp and it takes longer to repair the generators compared to before, as well as sabotage. In my opinion autohook repair after 3min is overpowered because of the duration it takes to sabotage it and how long it takes to complete one generator. If the killer cannot get survivors prior to hook disabling they should not benefit from an automatic repair, especially now. In previous versions when I would play killer it was never an issue for me and I had no ill will towards the survivors, because it was an equalizer. The only two things that this update has done to help the survivors is reduce disarming trap time and not allowing the trapper to place traps undernethe hooked survivors. This game is heavily favored for the killer and many of whom camp like crazy, even with all the buffs. In the games I have played recently I only had 1 survivor game where multiple people escaped, but that was due to a new player being a killer. Life's not fair, but this game heavily favors the killer. At minimum I would want the autohook repair to be removed and the killers speed to be debuffed. Once a survivor is found he or she is pretty much dead, due to the immaculate speed of the killer during the chase. Pallets are useless due to this speed and windows only have a certain number of uses. It's not fun to me to play as the killer, because it's too easy. The survivor is very challenging, but I'm trying to use it as a test of my skill. I would like it equalized more. I hope everyone has a nice day/night.\n\n*** Update 4/7/18\nI have recently started playing this game again and I am very pleased with how it has come along. There is little lag and most games are entertaining. I did not like that I lost everything I worked for after I uninstalled the game, but it was my own doing. I came across my first real hacker who was lagswitching, but otherwise I have not come across any other hackers. I feel as though the game is relatively balanced, at least at the lower survivor rank levels. As I have progresserd up I can see how the survivors are favored to an extent. Perks like borrowed time I feel like should be removed, even though I am a survivor main. One problem I have is that I have multiple instances where I hit my decisive strike just before the killer puts me on a hook, but it does not let me down. I have also noticed I have crawled away a few meters from a location only to be picked up in my original spot, but this could be a lag issue. Overall I am enjoying this game again, but there are toxic survivors that make it much worse for the other survivor mains. One example of this was yesterdasy when someone called me explicities for not knowing they were at the trap door. It was not my fault I was on the other side of the map getting hooked, but the individual got angry. It should be noted that the smae person spent the whole game hiding while the other twoo survivors and I fixed generators and tried to save teammates. The survive with friends feature is great, but I feel as though it gives an advantage to survivors, such as myself, who play the game with 2 or 3 friends. It allows us to coordinate and know the location of the killer at most times. If survive with friends did not affect rank I would not have an issue, but I want the killers to not be as disadvantaged because of skype or discord.\n\nSummary: Great game. I think there should be a seperate competative mode that equalizes the killer and survivor, as well as making survive with friends non-competative. Overall a great game.","timestamp_created":1481159567,"timestamp_updated":1523123990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49824148416519165","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28245252","author":{"steamid":"76561198298859192","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5251,"last_played":1539486853},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo idiota, ultrapassei o level 29 com a personagem Meg, e do nada me zeraram o meu level, ate nao me zerarem estava muito bem, mas e agora vou ter que começar tudo do zero, que justificativa me darao agora?","timestamp_created":1481157861,"timestamp_updated":1481157861,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48567548394203186","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28245200","author":{"steamid":"76561198343899829","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":70645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4013,"last_played":1658623580},"language":"spanish","review":"es genial si eres acecino te quedas sin enojo si ganas\nyeaahhh","timestamp_created":1481157541,"timestamp_updated":1481157541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.396975427865982056","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28245145","author":{"steamid":"76561198159974545","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":27256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9507,"last_played":1607252445},"language":"schinese","review":"      这开发商明显已经膨胀了，整个游戏遍地都是BUG放着不管，几轮更新全都是出DLC捞钱，好不容易来一次大更新结果把已经很弱的人类削的更弱。\n      这游戏看似屠夫和人类不平衡，其实还是应该有他自己内在的平衡性。比如一个屠夫打4个人类是标配，那么屠夫玩家和人类玩家的比例最好维持在1:4。而现实情况是打屠夫远比打人类简单，在这轮更新之前屠夫玩家就超出了比例（所以经常会有玩屠夫等很久排不到人的情况），在这轮更新之后这个情况显然会更严重，想想当人类不玩了，或者都去打屠夫了，而打屠夫的往往挂半个小时都排   不到人，这游戏会变得怎么样。\n     买这类游戏是一种投资，为了避免自己花钱买了个鬼服游戏，我反正是不会买接下来的dlc了。","timestamp_created":1481157213,"timestamp_updated":1481157213,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477855473756790161","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28244955","author":{"steamid":"76561198119817121","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":10250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3459,"last_played":1638694455},"language":"koreana","review":"마이클너무 무섭","timestamp_created":1481156077,"timestamp_updated":1481156077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28244653","author":{"steamid":"76561198057670636","num_games_owned":945,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":32348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14714,"last_played":1658695688},"language":"english","review":"Yes it has bugs, Yes it can be a little messy but what dead by daylight presents is a concept that while it might seem basic on the surface is in fact very in depth.
