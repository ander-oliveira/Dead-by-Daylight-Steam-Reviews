It may seem hypocrite to have played this much and NOT recommend the game, but the only reasons I kept going are because it's super addictive and I kept hoping with more experience and more grinded perks things will get better. They don't. Here are the things that made me quit and regret ever starting:\n\n- the game is a huge grind. The get an optimal build you will need to bring all your characters close to max. If you don't to put in a few hundred hours don't bother.\n- the community is the most toxic I've ever seen as a gamer in 20 years. Survivors and killers literally hate each other both in game, in chat and on forums. After playing killer so long I hate survivors too. I've taken so much abuse in game (tea bagging, making fun of the killer, exploiting etc) and after the game (in chat) that I geniuenly feel like this\n- the game is not balanced nor will it ever be. At high level only a single killer is viable. The whole concept is based on survivors making mistakes. If they don't there is nothing you can do as a killer. The survivors have so many crutches and things on their side that the killer is powerless. Look up \"dbd de-pip squad\" on youtube to see how bad it is. And any time the survivors are nerfed they cry out on forums like babies, and ultimately devs get on their side because they are 4 time more in numbers. Nothing you can do.\n- The balance is broken even more by SWF teams (nicknamed cheat with friends) that use external voice chat to circumvent most of the mechanics. When you encounter one of these you are about to have a really bad time. Worse, the dev allow this, but still balance the game around survivors not talking to each other.

Чиним генераторы, ломаем тотемы и открываем ворота, попутно спасая попавших на крюк. Либо просто убиваем всех. (Отмечу, что играю в основном на сурве в пати) [/b] [u]\nПерейду сразу к делу: \n\nПлюсы: [/u]\n[i]+ Возможность поиграть с друзьями \n+ Частые обновления, что делают игру все лучше и лучше\n+ Новые игровые механики. Выход новых маньяков всегда привлекает вернуться даже после перерыва. \n+ Комьюнити. Попадаются разные сурвы и маны, но большая часть из них всегда спасет вас или (в случае мана) покажет достойную игру без туннелинга и кемперства. Возможно за счет закрытого чата (лишь в лобби) в игре нет этого постоянного с_р_а_ч_а как в других подобных. \n+ Магазин со скинами, ну правда, это круто. [/i]\n\n[u]Минусы: [/u]\n[i]- \"Кепминг тоже тактика\". Многие игроки не умеют играть без кемпинга, ходят вокруг типа \"Я не при делах\" или же зафейсят потому как \"ТЫ ТОКСИСТ СКИНУЛ НА МЕНЯ ПАЛЕТКУ И ОСЛЕПИЛ, А ЕЩЕ ТЫ ЮЗАЕШЬ СПРИНТ И ОСКОЛОК\". Ребят это не оправдание, вы не разиваете свою игру, а значит стоите на месте. Смотрите стримы, видосики на ютюбчике, но смотрите и учитесь (только ты давай смотри нормальных, а не таких же кемперов). \n- Токсики\\токсиктиам или токсисты кому как нравится больше. И сейчас речь не о ребятах, что хорошо играют и держатся на соответствующем их скилу ранге. И именно те люди, что скидывают ранг и тролят новых манов-новичков. Будучи совершенно не опытной в этом не легком кровавом деле, ко мне в каждой катке залетали по 2 токсика с фонарями. Ничего им предъявить на моей 5-10 игре я не могла, в результате чего игра на маньяке не приносит никакого удовольствия и по сей день.

Здесь если ты выживший, будь добр, спасай других и чини генераторы. А если маньяк, то не будь лохом и покажи достойную игру. \n[u]Уважайте своих тиммейтов и противников. \n9 рандомных капканов из 10 рандомных топоров[/u]","timestamp_created":1527834074,"timestamp_updated":1528352127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":72,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.689192593097686768","comment_count":22,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42418966","author":{"steamid":"76561198003929404","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":65881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":142,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1659901380},"language":"english","review":"Game is trash","timestamp_created":1527833405,"timestamp_updated":1559104134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42418631","author":{"steamid":"76561198361611889","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":196,"playtime_at_review":1935,"last_played":1660573091},"language":"schinese","review":"刚入感觉还行，但是玩屠夫常会遇到老玩家开黑组队虐新人炸鱼塘的，一旦翻车还会拔线，素质很差。这跟游戏无关，纯粹玩家问题，这种人逼得新进屠夫守尸出来还要嘴贱骂几句守尸狗，恶性循环。且有恶意使用BUG卡位的人存在。所有的好感都会被这种恶意玩家磨灭。","timestamp_created":1527831481,"timestamp_updated":1527931242,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42418393","author":{"steamid":"76561198390611611","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":37221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":1248,"last_played":1659810117},"language":"danish","review":"i love the game literaly you need more like this not exactly tho\n","timestamp_created":1527830085,"timestamp_updated":1527830085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495867788791656494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42418280","author":{"steamid":"76561198001006490","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2838,"last_played":1653732395},"language":"english","review":"Unbelievable unbalanced game.

No more hatch stalemates, some of the more obscene killer and survivor perks have been scaled back. The game still suffers from a fairly hard meta and there are many perks that are either useless or badly out classed but overall there is much more variety in viable selection than in the past. RG color blind mode is also a thing now so I am finally able to play killer and have been enjoying that aspect of the game. The DLC model does, by its nature, still make the game a little pay to win but all non-licensed characters can now be unlocked with an XP point currency and individual perks can also be obtained through a rotating shop which is an improvement from the past.\n\nOverall, the game is something I can once again

If you're hiding, you see the killer with his BACK TURNED against YOU, and he turns aroudn while you hide again (Making you completely hidden), that means that he will see you because your movements are a literal full second behind his. \n\nThe game is trash, literal trash. \n\nI would love to recommend this game, i would. It's a fun game. But at the end of the day you will be screaming at the top of your lungs \"WHAT ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT\". Barely any deaths will seem fair, and i'm serious. \n\nAnd then you have the OP perks (For both sides). Some of the perks just completely ruin the experience. The killer being able to see you across the map because he hooked someone, really? And the worst part is that certain killers are able to get across the entire map in SECONDS. So before their 4 second window is gone, they can get to you.. Across the FUCKING map. \n\nThe game is trash and needs MASSIVE balancing, but it's been this way for months. They will never fix it.

Игра стоит своих денег.Минус 1,что-бы открыть новых маньяков и сурвов,одежду нужно покупать ДЛС.","timestamp_created":1527799612,"timestamp_updated":1527799612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496634095907211304","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42412176","author":{"steamid":"76561198820842037","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15917,"last_played":1536513059},"language":"german","review":"Viel zu viele camper und man wird andauernd getunnelt oder geblockt vom killer aber auch überlebende meinen einen zu blocken oder den killer zu einem zuführen...","timestamp_created":1527798519,"timestamp_updated":1527798519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42412008","author":{"steamid":"76561198095210238","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":8097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1884,"last_played":1648905456},"language":"english","review":"No linux support, full of bugs, not optimized, but hey we got mobile version","timestamp_created":1527797826,"timestamp_updated":1591544215,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42411807","author":{"steamid":"76561198111014212","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2543,"last_played":1580418627},"language":"russian","review":"Вцелом игра хорошая, с момента покупки мной этой игры многое доработали.
