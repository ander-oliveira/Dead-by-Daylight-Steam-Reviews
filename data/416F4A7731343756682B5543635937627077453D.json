Even playing during an event the matchmaking is getting so desperate that as a lvl 15 killer it was pitting me agains 3 survivors 7 or lower including a rank 2.  Game is fun as survivor but is miserable for killer if you don't have the meta perks.  Survivors will infinite loop all day long and take advantage of cheap tactics but salt and call you out really quick at end if they even think you were a little campy.  Player base isn't great.  The experience with killer could be alot more fun but the infinite looping needs to be fixed and pitting a killer without metaperks while survivors are running sprint burst, decisive strike, etc is just rough.  Good potential but as a killer game is more stress than its worth.","timestamp_created":1533661180,"timestamp_updated":1533661180,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43985776","author":{"steamid":"76561198125644829","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2467,"last_played":1529341498},"language":"english","review":"Игра скатилась в скинчики","timestamp_created":1533660730,"timestamp_updated":1533660730,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501935124397277832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43985721","author":{"steamid":"76561198401650779","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":18343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10811,"last_played":1630111143},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es bueno es original y yo le hecho casi 200h y seguire jugandolo pero tiene un monton de bugs ponene habilidades para q la jugabilidad de el juego no sea tan divertida y cuando arreglan 1 bug entran 10 peores q no te dejan jugar tranquilamente ademas q los servidores despues de 2 años aun no es lo que deberia ser","timestamp_created":1533660516,"timestamp_updated":1533660516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482758611440658569","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43985544","author":{"steamid":"76561198025559754","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16668,"last_played":1656160191},"language":"english","review":"It is a very challenging game, but worth it for the most part. Grinding to get everything you need to compete competitively takes a very long time, but you have enough diversity (with the different killers) to make it through in my opinion.\n\nAnd yes, there is a lot of salt and many player that like to complain, but mostly just due to a lack of being able to adapt to different circumstances and playstyles.\n\nPlus, the devs communicate a lot with the players. A lot is trial and error, but the amount of updates, changes and additions are great compared to other MOBAs.\n\nEdit: the amount and quality communication with the community have sadly gone down a lot in the last 1-2 years. On the other hand the devs seem quite intent on not learning from their own mistakes, mostly balance-related. Badly designed maps, perks or killer powers with no intention of improving core aspects of the game made it stale for me in the long run.

Моя любимая и ненавистная помойка, плачу и дрочу. Из этого жанра, игра одна из лучших (если не самая). В ней онлайн в час пик около 40-60к, но поиск игры за мана занимает минут 10 практически на любом ранге. Подумывал даже купить батл пасс, но с такой длительностью подбора игроков у меня терпения не хватит пройти задания за маньяка. Кстати о рангах: я не бомблю, но мне просто интересно, почему с таким онлайном, такой большой разброс в рангах у игроков в группе? Относительно недавно наконец-то ввели сервера (наконец-то не нужно заново искать игру если в лобби у маньяка пинг 200+), но починить поиск игроков так и не смогли (или не захотели). Почитывал иногда обзоры и не понимал, почему люди жалуются на обилие багов (я за всё время встретил от силы 2-3); также не понимаю, как они определяют имбалансность перков или маньяков (встречались нулёвые маньяки и сурвы разносящие противника в ноль), да некоторые перки делают персонажа немного сильнее, но если ты в принципе играть не умеешь, то это тебе не поможет. Игра, кстати, не дорогая. Стандартного издания хватит для комфортной игры (но я скупаю все выходящие главы (хотя даже на большей части персонажей из них не играю), и это мой заёб), если уж очень надоели одни и те же персонажи, то можете купить пару глав, но не всё, ибо (на мой взгляд) некоторые маньяки не особо интересные. Постоянно бывают бесплатные выходные, скидки, также есть тестовый сервер (можно опробовать и купить главу с полюбившимися персонажами). Исходя из всего вышесказанного - я рекомендую эту игру. Кто бы что не говорил, на 1-2 часика периодически можно зайти поиграть. Чуть не забыл: токсичных игроков стало меньше, так же как и русскоговорящих геймеров (вывод делайте сами), теперь хотя бы намного реже заканчиваешь игру с горящим пердаком, после которой тебя ещё и обосрут в чате. Кстати лайфхак: (в любой игре, а не только в DBD) делаете англоязычный ник и по возможности выражаетесь на английском, и вуаля, на вас больше не выёбываются и не поливают говном, ибо токсичное рус. комьюнити (состоящее по большей части из школьников), вас не понимает.

With the most recent update from the developers, I feel as if the game has become truly balanced, killers that were weak are stronger and more fun to play, and that same perks were taken, no matter the killer, aren't needed as much anymore (I'm looking at you, D-Strike.)\n\nSurvivors feel better to play, and more rewarding as well. Instead of looping the killer around the same pallet or same set of ruins for minutes on end while my teammates hastily complete generators, and where hiding from my killers was practically impossible, it feels...better now. While a distraction is still neccessary on a team of survivors, it feels better to play as the stealthy survivor, instead of being a detriment and a weight. And it feels nicer to have a wider range of perks to pick from, instead of the same 4 over and over again. I can go for a more altruistic line-up, focusing on saving and taking hits for my teammates, or go for a distraction lineup, looking to stall the killer long enough to get out. Or even a stealthy, play around the killer type of lineup, where I simply use all my perks to actively avoid the killer, while doing generators. I feel like I don't need D-Strike anymore, simply because my escape options are better now, or options to avoid the killer all together.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, killers feel much, much better to play than ever before. The perk buffs, along with the various buffs to killers and such make it to where knowing how to play one of the Trio of Meta (Huntress, Hillbilly, Nurse) isn't needed anymore if you want to climb ranks. Sure, it's still recommended, mostly because they're really good killers because of how fast they can stop chases and such, but it's not needed. Your options are much better in terms of killers due to the various buffs that the Hag and Trapper got, as well as general buffs to the killer like the pick-up time, or general nerfs to survivors like exhaustion cooldowns stopping when you run. Not to mention the various buffs to underground or not used killer perks like Bitter Murmur or Sloppy Butcher to make them optional choices.\n\nIf you had asked me before the mid-patch update if the game was good enough for the 20$ price tag, there was a decent chance I would've told you \"no, the game is horribly imbalanced. If you like wasting time and just waiting for a skill check to pop up, which scares you more than a disfigured, chainsaw wielding murderer, then yes.\" However, with the new changes, new balancing, and the new perks, which I didn't even talk about, as well as the new killer, the game feels amazing and refreshing to play again. \n\nSo out of 10? This game, now, is a good 8/10.\nThe bugs are still apparent, so is the lag switching from the killers. But the core gameplay, without all of that? It's fun again, for both sides.","timestamp_created":1533564120,"timestamp_updated":1533564120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43965443","author":{"steamid":"76561198386365767","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29297,"last_played":1658464249},"language":"english","review":"Играю. збс\n","timestamp_created":1533563483,"timestamp_updated":1533563483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470588237047195435","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43965429","author":{"steamid":"76561198013230890","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":289523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160221,"last_played":1659014878},"language":"koreana","review":"망겜","timestamp_created":1533563450,"timestamp_updated":1588877032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526518046855926514","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43965338","author":{"steamid":"76561197977059423","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1537546498},"language":"czech","review":"DEAD GAME,SUCKS","timestamp_created":1533563093,"timestamp_updated":1533563093,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43965305","author":{"steamid":"76561198146707037","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":52169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21228,"last_played":1627302693},"language":"russian","review":"Пи3же некуда","timestamp_created":1533562972,"timestamp_updated":1593102822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43965302","author":{"steamid":"76561198146584415","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1510,"last_played":1539315268},"language":"english","review":"Great game that is constantly improving.
