to be a apart of a toxic and crappy community? look no further than this game! in all seriousness, the new skill based match making has made it so impossible to play, i no longer have any sort of fun. i don't know why I still play this, out of every game i play, only 10-25% of them i get good games, the rest is a dumpster fire of wet garbage and dog poop bags on a humid summer day, watching while you're constantly swarmed with mosquitoes. and the entitlement of players, mostly survivors, is through the roof, so much so that people who win still get mad at everyone for no good reason at all. reporting anyone for anything for cheating doesn't work, and the censoring of words in chat doesn't make any sense, some curse words are censored but others aren't, words like Bill or raspberry or sometimes sentences where you miss a space are all blocked out. like seriously, only grown people should be playing this game, treat us like grown people and get rid of the censoring, it's dumb. i try not to play this game as much as possible, only if they get rid of skill based match making like the good old days will it be only slightly more fair and fun again. only, and i mean ONLY, get this game to play with your friends and not in solo queue, that's the only times you will have fun with this game.","timestamp_created":1631189312,"timestamp_updated":1651119688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99045673","author":{"steamid":"76561198313065621","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":33148,"last_played":1660479839},"language":"schinese","review":"脑瘫才会改段位","timestamp_created":1631189005,"timestamp_updated":1631189005,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99045629","author":{"steamid":"76561198829953046","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":14180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7296,"last_played":1650544196},"language":"english","review":"Kpop

I enjoyed playing with my friends and the theme of the game with the killers and trying to escape.\n But this company get keeping going backwards in developing the game. You think after 5-6 years of being release they would have fixed all the game crashing, map balancing, perk balancing, killer vs survivor balancing, random map generating, match making, generators, totem placements and so much more. But no, they keep having issues and more issue every killer and patch they do. I feels like they got a fan base and now just trying to cash out on them and not fix the major issues before leasing new content. To me the greed feels to real now. \n With the newer killer pinhead out games have not been enjoyable with matches DCing ever couple of game, either the killer or survivor because of memory leeks or what ever. They known the issues durning play testing but still decide to rush it out knowing these issue and people would still buy it. This my friends is company greed.\n  Losing licensing agreements for what ever reason is very sad, the stranger things is gone in a few weeks. Current people can buy it and still play in the future with those characters, but the sad thing is in the future with new people joining because they seen people play with demogordn or steve or Nancy and they can’t never get them hurts. \n  Now they are planing to reward players with ranks, the higher the rank the more extra stuff you get.  The last week after this news came out the games have been hard core unenjoyable. Killer are so desperate to kill they now camp and tunnel the person right off of hook. Survivor now leave that person on hook just to work on gens and if you are a random player good luck of getting rescued.

In fact, I have gifted this game to several friends and really tried to get them into the game, and almost none have played more than a few hours.\nI'll go over some of the issues, but as this game is basically two different games depending on if you're playing killer or survivor, i'll go over each separately.\n\nSurvivor:\nIf you're playing with friends this will be your only option, so we'll start here...\nThe first several hours of the game are going to feel like playing \"generator repair simulator\". This is largely because even after the tutorial you won't really understand the game, because there's just too much to learn (totems, generators, when to unhook, survivor perks, killer powers and perks, offerings, looping/pallets/lockers and their locations, etc). The first few hours are going to be : Run to generators, hold left click, and press space bar on occasion. If the killer finds you, you're going to try to run away but get knocked down pretty quickly because you don't know how to escape, then you'll die and (maybe) do it again.\n\nOnce you get past this stage it starts to get a little more fun as you learn how to run from the killer and start to unlock some perks that change the way you play and give you some new things to try. This is probably the high point, because everything is fresh and new and fun. You haven't played against the same killers a million times (yet), and your games aren't too competitive. You start to see that the killer isn't an unstoppable force or even something to fear, but just a small obstacle that you have to overcome. You're excited to level up survivors and get new perks. You'll probably throw some money at the game for DLC because you want a particular survivor or killer or perk. This isn't necessarily bad, after all you should support the games that you enjoy! The problem comes from the fact that you'll find that you need almost all of the DLC if you want have the best perks and most fun killers (thankfully they at least go on sale pretty frequently). This is where the grind starts - you'll buy these characters and then need to farm for hours on end to get their unlockable perk, which you can only HOPE to see in the bloodweb.\nMaybe it's because you're starting to feel the grind, or maybe it's because you've gotten good at the game, and matchmaking is a joke, but matches are starting to get less fun. Now you either bully the killer into submission with other capable survivors OR you get teammates that are still learning where the generators are on the map and you spend the entire game feeling like you're trying to herd cats. Escape? Get hooked? get Mori'd? Doesn't really matter anymore, you're just happy to not see Spirit.\nAt this point I personally don't enjoy the game because it becomes too competitive. For me it can be fun with friends, but honestly it's mostly going to be frustrating. Especially if your friends aren't all on the same level, because the matchmaking is bad to begin with, and having mixed skill levels seems to really throw it a curve ball. \n\n\nKiller:\nFor myself and a lot of people I've talked to, this is the real draw of the game at first. Playing \"generator repair simulator\" and then getting murdered isn't exactly fun, but getting to play as some of your favorite movie/tv killers? It sounds awesome, and it is! At first.\nYour first few games you'll be getting the hang of your power and getting a few kills, and you'll probably have a really great time! You'll want to get all of the DLC immediately because who doesn't want to play as Freddy, Pyramid Head, Ghostface, Nemesis, etc?!\nHere's where that bloodpoint grind becomes an issue. Thankfully as killer you get it a bit faster than survivors (generally) - but you'll certainly need a lot. also because some of the perks are WAY better than others, you'll need to put points into killers you don't like playing just so you can get their perk on your favorite killer...that's a fun way to spend about a million bloodpoints, right?\nNow if you read the survivor side, you'll think that there's a slow progression in difficulty and that at this point you should really start hitting your stride because you've played a few games and have some perks and you know your power pretty well, right? No. You're playing killer and the world hates you. You get to go against a 4 man survivor group that has 1 new player and 3 red rank monsters. You think they should be afraid of you? They're going to pallet stun you, locker stun you, blindyou, beat you up and take your lunch money, then teabag you at the exit gates until you force them to leave so you can cry in peace.\nPick yourself up try again. After all, that was just one game and it's not like every group is going to be premades! Oh hey, you're starting to rank up! You're rank 9 or so? That's close enough to rank 1 that we should probably match you against rank 1-4 pretty much exclusively, even though there's a world of difference between those ranks. Good luck!\n\nThe game isn't all bad. I didn't spend hundreds of hours playing it because it's horrible and I hate it. It just has a lot of problems, especially for new players, and that's who this review is meant to be for. \nIf you have friends that play it and can show you the ropes then by all means give it a try, but know that if you're getting the game to play it with friends then you should be aware that it's going to start off boring until you understand how to play against the killer and have some perks and offerings to play with.\nIf you're getting the game to play as killer, then you're in for a lot of fun until you start seeing higher ranks and then you're in for a lot of sadness. The game is absolutely survivor biased and there is no getting around that. If you can accept that and not let the semi-frequent beatings break your will, then you'll probably have fun on occasion....once you figure out what killer(s) you like to play...and grind the bloodpoints to unlock the perks that are good on that killer...oh and don't forget the fact that add-ons are basically mandatory because the powers tend to be underwhelming without them...","timestamp_created":1631170709,"timestamp_updated":1631170709,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99036711","author":{"steamid":"76561199050581309","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":2123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1473,"last_played":1653478050},"language":"russian","review":"попивая
