It's something I'd been hoping would be created for a while, and after it's release I fell in love with the game.\n\nAs a fan of the horror genre since the early days of Resident Evil 1, Silent Hill, and Amnesia, I think it's a fun twist to put another human being as the killer, as a player with actual thoughts and ideas is much more terrifying than an AI.\n\nFor people who have been throwing bad reviews to this game, sure it has some downsides, but every game does. Rather than tossing down a gauntlet and challenging people to internet flame wars, as most 'hate posts' do, Ignore them. I've yet to see a constructive negative review, most people either have a grudge against the publisher or just dislike the game.\n\nThis game is a must have, especially if you enjoy horror, and if you have friends who'd like to join in as well.\n\n\nThere are a few issues I've been having lately, and I know some of them have been addressed in the 'Developers Addressing Major Issues' post, but there are somethings that I think may be sort of overlooked.\n\n\nMatchmaking Time to Full Lobby -\n\nPerhaps it's just my location or maybe just bad luck, but often times I find myself waiting anywhere from 5-10 minutes to get a game, sometimes up to 10-15 if I feel like playing the killer. I know part of the problem is the current issue of 'Lobby Hopping', since there is no implemented ranked party system at the moment, but it seems like a bit more of an issue than that. As a survivor, I often am brought to the loading screen and kicked right back to the lobby, failing to find a match, which tends to increase the time to wait.\n\nLack of Survivor Communication in Game\n\nMaybe gestures, or maybe proximity voice chat that can be heard by both the hunter and the hunted. I feel like the game ends up being 1v 1,1,1,1 instead of 1v4, because there is a lack of communication and cooperation between players. Simply spinning in circles and crouching down/standing up isn't quite enough to communicate your plans and ideas to your fellow survivors.\n\n'Puppy Guards'\n\nEver jumped into a game, got hunted down or watched someone else get caught, and then watch as the killer stands by them and hits them repeatedly until they're sacrificed? It's a problem currently. Sure you can go grab the generators while he's doing this, but it ruins the game for that one person who has to sit there on the hook. \n\nPerhaps lower the rate at which the sacrifice ticks down while the killer is nearby, or give a lower score to killers who sit within a few meters of the hook. \n\nIt's not a serious problem per-se, as there can be ways to deal with it, or you can just escape while he's doing this to another survivor, but it does ruin the game for the one guy unless they just struggle and let themselves get killed to leave for another game, but doing that gives the killer exactly what they want, easy points with no downside, and allows them to go after another survivor to hang up and sit by for more points. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.\n\nPick-Me-Up with Med Kit\n\nI think there should be a (SLOW) way to pick yourself up if you have access to a medkit. As much as this should be a team game with cooperation, without a party matchmaking system currently, no one every seems to care about the other players or the coop aspect of the game. You typically have to fend for yourself, but once you're downed like that there's nothing to really do except exit the game. Perhaps offer a 'Quick Way Out' to downed survivors so they don't have to DC and lose what points they gathered through the game, if a pick yourself up function won't be added.\n\nDING-DONG-DING-DONG-DING-DONG\n\nThere are certain spots in the maps where the wraith(And other killers can, but it's much harder) can press themselves up against you to trap you there with no way out, sort of like corner trapping in older FPS games. Sort of the same issue with Puppy Guarding. The wraith goes invisible, sneaks up on you, and instead of killing you traps you in a corner in a building and stands there while doing nothing. It's a problem when said player ends up being the only one left, and just has to sit there until they get bored and DC, or the killer DCs, because there's no way around and no way out.\n\n\n\nThese are just a couple issues I found through playing. \n\nGreat game, great concept and great design, and I know things are getting fixed up properly. For those of you still questioning whether or not you would like to purchase this game, you can always wait to see if some of the issues are fixed in a future patch, but I strongly suggest you start playing now, as you're missing out on some quality content.\n\nThanks for providing such a captivating and entertaining game.","timestamp_created":1467179866,"timestamp_updated":1467179866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23915751","author":{"steamid":"76561198057842710","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":5364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1323,"last_played":1631931893},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Before You Buy, Don't Let the Concept Fool You [/h1]\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I even made a positive review for it a few days ago praising it and saying it has a few frustrations. No, I lied to you and myself. It has more than just a few. It's hard to recommend this game right now because it has terrible execution to a good concept. That's what makes people fall in love with this game but it's frustrating to play when the map design is more for the killer rather than the survivors and not to mention the killer, Wraith, is just plain unfair. More on that later. I want to recommend this game because it can be fun and it can be interesting but it's so buggy and unstable at times, which is almost all the time.\n\nThe controls are perfect for the keyboard and mouse set up, though. It also has controller support (haven't tried) but if you've played a 3rd person shooter or something, you will probably get used to this game's control scheme fast and it's not that confusing for the killer either. That's pretty much it. It's not complicated and the game will often remind you what button to push for certain actions. The survivor part is clearly more fun but also quite frustrating since the map design is hard to get around when balancing a game like this. I can tell the developers of this game tried to make it as fair as possible but there's 3 maps so far and the 2 of them benefit the killer more. In my opinion, anyway. The other is clearly more for survivors because there's a ton of hiding spots. The objective as the killer is capture all survivors and hang them on a hook till they give up and die to be sacrificed to the great God, Macho Man Randy Savage, ooh yeah (No, not really)! That wouldn't be a problem but 90% of all players stick around till they die and you have 4 chances (if you do it in a row) to escape from the hook before you have to hold off a claw hook thing from stabbing you. This is a real problem because the killers heavily discourage the survivors from saving their friends which the game itself rewards you for doing it. I feel like they have to add a disadvantage for the killer to camp around but also add an advantage. Like, the HP of the hooked survivor goes down faster when the killer is around but the killer is stripped of their ability to swing their weapon while doing so. I feel like this could fix a problem while making it not completely unfair for the killer or survivors. The objective for the survivors is to fix 5 generators to power 2 gates that you can choose to open and escape through intact. The generators have QTEs that randomly pop up, its a arrow moving in circular motion and you need to catch it in a certain area at the right time and if you fuck it up, boom, killer knows your location. You can gain bonus from it by hitting the small part of the certain area that is white. There is tall grass and trees, ruins, and windows for the survivors to use to avoid the killer. You can even throw down these palettes that block the killer off or even stun them if you throw it down at the right time. The killer can break through it, of course. There is 3 killers in the game. Hillbilly is the guy that has a machete and can lay down bear traps. The Chainsaw guy has a chainsaw but is the slowest but can down the survivors in one hit with the chainsaw. The Wraith, who is the most unfair, can turn invisible. The game has a heartbeat system, by the way, so when a killer get's close, you hear the heartbeat sound get louder as they get closer. With the Wraith, the heart beat disappears too when it's invisible and the only real disadvantage is has is that it can't attack in it's invisible state. The players can also hide in these closets placed throughout the map but honestly, they only really come in handy when the killer is already occupied chasing someone else and you need to get out of the way.\n\nLet's get to the technical stuff, this game, admittedly, has a pretty cool progression system for each killer and each survivor (4 survivors) and when you complete a match or lose one, you gain bloodpoints(?) and you can spend those on this. It's kind of like a skill tree but you get most of your items here(temporary though), item add ons (to make the items better), perks (permanent), and offerings (which give you a bonus for one game, like more mist during the match or one less hook in the map). When you complete a game, it adds up all the points in 4 categories: Survival, Objective, Boldness, and Teamwork (it's called something else). This also contributes towards the....sorry almost threw up...towards the God awful, ranking system that is pretty much broken. It's so unforgiving that even surviving isn't enough because you need to have a certain amount of points to gain 1/3 pips. You can gain two in one match if you fill all categories but fat fucking chance of that happening often. You start from 20 and you go all the way down to rank 1. Does it hold any benefits though? Fuck no. As far as I'm concerned, I never left Rank 20 because if you don't reach the amount to gain one pip, you lose one instead and you get de-ranked too when you have none starting off at the rank, it basically equals previous rank with 3/3 pips. You have to do more unnecessary shit in order to not lose a rank and that isn't even worth it. This is incredibly frustrating and pointless to even have in the first place. The killer side also has one as well. I don't know much about the killer other than he is in first person perspective, has a weapon, and hangs survivors on the hook. I did play as one, a few handful of times, and honestly, as frustrating as it is to be a survivor, being one is better than a killer, in my opinion. The killer can also rip the player from doing something anytime and carry them right away. Like, unhooking their friend, climbing through a window, working on a generator, etc... \n\nThe graphics look nice and the animations are basic which is also fine. The character models look fine and the monster designs look bad ass in each of their own way. The game lacks graphical options. It just gives you the bare bones basic of Ultra, High, Medium, or Low. That's it. Maybe the scale down your resolution too, otherwise, I shame the game for having lack of graphical options for those trying to squeeze out all the performance they can on their low end machines. I have a high end machine so no I'm not bitter about this due to experiencing it.\n\nThe sound design is important because you will know when the killer is near you and can identify who the killer type is because they make certain sounds like the wraith uses a bell that the whole map (almost) can hear, the Hillbilly hollers, and the chainsaw guy, has a chainsaw...so chainsaw noise. The generators can backfire on the survivors if they fail the QTEs and that makes a loud enough noise to give the killer your position away with a visual cue. This game has a lot of noise basically and its rather important since you're not facing AI here.\n\nThe game can be replayable when it works right when not having connection issues or not crashing either. There's no party system unless you create a private match inviting all friends. The game is poorly executed that the more I play it, the worse the experience gets. It just doesn't seem like it holds up well and its a buggy game right now. Only having one way to escape all the time unless you are the only survivor, then you can find a hatch to escape through but nothing special really. I don't see it holding up too long.\n\nAll these issues can be fixed in the future and I hope they will be. Right now, is not the time. Its a fun game but it has too many frustrating aspects about it that really hold it back to its true potential and therefore, I can't really recommend it. I had fun while it lasted but it just wears on you the issues it has and the amount of bugs it contains. It's just not a good time right now. The game could of used more polish and time.","timestamp_created":1467179027,"timestamp_updated":1467236009,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509900987148284912","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23915679","author":{"steamid":"76561198026370482","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":29683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7609,"last_played":1655110285},"language":"english","review":"Good old Cat and Mouse with a devious twist. \nSoooo much adrenaline or pure sadistic fun, depending on who you play.\nIt's been a while since I found myself screaming in terror twitching in front of my PC.\n\nThat moment when you know the killer has seen you, and you frantically try to get away.\nThe chase is always hilariously tense, whether be it youre the hunted or the hunter.\n\nAs a sidenote, don't believe the whine.\nWindowhopping can be countered if you have working brain.\nSame goes for Hook Camping.\n\nI fully recommend getting this game.\nIt will touch you deep down in the darkest parts of your conciousness..\n\n\nEDIT AFTER 120 hours: still love it!\nDON'T belive the whine!","timestamp_created":1467178758,"timestamp_updated":1470234300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23915117","author":{"steamid":"76561197987097488","num_games_owned":1763,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1650062622},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun, hope to see more future content for the game","timestamp_created":1467176664,"timestamp_updated":1467176664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23915116","author":{"steamid":"76561198007910997","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":30350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1658277731},"language":"english","review":"This game is a blast but not without it`s issues.

I have never experienced anything like this game.\n\nThis 4v1 horror survival game will make you scream, laugh, and panic. The thrill of the game is simply amazing. Whether you are hunting down your prey, or simply attempting to flee the chainsaw wielding hillbilly chasing you, the game is a race of emotions that will leave you with endless hours of fun.\n\nBeyond that, however, as you play, the kinks begin to reveal themselves. \n\nYou quickly realize that there are easy exploits and straight broken attributes to the game. And while it still is a largely skill based game, these exploits and attributes can seriously make you want to quit.\n\nExample: You're killer. You hit someone. They hop through a window and begin to self heal. You have two options, go through the window, or go around through another door. Both take very long. Let's say you go through the window. Surprise! The survivor just went through the window just to the left of the window you went through. The survivor self heals and easily escapes unharmed. You just wasted a bunch of time. \n\nThis example highlights two game breaking tools in the game: self healing, and infinite window juking. It is one of 4-5 issues that the developers are looking into at this moment, and hope to fix very soon.\n\nIn all, I think this game is simply stellar. I love it, it's great, it's 10/10 easily, despite the problems. It's fun, it's something new, and if you and four of your friends get this game, it will offer tons of fun.\n\nGet this game, trust me.

Was fun at first no complaints. People are asshats though... They don't use teamwork and if you actually have a good set of players who can get the exit open without the monster attacking any of you, the monster can just rage quit and you dont get any points even if you spent 30 minutes to stay hidden, get 5 of the generators running, and get the exit open, he can just quit and nothing counts. You won't get the experience points or get paid for the time invested... You don't even get rare itmes you pull out of boxes in the game that you would have gotten away with. It just fucks you which is amazing. Honestly, if you have friends you can play with, get the game. Otherwise I just wasted money because I spent more than 2 hours in an online game that have long matches. Some of the stupidest shit. Also, it's heavily sided towards survivors... Unless you are one of the best killers there are, which I have rarely seen, your gonna lose. Just play as a survivor to actually have fun.

Now for those of u that dont know this game, or how to go about playing it, this game is simple beyond belief and u dont need mics to comunicate with team members. I for one take the time to write messages in the opening to discuss what to do with campers this is simple and if we spread the word in each game we play, itll be alot more fun, and full of less camping idiots. Now for starters tell all ur team mates in the chat this \"if the killer is camping, hold M1 while on the hook so the bar fills half way, then release and continue to do so till the killer is  nolonger thier\" now this leaves your teammates 2 decisions. A.) they can either team 1 player distracts the killer and draws him away while the other saves the hooked player. B.) your teammates can say screw u and continue getting the Generators, now if they do decide to get the Gens, simply continue to be hooked, till u completely bleedout inorder to ensure that the killer is distract for the max amount of time, so ur teammates gain some sort of advantage. With this being said, everyone should understand and know this detail. Now as far as the camping killer goes, your a completly idiot for doing so because u actuially obatin less points when u sit their as the killer, waiting for the survivor to die. it is best to let them get rescued, so u can chop them up again gaining a second round of points and so on and so forth. U only obtain like a 1000 points when the survivor dies, but if u let the survivor get rescued, then their is more points to be made as youll cut them down again. now that that is out of the way, stop camping please, it is pointless and a waste of ur time, considering youll get a significant amount of less points doing so. Now for those of u complaining about the survivors and killers abilities, stop right their anything u complain about there is most likely a perk or add on of some sort that will fix ur problem (for example: i saw a thread stating how when ur the wraith, your bells should not be heard, when going uninvisible if your standing still) well would u look at that, after reading that thread, i later came across that day of a add on that does exactly what the person said, legit there is a sacrificial piece that does that, so please for those of u complaining about the game with only 3 hours on ur belt, please stop complaining, because u havent played the game long enough to see its full features, the only thing id complain about is the match making, im personally getting sick of being put together with newbies that have zero skill and hide the enter time, grow a pair and go for it!!! dont just sit their caz ur scared, do something! like save a teammate, its not that hard to trick the killer. BTW hears a little advice, USE YOUR VOLUME AS A KEY TOOL! even when the wraith is invisible u can still hear him breathing, USE THAT TO UR ADVANTAGE!!! And people also dont realise that u make heavy amount of breathing when ur in a locker, THE KILLER CAN HEAR YOU, if hes smart enough to use his volume, u also make excesive amounts of noise, after youve been hit once, THE KILLER CAN HEAR THAT ASWELL, so if u ar the killer use ur volume to ur advantage its more usefull then most people realise, i genereally tell where the killer is just by listening and pointing my screen in the dirrection that sounds loudest. USE YOUR GOD FORSAKEN VOLUME! the only complaint i have is my mouse and keyboard sometimes stop working, but i think its because its wireless (DONT ASK WHAT KINDA GAMMER USES A WIRELESS CONTROLLER) i dont know what i was thinking X(, also theyre is a slight glitch occasionly where ur arm can poke out of the box, so be careful, also occasionally, ur guy will glitch into the air when the killer picks him up , also theyre is this one spot in one of the maps where if u get down then crawl into it, and get back up, u glitch and can nolonger get out even if the killer hits u, he cant even pick u up. OVERAL FANTASTIC GAME!!! Just wish my friends were more into it like me, they yelled at me caz i played with perks stating that ive played it to much and know the game better, well IDK what to tell them, play the god damn game more it just came out! btw still have no idea where my cover art is, or where the sound treacks are, got the deluxe but neither are in my steam?","timestamp_created":1467156884,"timestamp_updated":1467157159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23909025","author":{"steamid":"76561198038362837","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":22838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16613,"last_played":1639339139},"language":"spanish","review":"era un juego de pta madre, perdi toda mi vida social jugandolo y me habia quitado las ganas de hacer ejercicio, PERO ENTONCES LLEGO LA PTA ACTUALIZACION DE MIERDA DONDE TODOS LOS PUTOS ASESINOS (MENOS LA ENFERMERA QUE NO LA VES NI EN EL PTO FORO DEL JUEGO) SON MAS FUERTES QUE EL PTO GOKU DESPUES DE TOMAR UN AÑO ENTERO ESTEROIDES Y ESO SIN MENCIONAR AL PTO ASESINO NUEVO QUE DE UNA HOSTIA TE SACA FUERA DEL PTO JUEGO, si lo que quieres es preguntarte porque eres un paquete en todos los juegos, te recomiendo que compres este juego y te pongas a jugar de superviviente.","timestamp_created":1467156538,"timestamp_updated":1536018738,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47266465425491333","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23908814","author":{"steamid":"76561198068393545","num_games_owned":652,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1468452269},"language":"english","review":"Just wish there was a way to play online with friends i no you can go privet but no fun with just two peole needs a lobby that you can ivite","timestamp_created":1467155929,"timestamp_updated":1467155929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23908795","author":{"steamid":"76561198108838470","num_games_owned":561,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":69171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":449,"playtime_at_review":1727,"last_played":1660603702},"language":"turkish","review":"Sikeyim böyle oyunu ben","timestamp_created":1467155874,"timestamp_updated":1615316036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23908790","author":{"steamid":"76561198040456422","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1627407193},"language":"russian","review":"Атмосферный и пугающий кооперативный хоррор!","timestamp_created":1467155860,"timestamp_updated":1467155860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23908725","author":{"steamid":"76561198016948163","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":89028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":334,"playtime_at_review":24950,"last_played":1660606858},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have ever played. This game could be considered both team based, or solo based. That is all based on the mind set of both the survivors and killer. There is no AI in this game, so both parties can be as predictable as ever. A teammate could mean life or death, whether it's healing, saving from a hook, or extra asistance with distractions or working on generators. However you are very capable of living alone if that's your wish. The Survivor side has a few ways to juke the Killer, each way funnier than the next. Apparently, spinning in circles like a bike constantly turning is one of those ways. Killers have many ways to play, varied by perk sets or the Killer power. The game is very uniqe every match based on those variations, and gets a lot of meta shift with every new DLC (once the full potential of each new thing is understood). Great game with a usually smart player base, 9.5/10\n\nEDIT: The player base isn't too smart. It's full of dipshit killers calling Survivors OP for some reason, even though they get overpowered perk sets and can camp making the game unplayable. Also Survivors bitch about a lot of things too, such as camping killers, except they actually deserve it.","timestamp_created":1467155696,"timestamp_updated":1492273827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23908459","author":{"steamid":"76561197962324014","num_games_owned":805,"num_reviews":404,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1659571995},"language":"english","review":"This game has potential, but it's missing a ton of polish which is needed to make it shine. \n\nIt's inspired by games such as Left 4 Dead and Evolve, but in my opinion it's more unique as it puts a spin on the idea.

The core game is there and it's fun, but plagued by several things that make it an unbalanced affair for everyone involved. Not to mention it seems the connection quality is based on the killer player and I've had too many matches where the rubberbanding/teleporting by either the surviviors or the killer makes the matches unplayable. I understand the game is supposed to be slightly in favor of the killers, but it's unbalanced all around right now.\n\nThe game needs: balancing for the Wraith, no auto rank downs just because you don't rank up, either better matchmaking or a connection quality requirement for hosts, Keys need to be able to be mapped, items that increase your chance to spawn at a certain level need to be changed to face a certain killer instead, so perks can be selected with strategy in mind. There are more, but those are the issues that come to mind first.\n\nI want to see this game succeed and grow, but if it wants to avoid losing players it needs to be more agile when it comes to balancing and there are some basic requirements for solid online play that need to be tackled ASAP. It's also important to note you cannot form parties unless it's a private match. I know many people would love that feature and are not going to buy the game unless implemented.

Algumas oferendas no começo do jogo, por exemplo, passam com um texto muito rápido que nem sempre dá pra acompanhar. A descrição dos perks dentro do jogo não podem ser consultados, somente antes de iniciar a partida.\n\nPor fim, estou aguardando ansiosamente pelo \"modo sobrevivência em grupo\", já que adoro jogar com amigos. No momento, acho que é o que mais detestei no jogo (a falta dessa opção).
