New bugs pop up, old bugs go unfixed. If a perk is unbalanced they rarely do any changes to it, they simply release new and increasingly overpowered perks so people no longer use the old previously unbalanced perks.\n\nThe latency in the game often makes playing as a survivor impossible, with killers hitting melee attacks from a dozen feet away. Being an asymetrical game with 1 killer versus 4 survivors, a lot of the power is naturally in the killers hands. So you can play for a whole evening and become the punching bag for frustrated kids that can't play the game normally.\n\nThe developers are completely deaf to feedback and make changes no one wants or asked for. The option to report players for toxic behavior or cheating etc, is a token act at best as nobody ever gets banned. Not even for cheating or hardcore griefing.\n\nThe game started out very promising, but now it's just another micro-transaction cashgrab for the developers. They make more new skins than actual changes to the game.

Not only can most machines these days run it (minimum is a GTX 460) but it runs very well too. Dead By Daylight is a really nice take on the killer in a horror movie type of games. Right now it offers 3 killers and 12 maps in 4 styled areas. each map is randomly generated so it's never the same, you cant learn the layout as it's impossible.\nThe developers have stated that they plan to hand out alot of free DLC as well as paid dlc BUT HERE IS THE BEST PART!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you don't have the DLC do not worry, as long as someone in your lobby has it then you can play it. THEY ARENT SEPERATING THE PLAYERBASE! This is what we want in games these days. Nobody likes being seperated from the others because they arent willing to pay up. Each killer has their own special perks and traits. 1st: The Trapper. Brandishing a meat clever the trapper has the ability to place down rusty bear traps over the map. if someone steps in it then they must get help from a friend or try to take it off themselves. while in this state the trapper can pick them up and put them on a hook to sacrifice them. they can also be downed by being hit twice with the weapon. Then we have the 2nd: The Hillbilly. The hillbilly is based off the chainsaw massacre, he has a hammer similar to the trapper's clever but  he also has something else. his special ability is a chainsaw, the chainsaw is an instant down and when activated the hillbilly can only charge straight ahead but is lightning fast. it's truly terrifying in-game. 3rd: is my all time favorite, the wraith. the wraith is a very fucked up being. not only can the wraith go invisible but it does not trigger the action music when he is nearby so unless you manage to see him then you wont know. but to counter this survivors can listen for creepy bells to know when he is nearby. also his weapon is badass. Now the survivors i can't go into too much detail as i havent played them all but there are 4 survivors and each has a special ability/abilities aswell but you only gain access to as you level up. Some are good at running, helping others, distracting and more which is awesome. The game takes quite a while to get boring as you never know what you are against as survivors but you can also be the killer too and the randomly generated maps are a nice touch and it's VERY easy to get lost. It's filled with tense moments, should you go save your friend or run for the exit? Found a flashlight? (a flashlight is an item ingame you can find which if shined in the kilelrs face can blind and stun them) maybe you can distract the killer and have someone else unhook your friend! theres alot of choices and things to loom out for. I only briefed you on half of the things as i want to get back to playing the game but i hope i gave you a general idea of what the game is about.\n\n\nPros: Randomly generated maps, Teamwork, very fun and forces you to use your brain, not graphically intensive but still looks great, free content in the future and dlc that doesnt seperate the playerbase and more.\n\nCons: There have been reports of crashing but i personally haven't seen any with my experience in the BETA or the full game, No friend play against randoms only against other friends (But they will add this feature soon)","timestamp_created":1465931866,"timestamp_updated":1465931866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579855620861053467","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557362","author":{"steamid":"76561198040499507","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1604536656},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game played the beta and now the full game and im loving it i highly recommend this game","timestamp_created":1465931771,"timestamp_updated":1465931771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557354","author":{"steamid":"76561198053672650","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1569044680},"language":"english","review":"Awesome evil fun, and a great new addition to the horror game genre. Highly recommended, especially if you bring friends along to hunt or try to survive with (though currently only able to do so in private matches, not ranked).\n\nPros: \n-Nice graphics\n-Great atmosphere\n-Lots to do as a Survivor\n-Good music (at least initially, becomes repetitive after a few hours)\n-Playing with friends (limited at the moment)\n-Leveling/perks/etc. to broaden gameplay depth\n-Consequences to failing as a Survivor (i.e. losing your equipped items)\n-Randomly generated maps makes for much needed variability\n\nCons:\n-Can't bring/invite your friends into public matches, only private games :(\n-A bit buggy, as expected of a new release\n-Limited players means rarely getting to play Killer in public games, unless you're REALLLLY patient waiting in queue\n-Definitely tilted in favor of the Killer early on (before one can level up sufficiently), especially in public games with no way to coodinate amongst yourselves as Survivors resulting in mainly headless-chicken gameplay\n-Losing your items as a consequence to getting matched with inept teammates\n-Offerings (buffs to the match arena, earning of points, etc.) are consumed on use, including the rarer items\n-Limited customization of characters\n-Limited Killer characters (though this and the previous issue will likely be expanded upon in the near future)\n\nOverall, a great exerience and will no doubt continue to improve as the devs address issues and expand on the game.

сбежать.Маньяк же должен убить их всех,но не просто убить,а принести в жертву,повесив на крюк.При этом выжившие будут отчаянно пытаться не дать вам их принести в жертву.\nИз гемплея можно отметить мини проверки в виде ползунка,который идёт по круговой линии и небольшой зоны,в которой нужно нажать кнопку(пробел).Если нажал правильно-ускорил починку,нажал не правильно-остановил починку ещё и немного подорвал генератор и привлек внимание маньяка небольшим взрывом.\nЕсть 3 вида маньяка-1 с капканами,2 с инвизом,3 с бензопилой.\nПомогать,как маньяку,так и выжившему будут перки,такие как например ускорение у выжившего или устрашение у маньяка и у выжившего ещё есть предметы.Например аптечка-можно лечить себя и других быстрее или ремонтный набор-позволяет ломать крюки и чинить генераторы быстрее.(у маньяка,как и у выжившего,есть ещё дополнительные предметы,которые немного меняют в ту или иную пользу,например на карте будет на 1 крюк меньше и всё в таком духе)\nАудио очень понравилось.Все звуки и вся музыка так или иначе держит в напряжении за выжившего и заставляет предвкушать страдания жертвы за маньяка.\nГрафика тоже не подкачала,красиво выглядит.\nГемплей понятное дело хорош,мы ради в него играем в эту игру)\nСтавлю оценку 10 жертвоприношений богу крови из 10.\nСоветую купить и поиграть в неё,не

AS OF 6/11/17!!!Review: Dead by daylight is a multiplayer asymetrical horror game where there are 4 survivors versus 1 killer. The survivors have a 3rd person camera while the killer has a 1st person camera. The main goal of the game for survivors is to activate 5 generators and find the 2 escape doors, there is also a trap door you can use if you find it and the key. Another way to use the trap door is if you are the last person alive it will automatically open. The killer's goal is to find and kill all survivors by sacrificing them to the \"entity\" by putting them on meat hooks. \nHonestly one of the best games Ive played in a while. I'll list some pros  and cons.\n\nPros: Great graphics and easy to learn \nNot too scary for the younger ones who want to play\nGood mechanics and map design\nGood player progression\n\n\nCons: This is a pro an con, you can now play with friends for BP, but its only surviving, not killing.\nNo in game voice chat\nCant change controls\nBasic graphics changing (although I dont worry about it some others will) \nFew bugs here and there, and few crashes.\n \nConclusion: Honestly for the game to have just come out its in great shape, of course the game is going to have its bugs and crashes when it releases and getting mad isnt going to help. Give the developers some constructive feedback, not feedback of you cursing and going off. I do wish that im able to play with friends in a ranked/multiplayer match and still earn BP but i hear they are working on it, so im not sure. I wish I could edit my controls but thats honestly not a big problem, for now i feel the 12 maps and 3 locations will do but of course there will be more. After a year of playing here and there, I believe the game is at a very playable state, I havent encountered any bugs lately,and I am having alot of fun surviving with friends. Overall I would give this game a.... 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1465931630,"timestamp_updated":1497158122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557276","author":{"steamid":"76561198215648335","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1559029609},"language":"russian","review":"Epic good horor. 10/10","timestamp_created":1465931437,"timestamp_updated":1465931437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535422325134277344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557274","author":{"steamid":"76561198001648677","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1586904770},"language":"english","review":"I got killed first my first match, exactly how I expect it to happen in RL.","timestamp_created":1465931434,"timestamp_updated":1465931434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557271","author":{"steamid":"76561198119160021","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1548880496},"language":"german","review":"is geil kann man sich geben","timestamp_created":1465931421,"timestamp_updated":1465931421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557270","author":{"steamid":"76561198118388531","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":17651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2533,"last_played":1658680395},"language":"german","review":"Game makes hella fun, its just missing a party system!","timestamp_created":1465931420,"timestamp_updated":1466185492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449157446622848511","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23557242","author":{"steamid":"76561198055703811","num_games_owned":491,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":3417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2165,"last_played":1656246193},"language":"german","review":"Eines der schlimmesten Entwicklerteams, welches derzeit auf dem Markt für Computerspiele existiert.

Но сразу же, после нескольких минут я сразу же изменил свое мнение.\nАтмосфера и адреналин тут буквально на каждом шагу. Действительно страшно прятаться выжившим от убийцы.\nСамый лучший вариант, прятаться в траве и ни в коем случае не бегать, потому что от спринта на земле остается рваная красная дорожка, видимая только убийцей и являющаяся для него ориентиром.\nК слову об убийцах. Их тут не так уж и много, но зато каждый из них уникальный. Классический, в маске с острыми зубами (еще из BETA-версии) правда достаточно похож на всем известного убийцу с Хрустального Озера, но вот его манера движения, оружие и стиль убийств разительно отличаются.\nКарты всего три, но на каждой несколько процедурно генерируемых локаций, что очень сильн разнообразит игровой процесс.\nОптимизация нормальная, ничего не проседает и не лагает.\nИз минусов можно выделить посредственную систему коннекта к серверам и постоянно сливающихся из игровой сессии напарников, из-за которых матч очень долго стартует.\nВ остальном же - неожиданный эпик и однозначно классная игра.\n\nВидео по игре тут:\n\n1) ПРЯТКИ ОНЛАЙН: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_AD4scIbC8 \n2) ПРЯТКИ УБИЙЦЫ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8zkTgv6-w \n3) ПРЯТКИ В ЛЕСУ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cqdu5taBI \n4) ПРЯТКИ В КОМАНДЕ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd979YKWscM \n5) ПРЯТКИ И БОЙНЯ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPxB3J6t5A \n6) ПРЯТКИ И КРИКИ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSjexcQmDhI \n7) ПРЯТКИ И УЖАС: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVu4VqFggUM \n8) ПРЯТКИ И СТЕЛС: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQKcWbVTOxI \n9) ПРЯТКИ В КРОВИ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihs7T2FkRg \n10) ПРЯТКИ И ЭПИК: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naOi22Zg9Mw \n11) ПРЯТКИ И МЯСНИК: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di8ujZKHk5I \n12) ПРЯТКИ И СКИЛЛЫ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBi31suDGSk","timestamp_created":1465930388,"timestamp_updated":1465930388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629087448120117188","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23556896","author":{"steamid":"76561198103565031","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":4369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1558727054},"language":"russian","review":"Великолепно!","timestamp_created":1465930258,"timestamp_updated":1465930258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23556890","author":{"steamid":"76561198059709719","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1475843077},"language":"russian","review":"Где люди,ку-ку","timestamp_created":1465930222,"timestamp_updated":1465930222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23556889","author":{"steamid":"76561198132812456","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":239,"playtime_forever":5344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1626663395},"language":"english","review":"Great Game","timestamp_created":1465930215,"timestamp_updated":1465930215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446579217910766602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23556874","author":{"steamid":"76561198058423176","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2588,"last_played":1472853615},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Updated 29/8/16[/h1]\nNote: I've stopped updating this guide because the developers haven't made a decent patch yet.\n\nIt’s now been a handful of months since the release date of DBD and when I made my first review of this game.\nIt’s gotten marginally better, but overall little has changed.\n\n[b]1)\tMatchmaking[/b]\nMatchmaking is looking worse every update. Each patch the developers seem to break or cripple matchmaking times for a day or two before fixing it. Furthermore, there is still no evidence of a calculation done for players when they match-make, meaning a totally new player can get matched to a very experienced set of player(s) that will make short work of them as a new player.\nAn example from a match I just had;\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=752856827\n\nLots of new players find this very frustrating to be outmatched and outgunned so heavily. And from an experienced player side, it makes games very boring and grinding.\nAnd yes, the game is still P2P hosted so the killer has a big network advantage on you if he decides to plug his 200m Ethernet cable into their neighbour’s modem. That is all assuming that you actually find a match. I’ve been waiting in lobbies for 20 minutes with over 18K people online.\n\n[b]2)\tBalance[/b]\nIn terms of matchmaking, little is being done about the overall balance of gameplay and how each side reacts to each other’s decisions. There is still a lack of a push or pull mechanic, meaning that games are over very quickly or very slowly depending on who has the better perks.\nThe developers seem to favour the killer over the survivors; every update the killer gets noticeable buffs while the survivors get nerfs or nothing at all. \n\nLast update the killer even got an auto aim feature for the lunge attack, meaning you could lunge at a survivor as they turned a corner and majestically ballroom dance your way round the corner while lunging to hit them. This makes games very unfair for the survivor.\n\nThere are maps themed around each killer, the problem is that some killers are very useless on specific maps, maps you have very little control over playing. This leads to very biased games which can be a stomp or very frustrating.\n\n[b]3)\tProgression[/b]\nProgression is getting more and more tiresome each update. The progression tree is randomly generated, which means you can get very lucky and get one of the most overpowered perks in the game early or get completely screwing and get one of the many broken or dysfunctional perks that still aren’t fixed.\n\nIf you love grinding games, DBD is very much for you. Your rank will be reset every month as standard and the skill tree is full of clutter and fluff to bulk out levelling. You will get 1 perk per level on your tree but the rest of your tree will be add-ons and other consumables that will buff you. \nThe problem is you lose these after every game so the skill tree is flooded with useless consumables you need to buy before you get to your perk or more useful items.\nThis means you could spend almost triple the value of the perk you want just buying the 3 or 4 add-ons to get there. This would be fine if the add-ons were useful. But many are not.\nFirstly the descriptions of the items are frustratingly vague.\n\n[i]“Slightly increases the chance of being sent to Autohaven wreckers when used”[/i]\nWell what is this “slightly” you speak of? Is that 1%? 10%? 40%? More? Less?\nYou can possibly find these figures on the wiki (if they are correct), but if they are on the wiki, is it really so hard to put them into the item description? The answer is “no, it isn’t”. It is just lazy not to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the value of perks seems to be all over the place.\nFor this example, let’s say perk A is worth 3000 points, it sits right at the start of the skill web.\nBut then, slightly further out, you see exactly the same perk, but it’s worth 5000 points this time.\n\nWhat gives? It just seems like a ploy to get you to throw away more of your hard earned points to string out the progression more. The game lacks so much content at the moment that makes progression tedious in order to make the illusion that it’s much more than what it is.\n\n[b]4)\tOverall quality[/b]\nThe main cause of all these problems is mainly the developer’s choices. Update notes are very unhelpful containing phrases as vague as the add-on descriptions. \n\n“Adjusted the catch-up speed for the Nurse” – no reference to what this means, just a single sentence that really isn’t helpful. \n\nThere are plenty of other examples where the update notes are just “increased” or “decreased”. If the developers are trying to make this game some sort of e-spot like they so badly are, they really need to put more effort into their update notes.\n\nAnd yet, game breaking bugs like getting stuck in objects will still get you\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=752822872\n\nThe developers also have a habit of addressing the symptoms of a problem and not the disease, often completely missing the problem people have been complaining about and change something related to it instead. \n\nLike the way map exploits created safe zones for survivors, so the developers made the killer’s lunge much longer and let the non-abusers have a miserable time trying to escape an impossibly long lunge, rather than just boarding up the exploits or changing map design.\n\nAnother example is how they nerfed many of the reward values for performing actions, then they threaten players that farm points with permament bans. Even though in some games players get barely enough to rank up due to the nerfs.\n\nThis game also has an anticheat, but it commonly bans people for no reason and still allows cheaters into games.\n\n[h1]Conclusion;[/h1]\nThis game should really still be in early access.\nThe developers clearly have no idea what they are doing, the game is progressively getting worse and more and more people are not playing each month. It has barely improved but has a very long way to go before it will be playable.\n\nBy the time it gets to be playable, the community will be so small that matchmaking times will be long enough to make people quit. \nProof of decline: http://steamcharts.com/app/381210\nFriday the 13th is on the horizon, and that will most likely blow this shit-show out of the water.\n\nThe community is also pretty unbearable and technical support is borderline non-existant and the forum page for it is a graveyard of bugs going back to the beta that are still not solved.\n\n[h1]Save your money and avoid.[/h1]","timestamp_created":1465930161,"timestamp_updated":1481497084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":54,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498968303203582764","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23556864","author":{"steamid":"76561198068616075","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1505673594},"language":"english","review":"Good Game, heartbeat should be replaced by Thomas the Tank Engine theme","timestamp_created":1465930133,"timestamp_updated":1465930171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":236,"votes_funny":698,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660717666149139404","comment_count":28,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23556862","author":{"steamid":"76561198043384039","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1532240897},"language":"english","review":"\nThis game is awesome!

One of the things I enjoyed most during the beta was playing with my friends, which took forever to acctually set up due to the fact there isn't a ranked mode where you can que with a party, so instead we had to just keep looking until after sometimes 45 minutes, we found each other.

In addition there are a whole bunch of game breaking bugs now.
