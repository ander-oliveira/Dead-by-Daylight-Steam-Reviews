Some people are not team players in a team based game so yea, best with known friends...[b]\n\n[b] This team of developers seem to make some really questionable choices at times, be warned... [/b]\n\n[B] The negative [b]\nIf you want a bug free completely developed and most importantly,if you value your sanity, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Some of the patches seem untested upon release, seen by breaking already working mechanics already present in the game, for everyone. Broken aspects rear their head more often than I'd like but it is improving, they are working on it, it is most certainly not dead. A huge problem is though, the killer becomes the host, if his internet is shitty for whatever reason, the lag can ruin the game for you. You can test it sort of after entering the lobby, you'll quickly see someone spamming a letter or number, they are testing the response times.\n\n[i] [b] The positive [b]\n\nThis game is meant to be played with friends, getting 3 others together (teamspeak/discord/skype is highly recomeneded) and facing a killer can really be fun, UNLESS the killer is camping.

Worth mentioning is the developers are still activly adding content and fixing bugs almost a year after release, yea, those other companies who just drop a pile of s.h.i.t. on you and never fix anything, they know who they are.\nWith friends I'd most certainly recommend it, solo can become a problem at times.\n\nBest of luck","timestamp_created":1471791477,"timestamp_updated":1498542783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497536957263946533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25054553","author":{"steamid":"76561198267759001","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":6067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2790,"last_played":1614867284},"language":"english","review":"love the idea of this game. very fun with friends. good game","timestamp_created":1471791140,"timestamp_updated":1471791140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503691554069519043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25054517","author":{"steamid":"76561198102762156","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1531352995},"language":"spanish","review":"Estamos ante posiblemente el juego más divertido y a la vez más desaprovechado de steam, aunque la idea sea un poco típica lo saben llevar muy bien a la hora de jugar, peeeero este juego esta repleto de una comunidad bastante \"antideportiva\", si quieres jugar con gente desconocida online el 90% porciento de las veces cada vez que el asesino te ponga en un gancho este se quedará campeando hasta que mueras, aparte del nuevo personaje que está demasiado OP, en definitiva es un juego que se aprovecha mucho mejor con amigos","timestamp_created":1471791031,"timestamp_updated":1471791031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502796769142150879","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25054511","author":{"steamid":"76561198130092686","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":6569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4486,"last_played":1483346502},"language":"thai","review":"  WINTING   WINTING   WINTING  WINTING   WINTING   WINTING   WINTING   WINTING   WINTING  WINTING ครับ","timestamp_created":1471791014,"timestamp_updated":1471791014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25054503","author":{"steamid":"76561197969655856","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":873,"last_played":1590615920},"language":"english","review":"Grabbed this yesterday and been having an absolute blast.

My First Game as a Survivor i managed to survive Long enough for survivors and Monster to disconnect or ragequit. What happened was We unfortunetly let one of our people die and the 4th person disconnect at the start of the game putting us as a disadvantage. This mode was honestly horrifying to me yet thrilling at the same time. I decided to give the Killers a Go and i definetly Learned alot from the High Lvl Survivors. Even though Monsters can pick survivors up, another survivor if brave enough can flash the light to temporary stun the Monster. Since the Monster is 1st person viewpoint he won't get to really see where they went except to corner of his/her eye perhaps and following the scratch marks survivors make from running. Also Even If the Monster Hangs one of the survivors, the more bold and veteran players WILL risk their lives to save their comrades. I had the weird experience of having one taken off and i swing at the savior and hang him instead while the one that escaped got away. Another time i managed to attack the savior b4 he/she got to get the one I hanged off. At this point there was 1 survivor left and she was a high lvl that had some sprint perk and managed to escape. normally when you have 1 person hanging and about to hang the other one there is a chance the other survivors will save that hanged person. Even though i sometimes lose to high lvl players I at least sacrifice 1 person which earns me blood points. I also learn from these other survivors how to be Very good cooperative survivors. I wish i could say the Wraith is OP because of the ability to cloak but that bell ringing when he needs to phase in and out of invisibility just to hit a survivor is a dead give away and they end up running when they hear it. This is gonna be a fun year for me. 10/10\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7/9/18\n\nIn my most recent match as the killer the survivors happened to be a 4 man survive with friends. maybe even a 3 man. I knew this because during the game the 3 players were messing around with me and were hiding poorly. They thought I was some casual killer (I actually am too perhaps even a baby killer) But I've watched enough videos and use my ears to hear my surroundings too. They were too altriustic so they kept saving each other and were always close by. Once one of them did the tea bag while I was breaking the pallet out of being over confident I started to tunnel. Managed to sacrifice all 3 of them and then I Freeze. so I take this moment to take a break and come back to find it was a Crash. I know Dead by Daylight doesn't do this, it was more likely the player might have ddos or intentionally crashed the game so I wouldn't get anything out of it and because they were salty. I log back in to try to find their profiles via Shift+Tab and find their names don't show up as if they didn't exist. It might be time to bring in some A.I. Killers and A.I. Survivors because apparently people get salty when they lose to other players and go so far as to greif/hack and sabotage gameplay for killers and probably survivors alike. I like this game alot too but then I find I lost my offering  which wasn't a big loss but it was still an item I earned with my time and effort and apparently that match still counted enough for me to lose it while the crybabies got a free pass to keep being toxic.

Just gotta be a sportsman and take defeat like a real player and also figure out ways to beat the killer when he camps or just try to escape. in killer perspective if they gen rush to 3 or less quickly they figure it's time to camp and start killing people ASAP. depends really though. most of us just play killer ofr the rituals yet continue to play as survivors, or we're killers and play survivors casually.","timestamp_created":1471790969,"timestamp_updated":1532524758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25054490","author":{"steamid":"76561198134368646","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8596,"last_played":1488481873},"language":"russian","review":"Добавьте поддержку руля!","timestamp_created":1471790934,"timestamp_updated":1471790934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523227393627166748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25054485","author":{"steamid":"76561198041580578","num_games_owned":973,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1471804890},"language":"english","review":"Ok so this will be the first game I have bothered to write a review for. For now my opinion is the game is not worth recommending. I have played four rounds as a survivor so far. My first match, the very first time I have played the game I was pited against a rank ONE killer with rare perks out the whazoo. That match lasted all of two through three minutes before we were all brutally killed. The second match was only a rank thriteen killer so we managed to last about five minutes. I do intend to continue playing as it is fun but if this trend continues I may stop.\n\nThe game while extremely fun and visually nice is ruined by the terrible matchmaking system. So as it stands I cannot and will not recommend it. Should they ever decide to rework the matchmaking in a resaonable way I will then recommend the game.\n\nDevs if you bother reading the reviews or discussion boards at all please listen to us when we are asking for a better match making system.

If you're a person who enjoys feeling pressured to use your skills and abilities, Killer is probably for you. Killer gameplay entails many different things such as mindgames (using your knowledge of the game's mechanics and predictions of movement to outwit a Survivor), map control (pressuring multiple Generators and/or Survivors at once), power skill (using the Killer's power ability to your advantage) and time management (self-explanatory). There is a large variety of Killers at your disposal, all with different powers that work in different ways and are stronger in different areas. My personal favourite is the Huntress as she is the most skill-based Killer of all of them, requiring perfect aim, precision, knowledge of the relationship between how long the hatchet is charged and where it lands, etc. However, Killer can be very difficult to learn and there are more skilled Survivors than skilled Killers, so naturally people feel demotivated to play Killer. As odd as it may sound, if you are struggling to get to grips with Killer, keep playing Survivor. The better you get at Survivor, the better you get at Killer because there are a lot of situations as Killer where you have to put yourself in the Survivors' shoes. Having knowledge of these situations will help you in the long run. Furthermore, ignore people who tell you to use and don't use what they want. Will you get flamed for it? Probably. Should you care? No. You're still learning, and it's all a part of the process. I find watching guides on YouTube can really help, such as those from OhTofu, Otzdarva or Scott Jund.\n\nMy personal thoughts on Killer are although it can be a lot of fun (and, in the case of a Huntress main, VERY SATISFYING), there are a lot of games where I don't have fun and I feel hopeless. This is due to sweaty games where Survivors just rush Generators, giving me no chance. This is normal, and in the end, you shouldn't expect to win every game.\n\n[b]Survivor[/b]\n\nIf you prefer a more casual playstyle and like co-operative gameplay, Survivor may be for you. I don't have much to say about Survivor, but if there is one thing I can recommend, don't play solo if you cannot defend yourself. You're going to have a bad time. Your best bet is playing Survive With Friends as you can learn the ropes with the backup of your buddies to help you. Although some Killers play fairly, there are a lot of Killers who do not. For example, some Killers will happily chase a different person every time, not bring any overpowered addons [i]cough[/i] Iridescent Head [i]cough[/i] forever Freddy [i]cough[/i] and not bring moris. However, there are Killers who take pride in doing so, and as Survivor, communication is key to surviving in these situations. Similarly to Killer, there are plenty of tutorials for Survivor on YouTube.\n\nMy personal thoughts on Survivor are I tend to not have as much fun as Survivor because there's not as much skill involved and I don't like the feeling of not having control over who is killed and whatnot. However, I think with friends, it's a lot more fun and chill.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nThere's a lot to this game, and even more so with the addition of the Archives. Every match can have a billion outcomes: it just depends on the choices the players make. Although it's had its ups and downs, Dead by Daylight always comes around to be a fun time in the end.","timestamp_created":1471785760,"timestamp_updated":1619970040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25053054","author":{"steamid":"76561198054029492","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":178176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":11844,"last_played":1660338725},"language":"english","review":"This game is buggy, yes.

The Charles Shaw boasts organically grown grapes or something. To be honest I wasn't really paying attention to the back of the label while I was using that McDonald's toilet. This \"organically grown\" stuff tastes as about as complex as a wet dish clothe and as natural as synethic motor oil. As such it will contrast and compliment the complexity of this game.\nIt's weird. Such a simple premise. People being hunted by killers in a closed map. The victims need to repair generators or invest in bitcoin in order to escape. The killers have to capture and hook the victims. But then you have all these witchcraft offerings and whatnot being given to some guy or god or whoever, possibly Santa. These offerings will hopefully help the offerer. I know that if i was a guy or a god or a Santa I'd want cookies and/or cake for my offerings.\nWhat was more painful than being skewered on a hook was having all of my favourite perks nerfed. It's like they want the killers to win or something. It won't seem so bad but its a real seesaw of opponents. You'll face the same pro three times in a row and then meet some noob who will tank harder than the bitcoin the victims invested in.\nLastly I must say that I've never liked a game which will bring out a hundred different DLCs. DLC prices should have a cap of something like $2 across all games.\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that its important to stay hydrated.","timestamp_created":1471785306,"timestamp_updated":1540802121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25052964","author":{"steamid":"76561198139755306","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1584895123},"language":"romanian","review":"Teamwork sucks !","timestamp_created":1471785282,"timestamp_updated":1471785282,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25052869","author":{"steamid":"76561198024212863","num_games_owned":987,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1610048704},"language":"english","review":"Too many bugs and issues, this should be early access, borderline unplayable some days (especially due to lobby connectivity problems).\n\nWhen you by some miracle or satanic sacrifice manage to play it's an ok game, it'll keep you entertained for a couple of hours, however the game is nothing special.\n\nI give it a MEH/10 (that's like a 5 or something, meh)\n\nIf they ever get their shit right I'll update this.","timestamp_created":1471784905,"timestamp_updated":1471794533,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455910086631774902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25052868","author":{"steamid":"76561198258011260","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3535,"last_played":1490464776},"language":"russian","review":"Лично я наиграл 50+ часов с другом и точно могу сказать ЕСЛИ ХОТИТЕ ТРОЛЛИТЬ МАНЬЯКА И РЖАТЬ С ДРУГОМ ИЛИ С ДРУЗЬЯМИ ТО ЭТА ИГРА ДЛЯ ВАС!

На всех картах на всех персонажах против всех убийц;\n- игра за убийц всегда является брождением между генераторами с бегом за увиденным человеком. И если противники не умеют стелсить и рукожопы в QTE, то 80% действия за убийцу будет занудный бег за человеком с последующим его повешением на крюк;\n- выше я умолчал о фонарике, которым можно слепануть убийцу, тайном люке, особенностях убийц (капканах, обратных капканах, и тд) потому что это невероятно незначительные особенности. Они не вносят ничего значительного в основу процесса;\n- QTE, сраное QTE!

I do have 100+ hours played in the game & i am by no means a noob my highest rank on survivor writing this review is level 4 with 1 pip. Also do not go ahead thinking the only reason i got to this rank was infinite glitches because i have never used one nor do i know about them but i do watch people stream on twitch and hear a lot of talk in chat about them.\n\nThis game was fun until the recent game update in august, the killers are way too overpowered now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPerks that are overpowered & all killers use:\n\"Spies from the shadows, iron grasp, deer stalker, no one escapes from death\" are too overpowered and need a nerf or the killers perks need to start having a cooldown like survivors do. On top of it most of them carry the four perks i mentioned above which just makes them overpowered.\n\nProblems with killers: \nThey hit you with their weapon after you have already jumped through a window there weapon goes through the window and hits you puts you down on the ground after hitting you for the second time of course. The killer walks way to fast & catches up to you in very little time. This gives you no time to escape at all. The killers speed should be nerfed i am not saying all killers but certain classes should walk slower in this game, which i will list in each killers review. Every killer in the game has auto aim which is terrible according to dead by daybreak \"it’s a bug\". I would say 75% of the time when i hit a killer with the pallet i end up getting hit by them. Then they end up on the same side of the pallet as me as well. Their attack range also needs a nerf all too many times i get hit when i am so far away from the killer which is crap.\n\nProblems with killer’s items:\nThe Trapper - His traps are to overpowered now since you can no longer sabotage them unless you disarm them first & by the time you do that he already notices that you have disarmed the trap and heads towards your direction giving you no time to sabotage the trap meaning the only traps you will be able to get rid of are the ones he has not picked up and set on the ground. They need to reduce the speed that the trapper runs to give you more of a chance in the game or reduce the time it takes to disarm a trap & sabotage it. Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers. The trapper should not be able to place traps underneth people on the hook it is to overpowered and does not give you team member enough time to disarm and take the person off the hook.\n\nHill Billy - His chainsaw lets him run halfway across the map or more, it is also a one hit kill once he hit you, you are instantly down on the ground waiting to be hooked. Because not only can he run really fast plus far with his chainsaw he can walk fast and catch up to you quick even if he misses. This would not be such a big issue if his walking speed was nerfed to something more reasonable.\nAlso they need to take the auto aim off the killers.\n\nNurse - Her teleport is to accurate mixed with the auto aim attack for the killers she is way overpowered, i would have to say she is the worst person to play against you do not want to play in a match against her at all let's just say your team is like an insta kill. She is broken & needs a nerf. They need to take the auto aim off and reduce the range of her attack also make her slower she walks to fast. Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers.\n\nWraith - He is not really overpowered a pain to play against but he is most likely the easiest to play against this patch. He deserves the extra speed since he does not have any killer items like traps, teleport, or a chainsaw that lets you run super far at a fast pace. i do not have much to say about the wraith except for his attack range is pretty out there and might need some small tweaking. Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProblems with surviving in the game:\nThe only escape from the killer that you have in the game is hitting them directly with a pallet to stun them which is pretty close to impossible since this game is player to player based and the connection is always the killers so he has the advantage in every single game. Example: \"lag is a survivor killer & the killer never has that problem\". The flash light is useless if anything in the game deserves an auto aim this because it never works when you shine it in their eyes to begin with they just walk right up to you and hit you. Besides the pallets being risky and the flash light being useless, this game needs to come up with more ways to get away from the killer.\n\nAbout Survivor perks:\nI do not find the survivor perks to be overpowered although there is a lot of discussion about them not being teachable to other classes because people would rather them be unique to each class.\n\nBugs in the game for survivor:\nWhen a survivor on your team is on the floor bleeding out in the game there highlighted body will disappear & you will no longer be able to see where they are which is annoying when you are trying to help your team member, this bug will also happen when your team member is on the hook. i am not sure if this is a bug but its annoying when you think your team member is hit once only to find out he is thrown on top of a killers shoulder being carried to a hook. Killers still glitches through pallets and hitting you. Dead by daylight needs to fix healing when you are bleeding out on the floor if your whole team is on the floor and the killer is leaving you there to heal up all the way you should be able to heal up the rest of the way so you can contunie playing the game it is pointless to heal up all the way if no one is left to help you. To many times have i laid on the ground as the last person to bleed out and die with no help no way to get up this needs to be fixed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think this wraps up my review on Dead by Daylight. if you can put up with all the bugs & glitches and the unbalanced gameplay Dead By Daylight is still a good game but it needs a lot of work before it is completely finished. I hope this helps before you decide to purchase the game.","timestamp_created":1471778018,"timestamp_updated":1472521999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25050934","author":{"steamid":"76561198091323207","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7730,"last_played":1629156139},"language":"russian","review":"топ за сваи тенге\n","timestamp_created":1471777544,"timestamp_updated":1592592434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9OKx1tYCdvPHXw=="}
