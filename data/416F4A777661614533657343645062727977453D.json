Dedicated servers are apparently on their way this summer, but I'm not holding my breath just yet. Honestly, the worst things I have to say about it are the players who are bad sports/like to cheat, and some of the newer cosmetics have flowy effects that jump and lag all over the place. You get a lot to pick from visually, and even if you don't have a specific DLC, if anyone else in the match has it, you can play on their maps/with those characters (as teammates).

You will likely feel discouraged at times. The state of the game balance can be annoying, the grind is such an immense time sink, and the developers' decisions can be frustrating. But, if you can get past that, as hard as that may sound, you will have a fun time with this game. Survivor is entertaining to play with friends, and killer is a nice challenge when you're solo. Aside from matchmaking, there is also the option to play private games with up to four other people. The game is also cross-platform with basically everything out there, ensuring that there's a player base even larger than Steam's stats say. If you're a fan of horror, and looking for a new game to get into alone or with some friends, pick it up on a sale and give it a shot.[/b]\n\nDead by Daylight is a 4v1 asymmetrical multiplayer game that's fun at its core, and has great iconic IPs attached to it (Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Resident Evil, etc.). Everything else that surrounds it, however, is kind of a mess. Despite that, I do think its worth an honest look.\n\nThe community is largely toxic and cocky. Many players you will encounter have insanely huge, and insanely fragile egos. This goes for both survivors and killers. Some killers will get so frustrated at you, they'll down you once, place you on a hook, and sit there in your face hitting you repeatedly until your time is up, taking you out of the game within the first two minutes of it beginning. A completely un-interactive and un-fun experience for both of you. Some survivors will teabag and taunt you the entire game, but as soon as one thing doesn't go their way, they'll disconnect, flame you in post game chat, and leave an angry comment on your profile. Once you're used to it, its funny 99% of the time. This sort of thing isn't exactly unique to DBD, every big multiplayer game has its fair share of bad sports. Due to the asymmetrical \"Us vs. Them\" nature of the game though, be prepared for some extra toxicity.\n\nThe in-game progression, as of this review, is fairly deep, but its a slog. With currently 29 playable survivors, and 26 playable killers there is a [i]LOT[/i] to grind out. Each character can be leveled up 50 times, and an infinite number of additional times to get more items and perks; perks being arguably the most important part of the progression system. Each character has three perks that are exclusive to them, until they are leveled to at least level 40, after which they can be used on any character in their respective role. Each perk also has to be upgraded three times to reach its full potential, and can only be upgraded once per character level. Oh, and the perks that you are able to choose from are completely random each character level. You can see how this can get out of hand, especially with 1-3 new characters being added in each major update, and three additional perks being thrown into the mix for each one of them. Early on, its often difficult to get the build that you want on a specific character because of this randomized system that requires you to potentially dump an unholy amount of Bloodpoints (the main free in-game currency) into it.  The base game comes with 7 survivors, and 5 killers. The rest you will either have to buy with real money, or grind out Iridescent Shards (the other free in game currency) to earn them. So unless you are willing to pay some real money, you'll have to grind out Shards to unlock a character, then grind out a bunch of BP to level them up and unlock their unique perks. Being a completionist in this game is nearly impossible. Trying to unlock what you want, let alone everything on everyone, requires a substantial amount of time. The developers have somewhat alleviated the grind over time with battlepass challenges, giving out Bloodpoint codes on social media, and login events. While all of that is nice and its much better than things were before, the issue of an insane grind still remains at a fundamental level. And speaking of the developers...\n\nThe developers are a mixed bag. The art and sound teams knock it out of the park most if not all the time. The issue is when it comes to balancing the game and adding quality of life features and fixes. The devs often choose the strangest hills to die on, and are unnecessarily stubborn about certain things the community would like to see changed. Bloodpoints being arbitrarily capped at 1 million, perk tiers bloating the grind up by 66%, an SBMM system that only accounts for the result of the match and nothing that occurs in between. As of this review, all of these things have either been shot down with a flat \"No, we have no plans to fix/change it\" or a \"We've talked about it. Maybe we'll do it but we can't give an ETA\" which, based on previous experiences, translates to \"We're probably not going to do anything about it, but we don't want to just say no on the off chance we decide to\". It doesn't help that when they [i]DO[/i] change things, its at a glacial pace. In some cases, its taken years to make balance changes to things collectively agreed upon by the community as being overpowered, even when that change is something as simple as changing a number from 3 to 1. I really truly hope that something suddenly clicks within the devs one day, and they pick up the pace on making meaningful changes. I hope they become much more transparent about what they're doing and why they are doing it. I hope that they start taking more constructive criticism and community feedback before pushing out unwanted changes to the live build. But until that happens we will sit here in disbelief as they nerf something that didn't need a nerf, and fail to give legitimate reasons as to why, while other blatantly overpowered things run rampant.\n\n[b]Even after all of this, do I really still recommend the game? Yes.[/b]\n\nI truly believe that Dead by Daylight is a good game, and it has the potential to be even greater. What's here is fun, addictive, and endlessly replayable. The gameplay is simple enough and easy to learn, but becomes more complex in its progression and meta game. Similar to a fighting game, there's lots of conditioning and mind gaming that go on between a survivor and killer during a chase. Its these moments where the game truly shines. Pulling off a crazy juke on a killer and rescuing a friend, just barely making it to the escape feels satisfying. Making a hard read on a survivor that results in a down, which causes the game to snowball out of control in your favor feels satisfying. When this game is at its best, there aren't many other games that can come close to providing a similar experience. That's why its so frustrating to see such an amazing idea be mishandled so frequently by questionable decision making on the developers' part. But there's always improvements to be made, and although they may be pretty slow, the developers are making continuous changes to the game (for better or worse) with the game being around for nearly 6 years now. Look at it this way, at just over 2000 hours in the game, playing both sides fairly evenly, there's a reason I've stuck around. The complaints I have towards this game are made out of love. I want to see this game succeed and thrive. I'm hopeful that one day I won't have to start a recommendation for this game with a bunch of disclaimers.\n\nIf you do decide to pick up the game, don't let the toxic players in the community dictate how you should play and what you're allowed to use. Just have fun. The game can be a little overwhelming at times with how much there is to remember, but that's ok! There are tons of learning resources out there for new players, including some very helpful content creators such as Otzdarva. If you're feeling lost, don't hesitate to watch a few videos or read a few guides, and you'll be on your way to being an experienced survivor or killer.","timestamp_created":1562203038,"timestamp_updated":1643206265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53448569","author":{"steamid":"76561198295048072","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":569,"playtime_at_review":10323,"last_played":1660587458},"language":"english","review":"A good game with lots of potential, but the balance leaves much to be asked for and the community can be very toxic.

FAITE À 30H DE JEU)\n\nPlusieurs points à aborder concernant l'aspect de ce jeu.\n\n\nTout d'abord, le jeu est fréquemment mis à jour avec des nouveautés ce qui est un bon point. Or, malheureusement, les DLC sont payants à chaque sortie et les prix peuvent être un peu excessif par rapport au produit proposé. Ensuite, l'aspect du jeu est franchement incroyable et nous donne des frissons à chaque partie mais peut nous causer également de la rage extrême avec le tueur qui campe ou encore les survivants qui n'en n'ont rien à faire du travail d'équipe pour survivre. Hormis cela, le jeu est agréable à jouer et je vous conseille d'y jouer entre amis pour un moment encore plus jouissif.\n\nJ'ai longtemps hésité à le prendre car les avis ne m'inspiraient pas trop : pas mal d'avis négatifs qui m'ont laissé sur la bande d'arrêt d'urgence et je n'arrêtais pas de me bouffer des \"lives\" sur ce jeu. Il m'avait écoeuré ! Finalement lors de ces soldes d'été, j'ai décidé de tenter l'aventure avec un ami et je ne suis vraiment pas déçu finalement de l'avoir pris. Chaque partie est différente et vous rencontrez toujours cette adrénaline à vouloir échapper au tueur ou dans le cas contraire, attraper et tuer les survivants.\n\nJe vous recommande Dead by Daylight si vous aimez les jeux un peu dans le style survie / horrifique poursuivi par un tueur à la Friday 13th. Une bonne mécanique de jeu et de nombreux atouts à débloquer au fil du temps que vous y jouerez : vous n'allez pas vous ennuyer ou en avoir marre. Malgré tout, il faudra parfois s'y faire à la rage à laquelle vous allez être confrontée avec une communauté qui ne sait pas jouer mais honnêtement, j'ai pour le moment 24h de jeu mais après de nombreuses parties, c'était vraiment rare de croiser de ce genre de personnes.\n\nHave fun!","timestamp_created":1562200601,"timestamp_updated":1577120796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53445202","author":{"steamid":"76561198273811332","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":94531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67851,"last_played":1659361446},"language":"schinese","review":"黎明杀机，黎明杀鸡，这个游戏陪伴了我许多日子，带给了我——抑或是我们许多的快乐，恼火，怀念。（[strike] 皮皇什么的都去见恶灵吧[○･｀Д´･ ○][/strike]）\n三年来，我们有多少天会因为这个游戏而熬夜？（[spoiler] 我觉得没有[/spoiler]），有多少朋友是通过这个游戏结识的？（[spoiler] 我觉得没有[/spoiler]）[strike]有多少萌新被扼杀在20段的摇篮里？[/strike]现在，黎明杀机3岁了，我们见证了它的成长，从蹒跚学步的婴儿成长为了现在的模样。\n白天不会到来，现在，庆祝这黎明吧，死亡不是解脱！\n[spoiler] 有点奇怪[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1562200509,"timestamp_updated":1562200509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53445099","author":{"steamid":"76561198275149451","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":81,"playtime_at_review":13834,"last_played":1660164646},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente","timestamp_created":1562200443,"timestamp_updated":1562200443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53445053","author":{"steamid":"76561198262233568","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1953,"last_played":1611888171},"language":"english","review":"Very interesting game, so much fun with and without friends!","timestamp_created":1562200397,"timestamp_updated":1562200397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53444932","author":{"steamid":"76561198014642660","num_games_owned":749,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":4628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4463,"last_played":1621538753},"language":"english","review":"itsa good show","timestamp_created":1562200315,"timestamp_updated":1562200315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53444506","author":{"steamid":"76561198156153720","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":69941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":265,"playtime_at_review":22328,"last_played":1659682752},"language":"english","review":"Great game but just doing this for the gran prix thing","timestamp_created":1562200044,"timestamp_updated":1562200044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53444306","author":{"steamid":"76561198168928071","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":1983,"last_played":1659981514},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun solo and even more fun with friends very replayable due to the amount of unlocks and characters to play in different maps alot of fun and enjoyable easy to pick up gamplay.
