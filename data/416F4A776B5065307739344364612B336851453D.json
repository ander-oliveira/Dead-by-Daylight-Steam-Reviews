There's a big variety of ORIGINAL killers and LICENCED killers. Each of them have different powers and perks which gives the option to play any playstyle you want to play. The game objective is clear and as you get into the Realm of the Entity more often you'll be able to succesfully escape the killers.\n\nI recommend playing with friends, it's easier to communicate on getting the job done. In my experience some killers have no respect for teams but it can really help you througout the match. Also encountering bugs is a fun thing especially when you're playing with your buddies. \n\nThis game still has to improve but I think they did a pretty good job so far. ;)","timestamp_created":1505543227,"timestamp_updated":1526568459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34988936","author":{"steamid":"76561198316268737","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7584,"last_played":1645906088},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo que vale muito a pena, você passa por um processo de medo, insegurança, calma, tudo que um jogo de terror pode proporcionar de bom, ele faz 10x, toda partida é uma nova experiência, super recomendo.","timestamp_created":1505542669,"timestamp_updated":1505542669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34988889","author":{"steamid":"76561198391436267","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1560557205},"language":"english","review":"Still better than Friday the 13th on NES","timestamp_created":1505542468,"timestamp_updated":1505542468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532734274864196777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34988802","author":{"steamid":"76561198034516392","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":82392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3333,"last_played":1659171637},"language":"english","review":"1.try to play killer, long waiting searching game\n2.the game favours survivors\n\n1.Now better balance\n2. events\n3. always come something new","timestamp_created":1505542083,"timestamp_updated":1576955188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.408000409603118896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34988745","author":{"steamid":"76561198272815209","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1596559160},"language":"english","review":"playing this game, scared me and make me scream. oh fvck, i love this game! worth it","timestamp_created":1505541845,"timestamp_updated":1505541845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34988716","author":{"steamid":"76561198317050906","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":76245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":99,"playtime_at_review":65913,"last_played":1660475575},"language":"english","review":"Oh come on.

(They watch the prey die, a slow dead)\n\ncons:\n- Sadly no campaign to understand the background story unless the bios for every character and some ¿tapes? (Dint get that).\n- Camping hunters. (Why me and not that dude that pass in front of you, HELP HELP *DEAD*)\n- The BUG that everyone is talking about. I don’t mind starting again but is a bad programing thing :( \n- The dam jump scar that nurse killer do as she blinks in front of you, gives a heart attack.\n\nMostly this game have all the potential to be a great game, the thing is the community hate frustration like everyone in this world, how don’t have a freaking killer standing in front of you only to secure that no one ells save you (I happened to come across to this situation but the other 3 victims lured him out of sight and one of them save me, so stop putting “Camping killer”. You can easily scape if you do teamwork), surviving is pretty easy if you know what to do and the things you come across in the way, the best part Is gaining points for doing extra things. Well finally is that I have a lot of fun in only 4 hours and it worth all the money I spent in this game + dlc.\nPls do more stories or background story that activates is you do something in game or

Despite all that, I still love to play this game, and recommend it -- provided you back up your saves after you play, because that lose-all-progress-bug is naaaaaaasty.

That being said, one suggestion I would hope the Developers see is this; Add a seperate friends mode where you dont have free access to all the items and perks that you can level up and unlock stuff in. Some players dont want to ever play with randos.

After having much more than 82 hours of gameplay I can safely say this game is NOT worth the money in the slightest. Unless you want a reason to thrust your fist through the monitor or damage any property in your space this game is not for you. The developers themselves are useless, making the game far too killer sided (Mind you this is coming from a killer main) and completely ruins the experience with every passing update. \n\nMy main issue from the beginning was how they ruined licensed characters lore wise, power wise and design wise. That hasn't changed at all. Michael's design isn't good at all, the coveralls being originally green in the film and instead changed to blue ingame. The mask itself doesn't look movie accurate either. I won't get into remake Freddy either. Power wise Freddy is a complete MESS and the way I view it? The developers use licensed killers as a crutch to keep this sorry excuse for a game on it's feet. As a huge Evil Dead fanboy it broke my heart when they ruined Ash. Ash is notorious for fighting demons and hunting them, but they stripped away everything about him. Even his perks are complete dogshit at this rate and it didn't help that they nerfed his only good perk after he was released. Even if survivors can't fight back, Ash doesn't belong there and it ruins the element of Evil Dead for me and i'm sure other Evil Dead fans out there will agree.\n\nThe gameplay itself is horrific whether it's the survivor playstyle or the killer playstyle. The game is almost 5 years old now and there's no new content in terms of gameplay. It's the same thing day in day out for both killers and survivors. Personally I feel like more gamemodes should have been added by now or some sort of side activity to pull yourself into a new perspective, like Friday the 13th's virtual cabin for puzzle solvers. I would get into tunnelling, slugging and other horrible strategies that ruins the gameplay, but that would cost me another paragraph.\n\nAs for powers some of them feel like complete copy and pastes of previous powers. Tricksters power seems like a more effective Huntress and Leatherface is an easier to control Hillbilly for beginners. If an icon is going to be in the game I want them to feel like an icon, not something a 12 year old can pick up and destroy in a single round. \n\n\nAll in all, Dead by Daylight is a pathetic game and I don't know why I continue to waste hours upon hours on it knowing I will just fill my anger even more with every passing round. I hope Evil Dead: The Game will finally pry me away from this so I don't have to increase my anger toward it. Dead By Daylight is NOT what it's set out to be. The game is NOT scary in the slightest unless you're going against three individual killers out of the large killer roster and in general it's horrible.

Ладно маны имеют свои уникальные способности и анимации, но выжившие помимо модельки и скинов в магазине ничего не вносят в игру (3 скила не в счет)\n\nПомимо отсутствия разнообразия, в игре также существуют миллион багов (которые исправляются, само собой, но за ними следуют другие). Сам не замечал их часто, но бывали и серьезные ошибки\n\nЕще из минусов - странная система обновления. Зачем необходимо перелопачивать все 40 гигов ради патча в 1 гигабайт к примеру. Может я не шарю в этом всем, но нигде такого не встречал в подобных играх\n\nНу из плюсов - атмосфера, стиль, облики персонажей и музыка. Все это может привлечь новых игроков всегда, это не меняется. Однако новых игроков также привлекают и новые главы, связанные с какими-либо известными героями из фильмов и/или других игр. Также, самое главное, игра без доната, а также отсутствие внутриигровых лутбоксов, все доступно (кроме самих глав, открывай либо за валюту, либо за внутриигровые мани). Однако скидки бывают часто, можно выхватить какую-нибудь понравившеюся главу по дешевке \n\nРекомендую для общего понятия, но не для игры на постоянной основе, слишком быстро надоедает, 7 подвальных Бубб из 10","timestamp_created":1505502552,"timestamp_updated":1633779297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34979091","author":{"steamid":"76561198292874824","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1641014789},"language":"english","review":"\"major\" reseting bug didn't effect me\n\npennywise should be next killer after leatherface","timestamp_created":1505502325,"timestamp_updated":1505502325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34978850","author":{"steamid":"76561198344677624","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1497,"last_played":1632771519},"language":"russian","review":"Добавили Кожаное Лицо,игра после этого превратилась в калл.Дело в том что он в 99.9 проц случаев тебя ваншотит и тут неичего не сделаешь.","timestamp_created":1505501600,"timestamp_updated":1505501600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495049506425857544","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34978549","author":{"steamid":"76561198001016986","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":40724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21606,"last_played":1650814199},"language":"english","review":"Add offline","timestamp_created":1505500576,"timestamp_updated":1524911934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkPe0w94Cda+3hQE="}
