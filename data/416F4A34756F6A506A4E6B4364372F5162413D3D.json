I think I'll buy this game. (buys game). *Everything goes down hill from here* \nDay 2: (Still in free play weekend but there is like 2 hours left) I'm noticing a little bit of bugs where the game isn't putting me in a game but I think it's because of the free weekend coming to a close so a lot of people are trying to play and possibly putting strain on the servers. Still having fun with friends but after free to play weekend ends, I play some solo que since my friends havent bought it *yet*. Runing in to more of the problem of where the game doesn't actually put me into a game but gives me a free escape *which sucks because I lose a level, because the level up system recuires you to get atleast 10,000 blood to be considered a win* or it puts me in a loading screen that heartbeats at me and i have to force close the game to do anythng else. *It's becoming an issue and I'm starting to not enjoy the game* \nDay 3: Playing solo que for while everything seems ok but after about 2 games i have a large time frame of where I'm being in a game crash state of loading screen heartbeating at me. It's taking about 15 minutes of restarting to find a lobby. I'm noticing that the later it gets the worse the games servers are. *Friends get on* We play a little bit and by little bit I mean it takes forever to find a lobby with 3 players in a group. One friend gives up after the 2nd match because the killer quits early in the match and everyone loses a level because of it. Friend 2 and I try to play a few more games before we go to sleep. We que and \"find\" a lobby but it kicks us to the main menu. My friends character *which was lvl 18* got bugged because of this and was put at level 0. *There is not supposed to be a level 0 in this game everyone starts at level 1* I fear that it might happen to me and i lose my level 25 character and everthing on him so we switch to other characters at level 1. We try to find a match with these characters. *We both are still rank 20 (lowest rank in this game) because of the server kicking us and people leaving and us getting punished for it* We get matched with a rank 8 killer that just destroys us because we have no perks on these new characters. We die so fast that we look for 1 more before we give up. *We find one* We die even faster than last time because this game decided to place us with a rank 1 killer. that is the highest rank you can be in this game. This is the last straw for us we say fuck this game. If you want to spend $20 or what ever the fuck this is at the time and you want to have maybe a little bit of fun but get fucked along the way.

Ständig gibt dir einer der anderen Survivor die Schuld, weil er zu dumm ist um das Spiel zu spielen und stirbt. Wenn denn überhaupt mal ein vernünftiges Match zustande kommt. Denn leider passiert es andauernd, dass der Killer seinen Opfern hinterher läuft, sie schlägt und am Ende doch hilft, sie zur Luke (dem \"Notausgang\" für den letzten Überlebenden) zu tragen und so das Spielgefühl vollkommen zu zerstören, nur damit alle Parteien ein paar Punkte farmen können. \n\nDa das Spiel nicht über eigene Server verfügt und der Killer die Rolle des Hosts einnimmt sind schlechte Verbindungen leider an der Tagesordnung. Wenn der Killer eine schlechte Internetverbindung hat teleportieren sich alle Spieler stückchenweise über die Map. Das führt wiederum dazu, dass man als Überlebender zwangsläufig Punkte verliert, denn es ist nicht möglich irgendwelche sinnvollen Aktionen zu vollbringen. Wenn man so eine super spaßige Partie dann allerdings verlassen will verliert man direkt einen Rang, da man ja ein Leaver ist.\n\nDie Entwickler scheinen sich auch keineswegs um die Probleme des Spiels zu kümmern. Stattdessen veröffentlichen sie lieber ein neues T-Shirt und bitten ihre Spieler bei irgendwelchen Umfragen für ihr großartiges Spiel zu stimmen. \n\nMitunter passiert es allerdings auch, dass man eine vernünftige Runde spielen kann und tatsächlich etwas aufkommt, was ein wenig an Spaß erinnert. Leider ist das eher die Ausnahme.\n\n\nInvestiert euer Geld lieber in Brechmittel. Erfüllt den selben Zweck, wirkt allerdings schneller.\n\n\nEDIT: \nAls ich dem Spiel nach 3 Jahren mal wieder eine Chance gegeben habe, muss ich feststellen, dass sich tatsächlich vieles zum positiven entwickelt hat. Die Lobbys enstehen und das Spiel startet wie gewünscht. Ich habe auch keine Lags erlebt, obwohl der Killer noch immer die Rolle des Hosts übernimmt. Über die meisten Neuerungen kann ich nicht meckern, da ich sie noch nicht ausgiebig getestet bzw. kennengelernt habe. Aber neue Inhalte, die von anderen Franchises stammen, sehen grundsätzlich sehr spaßig aus. \n\nAlso: Ich kann dieses Spiel inzwischen guten Gewissens empfehlen. Vorausgesetzt man bringt die nötige Geduld mit, um die Mechaniken der verschiedenen Charaktere und Killer zu lernen und sich mit den Maps auseinanderzusetzen!","timestamp_created":1482196747,"timestamp_updated":1566680772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517508506774902344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28478281","author":{"steamid":"76561197969037238","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5176,"last_played":1487447408},"language":"english","review":"DO NOT BUY!\n\nDepending on your hardware, this game could freeze EVERY single game you end!\nIf they fix it, i migh re-evaluate my review.\n\nAsus X99-M WS\nIntel Core i7-5960X\nnVIDIA GTX 780Ti\nG.Skill Ripjaws 4 F4-3333C16Q-16GRRD\nSamsung 950 PRO NVMe M.2","timestamp_created":1482196657,"timestamp_updated":1482196657,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28478084","author":{"steamid":"76561198022591491","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":42728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19299,"last_played":1655756488},"language":"spanish","review":"Hice un analisis de este juego hace 1 año criticando el tema de los bugs y diciendo los aspectos bueno del juego, y quería actualizarlo para ponerlo acorde a cómo funciona el juego ahora.\n\nYa han corregido errores como cargas de partida infinitas, miles de siglos en encontrar partida (que sigue pasando), y etc.\n\nSIN EMBARGO, este juego se ha convertido en un P2W de cojones. ¿Qué significa esto?

Wenn ihr sie haben wollt, wartet auf Preisnachlasse.\n\n[h1]Liebe Dead by Daylight Entwickler...WAS STIMMT MIT EUCH NICHT?![/h1]\nIch mag euer Spiel, ich spiel es wirklich gerne. Ein Horrorspiel in dem der Gegner ein echter Spieler ist und 4 Spieler als Überlebende halt überleben müssen ist echt eine geile Idee. Alles scheint ganz gut balanziert zu sein, Killer sind zwar stark, das müssen sie auch sein, aber nicht so stark dass jede Runde alle Überlebende sterben. Es macht wirklich Spaß...eigentlich. Denn...\n\n[b]Euer Spiel hat nen ganzen Haufen Probleme.[/b]\n\nIn den letzten Tagen konnte ich nur mit Freunden spielen, alleine als Überlebender resultierte darin dass ich entweder nicht in die Lobby kam oder in die Spielrunde. Gleiches wenn man einen Killer suchen den man nicht kennt, und Freunde als Überlebende dabei hat. Online spielen ging also gar nicht, und das ist ein großes Problem. Daneben gibt es noch das Problem das Matchmaking VERDAMMT KAPUTT ist selbst wenn es funktioniert. Ein Level 1 Killer mit Level 20 Überlebenden in ein Spiel zu schmeißen macht einfach keinen Spaß, weil Spieler mit einem guten Level natürlich viel bessere Perks haben die einfach das Spiel viel zu unfair machen. Anständiges Matchmaking ist ein Muss bei einem solchen Spiel und genau hier hin müsste die Arbeitszeit fließen wenn es nicht ganz klappt.\n\n[b]Natürlich gibt es noch viel mehr Bugs und Ungereimtheiten, das ganze Spiel fühlt sich unfertig an... Und das ist noch nicht mal das schlimmste![/b]\n\nAnscheinend kümmert ihr euch lieber darum, noch mehr Geld zu machen. Obwohl euer Spiel so unglaublich unspielbar bei Zeiten ist wegen oben genannten Punkten, habt ihr die Frechheit [b]4 bezahlte(!) DLCs[/b] für euer Spiel zu veröffentlichen, anstatt euer Spiel fertig zu stellen. Ja, ich sag es, es ist bei weitem nicht fertig, lange noch nicht aus der Beta Phase raus und trotzdem scheint ihr gar nichts daran zu tun! Stattdessen seid ihr einfach so geldgierig und erwartet von euren Spielern dass sie nochmal 30 Euro für das wirklich komplette Spiel inclusive Bugs und Unspielbarkeit bezahlen! Bevor ich auch noch einen Cent in euer Spiel stecke für das ich schon 20 Euro bezahlt habe möchte ich euch darum bitten, euer Spiel bitte spielbar zu machen!\n\nTL:DR\nKauft euch dieses verbuggte Spiel nicht sollange Leute nicht sagen dass alle Probleme gelöst wurden. Es ist es einfach nicht wert, so cool die Idee auch klingen mag.
