In the game's history, the developers were very hesitant in balancing the game because of the process of approval required by their publisher, Starbreeze. Ever since Behaviour bought the rights from Starbreeze, there have been many balance changes that have given the killer side of the game the balance they deserved. Before the balance update, survivors were very powerful in that they almost didn't even need to cooperate in order to survive. The point of a 1v4 asymmetrical gameis that the 4 survivors must work together in order to overcome the overpowered killer. The developers have recently been enforcing that type of gameplay which is why you can see many negative reviews and why there is so much toxicity in this game.","timestamp_created":1532573354,"timestamp_updated":1532573354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504043102264404297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43749158","author":{"steamid":"76561198105561631","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":63139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":539,"playtime_at_review":62599,"last_played":1660454979},"language":"schinese","review":"好久没玩了，又来看看zzz做没做妖","timestamp_created":1532573185,"timestamp_updated":1660281721,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.723285257816314697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43749051","author":{"steamid":"76561198370506925","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9591,"last_played":1634739332},"language":"schinese","review":"请改回去\n請改回來\nPlease change back.\n戻ってください\nVeuillez changer de retour","timestamp_created":1532572555,"timestamp_updated":1532572555,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61489182710647583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43749002","author":{"steamid":"76561198007561030","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":7971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6969,"last_played":1539987192},"language":"english","review":"Great game, only play killer.

Before dbd I never really played any horror games but I'm glad that I decided to give this one a shot. It's a strategic and fun game where four survivors go against one killer and complete objectives in order to escape. I have some friends who I play with who didn't really enjoy the concept because it felt repetitive or slow to them but to me I feel there is a good amount of flexibility for gameplay. As a survivor, you can focus on the gens only and hiding in lockers to avoid the killer, you could be brave and distract the killer to protect teammates, you can be sneaky and sabatoge hooks, destroy traps, and unhook your teammates- and so on. It all depends on how you want to play match by match.\n\nThe ambiance in the game such as the sound effects, lighting, music,  and the heartbeat you get from being near the killer all add to the player's experience by putting you on edge and immersing you into the world. It also helps to understand both the survivor and the killer's perspectives when playing the game, since the two roles are played in different camera perspectives- suvivor being 3rd person and the killer being 1st person. By understanding basic perks and abilities that both the killer and survivor have is also good when first playing the game since it gives you a better idea of what the people you will be playing with are going to be likely using. Perks, add ons, offerings, and items(in the survivors case) can help customize the gameplay by giving advantages and abilities. For example, the flashlight can be used to stun a killer and grant you time to create distance, or to help a friend escape the killers hold. \n\nBefore I bought the game, as one does I read the reviews and I noticed a lot of reviews saying that the community was toxic. And to be honest, I haven't had any problems with people in the community, I know that there are sure to be some sour people. But that's with any game community. The only downside off the top of my head is for the killer when they go against a survive w friends group that is using comms. Traditionally, survivors cannot talk to one another in the trial -only before in a text chat as they ready up in the lobby and then after the game where everyone including the killer can say their ggs. So when a group of survivors are using comms it makes it harder for the killer because the people on comms can tell the other where the killer is or if they are heading to a buddy or where they are placing traps. So I understand some of the frustrations that people have. \n\nBut overall I think this is a really fun game and should definetly be given the chance if you feel interested in trying it out.","timestamp_created":1532558653,"timestamp_updated":1532558653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496350377798080444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43746259","author":{"steamid":"76561198837695899","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":196773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":614,"playtime_at_review":43052,"last_played":1660588563},"language":"english","review":"Recent update is in the right direction.\n\nKeep up the good work devs and don't cave in on the survivors!","timestamp_created":1532558478,"timestamp_updated":1532558478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451223313808441162","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43746163","author":{"steamid":"76561198809251446","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3845,"last_played":1625372908},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego\n","timestamp_created":1532558035,"timestamp_updated":1532558035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43745977","author":{"steamid":"76561197996160916","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":112104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":77,"playtime_at_review":76877,"last_played":1660051016},"language":"spanish","review":"NO LO RECOMIENDO.\n\nEn los ultimos parches no han parado de nerfear a los survivors hasta dejarlos en la mismisima mierda, y buffando killers sin parar. \n\nCuando se retracten lo cambiaré.","timestamp_created":1532557350,"timestamp_updated":1532557350,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479400962591171265","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43745446","author":{"steamid":"76561198015476989","num_games_owned":431,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":121731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51652,"last_played":1630785816},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu à perdu de ca saveur franchement les développeur pense Argent et pas communauté ... clairement a laisser tomber","timestamp_created":1532555138,"timestamp_updated":1532555138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576508998870849609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43745418","author":{"steamid":"76561198093790112","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1562211977},"language":"english","review":"gud game very nice","timestamp_created":1532554992,"timestamp_updated":1532554992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497340410947799683","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43745130","author":{"steamid":"76561198127833668","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":39123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":227,"playtime_at_review":21430,"last_played":1660236124},"language":"english","review":"11/10 would tbag again","timestamp_created":1532553914,"timestamp_updated":1565637096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43745043","author":{"steamid":"76561198805727484","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":40372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":35,"playtime_at_review":35485,"last_played":1659903121},"language":"russian","review":"из мана Фреди сделали говно","timestamp_created":1532553546,"timestamp_updated":1592139171,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43744989","author":{"steamid":"76561198101129917","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":11337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11010,"last_played":1632936780},"language":"english","review":"Leaving a positive review after the survivor \"mains\" REEEEing from them leaving negative reviews after the 2.1.0 update.\n\n10/10 GOTY.

Обратите внимание на отзывы за этот период. В основном отрицательные. Их оставляют люди, играющие за выживших. Причина негодования проста - Сурвомейны привыкли творить дичь, чувствовать безнаказанность и кеклолить с Убийцы. \nСейчас разработчик понерфил имба перки (спринт, самохил и др.) и в игру стало более менее комфортно играть. \nЕсли вы раздумываете над приобретением - вот вам текущий расклад:\nиз 12 представленных на выбор Убийц только 1 в состоянии действительно успешно выполнять свою работу (медсестра). Остальные играют от ошибок Выживших. Другими словами, группа опытных Сурвов сумеет спастись (если и не полным составом, то трое выживут почти наверняка). \nИ да, хороший баланс по мнению разработчика - это игра, где двое выжили, двое принесены в жертву. Поэтому если вы оказались на крюке - смиритесь. Повезёт в другой раз.\nЧто касается эмоций - то игра даёт исключительный экспириенс, возможность примерить на себя роль героя из фильма ужасов. Ассиметричный геймплей (1 vs 4) является редкостью - поэтому попробовать DBD действительно стоит.
