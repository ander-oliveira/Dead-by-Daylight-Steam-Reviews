If you're not, they'll be PC players and they'll proceed to tell you how much you suck, that you should uninstall, and probably kill yourself. You know, apparently the usual things you say to the people you're trying to have fun with.  Because apparently that's fun: telling people that are not as good at a game as you to go kill themselves.  \n\nBeyond the player base, you are also going to have incredibly long queues, dropped games, and a ton of glitches.  And, yeah, the matchmaking will put you in games with people waaaay above your rank and also far below it.  Because that equally screws over everyone.\n\nThe possibility for having a good game is here.  I really wish it was a good game.

This review focuses on the foundation/blueprint of the game. All \" details\" are ignored\" such as cosmetics. ***\n\nSadly, I cannot recommend this game mainly because of two big things BORDERLINE PAY2WIN and EXTREMELY TOXIC COMMUNITY.\n\nBefore we dive in i want to let the newbies or people contemplating about buying this game know, your first few games will take  a while because the game doesn't know who to match you up, but after that you should be getting into games extremely quickly due to how big this game is.\n\nThe Goods of Dead by Daylight\n1. By far the BEST implementation of PLAY THE WAY YOU WANT IT. \n- In dead by daylight, there is not \" VICTORY \" or \" DEFEAT \" screen. There is only a review of how you played the game. This is determined by how \" well\" you are able to do your role. As a survivor you are supposed to do gens, rescues, heals, item search ALL AT THE SAME TIME. If you neglect these you will score poorly and thus get less rewards for doing so.\n2. Progression: Blood Points ( currency to game more abilities/ items to change gameplay) and exp (progression to unlock new survivors or killers) are separate progressions.\n- So this kinda goes hand in head, but it is mainly gray here. If you die quickly you get less exp and less blood points. If you dont die quickly and do nothing you get less points. If you dont die quickly and do alot you get alot of both blood points and exp. \n- if you are struggling to do your objective but are at least able to survive to get maximum experience points to level up you can get a new survivor that might suite your weaknesses better. So you aren't going to get hindered because you can't do much and get no blood points. Think of it as two separation progression bars. one for yourself the other for the said character to enhance them\n3. This game is extreme well thought of and pretty great design.\n- This game isn't a simple hide and seek. but hide and seek turned up to 15. There are very tiny details that alot of people will skip over. Like breathing, pain grunts, blood, crow noises, etc. They all work hand in hand. For example, if a killer is in your area and you are next to them. If you linger to long they might notice a breathing sound from you character and pursue you harder. Everything is useful, it all depends how you can or cannot use them depending on situations.\n\nThe Bad\n1. As mention at the beginning the game is border pay2win. \n- some licensed killers are powerful and oppressive as hell. the only way you can get them is literally pay for them. Not all of them are literally a pay to play a powerful killer to win, but there are some content specifically killers, and teachable perks killer/survivor that you can only get by paying because they are licensed (characters from different franchises.\n- Infamous example, Pyramid Head out of all of the licensed he is probably one of is not the strongest killers due to having the ability to attack through walls, hook people without the need to go to a hook. Or down right kill them instantly without need to go to a hook to do that. From my knowledge, there is no (non-licensed character) that can do that. It is not needed by Pyramid Head has that luxury that you can only get if you throw money.\n2. The game's grind is horrendous \n- This game is almost a callback to how mmorpgs especially f2p (free to play) games are. You get nothing if you buy the base game, then you grind HOURS and it is literally HOURS to unlock and get things moving forward. I hear people go \" ha ha i played 1000hours + and its terrifyingly true.\n\nThe Ugly ( REASONS THAT KILL DEAD BY DAYLIGHT)\n1. Matchmaking in Dead by Daylight has no rhyme or reason despite having 70,000 players \n- it has a hard time matching people who are similar to your play level. Example: When I started I already match up with someone who has a bloody character head to toe. this means that they prestige (reset their level 3 times). This is about 1,600,000 Blood points. With an average bloodpoint (excluding bonuses) per game it is about (20k per 10min maybe?) about 14hours x 3 of player experience ranked up with someone who literally just started the game.\n- As a killer you might face off people who are decked out with non-sensical perks immediately.\n2. The community is toxic.\n- Don't expect sunshine and rainbows here. Nobody here wants to help to you in fact some people will lie to you. or tell you that what you want is the \"wrong choice\"\n- Teabagging is a thing? I don't really get what it is, but apparently people use it in order to insult other players or what.\n3. Community will force you to think a certain way.\n- Despite have no win or loss the community wants to find a way to set in stone what is a win and what is a loss.  For example, they will claim killing only 2 survivor is a loss despite everyone in the game getting pretty good blood points of 20k.\n\n\nTldr,\n\nDead by daylight is a great game for what it is, but you have to treat this game as a free to play mmorpg in terms of progression. (hell i can't play a game for 1000 hours). You can go solo, but people go out of their way to make your experience terrible by forcing their negativity onto you. You can play the game however you want. as long as you play the game you will get the rewards. \n\n","timestamp_created":1625253470,"timestamp_updated":1625253470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94905346","author":{"steamid":"76561198091698159","num_games_owned":445,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":13970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7589,"last_played":1658412559},"language":"russian","review":"Из крюка полетели конфети и радостные звуки, когда повесили мою Богиню, крайне не рекомендую","timestamp_created":1625253446,"timestamp_updated":1625253446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94905316","author":{"steamid":"76561199061614661","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":103119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76441,"last_played":1632580540},"language":"thai","review":"เกมส์ดีมาก สูดๆไปเลย","timestamp_created":1625253419,"timestamp_updated":1625253419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94905107","author":{"steamid":"76561199019272629","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1653513250},"language":"french","review":"J'adore ce jeu, pas besoin de plus de mots pour dire qu'il est superbe, achetez-le !","timestamp_created":1625253213,"timestamp_updated":1625253213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94904956","author":{"steamid":"76561199181082743","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1649427118},"language":"russian","review":"1","timestamp_created":1625253034,"timestamp_updated":1625253034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94904949","author":{"steamid":"76561198411134053","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":58852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44509,"last_played":1642377104},"language":"brazilian","review":"Recomendo e pode tornar o seu jogo favorito como tornou o meu.
