As with any popular game it has its critics, but I'd say most of its problems are exaggerated. It's a fun multiplayer survival game that lets you play in many different ways, both with and against other players. It regularly gets new characters, perks and maps.\n\n[b]\"Paywall\"[/b]\nThe long list of DLCs may make it look like you need to pay to unlock everything but all perks and characters are unlockable through in-game XP-earned currency called iridescent shards, so you can technically access everything (other than optional Rift passes for cosmetics) as long as you play enough. Maps are available to everyone. There are collaborations with lots of horror media icons like the Resident Evil games, Silent Hill, Saw, and so on, and everything goes on sale pretty often so if you specifically like something and don't want to grind for it you can get it for less than a fiver :)\n\n[b]Community[/b]\nBefore I tried out the game I was hesitant because I'd heard the community was toxic. There's definitely trolling every now and then, and playing can be frustrating sometimes, but I'd say I've had far more positive encounters than bad ones when it comes to post-game chat and funny things happening in matches. I've laughed and had lots of fun both when playing with friends and when playing solo with randoms. There's no voice chat which is also nice for anyone who dislikes that. I'm not really involved with anything like discord or reddit but I know the game has a very active community for whoever gets into it.\n\n[b]Learning Curve[/b]\nWhat first made me love the game was how simple it is to get started. Controls are easy to learn and your goals as killer or survivor aren't complicated but can still be difficult to reach. Survivor gameplay mainly consists of quick-time events and evasion, killer gameplay is a bit more varied with each character but involves chasing and controlling the progress of survivors while sacrificing them. But even though it's easy to get started, there's tons to learn and practice as you play, which keeps the game fresh and exciting for many hours without being too punishing.\n\n[b]Dev Engagement[/b]\nThe devs get a lot of hate and I'd say most of it is unwarranted. New \"chapters\" (usually new killer, survivor, and map) are released around every three months. Events happen often, usually for holidays like Christmas, St Valentine's, Chinese New Year etc. The devs might not release weekly patches or anything but they're decently good at listening to players, for example through the prestige, matchmaking, and perk reworks coming later this year. I've only been playing for half a year so maybe I'm not the most knowledgeable on this but personally I'm pretty happy with the upkeep the game gets. There's also lots of cosmetic options for the characters and more get added regularly which is nice :D\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nDBD is fun and easy to get started with while staying exciting for a long time. You can play as, with, or against both original characters and classics from the horror-genre. Most of the bad things you might have heard are probably exaggerated. I didn't think I'd like it but I ended up loving it. Try it and see what you think! :]","timestamp_created":1655606328,"timestamp_updated":1655606328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117213976","author":{"steamid":"76561199079130272","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":377,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1660279484},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1655606172,"timestamp_updated":1655606172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117213965","author":{"steamid":"76561198426310119","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":4021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3644,"last_played":1656542957},"language":"brazilian","review":"é bom me caguei todinho","timestamp_created":1655606141,"timestamp_updated":1655606141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117213900","author":{"steamid":"76561199004272991","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":24996,"last_played":1659518080},"language":"schinese","review":"对新人不太友好，人类速修，杀手玩家对控机需要很好的意识，一波操作失误很可能崩盘，面对钢铁车队，没有很好的办法！","timestamp_created":1655606010,"timestamp_updated":1655606010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117213695","author":{"steamid":"76561199152651273","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":28,"playtime_at_review":2841,"last_played":1660241503},"language":"german","review":"ich habe so viel spaß an diesem spiel anfangs ist es ein Bisschen schwierig aber ich liebe es als killer zu spielen bin aber als survivor besser XD","timestamp_created":1655605696,"timestamp_updated":1655605696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117213518","author":{"steamid":"76561197989335101","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3729,"last_played":1659234644},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is a great horror game.

I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

But i believe that a balance between killer and survivor perks does exist somewhere. Also dbd has iconic killers and survivors for an example its very fun to play against micheal myers, freddy or demogorgon.
