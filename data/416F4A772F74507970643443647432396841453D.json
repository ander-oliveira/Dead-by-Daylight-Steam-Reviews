The survive with friends option is also great fun, but only when it works! Half the time it takes over 5 min to find a game or when you do find a game the game might kick you out of the lobby anyway.

The moving of camera is really good and you can easilly find your way around\n- Amazingly different perks for each character you choose to play as\n- You can be a full 'team-and-heal'-player, or the more 'I'll help but I'll leave quick too'-player\n- It's super intense when the killer is after you, and when you stun them you feel downright AWESOME\n- When you get a really good killer, they are the fucking best, praise the shit outta them\n- It's really nice to play with your soul mate(lover or whatever u like to call IT), hell fucking yes it's the BEST team\n- The graphics are AMAZING, the characters are creative, that being both killers and survivers\n- Some glitches but they are pretty darn funny when you find them\n- Every map is in 'the same area' depending on what map it is, but is totally different so you can always end up surprised\n\nCONS:\n- Toxic cummunity\n- Killer's that wont play by the rules camp you so that other people can't get near you and then you DIE\n- If a killer camps you and you call them out for it, they'll be so rude you wish you stayed in your mom's womb\n- More toxic community, 'cause damn, it is TOXIC\n- Really, the REAL 'killer' of this game(see what I did there?) is the community, they will come and shit on you, so seriously, beware\n\nThe game is cool though, and with really good friends it can be a wonder to play. If you have never played it before, I SERIOUSLY recommend playing with your friends through 'training' rounds, it's an option where you 'can kill your friends'. It's sickly good for practice and better than just jumping right into the game and ending up getting a shitty killer or two survivors who lost connection to the server.\n\nAT LAST; A word of advice, IF you are dealing with a camper killer, signal the other's by waving your arms(attempt to escape but don't go through with it) to tell them to stay away, or tell them before the game starts that if a killer camps you they should just work on the generators, because the killer is losing a sick amount of precious time guarding your hanging, dying body.\n\nOh, and lastly:\nThe Doctor sucks, fuck the Doctor.","timestamp_created":1504557541,"timestamp_updated":1511597797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34743305","author":{"steamid":"76561198258676570","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4878,"last_played":1600799264},"language":"italian","review":"anche se ho dovuto ricominciare il personaggio (liv. 50) ,he un bel gioco :)","timestamp_created":1504556776,"timestamp_updated":1504556776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34742414","author":{"steamid":"76561198283945704","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":45259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14884,"last_played":1643052408},"language":"english","review":"Best game 4ever","timestamp_created":1504553777,"timestamp_updated":1504553777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34742117","author":{"steamid":"76561198107258475","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":54038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41311,"last_played":1629370414},"language":"schinese","review":"开心农场~","timestamp_created":1504552794,"timestamp_updated":1504552794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34741918","author":{"steamid":"76561198390610917","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1527145877},"language":"schinese","review":"不好玩  人还少  亏","timestamp_created":1504552220,"timestamp_updated":1504552220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34741233","author":{"steamid":"76561198330000617","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":221,"playtime_forever":69619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38149,"last_played":1637927246},"language":"romanian","review":"DATA RECENZIEI: 17.04.2019\n\nSalut !\n\nInformații POZITIVE:\n\n- gameplay atractiv și distractiv.\n- grafica foarte plăcută.\n- foarte mult conținut.\n- îi destul de echilibrate meciurile.\n\nInformații NEGATIVE:\n\n- scârțâie tare la optimizare.\n- frățică ... atâtea crush-uri ... băăăăăăăăăăăăăă', la 2 meciuri bune, unul se duce din cauza crush-ului.\n- comunitatea ... vai de capul meu ... s-o stricat în 6 luni mai rău ca aia din CS.
