They insult you everytime in the chat when you do things negative like 1 gen camping to secure last kill or even playing as nice as possible without camping. \n\nMost survivors doesn't give a damn about the game they just want you, killer, to waste your time by everytime trolling you when they know that they are safe and the gate are open and you are at the total opposite of the map. and destroy your fun by gaming. They also spam control( to crounch) near you just to provoke you in a duel without giving a damn by the main objective,  fixing the gens.\n\nThey will use infinite loop that they have found on youtube to troll you as possible, making explosion by faking it just to troll you and telling you they are there of course without giving a damn about gens.\n\nMoreover, there are way too much smurf  especially as survivors that with more than 1000 hours  gameplay enjoy insulting and provoking killer with 50h max. I think that those people can't play against good player so they prefer to easily beat noob killer and destroy the whole game.\n\nMost toxic community ever avoid that community and that game at all cost\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n18th January 2021 update\nI still maintain what is writing above (However I have changed my mind about the last line) but that's not a reason to not recommend the game.\n\nIf you are new, especially if you are more interested to play as a killer, it's going to be tough but the game is really fun when played correctly and with the correct person (same skills)\n\nAs mention in the first part of the review, I got really frustrated by so many people t bagging (spamming control  key) when the stun you or loop you forever. Same for 4 SWF(survivors with friends) who don't care about gens and hide the entire game into an house inside lockers to stun you every time you ll try to hit them or SWF wearing all a flashlight to troll you as possible or body block you with 3 persons so you will never reach the hook.\n\nBut that's not the entire community and to be honest most of the time you ll get baited by the troll you are just feeding them and being yourself a troll by using toxicity as an answer and wasting the time of other survivors who want to have fun.\n\nThat's why I need to apologize for some bad behaviour made during that first part of gaming and swears after game chat when I got really mad and also to treat almost the whole community as \"toxic\". Doing this, won't do  anything good to the game's reputation.\n\nMy advice as a killer:\n\nIf you see a troll that doesn't care about doing gens and making the game go forward, just ignore him. I don't even try to hit them or trying to chase them if they are useless in the game and for other survivors.\n\nNever face camp by guilty or trying to humiliate survivors by letting them die slowly.\n\nAvoid as possible camping. When I have a down, I just put him or her in the nearest hook and will go to gens and look after my the next chase. Waiting in front of the hook after your first down is dumb and will let all the time required to survivors to finish fixing gens. However, if you see scratches near your hook don't go away there is someone near trying to rescue him or her.\n\nWhen I know people are already \"sitting\" next to the open door waiting for me to go for them, if it's too far away and I know the game is over, I just press \"windows\" and stay afk in the game while doing something useful on my computer.\n\nDon't try to chase someone forever by frustration or by only objective to catch him or her.\nIt's not productive, they are so many survivors with 1000h and more  that  can easily loop your for ages. Sure you will finally be able to catch him but you will waste time and let survivors doing gens without pressure. At the end nobody win and survivors will get bored and won't enjoy the game and you will loose without having fun.\n\nIf you begin to get mad, just wait until the game is over and don't use chat for spreading your frustration and anger. Just quit the game, do something else, remember it's just a game. \n\nI would also highly recommend to watch videos to understand how to \"counter\" looping survivors as a killer (I am still not able to do it  but I am learning it :))\n\nTo conclude, I recommend that game but  you will need to be aware that if you want to have fun, you ll need to respect each other and never focus on toxicity and troll. Just play fair without having the objective to kill everyone at all cost by face camping the whole game.\n\nSee you on the game.\nHave fun","timestamp_created":1610717271,"timestamp_updated":1610993437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84727195","author":{"steamid":"76561198795577542","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":34934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23091,"last_played":1649346832},"language":"german","review":"---{Grafik}---\n☐ Du wirst vergessen wie die Realität aussieht\n☐ Schön\n☑  Gut\n☐ Dezent\n☐ Schlecht\n☐ Guck nicht zu lange drauf\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n☐ Süchtig machend wie Heroin\n☑ Sehr gut\n☐ Gut\n☐ Es ist nur ein Gameplay\n☐ Naja\n☐ Die Wand anzustarren ist besser\n☐ Tu es einfach nicht\n\n---{Audio}---\n☐ Ohrgasmus\n☐ Sehr Gut\n☑ Gut\n☐ Nicht zu schlecht\n☐ Schlecht\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{PC Voraussetzungen}---\n☐ Guck erstmal ob Paint läuft\n☐ Toaster PC\n☑ Lowend PC\n☐ Midend PC\n☐ Highend PC\n☐ Frag NASA nach einem Computer\n\n---{Schwierigkeit}---\n☐ Drück einfach nur ‚A‘\n☐ Einfach\n☑ Gehirn ist erforderlich\n☐ Einfach zu lernen / Schwer zu meistern\n☐ Schwer\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Story}---\n☐ Nie gespielt\n☑ Es gibt keine\n☐ Herumfliegende Texte und Töne\n☐ Lohnt sich nur mit DLC's\n☐ Gut\n☐ Faszinierend\n☐ Es ersetzt dein Leben\n\n---{Spielzeit}---\n☐ Man kann sich währenddessen einen Kaffee kochen\n☐ Kurz\n☐ Durchschnittlich\n☐ Lang\n☑ Bis zur Unendlichkeit und noch viel weiter\n\n---{Bugs}---\n☐ Niemals davon gehört\n☑ Kleinere Bugs\n☐ Kann nervig werden\n☐ Wie Assassin‘s Creed: Unity\n☐ Hol dir ein Bugspray, oder mehrere.
