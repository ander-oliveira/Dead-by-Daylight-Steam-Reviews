I have over 2.5k hours (could've been more if I didn't play other games) which means I have a fairly good understanding of the game. I've been through all the updates, bad decisions and game breaking bugs. I mainly play Killer and try to play all of them instead of one. I do also trying to play a mixture so Solo Queue and Survive With Friends. Now onto the revised review. \n\nThe game is horribly imbalanced with a meta that has only just been shifted ever so slightly with the recent chapters. Your time as a new player will be a pain and more so if you plan on playing killer first.  Most of the community expect people to play a certain way and if you don't then you have to be bad. They shun people for not fully understanding every mechanic of the game and make fun of you if you do one thing wrong. \n\nGameplay when you start getting into the \"high MMR\" is heavily meta based where if you just try to do a unique build for fun it will most often mean your demise. Survivor meta is fully of second chance to cancel out their mistakes. Killer meta is fully of slow down to cancel out how fast gens can go.\n\nMMR (match making rating) is entirely hollow. The only thing the system counts for your MMR is if you escaped or died as a Survivor or how many kills you got as a Killer. In theory it should work as more escapes or kills mean you are doing something right. In practise it is not so much. \nAs survivor you can do all the generators or loop the killer for the whole game and end up being killed and in the eyes of the MMR system and the Devs that made it, that isn't skilful. \nThe same with killer, you can have everyone on their last hook but they end up all escaping which then results in the system downgrading your MMR even though you have done well.\n\nThis then causes some frustration playing the game, mainly as Survivor. It results in you playing with teammates who don't fully understand the game. Causing you to then be stuck in a loop of having downgraded MMR due to the fact that you will keep dying based on mistakes the other Survivors do. \nOr it could mean that the higher your MMR is the more likely you are going to be going against Killers who tunnel and face camp as those plays result in easier kills which in turn means their MMR is higher. This then also means that Killers who play more fair and skilful will have lower MMR due to them taking risks for fun rather then boring plays to secure a kill.\n\nTo wrap up, if your want to win your games will be boring and if you want to play for fun your games will be hard. It doesn't matter what you do in the match, all that matters is if you escaped as Survivor or killed as Killer.","timestamp_created":1555372180,"timestamp_updated":1644739763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50152342","author":{"steamid":"76561198163861224","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1618322591},"language":"romanian","review":"Very addictive game!

I broke 2 chairs , smashed them with my axe , hammer and knife and threw them off the window , turned my laptop into an Ipad , never smashed a mouse so hard in my life  i turned it into a mousepad. This game is buggy as hell with unbelivable hit boxes , you can get 360 no scoped by almost any Killer . Most of the Killers are OP as f**k , many of them having perks that basically ruin your life as a Survivor . I am in a mental hospital right now , suffering from PTSD because of this game . \n\nEDIT : \nSo , after a few more hours , i  decided to give  another chance to this game , WRONG MOVE , still getting slapped on the back by a huge fat ass samurai with anger issues , ofc i rage a lot and smash my children  , keyboard and whatever's left of my gaming rig , i lost my voice many times because of this game , i scream like an assfucked demon everytime i get slapped on the back while vaulting through a window and start cutting my wrists , 10/10 would recommend this game to my dying enemies so i can hear their screams in hell . I'll come back after a few more wasted hours.  \n\nEDIT:\nGame is called Dead by Daylight because you'll be dead by daylight after commiting sudoku because this game is so fucking unplayable , and most of the killers are professional sprinters and runners , faster than Usain Bolt ,  i don't even know why i bother to hide because some fucker always got the scent of my smelly sweaty feet and knows i'm hiding under the closer and comes to destroy my butt .
