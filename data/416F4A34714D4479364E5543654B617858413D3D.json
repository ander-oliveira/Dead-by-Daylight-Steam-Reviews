Im großen und ganzen ist das Spiel sehr unbalanced. Dabei ist hier das Wort unbalanced mit Vorsicht zu genießen, denn die meisten, die das sagen, sind irgendwelche Rang 20 Scrubs, die generell gar keine Ahnung von irgendwelchen Mechaniken haben, die das Spiel vorallem für die Killer bietet. Aber ja, das Spiel ist trotz alle dem wirklich gut. Es macht Spaß, einige Runden sind mit Spannung geladen, bei einigen Runden fässt man sich einfach nur an den Kopf. Eine perfekte Mischung meines Empfindens und derzeit mein Favorit aus dem Jahr 2016. \n\nNun, während des ganzen Spielens sind mir viele Dinge aufgefallen, die trotz alle dem noch gefixed werden müssen. \n\nSurvivor: \n- ich lagge. Warum auch immer, mein Ping ist konstant gut, ich dürfte mich eigentlich nicht durch die Welt teleportieren. Das hat mir in so vielen Situationen einen Pip und die ganze Runde versaut.\n-  bei dem selbstständigen Befreien vom Haken kommt manchmal die Erfolgsanimation, man hängt allerdings immer noch dran.\n- nachdem ich eine Kiste geöffnet und gelooted habe werde ich einige Meter wegteleportiert\n\nKiler:\n- die Leuten buggen wie ein Stadtfest auf der Schulter rum und man sieht nichts\n- ich hebe jemanden vor dem Fenster auf und stehe auf einmal hinter dem Fenster\n- die Animation des Aufhängens kommt und der Typ rennt einfach weg (hier bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob es sich doch um einen Hack handeln könnte)\n- jemand ist vor einem umgeschmissenen Holzblock.

If your a survivor you have to get generators up and running to open the gates to escape from the level and if your a killer you need to stop them. There's more generators then needed on the map to power up the two gates that then can be opened to escapse so people can't camp. Yay! Also I feel the game it balanced well and a nice selection of killers with different abilitys.  There's also progression which everyone likes such as perks, consumables and a kinda like talent tree. \n\nOnly con for me is mics have been disabled for some reason.

Doch ein Killer streift ebenfalls durch die Lande und dieser möchte bloß seine Opfer an dem nächsten Hacken baumeln sehen.\n\nDead by Daylight hat (derzeit) zwei Spielmodi: Das Spielen mit bis zu 5 Freunden in einer Offline-Loby oder das Online-Spiel, welches von einem Spieler, der die Rolle des Killers übernimmt, gehostet wird und vier zufälligen Spielern, die dem Spiel als Opfer joinen.\nBeide Modi machen auf Dauer richtig Spaß und treiben den Herzschlag so richtig an! :)\nAuch, wenn es in Online-Spielen keine Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten mit anderen Spielern gibt, ist es doch immer wieder erstaunlich, wie man es trotzdem schafft, sich irgendie zu verständigen. Daher finde ich, braucht das Spiel auch keine Möglichkeit per Voicechat oder ähnlichem zu reden, da es so die Spannung deutlich erhöht, wenn man eventuelle Reaktionen der Mitspieler nur annähernd deuten kann.\nDas Spielen mit Freunden macht ebenfalls richtig viel Spaß, trotz der Tatsache, dass es in diesem Spielmodus keine Blutpunkte gibt, die ein Charakter zum Leveln und Freischalten neuer Fähigkeiten benötigt.

I've seen the game in worse condition than anyone else has. I know every bug that once festered in this game and have seen how the game has developed since it released. I believe my opinion should be a good influence to those on the edge about purchasing this game. without further ado, here's my take on the game.\n\nThe current state of this game is unplayable for survivors. Don't attempt to play as survivor. Developers have their heads up their gaping butt sphincter, (remember, this is serious.) and do not take feedback of any kind. They most likely will fix many issues, as they always have, but if you intend to play with friends this is definitely the wrong game for you until further notice. Playing against a new player as a killer versus a veteran high ranked player you will find a very challenging match no matter what perk you attempt.\n\nHowever, if you intend to play killer, thankfully they've increased your reach on hit, so you should be able to get beyond rank 20 very effortlessly. I've been sitting steadily on rank 1 (the top rank) quite comfortably since the update. This will be a lot of fun for you, like myself.\n\nThe new interface took some time to get used to, but it's not bad, just make sure to reduce the scale to 70% immediately. playing 100% scale just makes everything feel worse.\n\nI'll update this review when things have changed, but it's unlikely for at least a couple of months. There's a ton of issues with perks, hit scan, and movement that make the game unbalanced. It's quite unfortunate that the game was so playable until a day ago. Rollbacks aren't this developer's thing which is why I suggest you don't support the company. Again, at their own pace, they will fix these issues and I'm sure it will be better than before, just that I disagree with how the implemented every part of this new update without resolving these issues before hand.

They are so afraid of releasing \"survive with friends\", that they ignore the problem of how the killers behave and once you are caught, you dont have a chance to survive. I dont think this is the way they imagined this game. Its just frustrating.\n\nGame is not bad but this issue is way to heavy to ignore it and it ruins all the fun you could have with this game...","timestamp_created":1468110162,"timestamp_updated":1468110162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507692337036132813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24219682","author":{"steamid":"76561198052324412","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":86485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":288,"playtime_at_review":68800,"last_played":1660602650},"language":"english","review":"i love this game so much, its my favourite","timestamp_created":1468109300,"timestamp_updated":1609073107,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24219362","author":{"steamid":"76561198257895608","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1329,"last_played":1641755266},"language":"english","review":"This game is great.

This is the first time I've written a review for a steam game, but I've felt pretty scorned by this game once the honeymoon phase had passed.\n\nThe first part of the game is very thrilling when everyone is lvl 19 and 20. People make mistakes, people freak out, and it generally plays I think the way the development team had advertised it. There is one powerful killer that stalks his prey until all survivors have been eliminated or have escaped.\n\nIn my opinion it should be very rare that survivors escape. Survivors should be able to gain decent rank depending on how well they struggled to the bitter end, but escaping is something they've made far too easy. \n\nAs the game progresses into the lower ranks we find that the survivors have been equiped with so many tools and perks that there is little reason to fear the killer. Very often perks will allow them to easily identify where the killer is and which direction they're coming from with aboslutely no trade-off. Conversely the killer gains perks that mostly assist the killer once a player has been caught or has been damaged. As fun as the perks may be for the killer (like insidious perk for ambushing players), they don't assist with finding the survivors. So when the survivor has spine chill and premonition, you're never going to find a good survivor purely because the perks become their new heartbeat monitor. \n\nI was lucky enough as a survivor to get spinechill 3 very very early. My win-rate skyrocketed on that perk alone because I could leave the area whilst my teammates had no clue why I was leaving. I knew the killer was looking my way (cloaked or not) and I could prepare to hide far in advance. This immediately kills the fear in beind hunted and just turns it into a little game of watch the spine chill detector; patience will win you most of the games at that point.\n\nThe perks for killer that tell you when a survivor is within 32 meters, and the one that allows crows to communicate with you are not terribly effective as a 32 meter radius could waste all your time looking. The crows only seem to tell you when someone is AFK. \n\nOne of the big killers for the game once you go into the lower ranks is window vaulting exploit. There's currently no cooldown on window hopping and most fo the maps are set up to allow survivors to lead the killer on an infinite loop through windows and doors where unless you're the trapper, you can't counter. You can kill all the other survivors then play infinite loop with the last survivor until one of you gets bored. THIS IS TERRIBLE GAME DESIGN. Immersion is lost, and the survivor gets all the power. Players have been known to farm killers for points and have even been know to chase the killer to egg them into following them through an infinite loop. Until this is fixed I play the game less and less. \n\nI would really like to see most of the survivor perks go away, and really limit the perks for the killer as well. Things like Insidious, Hardended Grip *I think it's called*, and monstrous shrine are passives that only help you if you catch a survivor through a successful chase. I dislike the perks that make you completely OP in a categoy (ie. one hit knockdowns when exit gates are open). \n\nThis game is without a doubt going through an experimental phase. If you want to get yourself frustrated over t-bagging survivors that will stand on the other side of the window and crouchspam and self-heal then by all means come and play, but I think folks are looking for survival horror. Nothing horrifying about cocky survivors- the ball should always be in the killers court or there is no fear.","timestamp_created":1468105865,"timestamp_updated":1468105865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545856714248657227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24218667","author":{"steamid":"76561198271862135","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1654657619},"language":"english","review":"needs to add invite then join\n","timestamp_created":1468105277,"timestamp_updated":1468105277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24218577","author":{"steamid":"76561198153954760","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3402,"last_played":1559512962},"language":"turkish","review":"yapıcağınız multiplayer sistemini skiyim aqdumun gerizekalıları","timestamp_created":1468104925,"timestamp_updated":1468104925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24218509","author":{"steamid":"76561198046840427","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1088,"last_played":1525748354},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito Bom esse jogo so tenho 110 minutos ja to no level 2 da loirinha e do killer da moto serra e mt viciante\nFalta ainda um chat para survivors dentro do jogo de voz/texto \nNOTA:8,5","timestamp_created":1468104681,"timestamp_updated":1468104681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24218494","author":{"steamid":"76561198041059881","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1471650610},"language":"english","review":"Cant find a game it SUCKS","timestamp_created":1468104620,"timestamp_updated":1468104620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432063132524490356","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24218451","author":{"steamid":"76561198028438902","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1516188630},"language":"german","review":"Ein Spiele das echt spass mach und auch,\nsein spass behält.\nAber wie bei jedem spiel solte mann es in massen spielen,\nda sonst der spass um schlägt in. \"zu oft gespielt langweilig\"\nAer Gennerall spielens wert.","timestamp_created":1468104475,"timestamp_updated":1468104475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24218216","author":{"steamid":"76561198172689295","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1621420947},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego no lo puedo iniciar por un error(DX11 feature level 11.0 os required to run the engine) si alguien me puede decir como solucionar este error que me lo diga por favor","timestamp_created":1468103525,"timestamp_updated":1468103525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qMDy6NUCeKaxXA=="}
