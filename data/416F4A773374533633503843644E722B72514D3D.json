I cannot stress this any further, if by any chance you still want to play this game, play only with friends that already have the game, do not encourage others to purchase this, it's only fun at the start and that immediately goes down an unfortunate drain, Killers are completely f over, survivors will always win (unless the killer chooses to camp everyone, + tedious leveling system that makes you want to die, there are plenty of other fun games and Roblox even has a game similar to this, (in fact nearly ripped off) That is actually better, also there will be no dogshit human beings who think they are the best for playing on an advantaged side, (mind my spelling im tired and pissed) And here are some ways they can improve the game (if they even care)\n\n1. Previously Said Roblox Game Literally had a anti Camping mechanism where the  process will be halted if said killer was near by, while trash killers will still find a way to camp, this would make it harder to.\n\n2. I f i want to post a picture of pay to play, this would be it, most movie killers are walled behind a while cheap, yet noticeable paywall, this includes their perks as well, same thing with survivors, and what makes this worse is they tend to have some of the best perks in the game,\n\n3. Give the Generators more time, holy crap was this annoying, my main tactic when i play as killer is to go to the farthest generator as your maps tends to be quite predictable, however every time i do such and chase one person, by the time the chase begins a generator has already been finished and your left going wtf?, and not in a good way, also for being a killer, you feel slow and lumbering despite being somewhat faster than the player, (i like playing as Oni, that could be just the fact that he is slow or something, and if so disregard such complaint) by lengthening the time of generators it could give the hunter some chance to counter rather than just feel like if they dont constantly monitor the generators, they will lose, (which is already a losing battle.\n\n3. give people access to the purchasable character perks, i know then no one will want to purchase your characters then but unfortunately thats not a good wall to have in the first place, as unfortunately those perks tend to be the absolute best, so you fuq over the people who just wanna fork over a 20 and play with randos (which I do not recommend)\n\n4.your pass is dogshit, just like everyone else's pass, We may give Fortnite shit for their battle pass but honestly their battle pass is one of the best out there and continues to be, and thats because you potentially could earn more than what you spend,( you fork a 10 and you have the potentioal to recieve 1500 V bucks which is about 15 bucks irl think about that) unfortunately just like every game now with said pass, you copied it but with a shittier design, less cosmetics, nothing new to the table (cosmetic wise not gameplay wise), and you dont have the potential to earn it all back, like everyone else who makes such a pass,, the pass is there to encourage playing and rewards playing the game, most now are just purchase packages with little to no rewards,\n\nHonestly i want to go through more however  i want to go to bed, and i just wan to sum it all up...\n\ntmi: fix yo game, and improve on the things that clearly need to be improved, i dont want another struggle design, i want  a balance design. dont purchse or encourage to purchase unless you already have friends who play it.","timestamp_created":1648106549,"timestamp_updated":1648106549,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112735238","author":{"steamid":"76561198999967042","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14418,"last_played":1653181177},"language":"german","review":"Killer > Surv aber einfach geiles Game xoxo","timestamp_created":1648105353,"timestamp_updated":1648105353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112734892","author":{"steamid":"76561199001776900","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":3002,"last_played":1660262310},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay itself is fun at it's core for both survivor and killer, but the current meta rn sucks the soul out of this game.

I'm being honest, I love this game amazing base gameplay, great licenses and even better original killer design.\n\nWhere this game falls apart is everything else, the meta hasn't changed in nearly 6 years and has become extremely stale. The devs have no idea how to play their own game and have expressed on multiple ocassions they have no idea what skill is. To win as killer you have to play as a complete asshole (Camping, tunnelling etc) because of the fact that survivors immediately have so many things in their favour, such as spawns, gen spread, pallet spread. Patches and balance changes only come out every 6 weeks, and they are so slow to fix the many many bugs this game has. \n\nI would love to reccomend this game, but due to the underlying issues, I unfortunately cannot. Maybe if they fix at least a few of these problems, I will be inclined to change this

community is exceptionally toxic, playing as the survivor and being camp by a low ranked killers, is really something, especially by getting camp and they keep hitting you with their weapons, also the survivor is the same as the killers, especially when one survivor DC, they all just straight up quit the match and left me by myself, what a fun game to play\"\n\n\"but hey atleast they giving us a bunch of licensed DLC lol, also fuck you Netflix for taking stranger things back\"\n\n\"Now, how I rate it\"\n\nIs it worth your time: Yeah if yah want to just fix generators, open gate, and play hide and seek, or just basically kill anyone if you like,\n\nGame play: It's fun, but bro fix the hit box, huntress just straight up snipe me even tho I'm behind the wall, also balance the game, some killers is unbalance compared to the survivor, and some survivor is unbalance compared to the killers, might be the perks lol,\n\nGame modes: only one game mode available, I want more, but knowing the community is Toxic af, I'll just shut my mouth to please the community,\n\nMechanics: be an engineer, that's all, or you can be a psychopath, and kill everyone for your own pleasure,\n\nHit box: BAD\n\nControls: I may say that the controls is decent, it's smooth, and I actually don't have a problem with it,\n\nGraphics: It's decent, not a AAA kind of Graphics, but it's good,\n\nCharacters: I really like the Licensed Characters behaviour picked, and also the original characters they made, Cheryl main here btw,\n\nPrice: decent, it's not around AAA kind of price, I will say you can actually buy this game, it's cheap enough for a viable option to play an Asymmetrical Horror Game, and it's famous one of all the games that have the same concept as DBD, except all the free games, but hey atleast DBD looks decent for the graphics and gameplay, even tho I been critical to it lol,\n\nCommunity: Decent, but TOXIC,\n\nFinal Thoughts: ehhhhh.... it's a decent game,\n\nOverall Scores: 7/10\n\n\"why??, they haven't release a licensed chapters that I want, oh wait, Sadako Rising is the latest DLC...... and it's my favorite horror movie of all time.....\"\n\n\"NVM, I changed my mind, 10/10 just because Sadako is in the game, good game, please buy it :>>>>>\"\n\nRecommend: HECK YES!!!!\n\n\"but for seriousness, yeah I love the game, I bought like 10 DLC now, what more can yah say
