Always changing, always improving, always shaking things up with new killers/perks/survivors, I def recommend giving it a go.","timestamp_created":1652071763,"timestamp_updated":1652071763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115190736","author":{"steamid":"76561198111950814","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":64568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5819,"playtime_at_review":25325,"last_played":1660570028},"language":"koreana","review":"게임은 참 잘만듬 핵만좀 잡아주면 좋을텐데 ㅜㅜ","timestamp_created":1652071148,"timestamp_updated":1652071148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115190255","author":{"steamid":"76561199273781638","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":766,"playtime_at_review":8038,"last_played":1660542493},"language":"english","review":"10/10 game is so bad, yet we all still play it 6 years later and 5K HOURS","timestamp_created":1652069998,"timestamp_updated":1652069998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115189955","author":{"steamid":"76561197997241746","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":7325,"last_played":1659462813},"language":"english","review":"its shit","timestamp_created":1652069322,"timestamp_updated":1652069322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115189822","author":{"steamid":"76561199100450285","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4798,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1660601690},"language":"english","review":"Game is buggy as hell but everything else is pretty good!!","timestamp_created":1652069043,"timestamp_updated":1652069043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115189509","author":{"steamid":"76561199275913885","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1658208463},"language":"thai","review":"เข้าเกมไม่ได้เลย บอกเกิดข้อผิดพลาดทำไมเป็นงั้นอ่ะ เกมอื่นนี่ก็เล่นได้ปกตินะ เราก็ลองเข้าเกมมาหลายวันแล้วก็ไม่ได้สักทีเสริชร์กูเกิ้ลก็แล้วแต่แก้ไม่ได้เลย ถ้าเกมมันไม่เสียตังจะไม่บ่นเลยนะแต่นี่มันเสียตังอ่ะะะ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1652068429,"timestamp_updated":1652068429,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513888895511627197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115189428","author":{"steamid":"76561198109972470","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":12855,"last_played":1660522756},"language":"spanish","review":"recomendadiisimo para jugar con amigos y si no, tambien como asesino solitario despiadado x3","timestamp_created":1652068252,"timestamp_updated":1652068252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115188916","author":{"steamid":"76561198246802172","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7361,"last_played":1655348941},"language":"schinese","review":"  游戏整体来说还不错，画风与氛围感都打造得很好，游戏初期竞技游戏性很强，无论是玩屠夫还是逃生者都很考验策略，只可惜游戏运营越来越将游戏娱乐化，加入了很多过于背离游戏初始设定的东西......\n  在游戏中还是能找到很多乐趣，但是已不像从前那样有趣，夸张的技能与道具只会让人感到越玩越疲乏了。","timestamp_created":1652067087,"timestamp_updated":1652067087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qea304ADdMu0twM="}
