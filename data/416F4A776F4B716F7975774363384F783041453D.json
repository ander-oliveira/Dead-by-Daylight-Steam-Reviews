On the other hand, the Devs. should step in and fix this. \n      Also, if you read builds and forums on this game, you will understand what the nuance of \"toxic builds\" with regards to \n      killers means, it means there is no chance to win... \n- Replay value:\n   - 0/10\n      - What do you expect, it's a grind fest. There are really no other game modes, and it's constantly one sided, unless you \n      play with a friend, and even then, it's still just a grind fest with a one dimensional throw away game play concept.\n----\nPros:\n- Challenging\n- Interesting concept\n- Everyone DC'ed, killer felt bad, and we just screwed around, let me escape, was funny\nCons:\n- Odds are constantly stacked against you if you are a survivor\n- You can never play as the killer, because everyone wants to play the killer, so que is bogged down for being a killer\n- DLC crap, the base game only gives you about 1/3 the potential characters to play with, both for killers and survivors\n- It's honestly not that fun, being a survivor would be more fun, if there were more chances to escape the killer in a chase or more chances to sneak around, effectively, but good luck with that, the map is so open even crouching you can be seen stupidly easy, especially since the killer is faster than you, has a higher view radius, and can down you with two hits, or just out right kill you with certain builds and perks\n- Perk and bloodweb system is stupid, you have to grind, no way around that, it is boring, humiliating, and not fun AT ALL, constant games of being tunneled/focused down and killed immediately, and then, to start all over again, just to get any bloodpoints to try and lvl up and get more perks, so one day, maybe you can actually stop the infinite losing streaks\n- Perk system to unlock global char. perks is way too long, needs to be faster, WAY faster, I, along with many others, don't have time to grind 10 to even 20 hours a week just to unlock some basic decent perks, that really do nothing, and then to be downed constantly as a survivor, it's not fun, it's grindy.\n- Lose ratio roughly so far, 8/10 lose all the time, barely ever win, only way is if you hide, everyone dies and then just escape, which is a scum strategy anyways, but have seen i t\n- It's not fun, at all, killers are way too stacked against the survivors\n- The objectives for survivors are so boring and one dimensional, generators, and then escape latch to open escape doors, that's literally it, if the killer decides to just be a jerk, the killer can just stop and stall all generators, and then camp either the generators or the hooked players that are dying, killing off players one by one, or just generally camping, which you can do nothing about, because remember, you are slower, and easily downed through focusing and tunneling.\n- There is a common theme I read around forums on here, \"toxic killers\", it seems the killers are so OP, that there needs to be an unoffical community just to curb killers from abusing their perks, powers and abilities from just killing everyone immediately in the first 5 mins.\n---\nConclusion:\n- I rather regret buying this game, I got onto the hype train watching streamers and thought, \"well that looks like fun\", wrong, it's boring, grindy, and hellish, good luck when the killer has every horrible perk to make your life hell, and your teammates just screw with you. It's literally a grind game... that's it, get perks and grind, and not even good perks. I still don't understand how the perks work with regards to trying to get global perks. The game is confusing, in a very bad way.\n- 3/10 (Would not recommend, unless they make being a survivor more fun, fix perks, and balance the gameplay elements)","timestamp_created":1566005895,"timestamp_updated":1566005895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54655695","author":{"steamid":"76561198838546304","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":33369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20390,"last_played":1642250658},"language":"turkish","review":"Gerilim dolu dakikalar sizi bekliyor çok iyi mantığı var oyunun sürükleyici ve etkileyici oyuna başladıkça daha fazla oynama isteği veriyor.

Tenho 3k de horas e por isso resolvi refazer essa análise desse jogo que continua em Beta desde que lançou:\n\n- Primeiro que o jogo já começa todo errado em configurações minímas. Aquelas ali NÃO servem para esse jogo, pura enganação. Com elas seu jogo vai travar, vai perder qualidade tanto na estética quanto na jogabilidade. É sem condições.\n- Segundo, a empresa é extremamente incapaz de se relacionar com seus CLIENTES de forma clara e e educada. Na maioria das vezes são mal-educados, são grosseiros e sempre respondem com um \"eu não posso fazer nada\". E eu lá posso? Não, vocês deveriam poder fazer algo.\n- Terceiro, é um jogo que se você não jogar no mínimo 4h por dia, você jamais vai ter chance de adquirir conhecimento para enfrentar pessoas que já jogam há ANOS. O Matching game é simplesmente HORROROSO e isso porque nem é um jogo competitivo, mas os players jogam como se dependessem da vida e não da diversão.\n- Quarto, os players desse jogo são ASQUEROSOS na sua maioria esmagadora. Seja surv, seja killer, é NOJENTO. Vc termina uma partida onde você foi provocado até seu psicológico ficar abalado e ainda depois ter coisas racistas, machistas, homofobicas, xenofobicas, e todo e qualquer tipo de intolerância. O que vc faz? Denuncia e espera algo. NADA ACONTECE. A empresa tapa os olhos com uma peneira, fingindo ver e dando suas posições contra, mas na hora de denuncias eles não fazem N A D A. \n- Quinto é o descaso com seu público que GASTA DINHEIRO e mantém o ENGAJAMENTO do jogo desde os meados de 2016/17. Essas pessoas com mais de 3k de horas mereciam no mínimo alguma coisas diferente na hora de jogar e não tem NADA. O jogo continua praticamente o mesmo desde que foi lançado. Chega uma hora que não é diversão, é VÍCIO. O jogo trás o que de novidade? Perks? Roupinhas? Não tem nada de novidade fora isso, é o mesmo looping infinito de afazeres. Mas em alguns eventos eles fazem algo legal e depois voltam a mesmice de SEMPRE.\n- Sexto e último é o descaso com TODOS os jogadores. TODA att, TODA, um bug novo vem junto. É exaustivo você saber que existe uma PTB, algo para ter os testes e a empresa simplesmente deixar TODOS os problemas serem lançados e só depois arrumar. Isso quando arrumam rápido, mas teve bug que demorou 3 MESES pra ser concertado.\n\n\nFora tudo isso de negativo, o jogo é ótimo para tentar jogar com amigos apenas pra descontração. Mas não aconselho, não mais. Vc pode acabar se viciando e mantendo um looping irrelevante de tempo em um jogo onde vc vai passar mais dor de cabeça com os players e empresa, do que se divertindo de verdade. É isto, bjs ;')\n\n((mantive o recomendo, apenas pra manter as reações kkkkkkjj))","timestamp_created":1565993642,"timestamp_updated":1638062387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586555421352386475","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54653744","author":{"steamid":"76561198981386823","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1592786280},"language":"italian","review":"Bel gioco, anche se a cercare le partite mentre sei un killer ci mette veramente troppo","timestamp_created":1565992800,"timestamp_updated":1565992800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54653684","author":{"steamid":"76561198050615387","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":52270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11758,"last_played":1656383759},"language":"english","review":"Picture this; A murderer is trailing right behind you.

EX just played a match against the pig. shes silent but can do a dash strike that instantly downs you, shes fast, she can put the mask on you so even if you get unhooked and dont die if she isnt camping with her silence and strike, you have to spend the ENTIRE match searching for the right puzzle that you have to skill check and then hope the WHOLE time that you dont run intro her, bleed out, or have the trap go off all while you cant really focus on generators... like come the f on dude thats complete bull. and then there are killers like wraith that are cool and fun tyo play but are complete trash because all you cvan do is be KINDA invisible and then wait to be visible and hit them hopefully.","timestamp_created":1565961093,"timestamp_updated":1571136746,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54646361","author":{"steamid":"76561198332550801","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":10874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1625619638},"language":"polish","review":"One of the best games I ever played.","timestamp_created":1565960948,"timestamp_updated":1565960948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54645935","author":{"steamid":"76561198077635310","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":280156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1800,"playtime_at_review":125879,"last_played":1660602667},"language":"french","review":"Après avoir passer plus de 2 000 heures de jeu sur Dead by daylight, voilà mon avis sur ce jeu :\n- Si vous aimez jouer à des jeux avec de l'action ou de la discrétion, vous pourrez l'expérimenter du côté des survivants.\n- Si vous aimez chasser ou faire peur, vous pourrez l'expérimenter en tant que tueur qui pour ma part est très amusant.\n\nChacun à sa façon de jouer, et si vous aimez les jeux qui vous donne de l'adrénaline Dead by daylight est pour ma part un bon choix, mais après je suis qu'une recommandation, je vous conseillerai de regarder des vidéos sur ce jeux pour vous faire une idée de ce que c'est.","timestamp_created":1565959072,"timestamp_updated":1565959072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54645922","author":{"steamid":"76561197970768754","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":107390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":845,"playtime_at_review":21623,"last_played":1659722985},"language":"english","review":"I've played this game for about 1-2 months regularly.

Those are the most toxic killers there are, face-camping, tunneling and after the game they will spew annoying filth out of their keyboards. I use HEX: Delete russians from my games. but apparently it's bugged?\n\nFor survivors, these premade teams looping around objects ( no problem with this though ), and teabagging the living cr#p out of you every chance they get. After their easy \"genrush\" they will continue this toxic behaviour on the games chat after match.\n\nNo dedicated servers so some servers are literally unplayable and you will die when suddenly killer just appears next to you and beats the living shit out of you and you die. Also lag-switching is a thing when the killer is losing. RIP rank.\n\nSo if you're willing to risk your physical and your mental health for this videogame, go for it.

I enjoy this game and it's simple objectives, which is confusing to me as I get tired of repetitive actions when it comes to video games. Whether it's completing generators and attempting to win chases as survivor, or downing and sacrificing survivors as killer, I thoroughly enjoy this game for the challenges it brings. \n\nWith a variety of perks, items, addons, survivors, killers and their cosmetics, such simple mechanics can either become easier or harder, depending on your playstyle. I enjoy playing as a challenge, and have started re-doing adepts as survivor. \n\nedit: it bad\n\nMy favourite part of the game however would be grinding for bloodpoints. The game rewards you for how well you play, as well as offerings and perks, so it is satisfying to play the game for hours one day and then deposit all those bloodpoints into bloodwebs to get more perks and eventually prestige.\n\nThere may be bugs, and I know from design experience, bugs are a common factor between most games. They're irritating, but hard to remove due to the random occurrences or complicated steps to re-create the bug. I don't get annoyed by bugs as much as I used to, as I remember game creation is a hard feat, even for massive teams. As well as this, the developers attempt to push out weekly cosmetics as well as patches to reduce the number of bugs in the game, so it's hard for them to keep players interested in the game with new content as well as fixing older content.\n\nThere was a reason I left the community out of the game review, because the game itself, nor the developers are responsible for how the community act, no matter how much the killers and survivors make them out to be. I respect those survivors and killers who play fair, and play the game as if it was a game, that goes for winning and losing the game. It isn't a competition, you don't lose some massive prize over not getting your \"deserved\" win, so how is a game so crucial to some people? I'm not going to be a hypocrite, I've taken this game as a toxic person before, but after so long playing the game I've changed my mindset. Toxicity on this game is infectious, you spread it to the killers and survivors you play with. Whether it's intentionally playing unfairly to make survivors or killers give you salt for some weird addiction you have, or you yourself are leaving salt to satisfy some sort of goal in your own mind. I'll say it here, it's a game, get over your losses, they don't matter, no matter how much you or the people you go against make it out to be.\n\n(Sorry for that last rant, had to make a point of it, before the community end up destroying this game)","timestamp_created":1565952084,"timestamp_updated":1652300101,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489285707473754883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54644268","author":{"steamid":"76561198002368738","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1307,"last_played":1630452148},"language":"german","review":"I like this game!

Nothing is clear about it. And, this creature, the Entity has affected normal, classic people, who've been through a lot more than anyone can even imagine.\nSome of them have died, or have almost died, and the Entity was the only chance to live. Some didn't die, but the Entity has taken them and used them.\nNone of those have tried or learnt, how to escape the Entity itself, so, they work with it. They bring her Survivors, people, to Sacrifice them for it. That way, the Killers have to Hook those Survivors, instead of Killing them.\n\n\nSo, the Survivors have to repair the five Generators to give the Gates enough of a power to be opened. Once they open them, they can escape, but in the meantime, the Killer is hunting them. The Survivors can run, use windows, wooden Pallets, that can be dropped, (...), to escape the Killer.\nOnce they reach the area in one of the two Exit Gates, they've escaped the Realm, and have survived that day.\n\nThis should be enough for the basic informations about this game, but gameplay differs from them a bit, so, take it in mind.\n\nThe Developers are well aware, that the Survivors, those players, can use unarthorized third party programs, that gain an unfair advantage over the Killer - over the players without even being punished.\nThis game wasn't meant and isn't meant for voice communications, but because something went wrong, they've allowed them to use it.\nThey can't afford to make them as a bannable offense, as they may lose around 60 % or more of their whole playerbase, if they do so.\nIn short, even here is being applied a term, ''money > fun, fair-play.\n\nAnd, the most annoying part.\nThe Developers haven't learnt a thing. Instead, they've decided to give the majority of their, this, playerbase (to the Survivors) an option to leave, to disconnect from the match without any further punishment, except of not gaining any Bloodpoints from the match, that are being spend on upgrading your characters.\nThey can even keep their Items, that can cost from 3 000 Bloodpoints to 19 000 Bloodpoints. That has been acknowledged numerous times, no response, no action has been taken.\nYes, they've told us, that they do ban people for leaving very often, like 2/5 off of their total number of matches played, so, almost never.\n\nAnd, a part of it, that can basically rid out your feeling about winning the match, if you play as a Killer, that there's a Hatch, AKA black door., that spawns randomly in the map, whenever there's only one Survivor remaining.\nSo, the Survivors can easily just disconnect, and the last Survivor can escape without any effort, just because that player has decided to do so.\nIt's been acknowledged, and nothing has been done about it.\n\nAnd, a bit of a grimm part, why this game isn't suitable for people, who can't take being insulted, harrassed, threatened, getting wishes to die, their family to die, (...).\nThe community is mostly very annoying, thanks to the way they tend to behave. I don't mean to throw everyone into one single bag, but if you beat them in the match, they're able to spam on your profile page, into your comment wall, that you're, ..... I'll rather not elaborate it any further, as I'd have had to break the Steam rules in order to do that.\n\nThere is no Valve-Anti-Cheat ban, so, that's why none can be banned for using third party programs.\nThe game isn't that well optimized, so, you do need a bit better PC than the current average is nowadays, and that's it.\n\n\nThink twice before buying the license to be able to play this game.\nIt can really change yourself into a very annoying person, who can't take any criticism, who has to be angry, who can't control himself / herself, and so on.\n\nIf you're interested in what I've meant about the harrassments and insults, feel free to take a look at my profile page, at the comment wall of mine.\nYou'll see, what do I mean, and quickly understand, why I am so much against this game.\nYes, I do enjoy it to some degree, but every sinlge insult, no matter against whom it has been used kinda makes me feel, like I don't belong to this community.\nThe majority doesn't respect the PEGI recommended age, so, expect the same community as from Rocket League - A community, where you'll highly probably meet a five year old people, therefore kids, who can't control themselves.\nThe thing is, they don't care, that they're not even aware of how stupid they do look.\n\nI can't recommend this game, right now, as the harrassments and insults are normal, because the Developers can't afford to ban the majority of their whole community, the community of this game.\n\nIf you decide to join us, I do really wish you a lot of luck, but even more of health. Those people don't think before they act, they can change your whole yourself, if you play this game very often.

I would be waiting longer than I needed to just to ultimately fail. However, being a killer was quite the opposite. I immediately had survivors join my games and it would work fine. I tried restarting the Xbox, uninstalling and reinstalling, and nothing worked. So I switched to PC after being fed up with the lobby waiting times for survivor. After sacrificing and losing ALL of my DLC content on my Xbox and data, I queued in as Killer just to find out it was doing the same thing as it was with the survivor on my Xbox. I can instantly join a game as survivor but its the opposite with the killer. Hence it being vise versa to my Xbox. I bought this game here on Steam and other DLC content for killers just to find out I cannot play it. Really, I can't play half the game. I have always loved this game's plot and gameplay, but if I can't even play the killer then what's the point in buying it. I've heard things like how you have to rank up to get better killer queue times, but I should not have to resort to that option. That is quite sad. After a long time of trying to support this game, and relentlessly trying to play it, I have to say I'm done. Not only I am having this problem, but so many other people are too. Fix this problem and you have yourself a fantastic game to grind on and have fun with. Other than that, I do not recommend buying this game until the issue is fixed.

you.","timestamp_created":1565922451,"timestamp_updated":1565922451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54639224","author":{"steamid":"76561198295343072","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1594424616},"language":"spanish","review":"buenisimo","timestamp_created":1565920233,"timestamp_updated":1565920233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54639053","author":{"steamid":"76561198103539610","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":7779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3820,"last_played":1643938608},"language":"koreana","review":"공포

Ещё есть проблемы с пингом, т.к. у каждый игры хост не выделенный сервер, а маньяк, что способствует высокому пингу (доходило даже до 1000 пинга). Вывод: Игре дико не хватает баланса, обновлений, фиксящих баги, и собственных серверов. Думаю, что у разработчиков достаточно денег на это, т.к. DLC в игре много.\nЖелаю игре дальнейшего развития, т.к. задумка очень интересная. Рекомендую.\n\n\nP.s. Добавьте уже новые режимы. Игра вышла в далёком 2016 году, и по прежнему имеет всего 1 режим с починкой генераторов. Я считаю, что если разработчики начнут работать не только над DLC, но ещё и над самой игрой, то онлайн хорошо повысится, так как я думаю, что людям будет интересно это, и появится желание играть.","timestamp_created":1565883542,"timestamp_updated":1565883619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54631475","author":{"steamid":"76561198138718044","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11696,"last_played":1639477809},"language":"english","review":"Fun game.","timestamp_created":1565881937,"timestamp_updated":1565881937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54630759","author":{"steamid":"76561198361916938","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":234935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":548,"playtime_at_review":181934,"last_played":1660466386},"language":"japanese","review":"鯖視点で言えば現状トンキャン多すぎだよ！特にレイス！助け入るとすぐ戻ってばっか！赤帯なんてひどいもんだよ！それが現状！\n","timestamp_created":1565878941,"timestamp_updated":1627819646,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482233524322509766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54630535","author":{"steamid":"76561198377404185","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15513,"last_played":1600489037},"language":"tchinese","review":"very bad ,i always meet ATs.#remove ATs and SWF","timestamp_created":1565877888,"timestamp_updated":1565877888,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54630139","author":{"steamid":"76561198959858212","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":51,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1660381889},"language":"russian","review":"Очень чёткая игр!\n\n","timestamp_created":1565876105,"timestamp_updated":1565876105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54629897","author":{"steamid":"76561198264069357","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":9680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1639800104},"language":"brazilian","review":"massa\n","timestamp_created":1565874967,"timestamp_updated":1565874967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54629426","author":{"steamid":"76561198180583197","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":15528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14501,"last_played":1630157355},"language":"koreana","review":"썩은물들과 다인큐가 내려와서 귀여운 살인마유저 괴롭혀요..\n\n그러므로 다들 너스를 연습해서 저 놈들 모가지를 따도록해요","timestamp_created":1565872715,"timestamp_updated":1565872715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514182806015014648","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54629166","author":{"steamid":"76561198268461747","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":50257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":175,"playtime_at_review":11335,"last_played":1660322700},"language":"russian","review":"хyйня ебучая! мне нравится! пизжу, пжпжпжпж не играйте в эту залупу у меня друг сел и начал в деревья врезаться я ваще в ахуе сегодня в травму его отвез оказывается его тини в жопу ебал. тини камииин ииииииииииииииииин дотка","timestamp_created":1565871551,"timestamp_updated":1623851015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54628865","author":{"steamid":"76561198313630663","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":51399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33042,"last_played":1656751870},"language":"czech","review":"Při začátcích této hry ve mně vybouchla obrovská euforie a nadšení. Obrovská porce zábavy jak při hraní, tak při sledování Herdynova hraní na streamu (píše se rok 2016) po neustálém hraní 6h denně se hra stává stereotipem, ten ale oživuje switch na killera/survivora nebo hraní s přáteli, kteří jsou pro hru stejně zapálení jako já. Vývojáři hry se velmi snaží jak přídáváním nových postav tak změnou perků a grafiky, která se od 2016 velmi změnila. Co ale může být pro někoho odrazující je neustálé placení za nová dlc, chápu. Bohužel přidávání nových dlc a ignorování některých chyb hry značnou část hráčů odradilo. \n  Ve hře je neskutečně mnoho možností jak ji hrát a je jen na Vás jak ji chtít hrát budete, ale není to nic jednoduchého, takže všichni co nahrajou 30h, smažou to a napíšou všude jaká je to toxická sračka jsou pro mě kreténi, kteří by už nic kompetitivního hrá neměli. Toxicita je velkej problém hry, ale kdyby ve hře nebyla, tak by nebylo tolik srandy. Campení a tunnelování killerů je součástí hry, které není zakázano, stejně jak cvakání baterkou nebo t-bagování. \n   Za mě určitě nákup doporučuji, ale je to trochu střet zájmů, protože je to moje srdcovka <3","timestamp_created":1565869923,"timestamp_updated":1565869923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54627379","author":{"steamid":"76561198400385948","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":40505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40490,"last_played":1620195899},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾game无缘如故给我VAC 我寻思我也没开挂啊直接来个永封舒服了\n","timestamp_created":1565861696,"timestamp_updated":1565861696,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543408393859863281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoKqoyuwCc8Ox0AE="}
