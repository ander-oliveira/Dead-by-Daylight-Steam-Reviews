As killer I'm roaming around and I cannot find them for shit until a generator symbol pops up so I go there and the person is long gone, obviously. I don't even know if I can sprint either, [strike]considering my shift key is broken.[/strike] As human I have no idea what I'm doing, I find a generator and try to fix it which takes like 2 minutes, and it just continues like that until we either win or somehow the killer keeps tracking me down, injuring me till death. even if im doing nothing but hiding. The bugs, if there are any, as people keep saying, I don't even see. Probably cause the game seems so poorly made already that I can't tell the difference.\n\n\nEdit: This game is still confusing and poorly made even after all this time.

Just play the game for a couple days and don't worry about how long it takes to get a game going. Just alt-tab and browse reddit or something. I've noticed that most of the time the game works perfectly fine. \n\nPlay the game for a few days because most of the glitches seem to be gone after you get some character progression and learn not to touch menus while the games are searching/loading.  I learned to survive and realised that camping killers are only harming themselves. You can almost get the exit open with three people in the time one person dies from hanging on the hook. If you see a camper, just go and work on the generators! They are giving you a free win.\n\nAlso, before you complain about the killers; go and play a couple of them. Their eyesight and hearing is limited, the survivors can easily outrun you if they know where barriers are, and you have to get your attack down perfect or you'll miss every time. I found them being way harder to play than the survivors.

Nowadays u r kinda forced to play with friends bc otherwise you won't enjoy this game most of the time.\n\nStarting at low ranks the game seems far simple as killer and survivor as long as u have atleast a bit of a clue what you're doing.

But now u r kinda forced to play with a squad u can communicate with bc if u r facing a good killer and you r all by yourself u will most likely dont stand a chance. It's pretty common to get tunneled, camped or moried after 1st at 5 gens which is literally hilarious and completely unnecessary. You will have a  slight chance don't take me wrong, but to get this you have to play this game for reaaaaally really long to learn everything and get good at looping and knowing when to do what.

This game is awesome \n2. Every Killer has a special power to help them hunt \n3. The items are pretty cool\n4. Each stage has its own challenge\n5. lol it has a very cool creepy factor.\n6. The perks you get are kinda cool for both killer and survivor.\n7. The DlC are awesome always have awesome new killers.\n\nCons\n1. Dont like how survivors can sabotage the hooks its kinda unfair to the killer because then you gotta drag a survivor all the way to the basement.\n2. Not that many items to customize your killer or any new weapons.\n3. If survivors can sabotage hooks then you should give the killer a longer timer on holding a survivor. \n4. Should add other game modes besides turning on generators.\n5.

Ademas los desarrolladores del juego sólo hacen el juego mas complejo para los supervivientes sin balancear la jugabilidad.","timestamp_created":1483698975,"timestamp_updated":1570819372,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29056637","author":{"steamid":"76561198228304056","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":76507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37041,"last_played":1645468519},"language":"thai","review":"=w=","timestamp_created":1483698926,"timestamp_updated":1493624260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29056277","author":{"steamid":"76561198353686762","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1541260951},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกและตื่นเต้น","timestamp_created":1483697730,"timestamp_updated":1483697730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29056276","author":{"steamid":"76561198118470088","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":23790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2898,"last_played":1652449403},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito divertido, otimo para jogar entre amigos","timestamp_created":1483697730,"timestamp_updated":1483697730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29055959","author":{"steamid":"76561198010149329","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":8054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5001,"last_played":1631533933},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun at first, then you start to realise how unbalanced everytrhing is, its completely geared to the killer as far as game play goes. in addition if you try to play with anymore than 2 friends you run into trouble actually joinin games due to ping differences, its like the game cant find a compatible host. \n\nthen there is the low level surviver tanking system, if you run into a camper killer and are unlucky enough to be put on a hook, its sya later ranks, so basicly every 2nd game. ranking as a killer is easier, there really needs to be more detriment to sabotarging and hook camping on both sides....\n\nIve never enjoyed and then crashed into a centre of hate towards this game...","timestamp_created":1483696601,"timestamp_updated":1483696601,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50641024112701416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29055936","author":{"steamid":"76561198041783297","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":9910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6845,"last_played":1658275661},"language":"schinese","review":"老是错误1通不过怎么玩\n修复了老bug新bug又出来了\n4人联机很难排进去，和基友联机谨慎入手，半个小时才进去常有的事\n游戏好好玩哦","timestamp_created":1483696475,"timestamp_updated":1487203666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50525665283203125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29055782","author":{"steamid":"76561198200359357","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25106,"last_played":1638057782},"language":"polish","review":"Gra w której dostaniecie centralnego WKU***ENIA oraz przeżyjecie wiele bógów, gliczów.
