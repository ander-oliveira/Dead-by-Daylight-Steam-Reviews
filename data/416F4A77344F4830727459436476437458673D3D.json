The gameplay is fun, if not slightly repetitive, from both killer/survivor. High replayability, given it's competitive multiplayer. However, both survivor and killer can be frustrating to play. This is *for the most part* because of a mix of bugs/exploits (see the pages of random reports on the community discussions page for specifics) that can ruin a game often enough to be annoying. The reason this does not make this review negative is because I find the game fun to play!\n\n     The devs are hardworking and listen to their community and are actively fixing the game's problems. When the game works right, it works extremely well. When it doesn't, it's either very frustrating or very humorous. So, if you enjoy 4v1 multiplayer within a horror environment and are willing to support the devs through a somewhat-rocky launch, by all means, pick this game up and join the mass murdering fun! Many people are posting negative reveiws about this game because of numerous nitpicky complaints that really don't affect gameplay often enough to ruin the experience.\n\n     As an example, at the very beginning of the game's launch many people posted negatives because friend-to-friend multiplayer wasn't exsistent. This was a bad move by the devs, but it was deliberate. It was deliberate because it would shift the balance of the game towards the well-coordinated teams. Though the devs openly said this, the community didn't care. So, it was implemented early with barebones funcionality because of the community's impatience. Now what do the reviews say? That it's broken and makes it too hard for killers to play. See a problem there? Again, I will repeat, if you like this genre of game and are even slightly interested and don't mind the once-in-a-while bug that are indeed being fixed as this review is being written: don't be turned away by some of the whiny negatives, this game is worth it!","timestamp_created":1470510994,"timestamp_updated":1473811249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24747326","author":{"steamid":"76561198284732728","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1398,"last_played":1561407699},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego ;) tiene uno que otro bug pero nada para alarmarce xD","timestamp_created":1470510903,"timestamp_updated":1470510903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24747134","author":{"steamid":"76561198135049039","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1644628213},"language":"english","review":"I would love to recommend this game but it keeps crashing.

Simple gameplay that doesn't get stale for a long while. \n\nShort description: it's a 1v4 asymmetrical survival game. There is 1 killer with a melee weapon who needs to find 4 survivors, hit them and sacrifice them to a mysterious god. The survivors can't hurt the killer, except for stunning him for a short while, they have to hide and complete objectives on the map (repair generators) to escape. They are able to save each other from death.\n\nThe game is mostly about prioritising objectives and timing your actions. There is a bit of strategy involved and some mechanical skill (in chases). The game doesn't have too many rules or complicated mechanics and therefore the learning curve is not overly steep. At lower levels, the killer will have an considerable advantage, as you start learning the game and level up your characters, the balance shifts more towards the survivor side.\n\nThe progression system in the game is quite interesting. The points you earn through playing are spent on permanent perks as well as consumable items, which change the game a little bit and help you. The perks you get introduce a significant change to the gameplay (which can excerbate matchmaking problems as levelled up characters are much stronger). It takes a long time to get all perks on multiple characters, so you will have a goal to work towards for hundreds of hours.\n\nThe game is not without bugs and problems. The matchmaking is quite bad, and there are still a few glitches around. But the involvement of the developer team is promising and makes me think all those issues will be solved in time. There have already been several patches since release addressing bugs and balance. If you have very little patience for glitches and really expect a flawless game, you may want to wait until more of the issues are solved. However, they are not preventing me from recommending this game, as I have had a LOT of fun in it.","timestamp_created":1470479158,"timestamp_updated":1470479158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622132301330566406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24739813","author":{"steamid":"76561198263995392","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":12205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11646,"last_played":1639043345},"language":"polish","review":"Just run run and hide run run and hide P.S dont die :) dont be lama.. to farm:)","timestamp_created":1470479031,"timestamp_updated":1542830488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24739550","author":{"steamid":"76561198269454099","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2283,"last_played":1615032504},"language":"russian","review":"Игра класс!","timestamp_created":1470477733,"timestamp_updated":1470477733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24739510","author":{"steamid":"76561197992828121","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12742,"last_played":1480921692},"language":"english","review":"To start this i will say there are issues with the game\n\nclicking \"join a lobby\" many times to get into a game (devs have said that are working on this)\nmatchmaking (devs have said they are testing possible fixes to this)\nno key bindings (are currently being worked on and are expected soon)\n\nand many more but even with these i still enjoy this game quite alot.  This game is done by a small team so bugs and ballance issues are to be expected but the devs are active in communication with the comunity via a weekly twitch and releasing patches quite often.\n\nThe thrill of a chase is something i have not found as good in other games as I have found in this (on both sides).  Hanging someone on a hook that you have chased for some time is quite satisfying and the flip side to this escaping someone who can track well is equally satasfying.  \n\nWhen you first jump into the game you are very likely to loose either by not finding anyone or getting hooked quite quickly this is due to a in depth toutoral but then again sometimes the toutoral in games feels too long and getting your hand held the whole time is just boring.  Once you have got a feel for how the mechanics work you will start to earn more blood points (currency for leveling up and obtaining items/perks) and this will help you survive better or be a more efficient killer.\n\nThis is my first review i have written so its brobably written badly but all i can hope for is that you dont rule this game out just because of a few bad reviews.

This game has a lot of issues. Issues that for some can make this game unplayable. The servers are P2P.

Play. And if you are ever the killer and any lag happens... expect a lot of hate and death threats in your comments. Check my page for proof.... I play this game with friends, and when trying to join a game, instead of the lobby constantly searching for a game until it finds one, it says, \"Failed to join game.\" and Every time that happens, each friend I play with has to press ready again. This wouldn't be a big deal if it was about 3 times we had to ready up. However, you have to do this about 20-50 times before finding a game, and sometimes if a game is found one of your friends is kicked out randomly. These are the biggest issues. It definitely feels like it should still be in alpha. There are so many problems that it hurts me because the concept is the most amazing multiplayer concept I have seen in years. \n\nHOWEVER!!! You probably have seen many reviews not recommending this game because of all of these issues. I will tell you. Me and my friends persevere, because it is so incredibly fun when it actually works.

Most matches are fun, mostly fair and pretty intense, but you usually do not feel cheated. Sometimes you're team fails you and just leaves you to die, sometimes you do the same...which is all fine and good. \n\n~~2/10) The matches that aren't good are...really really bad. You either end up with the wraith as the killer and it plays some intense levels of bullshit and is extremely OP; wouldn't be so bad if they either nerfed the Wraith's invisibility power, made it take longer to attack after appearing or turned off collision with the Wraith (there have been times where I have been squeezed between a generator and the Wraith when it decides to appear right next to me and I cannot flee). The Other thing that makes some matches absolute horrible is...killers that puppy guard when you're on the hook. I get that it is a tactic, but it should be a tactic they are punished for. Losing points, etc etc, because puppy guarding definitely does not please the \"Entity\" if hiding survivors annoy it (An update made it that if you hide too long, the \"Entity\" does things to reveal your location). \n~~~~Basically, this poor portion of the review would be negated if they punished killers for Guarding people on the hooks, thus negating a large portion of the Alturism tree of points for survivors. And if the Wraith recieved a major nerf on it's invisibility options. The Hillbilly can run into walls and miss entirely with the chainsaw, the Trapper's traps can be sabotaged, but nothing can fuck with the Wraith.\n\nOverall 9/10 IF they fix some of the problems in the future.\n\nSuggestions: Nerf the Wraith, Punish Puppy Guarding Killers with point loss or something. Or best idea of all, implement a ban system like similar games have done, where the other players can disallow specific Killers/Monsters, that way newer players are not being absolutely destroyed by the Wraith. Also, please for the love of all that is right, make it easier to get off the hooks...in my whole time playing in the beta and the official, I never once managed to get off the hook with my own power.","timestamp_created":1470471311,"timestamp_updated":1470471311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24738262","author":{"steamid":"76561198121363007","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11243,"last_played":1487676569},"language":"schinese","review":"挂B太多，转一圈钩子全没，透视加速太多，虽然有中文，但不建议入手。","timestamp_created":1470471102,"timestamp_updated":1470471102,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51445084810256958","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24738257","author":{"steamid":"76561197968374655","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1472121859},"language":"german","review":"habe mir das spiel vor paar tagen gekauft war am anfang echt voll happy drüber aber jetzt nach all den dcs und all den abstürzen würde ich lieber mein geld zurück nehmen","timestamp_created":1470471074,"timestamp_updated":1470471074,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475074023008346558","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24738247","author":{"steamid":"76561198123294271","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":115346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":49,"playtime_at_review":10498,"last_played":1659912079},"language":"english","review":"If you have ever loved the good old cat and mouse. you'll love this game. take it from a ape like me.\n10/10 would die for this","timestamp_created":1470470972,"timestamp_updated":1640222907,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24737782","author":{"steamid":"76561198004741263","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3122,"last_played":1583706462},"language":"english","review":"This game can be very fun if you are willing to put with a screwed up match making system,  their is a ranking system yet it will match a rank 1 killer with a group of rank 20 survivors.  The killer has the option to drop his lobby and rejoin to get a more favorable match, he can see what rank/level/gear the survivors are before deciding to accept the match or not.  As a survivor you have no idea what killer you are facing let alone what rank/level they are.  \n\nWhen playing with friends, I find the game will often drop you back to the main campfire lobby where you and your friends have to rejoin up and try and get into a match.  One would think after you click ready that you'd be put into a match making que and wait till your turn is up, you'd be wrong, it searchs see's no game is ready for you and unreadies you.  So you have to keep clicking ready for 1-2 minutes,  \n\nDon't wanna take a loss just alt-f4 and quit game and no harm no foul, nothing more frustrating when a killer doesn't wanna lose points and he kills his game, you gain no points for the match he losses none.  This game has already been cracked and several different hacks for both survivors and killers that can completely ruin a match.  While this is nothing new to PC games its just frustrating when an already lopisided match gets worse because the killer is using cheats.  \n\nSo key things for this game to get a thumbs up from me,  Fix the match making system to A.) be more fluid I.E. I don't have to spam click ready for 5 minutes to get a game, and so that it doesn't randomly drop me and disband my friends group B.) Make some damn sense, don't put me in with a rank 1 killer when I'm rank 18.  C.) Stop allowing the killer to see what he's going to face so he can decided its to hard and not face it, I can't see the killer why the hell can the killer see us?\n\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************************************\nUPDATE 10/13/2016\n\nCame back to play this game after a few months of nothing and a few thinsg have changed.  For starters they removed the ability to see everyones level at the game lobby so you don't know if you have a team of pros or a team of noobs, the killer also can't see.  Huge improvement.  \n\nThey also fixed the match making system so that you don't have to keep spam clicking the ready button click once and it puts you in a que another huge improvement.  The match making system itself still needs a little help.  I was playing as a killer and kept finding myself getting que'd against rank 12's and lower that had all the perks you'd want and well my killer is lvl 1 without any perks. Now thats not to say I didn't get a few kills in here and there but more times than not it was at the end when they were being greedy and trying to max out their points and I got lucky.  \n\nThey finally also fixed the Alt-F4 so people will no longer disconnect in a match they think will be a loss, a big bonus means people play to win and not just say fuck it and leave. When you que with friends it would be nice if after the game was done you didn't have to remake your group again.  Thats a minor annoyance, I hear people complaining that the killer is just a pushover and easy to defeat.. while I agree there are some things just frustrating. like I hook someone and go to place a trap at their feet someone can run up and get em off the hook before I can set the trap or before I can stop trying to set the trap and take a swing at em.  but all and all I find it fairly balanced, you gotta get in the head of the runner that your chancing and predict where they are going to go don't always follow the same path or try and take down every barrier they put in your way.","timestamp_created":1470468352,"timestamp_updated":1476411121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497076034545898438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24737617","author":{"steamid":"76561198308777418","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4686,"last_played":1594021514},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏很好玩很刺激，但是模式单一，希望出新模式","timestamp_created":1470467382,"timestamp_updated":1470467382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48554915189743042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24737531","author":{"steamid":"76561198125092233","num_games_owned":474,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1535932003},"language":"english","review":"no matches found\ng8","timestamp_created":1470466785,"timestamp_updated":1471198416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484007894992828369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24737384","author":{"steamid":"76561198118208318","num_games_owned":488,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":23649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13932,"last_played":1623343442},"language":"russian","review":"Мда...

My last attempt with one friend playing was readying up 97 (yes we counted) times without connecting to a single lobby.","timestamp_created":1470457017,"timestamp_updated":1470457017,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24735865","author":{"steamid":"76561198146604583","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4271,"last_played":1498715608},"language":"schinese","review":"竟然出了官方简体中文 好评  话说怎么没有繁体中文","timestamp_created":1470455623,"timestamp_updated":1470455623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24735695","author":{"steamid":"76561198087443467","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":65406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":190,"playtime_at_review":33575,"last_played":1659966655},"language":"english","review":"Very Nice Game of The Year!!","timestamp_created":1470454419,"timestamp_updated":1542900582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24735494","author":{"steamid":"76561198321566906","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1471225206},"language":"koreana","review":"개잼씀! 명불허전 데바데  추천합니다!","timestamp_created":1470452928,"timestamp_updated":1470452928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4OH0rtYCdvCtXg=="}
