Можно было бы здесь поставить \"нейтральный\", так бы и сделал. Я не играл в дбд со старта или где-то там, поэтому для меня эта игра особо не изменилась. Почти... И сейчас я попробую разъяснить, почему я недоволен, но продолжаю играть. В первую очередь этот обзор будет, конечно же, направлен на разъяснение для потенциально новых игроков.\n\nКакая в игре цель?\nЯ совру, если скажу, что главная цель в игре за выживших - это сбежать от убийцы. Нет. Теперь уж точно нет.  Хотя никто не мешает вам только это и делать. Сейчас главной целью сурвов является выведение убийцы из себя, да так, чтоб он вышел. Побегать, застанить доской и ослепить по десятку раз, а потом поприседать перед лицом, показывая своё превосходство. Я бы хотел вывести это в отдельную часть с минусами, но, дабы не терялась связность текста, спрошу: почему здесь царит такая токсичнось? Я имею ввиду, если сурв может убежать от мана, то почему он предпочитает начать тыкать ctrl и кликать фонариком, тратя его ресурс впустую?\nУбийца же, при всём этом, должен ловить этих неугомонных, и всё. Разница только в том, какие у него способности и перки с аддонами, что может хоть и немного, но поменять геймплей. И тут уже сурвы решают, будет страдать ман или нет. Будет ли он должен справляться с идущим в его сторону негативом, или он просто будет бегать за ними, сетуя лишь на свои собственные ошибки.\n\nЧто в игре вообще можно делать?\nЕсли коротко: за выживших - чинить гены, искать предметы в ящиках, ломать тотемы (или же накладывать дары), спасать других сурвов или же просто бегать от мана; за убийцу - просто бегай и бей всё, что двигается или мешает пройти и ломается... ну и гены пинать время от времени, и вешать тушки обычных человеков на крюки...\nЕсли так подумать, весьма однообразно, что может надоесть через часов так сотню-две. Однако для меня тут главное уже просто скоротать время и просто побегать и попытаться переиграть противника.\n\nКак я думаю, краткую суть игры я изложил, а теперь к плюсам и минусам, а точнее, к тому, чем я доволен и нет.\n\nПлюсы:\n+ Количество перков за обе команды. Это придаёт вариативности в геймплее. Однако большинство из них, всё же, ситуативны.\n+ Разнообразие маньяков. Тут то же самое, притом способности у них, так сказать, тоже ситуативные, то есть их применяемость и полезность зависят от карты.\n+ Игра не требует тебя донатить или покупать длс вплоть до того момента, пока ты не захочешь приобрести персонажа, на которого у разработчиков была приобретена лицензия, то есть персонажа из какого-то фильма или другой игры. Все перки для обеих команд можно достать посредством прокачки персонажей, купленных за валюту, что получается за повышение уровня, либо покупкой в храме тайн всё за ту же валюту за уровень.\n\nИ как по мне, это... все плюсы.\n\nМинусы:\n- Токсичность. Я уже упоминал о ней выше, поэтому расписывать не стану.\n- Система рангов + SBM (подбор на основе навыков игры) для манов. Ничего не решает. После долгого перерыва меня кинуло в низы новой рейтинговой системы. Что после этого я увидел? Четыре пепла против красного ранга. Или набор из золота, серебра, ещё одного золота или радуги (то есть красного ранга), плюс одного пепла (на месте которого был я) против пепельного мана, который даже в упор тебя не всегда замечает. Это скорее лишь отторгает новичков, ведь им нужно учиться бегать за сурвами, находить их, а не видеть, как за пять минут три гена заводят, пока он ищет только что бывшего перед ним чела, или же, наоборот, учиться убегать, а не получать километровые ваншоты от летящих из ниоткуда топоров охотницы.\n- SWF (выживание с друзьями) и соло-сурвы. Если ты ман, то SWF - это сущий кошмар для тебя. Пока ты бегаешь за одним челом, за тобой бегает другой, пока оставшиеся два генрашат тебя по полной. Когда ты кладёшь одного сурва, тебя оглушают любым доступным способом, чтобы освободить напарника, а когда ты продолжаешь бегать, у тебя не остаётся ни генов, ни висячих или дохлых сурвов. И если ты меняешь цель, то и сурвы тоже меняются между собой, ведь они имеют голосовую связь, могут сказать друг другу куда ты пошёл, что делаешь, как пытаешься переиграть во время преследования и т.п. Если же ты пошёл за выжившего в соло - не жди, что тебя спасут спокойно, когда ты кое-как отбегаешь четыре гена, после чего тебя повесят. К тебе либо прибегут все, либо никто, либо приведут с собой мана. Лишь иногда тебя спасут и выхилят нормально. Адекватного сейва фонариком или бодиблока тоже не всегда приходится ждать.\n\nВ принципе, и это все минусы. Их тоже не так много, но они явно посерьёзнее.\n\nЧто-то между плюсами и минусами - это баланс. Ничто не законтрит генраш, ака быстрый завод генераторов, когда у сурвов есть связь, а ты один, сам по себе. Так ещё и эта убитая система рангов. Но если отбросить это, то проблема в другом: есть маны, которые не могут ничего, а есть имба. Так к этому ещё добавьте разброс в аддонах. Есть аддоны бесполезные, а есть те, которые сделают из среднечка имбу, а из имбы - нечто невообразимое. Сюда же добавляются ключи и шестерёнки у сурвов, а также разные перки с обеих сторон. И, с одной стороны, это всё постоянно меняется и балансится. Но эти же изменения не дают привыкнуть к геймплею, который зависит от некоторых адднонов, которые меняются кардинально.\n\nМой вердикт - я не советую новичкам покупать игру до момента, пока на покупку и дальнейшую игру вместе не согласятся друзья, хотя бы двое. Это если вы будете играть за выживших. А вы рано или поздно будете. Если же собираетесь играть за мана - держите в голове, что вам это может быстро надоесть из-за токсичности. Старичкам эта игра может и зайдёт - они уже заняли своё место и освоились - однако начинать играть теперь явно будет не так приятно, как, хотя бы, со старой ранговой системой.","timestamp_created":1634831110,"timestamp_updated":1639572003,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101394524","author":{"steamid":"76561198366454943","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":27409,"last_played":1659867887},"language":"english","review":"Shit Game\n\nRevised Review: Still shit \n\nRevised revision of the review: new character surv seems pretty cool same as killer, rlly cool skins in the update but the game is still shit","timestamp_created":1634830638,"timestamp_updated":1638544283,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562732875347137451","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101394419","author":{"steamid":"76561199126350373","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":13403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":293,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1660122401},"language":"russian","review":"отличная игра с друзьями класс в нее поиграть\n","timestamp_created":1634830518,"timestamp_updated":1634830518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101394337","author":{"steamid":"76561198288573984","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1376,"playtime_at_review":39051,"last_played":1660579534},"language":"tchinese","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1634830396,"timestamp_updated":1634830396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101393887","author":{"steamid":"76561199049703844","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":24069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6137,"last_played":1659263771},"language":"russian","review":"ok!","timestamp_created":1634829730,"timestamp_updated":1634829730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101393448","author":{"steamid":"76561198808818980","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":235,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1660413160},"language":"latam","review":"sisi\n","timestamp_created":1634829092,"timestamp_updated":1634829092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101393371","author":{"steamid":"76561198976400758","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":1107,"last_played":1660314394},"language":"german","review":"Einfach Top alles dabei","timestamp_created":1634828979,"timestamp_updated":1634828979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101393347","author":{"steamid":"76561198124323982","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":5527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5120,"last_played":1658727794},"language":"tchinese","review":"操 最低牌位遇到紅牌","timestamp_created":1634828952,"timestamp_updated":1634828952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533011257648468018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101392873","author":{"steamid":"76561198095568867","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":7421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5893,"last_played":1658088278},"language":"english","review":"1) This game WAS good and mostly balanced!

Link to the [b]second part[/b] [url=steamcommunity.com/id/GitLike/recommended/381210]here[/url].\n\n\nWether or not I can recommend this game has to be one of the hardest decisions I've made. On the one hand you have a lot, A LOT, of things that greatly reduce the fun you could have with the game (and I will be going into extensive detail about the things that are most upsetting and infuriating), but on the other hand my friends and me keep playing the game, so there has to be some good aspects to it.\n\n\nFirst, let's get over the good aspects of the game. First off, making an asymmetric team game isn't the easiest task and not many modern (popular) games do this. For that reason alone you might discard the point I am going to make later on about the insane balancing issues, but please still hear me out. Now, obviously a great thing about this game is that you have a wide range of characters from movies, games etc. that you can play as (on both sides). The whole game is filled with a lot of lore which is nice, although this doesn't affect gameplay and you could easily miss it.\nOn of the biggest pros for this game has to be the atmosphere. Wether you are sneaking around the map, repairing a generator, opening chests or whatever you constantly feel like you might be followed or watched from a distance, perhaps as if the killer just appeares around the next corner. A big part of this feeling is achieved through the music and the sounds. (Most of the times) when the killer gets close to you you can slowly hear a heartbeat getting more and more intense which can cause panic, especially when you are doing something are you very close to finishing. The sound design is just excellent.\nNext, the graphics of this games look rather nice and the game has a pretty solid performance (they previously had to disable maps for everyone because of performance issues, but this was only present on consoles so who cares) and nobody I've ever played this game with had major performance issues that were caused by the game itself.\n\n\nUnfortunately that's where the pros end and a long list of issues begins. First of, the character progression. The game will rewards you with \"bloodpoints\" during each match whenever you do something noteworthy (repairing a generator, helping someone else, being chased by the killer, etc.). These points can be spend on both survivors and killers freely, no matter where you got them from (great!). The issue here is that this system has not been greatly updated since the game has been released, it worked great with only a couple of characters, but with every new character it just keeps getting more ridiculous. [i] But why would you want to level more than one character anyways? [/i]. Each character comes with his/her own set of 3 unique perks. These perks CAN be taught to other characters, but you need to level the origin character first (which, depending on your target perk, means you need to level up to level 30/35/40 out of 50 max) first. Then, when you have aquired the perk as a \"teachable\" you need to level your main character until you find the perk in his leveling system (called \"bloodweb\") through randomness.\nLet's do a little calculation for 2 out of 3 unique perks from the new \"Hour of the Witch\" DLC.\n\n\nOur target is to get the second and last perk which means we need to level the character to level 40 to make both of these perks \"teachable\" and then find them in our main character's skill tree. This action has cost me a little over 1.700.000 bloodpoints. Yes, almost 2 million. Now, let's say in a good round you get rewarded with 25.000 bloodpoints.\n\n1.700.000 bloodpoints (total needed) / 25.000 bloodpoints (awarded in a good match) = 68 good matches\n\nTo put that number into perspective let's do another quick calculation about the time it takes to finish these matches. Let's assume the average match takes about 15 minutes to finish with about 10 minutes of waiting in between matches (assuming you always instanltly requeue).\n\n68 matches * 15 minutes (game time) = 1020 minutes\n68 matches * 10 minutes (wait time) = 680 minutes\n1020 minutes + 680 minutes = 1700 minutes\n1700 minutes / 60 minutes = 28,3 hours\n\nSo, assuming that every single one of the 68 match starts and plays well for you with no downtime in between or server issues etc. you have to play for a little over 28 hours to unlock 2 perks from the dlc you just bought. Now, because of all the assumptions from above let's say it takes a good 30 hours. If you are luckly like me who still had 1.700.000 bloodpoints left you might just need 5-10 minutes of tedious button clicking to unlock your content, but please note that you can normally only have up to 1.000.000 bloodpoints at a time (You can trick this system pretty easily if you just have around the max value and then redeem a code for bloodpoints, which they give out for free very frequently, that will bring that number over the cap. From here on there is no cap for you assuming you stay above the 1.000.000 bloodpoints).\nDuring my last points I have already scratched into other issues of this game, like for example the waiting times. As I am typing this there are about 51.000 players in the game with a daily high of around 66.000 players (data acquired from the Steam statistics tab for most played games on the platform). With this amount of people playing and the fact that this number puts the game on place 15 for most played games across ALL OF STEAM (+ everyone playing on console with cross play enabled NOT INCLUDED) it is unacceptable that you need to wait 10 or more minutes to find a game. And then you need to hope that nobody leaves and that the game actually starts (it isn't that uncommon that a game will just load for a solid 5 minutes before disconnecting everyone).\nNext up, this game features 3 different currencies and 3 different leveling systems. Why?. One is fine, two maybe if you want to have a currency that is only obtained through real money, but why does it need to be 3. The first currency, bloodpoints, are giving (as said before) through the things you do during a match (and as a gift whenever they screw something up). Next up you have \"iridescent shards\" which are obtained through a level up of your account (not your character). These points can only be spend on cosmetics or buying a teachable perk. According to the game's wiki you aquire enough iridescent shards to buy one perk between the levels 15 and 24 (don't ask me why they made the table that way). To put that level into perspective as of right now I have progressed to level 98. For cosmetics a good set (that is 3 parts, head, body, pants & shoes) costs 21.600 iridescent shards which (according to the same table from before) would require a level closeish to 90 or so (so in playtime roughly 200 hours in my case). As for the last currency the \"auric cells\" can be obtained through real money and can be spend on clothing as well.\n\n\nWe are getting close to the character limit so if you want to continue

Yes, it is. Just look at my play time.\nIs Dead by Daylight currently a game worth supporting? No, it is not. Not in the slightest.\n\nWhere to begin? Besides the recent controversy around DbD now dealing with NFTs against the knowledge of players who recently purchased the Pinhead DLC (many of whom are now demanding refunds - and who can blame them?), the game is riddled with bugs and tons of in-game content is routinely removed for quite literally months at a time to 'fix' it, only to return broken and ultimately end up being removed again for further 'fixes'. One such map has now been disabled for around two months. It just came back, only to be pulled a day later due to apparent bug issues that the game's latest DLC has introduced. Any other developer would surely spot many of the bugs that their DLCs and updates cause *before* releasing the new content (isn't that a basic fundamental of game development?) but not BHVR, it seems. Despite giving players the choice to opt-in to PTBs (Public Test Builds - basically Betas) before the release of major new DLC to try and find and address bugs before the official launch of the DLC, 9 times out of 10 the DLC will release with pretty much the exact same bugs everyone was complaining about in the PTB. Last year's update (The Twins DLC) was the prime example of this. A ton of issues during the PTB, nothing done for months about it, even after its release. The devs seem to have a habit of releasing incomplete, buggy content *despite* it being tested by literally thousands of players in Beta, and then pulling chunks of it (and other, non-DLC components of the game) within hours of it being released.\n\nWhat's that? You're experiencing crashes? Frame rate drops? Terrible optimisation? You're upset that four maps are missing, one of which has been down for months, with a \"TBA\" release date on it being brought back (and then probably pulled for the fourth time)? You're annoyed that a new survivor perk got pulled in the first 24 hours because it was causing everyone's games to crash? Well, don't hold your breath for an effective fix! The devs will be too busy adding new cosmetics (Ghostface's classic look is only the equivalent of around £6-7! For a skin! A bargain!) - the one thing that they actually seem to get right.\n\nTl;dr the game is buggy, chunks of content are routinely pulled (currently four maps and a perk that people literally just paid for 24 hours ago are gone for 'fixes'), the Devs don't really seem to listen to the community - even during Betas which are designed to find and fix bugs - and now they're dealing with NFTs and only told players about it after they spent their money on the DLC connected to it. Oh, and if you buy DLC featuring a new killer or new survivor perks or new features, expect major nerfs and changes the second you start getting used to them (or sometimes even completely undeserved buffs, too). \n\nDbD is a great game, but the Devs are dragging it through one of the roughest patches I've ever seen in a game this big. Just check the DbD twitter page replies and see the reaction of the community for yourself if you don't believe me. Save yourself the time, the money and the frustration. As it currently stands, it really isn't worth it.","timestamp_created":1634813059,"timestamp_updated":1634813539,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50464397668838501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101383392","author":{"steamid":"76561198415173051","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":45119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37479,"last_played":1658933534},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam.","timestamp_created":1634812983,"timestamp_updated":1634812983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52707982063293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101383327","author":{"steamid":"76561199020792517","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5779,"last_played":1646708358},"language":"english","review":"pog","timestamp_created":1634812820,"timestamp_updated":1634812820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101383303","author":{"steamid":"76561199210471386","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":589,"playtime_at_review":4660,"last_played":1660580330},"language":"schinese","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1634812772,"timestamp_updated":1634812772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101382309","author":{"steamid":"76561199160643733","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1650018498},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра, купил по скидке, не жалею.","timestamp_created":1634810680,"timestamp_updated":1634810680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101382055","author":{"steamid":"76561198058114333","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":158455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1035,"playtime_at_review":136460,"last_played":1660429974},"language":"english","review":"More fun than it's competitors when it comes to gameplay, and with a more lively community, but please look into the game's history and recent evens before deciding whether or not it is worth your money.
