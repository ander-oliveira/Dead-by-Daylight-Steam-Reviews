Dead by Daylight is more so the latter. The game has been around for five years now, and in that time I have been around for most of it. As a long time player, I think it's safe to say I have a pretty good idea on the experience and if it is worth it for me, but my experience and the experience you'll find in the game can vary and may not be for everyone. With most games I would sugguest watching a basic rundown of what the gameplay is like to judge an opinion on wither or not you want to sink your teeth into it, and if it's not right for you, utilize the Steam Refund feature if it is still possible by that point in your playthrough. Dead by Daylight is not a game you can really determine if you'll like within a few hours of gameplay however.\n\nLet me just say this to begin with, Dead by Daylight is a grind, no doubt, especially so at this point in it's life with hundreds of perks between both roles in the game, and entire strategies and crutches only being possible with certain perks or combinations, especially for new players. With that said, the game does utilize some amount of RNG, and not only that, but many perks are behind a paywall through DLC, which means that you'll have to pay for them to have access. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when buying said DLC does not immediately unlock it for all other available characters you have, and instead needing to still use the in game bloodpoints system to even unlock said perk per character just adds for the less than friendly experience to new players. Even as a veteran, I dread prestiguing or unlocking a new character only to spend 75 levels worth of in game currency to yet unlock a damn self-care because the game's RNG would much rather I take Deja Vu instead, a perk I doubt has been used even by new players since 2017, and which is even more ironic when it keeps appearing in my bloodweb instead of actually useful perks. This all means that even though you unlocked the perk for once character, or unlocked a teachable for that character, which means the perk can now be discovered on the bloodweb for other characters, this does not negate the complete RNG found within said bloodwebs that you'll need to spend in game currency on in order to progress and earn new tools and perks to better your chance of being effective in the trial. Fortunately the game now has a basic tutorial that gives you the basics of how to play the game in either role, as well as giving some free points as incentive to help get you started. Not to mention the famous bloodpoint events and holiday events found in the game, although seemly less often than in years past. Even so, especially if you are going for a wide array of perk options and seeing what works best for your playstyle, let alone if you are planning to prestige your characters for the cosmetics given for doing so, you are going to spend a lot of bloodpoints, for a lot of things you may never even use. Which can be a nuesence, if not repetitive and downright annoying. Of course prestiging is optional, but the rest of the issues previously mentioned will still be in effect regardless, even for veteran players.\n\nAs for the variety of perks, killer types with unique powers, and even cosmetics for almost every character in the game, there is something to work towards, but if it is worth it or not may vary person to person. Some people will be just fine having a default Meg running around in a sea of rabbit Fengs and 80's Jakes, while others may want a bit of spice of life in their most invested character. Fortunately, there is a wide variety of cosmetics to choose from, some characters having more diverse selections than others, and most cosmetics can be bought with iridecent shards, another non-paid in game item given simply by playing the game. Iridecent shards can also be used to 'buy' specific perks that are updated each week, even for characters you do not own, which can mean you can get the perk you really want without getting the DLC you don't. The same can also be done to buy some cosmetics and DLC characters, allowing you to buy some killers separate from the survivors, or vice versa. Which is a good system by nature, even if it does not allow every cosmetic or character to be bought in the store, but should be commended. However, again, these iridescent shards while free can be time consuming to gather enough to buy much of anything too often, so don't expect to rely on them too heavily.\n\nLet's talk about the game's overall 'health' and the community for a moment. It's no secret that this game has a both very passionate community, and also a community that can be very passionate, even if not necessarily about the game itself. It's not uncommon to find people who take the game too far and put others down for not being optimal at the game, or others who just want to put others down for the sake of their own enjoyment, but don't want to play Rust after their base was griefed once again while they were at school. That is not to say there are not players who desire to have fun, and promote it, from silly gags and meming in game, to outright supporting players and even mentoring them on how they can be more efficient. That being said, often times changes made by the developers to maps, mechanics, and perks can add fuel to the fire and not only change things up for the less informed players, but also feed the anger and toxicity in some players. That is not to say that players are always at fault, as the game does have many flaws, and has a long way to go to fixing even some long term issues. That isn't to say the game is dead, or not worth investing in, or that nothing is ever fixed or added, because that is simply not the case. But there are certainly still many issues with the game present for years that need addressed that seemly go unnoticed by the developers, or simply not corrected. This again can add fuel to an existing fire, and can be offputting for newer players especially. While every game has trash talking, with a game that can already take quite a learning curve to get into, let alone become caught up with all the perks and experience, many players can be turned off by this, and have.\n\nSo, as a long time player, who used to make entire compilation videos about a single game and the antics that can ensue, for better or for worse: Would I recommend Dead by Daylight? Yes, and no. Personally, I would love to be the reason someone new takes a crack at the game and picks it up for the first time, but I'd also hate to be the one who encouraged buying a game that isn't right for them, or that can feel like a waste of money, both of which I can understand and empathize. Dead by Daylight may especially not be right, or the best fit, for players with a limited availability to play games due to other life responsibilities, or who may simply be more of a casual gamer, simply due to the amount of time really needed to invest in the game to get more out of it. While games with an open world, numerous quests, and entire storylines may be worth the time investment in the long haul, and even offer reliability in that respect, Dead by Daylight because of the size of the content now is even harder to get into, and fully experience, now than ever before, despite having more licensed killers bringing new faces to the game. Nothing I said here should discourage you from playing the game, but offer a perspective not always seen amongst the meme reviews. As easy as it would be to do, it doesn't offer much insight into what the game actually is like, and beyond playing it for yourself, or watching a fair amount of raw gameplay and seeing it's ins and outs, there isn't a good way to really judge if the game is a right fit for you. Hopefully this helps.","timestamp_created":1561870977,"timestamp_updated":1630914120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52308225","author":{"steamid":"76561198162055562","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":493,"playtime_at_review":12457,"last_played":1660605179},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen Game.-","timestamp_created":1561870921,"timestamp_updated":1561870921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52307782","author":{"steamid":"76561198407078240","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":42848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1160,"playtime_at_review":8119,"last_played":1660387500},"language":"english","review":"I really like this game.
