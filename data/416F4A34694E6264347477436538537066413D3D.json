I'm happy to reccomend it on that basis alone. The game is enjoyable from both the perspectives of the killer and survivor, and they feel fairly balanced. Being a survivor follows simple gameplay with minor complex detail featuring very heavy risk taking, creating extremely tense suspenseful moments in sessions. Progression relys a little less on levels (though still a considerable aspect) and more on the skill and accumulated knowledge of the player which I find to be an especially rewarding mix. Killer gameplay is considerably more complex and relatively more tactical, relying on cunning and trying as best you can to use the many mechanics available to track and chase survivors. New killers will struggle more than new survivors though, as progression for the killer is split a similar way as for survivors, but relies more heavily on both knowledge and skill.\n\nHowever as much as I enjoy playing there are some flaws that really shouldn't be there.\nThere seems to be little consideration to mathmaking, where new killers are pitted against teams of seasoned survivors and vice versa. Lobby waiting times can sometimes be quite lengthy too. With a decent playerbase, there is no good reason to have both these issues simultaneously. There can sometimes be some lag in games, though I've experienced less of this than what others seem to have. I've noticed some bugs. Disconnects are also a semi-frequent problem where you can be kicked out of lobbies 15% of the time and, with great frustration, can be kicked out of the game roughly 5-10% of the time.\n\nI'd like to be able to say the devs are great and working on this, but from what I can see it doesn't seem that way. They appear to have set focus on producing content for the game for it's longevity and for money. While the dlc is good and something I'd also reccomend they have clearly lacked as much focus or refused to work on the problems the game has.\n\nDespite this I reccomend This game. It's very appropriately priced so If you're interested in the concept it should be worth the money, particularly when on sale.","timestamp_created":1498004234,"timestamp_updated":1498005996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488857299089431763","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32605775","author":{"steamid":"76561197974982540","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1498000916},"language":"english","review":"Just awful, dull, repetative, poorly thought out and implimented even more poorly, buy depth instead, it'll kinda fill the hole this game should fill but doesn't.\n\nThe community is generally toxic and will complain (flame and troll) if you don't follow the 'rules' of being a killer which largely involves letting them rescue other players after you have gone through the long, dull process of catching them. It's a chore and it feels that way, even when you succeed it's dull.\n\nThe killers aren't scary and the game is balanced in such a way that survivors win a lot of the time, while playing survivor is slightly better, it's still shallow as a paddling pool, I'm bored of it already and while I normally like playing the hunters, in this game it's hardest to find a killer, not survivors in matchmaking.

problema es la toxisidad pero esta a bajado mucho con el tiempo ya que los jugadores toxicos suelen ser gente nueva de resto el juego esta muy completo y los desarroladores le estan metiendo muchas

estuve jugando un buen rato a este juego, en diferentes oportunidades y siempre fué muy grato.\nPor lo que hoy escribo este análisis aprovechando el sabor de boca que me ha dejado en esta ultima oportunidad. \n\nLes comento que yo soy mas de la antigua escuela, anteriormente no habia juegos multijugador por lo que siempre nos teníamos que arreglar en single. (tampoco esperabamos el multi, estabamos bien asi) \nPero el furor de muchos (no el mio) fué cuando el Counter Strike comenzó con sus partidas Coop en LAN y todos salieron a cagarse a tiros para compartir un buen momento juntos. Pero por mi costumbre de antigua escuela nunca participe porque francamente no llamaba mi atención. Siempre me gustó jugar por mi cuenta y no tener que estar esperando a otros para hacerlo.\nPero un día me animé a probar este modo y ya para entonces estaba el multiplayer siendo este muy popular. Entonces comencé con Rust, Payday 2, entre otros. En ocasiones fué divertido y otras no tanto. (demasiado griterio y pavadas varias por parte de los demas) y eso me echaba atras en mas de una oportunidad. Pero este juego en particular les aseguro que siempre fué muy bueno. No hay chat de voz durante el juego!!!!! IDEAL PARA LOS IMBECILES QUE SE LA PASAN DICIENDO PELOTUDECES EN LA PARTIDA Y ROMPEN TODA LA AMBIENTACION DEL MISMO, ARRUINANDO LA EXPERIENCIA DE JUEGO DE LOS DEMAS. \nY respecto al juego en sí, tiene lindos gráficos, cumple muy bien su objetivo y la verdad que tanto jugar con amigos como con gente desconocida, no deja de ser atrapante e interesante.  \nEs de esos juegos que uno termina la partida y quiere mas!! , vamos por otra partida y cuando se termina...vamos por mas!!!!. O sea que organizamos 2 o 3 partidas y terminamos jugando 10. \nNo pensé que me iba a enganchar con un juego multiplayer ya que son muy casuales todos estos pero francamente este superó ampliamente mis espectativas y me hizo dar cuenta lo que el multiplayer te puede dar. No siempre es malo.  \nAHORA este tipo de métodos de juego son realmente interesantes para mi.  Y lo recomiendo ampliamente.\nSi sos chapado a la antigua y no sos muy \"multipleyero\" pero te intriga conocer este mundo..entonces empezá por este, te aseguro que te va a dejar una buena sensación. \n\n[h1] Datos técnicos[/h1] \n\nEl juego funciona muy bien, tiene arbol de progresos, skills, perks, items varios para usar y sacar provecho. \nPero por sobre todas las cosas, es realmente entretenido. Uno puede elegir entre varios personajes. hay aproximadamente como 9 supervivientes y 7 asesinos (aprox) diferentes para usar, \"TODOS\" con sus particularidades.\nEl objetivo del juego es mientras 4 supervivientes intentan reparar 5 motores para activar la puerta de escape (sin hacer ruido), uno que es el asesino intenta colgarlos y masacrarlos brutalmente. \n\n[h1] El juego se encuentra muy activo en este momento. [/h1] \nDe verdad recomiendo este juego, es muy bueno y cumple muy bien con su propósito. \n\nObviamente encontrarás en ocasiones alguno que otro que no juega del todo \"correctamente\" bien. \nComo por ejemplo un asesino que no termina de matarte nunca, para sacar mas puntos y eso hace perder el tiempo a los demas. Pero también del lado del superviviente sucede que trollean al asesino. Pero esas cosas pasan en todos los multiplayer, ya que es inevitable porque depende de la persona ya y no del juego. \nPero no abundan estos casos por suerte. Se dan en ocasiones, no siempre. \nLa gente juega como debe y esta muy bien!. ;).\n\nRECOMENDADISIMO!!!!! 100%. \nAloha!.","timestamp_created":1497997072,"timestamp_updated":1497997413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32603926","author":{"steamid":"76561198178043943","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":28698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1359,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1660529095},"language":"english","review":"I

really gotten into this game; and I can and will reccomend it for you to buy. (and hay its 40% off too :) ) \n\nThe game is a 1 vs 4 survival horror in which a killer (choose from currently 4 free killers the other 3 can be obtained through DLC which also gives you a survivor) chases, hunts, kills or sacrifices the 4 survivors (choose from 7 free survivors) each character has its advantages through its unique perks but you can level each character whether it be a survivor or a killer to get there unique perks teachable so that you can take them on different characters. \n\nTheres are set maps but the contense inside them variates between each trial (game) for instance the basement can switch positions and the generators, hooks. barricades and alot of the walls in the game are also random. So each trial can be different providing endless hours of fun even though your playing the same game over and over. \n\nSome killers may seem overpowered at first but the more you play vs them the more you can see there weaknesses and strengths so you can learn to play agaisnt them. It works vise versa some killers may find a certain survivor with a certain perk overpowered but again the more you play the more you realize how to counter that survivors tricks. \n\nTheres only one problem I have really with the game is the Doctors new map which for me is just meh. But all in all this game is great to play alone or with friends. You might find yourself playing all night sometimes haha. Well I hope I helped convice you or not convince you to buy Dead by Daylight. :)\n\nThanks - Andro <3\n\n","timestamp_created":1497990935,"timestamp_updated":1498584388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32602052","author":{"steamid":"76561198333451495","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1250,"last_played":1631919722},"language":"russian","review":"Сранная игра вечно лагает и кикает из лобби","timestamp_created":1497990817,"timestamp_updated":1497990817,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32602044","author":{"steamid":"76561198080714131","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1656508099},"language":"dutch","review":"This game is much fun.\nIt might get repetitive for some people since every game you are kinda doing the same kind of things except with different teammates and or enemies.

Sure, you just move on to the next one (where there's 5 in total) and so on. Whenever the killer gets you, there is a \"Press to wiggle\" function. This gives you a chance to break free from the killer and escape. He then drags your ass over to a hook. where he will impel you, untill a survior comes to your aid. It would've been a great feature, if the hooks weren't  2 inches from each other. And if you are new to the game, and are a low level character, there's not much fun in it for you. You have to grind and grind your character to a certain level, before you can start to have a slight of a chance.

It makes every game interesting.\n\nThere is just no feeling like killing all of the survivors because of your own ability or evading the killer during a close game and escaping to safety.
