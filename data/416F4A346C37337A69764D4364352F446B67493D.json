To a degree its honestly just not that fun as a survivor. Sure, some games are really fun but its more or less ONLY when the killer is a fresh-to-the-game NOOB. The game is FAR to on the killers side. Everything from his movement speed being at least twice the speed of yours to the ridiculous amount of hooks he can put you on SEEMINGLY always only a matter of 5 feet away because they're so plentiful. Even with a good team of survivors using all tool boxes with high charges, there STILL to many hooks and there will always BE one within 10 feet of you SOMEHOW. The outside maps are the ONLY maps the survivors really have a chance and that's only because they can somewhat see across the map. Indoor maps are completely in the killers favor and are damn near IMPOSSIBLE to escape. I mean in an idea of having fun playing video games this game just isnt that. Its frustration because I mean its just so POORLY balanced. Look at games like Friday the 13th or Deceit. Atleast in friday the 13th you can somewhat FIGHT Jason. You got all kinda stuns you can do. Ways to GET AWAY from him. On this game once the killers chasing you your FUCKED especially on a indoor map. There's no stuns, the obstacles you can use HARDLY do a damn thing. Tearing down hooks can be easily fixed so fuck your toolboxes. Its just BLATANTLY against the survivors. To an extent that any killer but complete noobs will not EVER lose.","timestamp_created":1593811761,"timestamp_updated":1593811761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71976926","author":{"steamid":"76561198152858580","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":61,"playtime_at_review":5109,"last_played":1660105498},"language":"english","review":"It has a very simple play style that's easy to grasp.

Hackers are very rare to find after 700 hours i've only came across 3. community can be toxic but thats just how most games are. in conclusion i recommend to buy this game on sale if you like to play a somewhat scary multiplayer game since sales on this game are quite often to happen.

The idea of Perks and Add-Ons. In the game, there are permanent perks you can unlock for your character that change the way you play, e.g Crows send out a radar-like echo when you are near a survivor, allowing you to follow them better. Add-Ons are smaller perks that are used up at the end of a match. Until you unlock them by playing specific characters, many of the best perks are locked away behind characters you have to buy with real money, or killers you might not want to play.\n2. The Matchmaking system is probably the worst you can come across. It takes a long time to get games, and very often the gap between players' skill levels will be by many ranks and hundreds/thousands of hours. There are tens of thousands of players playing all around the world on any one day, you should not be waiting this long.\n3 A very toxic community. I'm not talking from when you're playing the game and you have a post game chat, from my experience people have been more than polite, relative to other online communities.

Other than that the game is worth the price especially if you get it on sale then it's win, win for both sides ( mostly for you ).\n\nAlso, some of the killers are extremely overpowered ( one of them is the Nun ) the fact that she can teleport between walls doesn't sound broken because it's already broken. The game isn't hard to learn but it's hard to play as a survivor, both you and your teammates must know what to do in order to get the generators going and escape from the killer.\n\nFor the folks that think it's easy to win as a survivor it's not. And if you think you can win easy as a survivor give it a go.\nEither way you can easily refund the game if you haven't played it for more than 2
