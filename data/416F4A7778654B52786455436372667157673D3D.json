You see, in this game, all everything revolves around is to spam the shift button and watch the ground, and pressing space for vaulting over stuff, or to block certain chokepoints with planks of wood. Not only is the matchmaking barebones as of current, it's hard to feel any sort of terror or horror into the game, although the devs did mention they are fixing matchmaking for the future, I'll credit them for it.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, that's 3 things you're going to be doing again and again after matches aside from the shitty qte generator fixing, maybe an extra couple or so once you've unlocked several new items which hardly makes it more fun, rather making matches last longer than its comfort zone, and if you've still thinking that I'm an idiot for critizing/not reccomending the game , here's a video you should definitely watch, I don't know about you, but I'd rather pay full price for something as good as this, rather than ten bucks for a game that's disguised under a murky color pallette to hide how insignificant the \"Procedurally generated\" world is, \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz6e-64mj2Q&ab_channel=GunMedia\n\nSee that? Yeah, looks amazing, right? Well don't get overhyped before its release, but definitely keep an eye out for that game instead of this.\nIf there's anything to compare this game to, is that Dead By Daylight is very technically similar one of the better looking GMOD gamemodes with the same concept, and even then I've had more fun with Gmod gamemodes\n\nIn re-cap\nThe Alpha build for Friday the 13th makes Dead by Daylight look like a shoddy attempt to race them to the pot of gold, it's surprising how simple things missing in this game like doors makes it look 100% better, that kind of simple stuff is what creates this 'dynamic horror' feature, not a bunch of random pubs that have a 50% chance to troll you by dragging matches way longer than they should last.","timestamp_created":1466912915,"timestamp_updated":1466935993,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562673866748809814","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23813931","author":{"steamid":"76561197983141629","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2700,"last_played":1484649452},"language":"english","review":"Full of Euro or Chinese trash that can't afford more than 56k so either you're warping all over or they are.

The Killers dont have any real insentive to go hunting for other survivors as he is hook camping. Their is only one game mode and it still feels like this game is still in early beta since it still got a long way to go in updating. \n\nYoutubers and streamers got it easy since they got a fanbase and buddies to start a game with, but the ammount of dead air you have when you are solo queing is insane. \n\nId recommend this game of you have a group of 5  friends including yourself to have a game with. But if not, save your money and look somewhere else till they actually have a completed product.","timestamp_created":1466906713,"timestamp_updated":1466906764,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23811715","author":{"steamid":"76561198018795902","num_games_owned":616,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":13336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2421,"last_played":1627603898},"language":"english","review":"Enormously fun. A bit bare bones to be honest, so don't expect a huge amount in terms of variety, but it has very solid core gameplay that more can be built onto. \n\nThere are a few issues:\n\n As other reviews have said there is no way to play a match with friends unless you can fill the full five-men. \n\nYou can't choose your host, and so it's up to the will of the gods as to whether or not you'll get one with decent ping. \n\nThere are a few bugs and exploits that are running crazy right now, including things like disconnections not being counted by the ranked system and therefore high level players are disconnecting at the slightest hint of losing. \n\nFinally the survivors are a bit broken. Though the maps are randomly generated, anyone who plays them a few times will come to know the sections where a survivor can abuse their wall-jumping speed to constantly hop back and forth over the same wall. A pursuing killer would then either have to run back and forth hoping that they mess up, or give up and hunt other prey. Luckily this is going to be patched, but hasn't yet. \n\nSo yeah, it is not perfect, but it's fun. Ludicrous, terrifying, exhilirating fun. 8/10 would buy again.","timestamp_created":1466906036,"timestamp_updated":1466906036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23810996","author":{"steamid":"76561198107546842","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1658007868},"language":"english","review":"i really want to play the game but i cant because i need DX11 to play the game","timestamp_created":1466903956,"timestamp_updated":1466903956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23810973","author":{"steamid":"76561197993343821","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1466940821},"language":"english","review":"i like the idea of the game, but the pace is a bit too slow for me. At the moment I find that the only real way to succeed is to not give a crap about your team mates and just repair generators and get the hell away :P\n\nI suppose thats how it \"should\" be, but it doesnt make for a very entertaining game in the long run (for me, anyway). The reward for trying to rescue a team mate is just not worth it. Especially not if the Killer is a real camper :)\nIn that case you just merrily go about your business and start generators while the Killer is busy guarding that 1 poor sod who was stabbed in the back 1 minute into the game :(\nSometimes you're lucky and the hooked victim decides to spam his <space> button and tries to struggle to resist the Entity as its stabby bits close in upon his poor head... That gives YOU more time to do your stuff, while the Killer impatiently taps his foot waiting for the guy to give up and die so he can go out and find more people.\n\nI recommend the game for its concept and the polish of it. The gameplay and matchmaking needs work, but I'm hoping things become better in the near future :)","timestamp_created":1466903884,"timestamp_updated":1466903884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23810935","author":{"steamid":"76561198085249206","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1491948908},"language":"english","review":"Game has some lagging issues a bit but over all, 5/5","timestamp_created":1466903778,"timestamp_updated":1466903778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23810930","author":{"steamid":"76561198309642558","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5520,"last_played":1620028816},"language":"english","review":"This game, even through all the cons that people are listing, is still really fun.

My character is lvl 23 now, I've only been down to Rank 18 as my lowest, because regardless of me winning or losing I still had a great time.), lag, etc.  Like 90% of the cons people are listing are on their way to being in a patch, but until then, I still get my heart racing in a lot of games that are perfectly fine.
