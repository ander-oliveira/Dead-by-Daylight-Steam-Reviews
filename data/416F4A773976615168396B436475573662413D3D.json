I've played this game since the beta stages and it's come a long way. The problem is it still has a long way to go. There are still many bugs, but now the majority of them don't affect the game too much.\n\nI also feel like they're giving the killer an advantage. Basically I'm saying that the teams aren't completely balanced. I think that was an intentional feature that doesn't need to be fixed. The game itself says that the entity favors the killer. It makes the survivors jobs that much harder. I happen to like a challenge, though.\n\nCamping! OMG! People need to not get salty over it! If the killer is camping, then don't save the guy. It's that simple. And while the killer is camping, you can power a generator or two. If the killer isn't camping, save the guy, because the more people there are, the easier the game will be.\n\nSome perks are pretty useless.... I just don't use them, for the most part. They all are useful sometimes, though.\n\nOverall, though it's buggy the game is worth $20. If you can get it on sale, that's even better.\n\nData restting? \nHasen't happened to me yet... That's good, but it could still happen. I'd still like the game if my data was reset though.\n\nGood glitch : I got on once and had vanity that was exclusive to YouTubers. I had H2ODelerious's Trapper mask, and Bryce's shirt for Meg, and a panda shirt for Dwight. Dwight was bald and bearded. I had some glitchy mask for the trapper. I had a mask that was just the trapper mask, but it had not textures. It was just solid blue. I also had other stuff.

I'm a horror fan, movies, novels, games, anyhow you get the jest. I stumbled upon this game while browsing the market place and read about it. Right away I was captivated with the premise of the game. So I did some research, watched some gameplay videos online and decide to give it a shot.  I came into this game with a open mind and after playing it for over 12 hours I gotta say it's fresh, it's addicting, and it's a good change of scenery from games I normally play (A lot of FPS) \n\nThe concept of this game is simple yet fun. It seems to have a small following that continue to support it and I must say I will be one of them. The only thing that bothers me with this game some members of the community. \n\nMy biggest pet peeve is the players who swarm the hooks right away and you can see them because they clearly suck at stealth. Then they expect you to leave the victim on the meat hook and run away so that they can help them down the second you turn your back. Wrong, If I see them lurking and not even bothering to hide I'm going to stay around that area to ensure they don't F### with my sacrifice... then at the end of the game I get called a camper because I never ran away to let you get down your buddy.  Just boils my blood when they expect a victory to be handed to them in a 4v1 match.\n\nAll in all it's a fun game and it's blast to play in a group of friends. I'm interested in seeing where the developers go from here.

At least in PayDay 2, you can quit out of that host. Not so in Dead by Daylight, as once the game readies up, a person can be stuck on that loading screen for forever, forcing a task manager closing of it.\n\nFurthermore, as survivor a person can't tell what their ping is to the host.  One would think if there's no apparent grouping by locale, at least let me know if my connection to the host is garbage so I can find another host.  There's no reason to hide such relevant information from me.\n\nThe lack of information and hours lost to the P2P system being a turd means that half the game (survivor) is going to be locked to anyone without the patience of Job.

Overall game play can be fun, when the killer knows what he's doing and doesn't camp survivors. However, the game is played with a match making bug that makes it a nightmare to play with your friends. Lobbies kicking everyone, or only kicking one of your group members out. You'd think fixing that would be their biggest priority, but it isn't. I also feel like some of the newer killers are a little unbalanced like the hag and michael myers. The hag is frustrating because she gets 10 traps, unlike the trapper where you have to walk around the map and pick up the traps, she spawns with all of them. It's also very annoying not being able to disarm her traps. It is impossible to take the last couple generators with her as the killer because of  her stupid traps. Michael myers is also a bit overpowered, my only gripe with him right now is how fast he is at his first level. He can get to a max of 3 levels by stalking people, its creepy as fuck when you catch him, at level 3 he's so god damn fast its insane. All in all, its a good game, if they fixed the match making bug and balanced the game a little better I would be happy. In my oppinion the only reason they haven't balanced the killers is because they want people to purchase them.","timestamp_created":1482015825,"timestamp_updated":1482015825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28435522","author":{"steamid":"76561198302149798","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1539878986},"language":"finnish","review":"shit game\n","timestamp_created":1482015643,"timestamp_updated":1482015643,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28435458","author":{"steamid":"76561198097650018","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2716,"last_played":1629730670},"language":"italian","review":"Ora come ora non consiglierei mai questo gioco......E' innovativo ok...ma è pieno di bug.

Você escolhe entre ser um brasileiro na raça (sobrevivente) ou alguém protegido pelos direitos humanos (assassino). Sendo assim o jogo é um PvP envolvendo 4 sobreviventes e 1 assassino colocados em alguma fase que o Gugu Liberato esqueceu de reformar, locais completamente destruídos, decrépitos e velhos. Nesses estágios há vários geradores espalhados aleatoriamente no cenário e os sobreviventes (que são todos formados em engenharia elétrica) devem consertá-los apenas acariciando o aparelho. Logo que pelo menos 5 geradores forem ligados os sobreviventes poderão escapar pelos portões automáticos (custa colocar um portão com chave?), mas só conseguirão tal façanha se não forem mortos pelo assassino.\n\nCaso o jogador que controle o assassino capture algum sobrevivente, o pendurará em ganchos de rituais satânicos.
