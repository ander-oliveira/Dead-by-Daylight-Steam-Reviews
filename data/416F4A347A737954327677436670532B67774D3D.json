This is a massive problem, as it almost always means that you won't be able to pip up unless you 3k and do literally everything perfectly. The toxicity in this game is astounding, and this is from someone who's played 1700 hours of Siege. BHVR has also turned their back on the cheating epidemic almost completely, meaning that whenever you get a cheater, no matter how blatant, nothing will come of it. At least in Siege, a cheater will get banned after a few months. Not in DBD. \n Starting out as a killer, you won't have access to almost any good perks, outside of those you can get from Billy and Nurse, though everything but perhaps Tinkerer drops off in mid-high ranks. You are essentially forced to buy DLC killers to get their perks, or you can wait weeks upon weeks just to cry as you watch Iron Will and Agitation be put in the shrine for the 3rd week in a row.\n \n So, in conclusion, this game is dogshit. While you may have a wholesome interaction with a streamer that's positive once in a while, you will constantly have to face cheaters and dc's, making red ranks a swamp where hopes of ever hitting rank one is crushed by people having good coms and teamwork absolutely destroying you, or by some random Leon and his SWF friend, both with 3.5k hours, dcing after he gets downed at 5 gens because someone cleanses Haunted Grounds.","timestamp_created":1635129435,"timestamp_updated":1635129435,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524339020252227783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101585529","author":{"steamid":"76561199147708372","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1635193385},"language":"english","review":"funny ghost face tiktok trend","timestamp_created":1635129240,"timestamp_updated":1635129240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497159063816070557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101585448","author":{"steamid":"76561198901269891","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":11051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1652490720},"language":"spanish","review":"⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⢀⣴⣶⣦⣴⣿⣷⣶⣶⣄⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⡇⢀⠜⠛⠿⢿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠿⣿⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣇⢼⡞⡉⠁⠀⣿⡟⣠⡘⣷⣾⣐⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣇⢰⣯⣭⡀⢠⣿⣷⣾⣿⣿⣿⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⣉⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠛⠿⠿⣿⣿ta bueno⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⡏⠈⢇⡀⠙⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿","timestamp_created":1635129075,"timestamp_updated":1635129075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101585371","author":{"steamid":"76561198453202086","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":127,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1660201041},"language":"english","review":"scary","timestamp_created":1635128938,"timestamp_updated":1635128938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497159063816070557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101585309","author":{"steamid":"76561199013738460","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":27478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":3066,"last_played":1660097008},"language":"english","review":"i'm absolutely addicted :o\n\nEdit: That was when I had around 25 hours?

The first game is horrible and I hate it. You're a survivor running from a killer, trying to fix up generators to power exit switches to open a door to escape the hunting ground, even though in the lore you just escape back to this endless nightmare forest until you wander into another hunting ground. It's fun with friends, or so I hear.\n\nThe second game is a blast. You play as a killer hunting down a group of survivors, using your powers to strike them down and impale them on hanging meat hooks to sacrifice them to 'the entity'. You gotta think smart and weigh the balance of checking generators vs chasing survivors, and skill comes in to play with how you use the powers along with your perks and items. There's a good variety of original characters, and every few releases brings a licensed character which is always fun to see.\n\nMost importantly, this game has an active fan-base and I never have much trouble finding a game, particularly when playing at night. I've found it's harder finding games as a lone survivor, but since I mainly play killer that's not an issue for me, and if you want to play survivor then playing with friends solves that problem.\n\nAnother noteworthy mention is the challenge and progression system, the game offers 'tomes' that have a branching path of challenges, which helps focus the gameplay and give you goals within the game that rewards you with 'bloodpoints' which are spent on buying items and perks to level up your characters. It's a good loop that always gives you something to do.\n\ntl:dr; If you like running in fear, and/or survival horror with friends, you'll probably enjoy this. If you like hunting down folk and beating 'em up with spooky powers, you'll probably enjoy this.
