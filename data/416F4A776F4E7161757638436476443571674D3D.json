But then I realized that with the addition of a \"battle pass\" for pretty lack luster cosmetics, and that really being the only way you can unlock additional lore for some of the original killers that the devs put out (until someone puts the whole mini-cinematic up on youtube), that the devs don't care about the community. They're just trying to pad their bottom line. Which yes, it's a game. And games make the developer money. But when it kind of feels like a gaccha game every new \"tome\" that comes out, because the devs won't put out any good cosmetics to buy outright for some survivors/killers, no, you'll have to either buy the premium battle pass, either grind it for hours upon hours, or buy your way through the battle pass, all to get cosmetics.\n\nYeah sure, you don't have to play the game for any cosmetics at all. You can 100% just play the game as the base killers/survivors. But sadly, my little consumer brain likes some of the skins that the devs have put out, and it just frustrates me that some of the coolest concepts are not only limited time, but hidden behind a lot of bullshit walls.\n\nThe community is beyond shitty too. If you're playing by yourself, brace yourself for a deluxe experience of \"solo queueing\". You will be subjected to play with either people who just installed the game, people who are red ranks (which is the most \"skilled\" rank you can be), or people who just rage quit 5 games in a row and are about to make it 6. Often, if you are playing by yourself with randos, you will be left to die on your first death stage on a hook, and simply hang there for however long it actually takes you to bleed out, and you will die, and that's game over for you. Or you will have the randos bring the killer right to you. Seriously. For no reason. I've seen randos do this accidentally and deliberately. And I don't understand why.\n\nDbD also has a nonexistent reporting system. The whole reporting system they have in place at the end of matches and everything, it does nothing. Absolutely nothing. I think it's just there to help people feel better after a genuinely shitty game. Give them some sense of being a keyboard warrior, as they type out what the hell player x, y, or z did that was actually either trolling or greifing.  You will have players who will \"sandbag\", stand in front of you and have their hit box collide with yours so you can't continue going the place you were or so you can't either throw a pallet/vault a window/get on a gen/unhook someone, you just because they can. You will have them fast vault windows and throw pallets for no reason, which makes a \"loud noise\" indicator to the killer which reveals the location of the loud noise. Eventually the killer comes and checks it out, and it just really adds a layer of \"great, now I have to deal with this shit\" to the game that at times can already be scary/tense.\n\nThe game loses its scare factor once you learn what all the killers are, how to identify what sounds which one makes, what their powers are, and how to deal with them. But don't get me wrong, for some of the stealth killers (I'm going to use Michael Myers here as an example), just hearing Michael's breathing when he does not have a terror radius (an auditory indicator for survivors to know when you're close to a killer), you freak the hell out. It's very unnerving. But there are perks to help you combat stealth killers. So at the end of the day, when you get past all the blush of \"ooooh it's a scary game!\", you see all the problems that the game actually has, and the favortism that the devs have for certain killers/survivors.\n\nIf you play the game, or have any knowledge of the killers, you can't sit there and tell me that the devs equally like the nurse and the spirit. Or the clown and Myers. It's not a comparison. Some killers are so astronomically strong in game compared to others that you don't even notice half the time. Some killers absolutely curb stop a game, while others take it down to the wire to determine if it's a win or not. It doesn't necessarily matter if it's a skilled player you're going against either. Someone who just downloaded the game can hop in and play a game as Leatherface and come out with having killed all four survivors. But if they were to try and play the nurse, they wouldn't get a single kill. And sure, the interface when picking killers shows their skill level, and I appreciate that there is a range of easy to hard killers to pick from. But I still believe that they all should have relative equal effectivenss in game, and that if someone is truly skilled with that particular killer that only then they can be pushed to \"frustrating\" levels of success. \n\nHit boxes are also a menace. And as far as I can remember, they have been for YEARS. Literal. Years. There have been times when I'm playing killer and I'll jokingly swing at a survivor and it will down them! I will stand there and think to myself, \"there's no way in hell that should have hit\", but it did, and I got a free down. There are too many times to count when I have played survivor, vaulted a window and have had time to already start running away from it, and the killer will still swing at the window and somehow hit me. I understand lag and latency and all that, but when Team-fortress-freakin'-2 has better hit boxes than you, that's a problem.\n\nI understand that the devs haven't had much push from the market to really improve the game and keep revolutionizing the genre that they have created. Which lets be real, in a perfect world they wouldn't need to have competition from the market to keep their game on the up, but capitalism. But I am looking towards the upcoming game \"VHS\" to hopefully get the type of gameplay I am craving in this genre. Maybe even the release of VHS, an actual contender in the genre, will spur the devs to listen to their community and give the people that got the game to where it is now what they want.","timestamp_created":1646967570,"timestamp_updated":1646967570,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502958595752716064","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111952932","author":{"steamid":"76561199200663672","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2010,"last_played":1646967677},"language":"schinese","review":"是真好玩,就是被吓得直接拔线了","timestamp_created":1646967477,"timestamp_updated":1646967477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111952925","author":{"steamid":"76561198429587204","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":199346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1985,"playtime_at_review":182313,"last_played":1660347041},"language":"english","review":"The developers are henpecked by the American government.

New \"meta\" is facecamping nolife killers that just wanna ruin the game for everyone and toxic survivors (wannabe bully squads that get rekd if u know how 2 play, teabaging nolifes or trolls who refuse to do gens/help teammates)\n\n+Game is mostly fun when both sides are playing normally (without facecamping or being toxic as survivor)\n+Nice variety of chars, skins, perks and items\n-Tons of grind or real money to get chars (licence chars can only be bought with real money)\n-Some items are almost broken OP or useless (install new part addon vs the key)\n+You can make nice and different builds\n-Some perks shall forever be useless\n+Lots of maps\n-Most maps are not balanced well, RNG is horrible and makes most rounds feel almost one sided\n+-Saw hacking nolifes only a few times in almost 400h (hope they got punished)\n+Codes to get free bloodpoints (ingame currency to level up)\n+Every few months or so there is a new chapt with a new killer and/or survivor\n-Have a feeling the devs waste more time on getting more expensive cosmetics then improving gameplay/bugs (saw killers and perks being disabled for 15+ days before they fixed it..)\n-Excluding 2 emotes there is no communication in game and the game would benefit greatly from something like proximity chat (yes alot of cursing between survivors but the killer could also at least hear them)\n-Toxic survivors, tunneling and or facecamping killers are a thing and they are here just to ruin everyone's game and only thing u can do is suicide ingame/wait for the game to end....\n-Depending on when you play the que can be super long (late eu hours can have long suvivors ques while early eu hours can have ultra long killer ques)\n-The game is 2 bright (should be way darker and scarier no most maps + I saw footage of the game from few years ago and it was actually way darker and scarier..)\n-No lifes who teabag at exit gates, hatches or as a ghostface killer after knocking u (there are some who do it to show they are friendly so those are ok but there is sadly a lot of those who do it just to disrespect cos nolife sc_m - .-)\n-Rly bad for achiv hunters cos u gotta get every char meaning tons of thrown money to get licensed chars\n-Excluding a few good skins the BP is rly bad giving u way 2 many charms (u can only have 3 equipped at once)\n\nPlaying survivor solo is a nightmare due to your \"amazing\" random team mates.. Some will only provoke killer and either loop him good or fail instantly while refusing to do gens, others will be super scared and hide every time they even hear the terror radius from afar so its like playing with semi afk ppl.\nPlaying a non toxic duo, trio or 4 man pre can be super fun (unless the killer is an a**hole face camper and/or tunneler..)\n\nPlaying killer is a nightmare:\nYou might get super new players and just destroy them (it can be fun but not balanced or challenging) or you will get rly good premades (which can be fun if ur playing a strong killer very good otherwise u will just have a bad game and lose hard) and the worst premade toxic survivors whos only goal is to make your life a living hell and if ur not tryharding with a strong killer ur doomed\n\nOverall rly good game that could be even better but sadly is getting worse by the minute.. Not even the devs care enough to do something about it.. (ez fix - if killer is camping the hook make the sacrifice progress stop and if the survivors are toxic nolifes who run around the killer for 2mins make em exposed and make their movement slower..

Sometimes have the same character & cosmetic within the same game....then you see your friend get lifted by the claw later on thinking it was another player- \n- Most of the time having sales go on every other month(?) (appreciate that! Got this game during Lunar New Year <3)\n- Lobby/Player/Killer music actually changes tone/composition when an event or holiday is going on \n\n\nCons:\n- Have to buy DLC's to gain most killers and characters (sure they're cool, but should overall be $3, not $6 - $8, unless they give within the DLC the actual cosmetics so we do not have to pay for them in the store)\n- Having to buy Auric Cells to unlock outfits \"cheaper\" (could have a system of where you could exchange cells with iridescent shards or blood points).\n- More than likely you'll have a group of newbies instantly paired with a very experienced killer...basically throwing fresh meat into a piranha pool\n- Can have a whole group of experienced players with a newbie killer....lots of trolling so be prepared (I enjoy it! though perhaps not many other killers would-)\n- Still see hackers once in a while appear as killers (get 4 players within 5-10 minutes no matter the experience level-)\n- If you do play as killer be prepared to WWWAAAAIIIIITTTTT for a lobby UNLESS you have friends to play with.  Sitting in the lobby once took me a full 30 minutes to 1 hour just to get into a game.\n- Still quite a bit of bugs (ex: Being a survivor and getting the killer's 1st person view), though I do hope they get fixed!\n\n\nOverall, I would give this game a good 75-80% vote!  \nFun to play online and/or with friends, though could polish every now and then away at some of those same reoccurring bugs.","timestamp_created":1646954100,"timestamp_updated":1646954100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519797623157501221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111943286","author":{"steamid":"76561198192862834","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":284,"playtime_at_review":1749,"last_played":1660185338},"language":"spanish","review":"","timestamp_created":1646951861,"timestamp_updated":1646951861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111943161","author":{"steamid":"76561197986839215","num_games_owned":701,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1246,"last_played":1647098985},"language":"russian","review":"Игру больше не купить по политическим причинам.","timestamp_created":1646951654,"timestamp_updated":1646951654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582663357257843018","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111943054","author":{"steamid":"76561198258145745","num_games_owned":391,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2976,"last_played":1626691149},"language":"russian","review":"а что я сделал то чтобы не играть в игры?

Also it has this distinctive contemporary \"i play it until it is not fun anymore and then continue playing\" vibe. Not recommended. I bought all characters and i have all killer teachables unlocked, all survivor teachables (minus 2 survivors)\n\nPlaying killer is just, like, not fun. The real killers of the game are the survivors and they kill your motivation to play as a killer, therefore killer player rates are significantly lower and divided into 2 groups: great impossible to beat killers and new killers. Even if you have the most advanced matchmaking system, this will not mitigate the gap.\n\nIt's extremely fun to play survivor, because you get noob killers all the time and 4 medium skilled survivors are still volumes better than one medium killer and they will win. If you get a good killer, you get destroyed or you manage to avoid the killer and escape alive (wow skill).\n\nTeabagging, flashlight clicking after they vault every next pallet. They can see you are struggling, they feel superior and they start bullying. AND there is 4 of them. AND they can see around corners without showing themselves. Sometimes they run perks to use strategies to annoy and lots and lots of killer disconnect because of it (this last particular thing i didn't see as much in this last year i was playing)\n\n\nI can understand, it's very easy to fall into the bullying survivor mentality, when the killers also bully survivors in various ways. Weird that the game allows things like camping (score penalty, but people play for fun, not for score), tunneling (no penalty i think), insta mori without downing, AFK etc. It's very easy to make the game not fun from either side in my opinion.\n\n[h1] Map size, killer mobility [/h1]\nThe killer mobility vs the map sizes doesn't make sense at all: maps are too big for the killer, killers are too slow for the map. Hard to get from edge to edge of the map. Therefore BHVR creates crazy killers that can teleport, move more quickly, skip walls, become invisible. There are also certain other tools to fix the mobility issue, like hindering the survivor somehow, make him do additional tasks (for example experienced players play with time in mind and WONT, mostly, cleanse & heal against plague etc because it takes too much game time to the killer to do stuff and for survivor to not do stuff). As Trapper (got better when they gave him a second trap) i should choose an area of the map that i basically give away to survivors and never go there, all to secure my victory. Some traps won't get picked up, ever. When you try to play a killer that doesn't have any of that mobility fixes (most killers out of the box; some of them even have a movement speed nerf attached to them, especially if they have far-reaching attacks), you will quickly find that if the survivors know their shit at least a little bit, few things will happen almost always:\n\n- the gens are gone FAST, you might even struggle to hook 1 survivor in the timespan\n- when you find one, he posesses all the certifications and skills to, as they call it, \"run you for the whole game\", like it's actually very very hard to counter \"press W\" survivor strategy\n- if you by any chance face a team that isn't that good, you instantly see it and this means you basically never play good, it's the enemy skill that determines the outcome\n- when you actually win, you can clearly see why you win: they messed up for some reason, they used wrong perks, you used an OP perk\n\nIt's never YOU that wins a killer game. It's also never you that wins a survivor game, because if you only do the gens, it's boring and it's only fun if you are the one that is running the killer. So, 1 guy interacts with the enemy and the others do gens, which is boring, but, this is the strategy that is the best for survivors to win. But since it's boring, almost every survivor is flying around the killer and the runner person, there might even be many of them. In result, you run the killer for 20 minutes and still lose.\n\nI think there is no fun to be had in the game but i will still play it, being hopeful to have fun. Sometimes happens\n\n[h1] Dead by Daylight is dead [/h1]\nCurrently every first game of the day is AFK, today i just had a second game with killer AFKing.
