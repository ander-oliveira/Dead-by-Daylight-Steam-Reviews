In the most recent patch, the de-sync between killer/survivor on their \"dedicated\" servers has become so bad that the game itself becomes almost unplayable for survivors. Hits will register positively when killers are almost double their lunge range, making it nearly impossible for survivors to participate in the core game mechanic: looping/avoiding the killer.\n\nIn addition, the company willfully ignores player feedback from PTB and other sources, and implements features that are strongly discouraged by the community (such as the most recent UI overhaul). In addition, EVERY PATCH CREATES NEW GAME BREAKING BUGS. These bugs MAY be addressed within a month, but likely they will persist until the next mid-chapter update (in between the \"paid chapter\" updates). So if a bug exists, learn to live with it.\n\nIf you're still unconvinced that this game isn't in a good place, and wish to purchase it, do the following:\n1) Wait for a sale on the base game (aim for $10)\n2) If you want to play killer, purchase the Leatherface Pack (for BBQ and Chili) and the Plague pack (for Corrupt Intervention and Infectious Fright), and use the Whispers base perk.\n3) If you want to play survivor, no additional packs are required, you can make very strong builds with the original four survivors + Bill\n4) Try your best not to get frustrated at the state of the game, and hope it improves soon.","timestamp_created":1613172895,"timestamp_updated":1613172895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502634882926940918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86501053","author":{"steamid":"76561198129899580","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16703,"last_played":1658521568},"language":"german","review":"Dafür kauf ich das Spiel, für BUGS (~alina)","timestamp_created":1613172875,"timestamp_updated":1613173286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86500862","author":{"steamid":"76561198874374131","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":138,"playtime_at_review":9075,"last_played":1660154219},"language":"thai","review":"มือคิลเลอร์ยาว8เมตร","timestamp_created":1613172637,"timestamp_updated":1613172637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86500787","author":{"steamid":"76561198125152913","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1635888038},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game for horror fans, competitive players, and friends alike!

I love this game!\nWhen I started playing in Sep 2020, I was in a low point in my life and DbD just helped take a lot of those dark times away. In spite of its steep learning curve, I had so much fun getting the grasp of survivor to begin with and the array of killers to face up against were fun and challenging. From loud speedy killers to insiduous stealthy killers like Myers. Really loved the visuals and they were vivid and captivating back then. Imagine my joy on how good they look today, too!\n\nOnto killer- that was an even crueller learning curve but addictive and one I'd come back to.\nThat role is way more fun although I am wary about playing killer if I'm tired or grumpy.\nThe map pressure you generate and multi tasking is tricky but really feel a sense of satisfaction when I do get it right! I do sometimes wish I could vary what perks I bring and feel I sometimes have to play around SWFs or common survivor perks but I feel in time I won't have to really do that once I get my bearings around maps and sorts.\nReally like the cosmetics BHVR bring out too!\n\nSo the dark side... I'll admit I fluctuate with that. I sometimes feel BHVR are survivor sided but recently I feel they have taken on board some of the challenges killers experience and now I am seeing a backlash from survivor mains. So, at this point, I can appreciate how tricky it is for them to get an earful from both sides.\n\nMe? I am one to respect that the meta undergoes changes to just ride out the wave. \nYes bugs, glitches, all things wrong... easy to think why why why. But BHVR take on the feedback and don't always get a thank you for it xD\nHaving played LoL for 6 years and feeling how more and more impersonal the gaming company was- I have come to appreciate that BHVR at least view their fanbase as a family and will try if and when.\n\nI look forward to seeing DbD go above and beyond how it currently is doing on its current trajectory :)","timestamp_created":1613168406,"timestamp_updated":1613168406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86497304","author":{"steamid":"76561198209702437","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4659,"last_played":1635135954},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1613168263,"timestamp_updated":1613168263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86497191","author":{"steamid":"76561198033567809","num_games_owned":426,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":23846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23358,"last_played":1647296652},"language":"english","review":"Bad Game.
