What the actual hell is wrong with bhvr lmao\n\nSo. This game is fun, and it gave me a lot of enjoyment for the 1000+ hours I played it for. I won't pretend like I always hated this game or that it's always been a shitshow, but ever since the fucking clown update BHVR has continuously put in micro-transaction schemes that are extremely hostile especially to neuro-divergent people like myself. This game is NOT free to play, and yet nearly every free to play micro-transaction scheme is present in the game, save for loot boxes, which is a very small blessing. This game will devour your wallet, the devs will not fix the plethora of bugs they add with every update and PAID DLC they release, opting instead of pinch every penny out of your wallet and adding new, exciting broken features to their already busted game. I've never been more disappointed in a game I loved. I thought the separation from starbreeze would make things way better, and for a while it did. But then it got worse. \n\n0/10\n\n[Previous review below]\nHonestly? The game is so much better than it was when I originally reviewed it, and still much better after I edited my initial review. I'm gonna keep the old review in, but in parenthesis. That review is outdated, but feel free to read it.\n\nSince the dead by daylight team at bhvr seperated from starbreeze, I have been nothing but impressed. They have a very voherent plan laid out for their game, and it seems like they are actually focusing on making a game they love rather than making it for money. The changes are well welcomed, the balance changes were much needed and the pallet changes are excellent. Most of the negative reviews you will see on this game recently are people very upset about the balance changes. The balance changes have actually made things more balanced, and they don't like it because they aren't as good anymore. Which is understandable since if you bought the game for that reason and don't get that feeling anymore I would also be disappointed, but you also have to realise this is more how the game was envisioned.\n\nThe community for this game is, to be honest, terrible. Only in rust have I seen a community more toxic and abysmal than the Dead by Daylight community. However, the game is still extremely enjoyable and fun, and you can also just hide the chat so you don't have to deal with people. All in all, this game is easily one of my favorites, and I only see it getting better in the future.\n\nHowever I still stand fully by my statement that the doctor is the actual worst part of any video game I have EVER played. But that's just an opinion.\n\nTL;DR This game is fun, the community is shit, the devs are working on making the game a better experience and I couldn't be happier with the direction they're going.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1509134640,"timestamp_updated":1634591100,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36055212","author":{"steamid":"76561198167160838","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1626369162},"language":"turkish","review":"arkadaşlarınızla eğlenerek oynayacağınız bir oyun. :)","timestamp_created":1509134469,"timestamp_updated":1509134469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36055116","author":{"steamid":"76561198285814590","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":58702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29115,"last_played":1631611016},"language":"english","review":"\"pretty good job so far\", serriously","timestamp_created":1509134196,"timestamp_updated":1529136965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36054971","author":{"steamid":"76561198151231220","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1529129594},"language":"russian","review":"Игра клаасссс,можно поугарать повеселиться","timestamp_created":1509133810,"timestamp_updated":1509133810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480362534523010254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36054940","author":{"steamid":"76561198091852333","num_games_owned":688,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":36706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":4060,"last_played":1660588551},"language":"english","review":"Hey, it's pretty good!

It's a fun concept, extremely addicting, and a breath of fresh air from  most online multiplayer games.\n\nThe devs seem to be a small but dedicated team. Other players may say otherwise, but they listen to their players. It's easy to see that they're always keeping themselves busy and always looking on ways to grow and improve. You can feel that this game has heart and isn't just a pumped out cash grab. They want this game to be great and they want people to have fun.\n\nIt's a great game, it really is. But there's definitely room for improvement. \n\nGetting this out of the way. There are a few bugs here and there but like I said, the devs are always working on the game and usually try their best to fix it. I have to reset the game at least once every day for it to work right again ( it's usually trying to join servers with friends for me ).\n\n_________________________________________\n\nThe amount of fun you'll have in a game relies completely on the 4 other people you're playing with. You can have extremely toxic survivors who DC as soon as things get tough. You can get extremely laggy killers who just suck all joy out of you as you lose your mind ( and your items ) losing in unplayable match running into walls and teleporting. You can get survivors who just hide, do nothing and wait for matches to play themselves out. You can get pallet looped by survivors and then get called a cheater as soon as you finally get them. Or you can get the infamous face camping killer with the combo of 3 crouching survivors watching you bleed out.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nWith so many different ways to play the game, it's hard to really tell what's balanced and what's fun for most of the players. As soon as something changes, someone will be extremely vocal about how they hate it. You always have to look at game at every angle. You can't please everyone, but you can sure as hell try.\n\nThe game has so much potential with future killers, perks, maps, items, perks. They can do so much with it.\n\nI personally would love if killers had some more incentive to get the hell away from the hook. I might of lost some people there lol. I would personally sacrifice a perk slot so that the entity would consume me slower if he's at a certain range. Or if Killers had a perk that would considerably speed it up if they leave. I know that other players can do gens while you're hanging there, odds are they wont, and that's not fun. I don't see how fun it could be staying in the same area can be either. \n_________________________________________\n\nLess seriously. I wish the game would give itself a little more visual polish here and there. There are so many slots for character customization and it kills me seeing such little things you can do. There's so much potential with the killers especially to make some really fucking rad skins. It would be nice if levels started having some more personal aesthetics to them too to stir things up a bit. IE: like how Lery's memorial has unique hooks, it'd be nice to see gen's, doors, lockers get a change here and there. ( NOT the hatch though. )\n\nEver consider the steam workshop? \n_________________________________________\n\nOverall, I highly recommend. You can play competitively, you can play for fun, you can play with friends or you can play alone, ect. I'm really pumped to see where this game goes next.","timestamp_created":1509124740,"timestamp_updated":1510714640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549549520015716553","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36050973","author":{"steamid":"76561198376885022","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1625816415},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏不错的，希望可以继续下去","timestamp_created":1509124645,"timestamp_updated":1509124645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36050874","author":{"steamid":"76561198086333843","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1638639027},"language":"english","review":"Fun
