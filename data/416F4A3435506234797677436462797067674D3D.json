You have to invest a bunch of time or money to access a lot of the game content as most of the perks are locked behind characters you have to pay for racking the price of this game if you want everything in it.

It's been about 2 years of playing total. No matter how bad it was with the bugginess, general imbalance, and overpriced cosmetics, I still had fun and I was getting to play a videogame about the horror genre with other people. I was willing to try and accept that Behavior had inadvertently been contributing to NFTs after their first round of tweets explaining that they just made the models and gave those and the steam codes to the license holders. I figured, alright sure, they aren't /that/ bad, they wouldn't purposefully create things if they had known they would be used for NFTs. Cue today where, contradicting their own previous explanation, Behavior announced how happy they were to knowingly collaborate with a company that buys and sells NFTs for /months/. Did they announce this when the DLC in questions involved with NFTs was released? No! Of course not! They gathered up the money and waited a few weeks before dropping this bomb so that refunds wouldn't be possible. The fact that consumers and /employees/ of Behavior were unaware of the fact that they were contributing to NFTs-- whether through paid money or the actual created in game content-- is one of the worst things I've seen from a company in a long time. This is beyond low, this is beyond scummy. The level of disrespect, lack of communication, and deliberate attempts to get as much money as they could before trying to cover their tracks is unacceptable. I wish any game dev at Behavior who didn't know about this good fortune if they're attempting to find a new job. What a fucking disgusting move from a greedy, cash grab exec team.

А что нам, Дуайтам с двуми стандартными перками. \n\nСейчас вернулся, чтобы поиграть за манов, и мне приглянулся брутальный дед с ружьём, который выдаёт снайперские выстрелы своим гарпуном, насаживая сурвов на свой штык-нож. Ну и что же я получил?\n\n- Оскорбления в чате и заметки обиженных в профиле. Выиграл ли ты или проиграл - без разницы. \n- Пати сурвов с дисиком, которые тебя загенрашат и будут рофлить с тебя в чате.\n- Приседание после скидывания палетки и у ворот, щёлканье фонариков, показыванием пальцев и так далее.\n- Мета-перки, которые дают сурвам чувствовать себя безнаказанно или те, которые откровенно говоря дают возможность издеваться над маном. Палеты и хижина, которые можно крутить до одурения. Генраш.\n- Кодекс чести сурвов, который запрещает ману играть так, как он хочет. Низя же играть от земли, брать НОЕД (Который может хоть как-то в конце перевернуть игру в твою пользу, если, конечно, его не снесут до этого момента, с учётом того, что тотемы, в большинстве случаев, они расставлены на видных местах), туннелить, токсичить в ответ и обязательно всех развешивать поочередно. Конечно, ман же заходит игру, чтобы сурвам было интересно играть.\n- Разработчики, которые на стороне сурвов. \n\nСо всем этим я готов был смирится, если бы не чёртов нёрф моего любимого деда. Ведь бедным сурвам очень трудно уворачиваться и они пугаются!\n\n Спасибо разработчикам за баланс и убийство Калеба, который и так был хромой со скоростью 4.4, но мог фастзумиться и выдавать красивые выстрелы, фейковать, беря всех на реакцию.
