I've played Dead by Daylight the first day it came out in 2016. I actually took a break for a year and came back 2017 because I didn't have a compatible computer at the time. \n\nSince 2017 I've been playing and let me tell you that the development of the game since 2016 till now is such a mess. Yes the game is so much better than it was in 2016, but with every update that the DEVs release breaks the game. More bugs, more glitches, more crashes, and sometimes people can't even play the game due to some game issue. A lot of DBD\"s player base has given feedback on the glitches and bugs in this game and what they want to see in this game but the developers won't listen. The 4.5.1 patch was the WORST patch for this game imo. With the most recent patch, 4.5.2, the desync and hitboxes were fixed which made me happy since now I can loop the killer without being hit from 5-20 meters away. \n\nI don't hate this game. I still love this game even with all the bugs that seem to come out with every patch. I've seen this game grow since it's release and there has been improvements. However, the devs could do so much better and listen to the players' feedback. I do recommend this game because it's still enjoyable. I recommend playing with friends. Playing solo survivor is very frustrating.","timestamp_created":1468875076,"timestamp_updated":1614539768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513280689716339111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24396602","author":{"steamid":"76561198027905886","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1133,"last_played":1639018930},"language":"english","review":"Love this game just waiting for some more features within kill your friends mode.","timestamp_created":1468874951,"timestamp_updated":1468874951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500041961669921875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24396555","author":{"steamid":"76561198178010943","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1760,"last_played":1479570979},"language":"english","review":"why killer move so fast and no need cd?\ngot hacker?","timestamp_created":1468874780,"timestamp_updated":1468874780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24396532","author":{"steamid":"76561198289257941","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":221068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1865,"playtime_at_review":97886,"last_played":1660599835},"language":"russian","review":"Игра имеет свои плюсы и минусы, каждый сам тут выбирает на чём они фокусируются больше.","timestamp_created":1468874688,"timestamp_updated":1619284105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24396510","author":{"steamid":"76561198088523229","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1432,"last_played":1600466814},"language":"english","review":"I just cant recommend this game in it's current state.

And instead of fixing these bugs, the developers try to implement new game modes (like Survive With Friends for example) and thereby introduce even more bugs. Joining a lobby may take a dozen attempts, each time yielding an \"unable to join\" error. Sometimes, survivors join with a killer character causing the game to crash when the map is finally being loaded. Worst of all, additional survivors may happen to join a running and already full game causing it to crash instantly.

Dead by Daylight\n[i]Genre:[/i] Asymmetric 4v1 Multiplayer Survival Horror\n[i]Developer:[/i] Behaviour Digital Inc.\n[i]Publisher:[/i] Starbreeze Studios\n[i][u]Copy supplied by Steam[/u][/i]\n\n[b]Dead by Daylight[/b] is an asymmetric 4v1 multiplayer survival horror game developed by Behaviour Digital Inc. and published by Starbreeze Studios.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nDeveloped with Unreal Engine 4, the game looks pretty decent: the four survivors and three killers are well modeled, but they are also nothing special. The maps are pretty big, but they all tend to look pretty similar with just a few [i]landmarks[/i] to help you navigate them. The feeling of confusion that you get is probably made on purpose to make you feel like the characters in slasher movies that keep running in circles. Still, the performance is pretty good, but beware of a couple of bugs that, while not game breaking, might lessen the enjoyment to those \"graphics\" purists that want their games to be 100% bug free (which is impossible).\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe game is the opposite of [i]Evolve[/i]: four survivors are trying to repair five generators in order to open a door to escape, while one killer has to find and kill them. This is a pretty simple setup that luckily does not get repetitive.\nWhen repairing a generator, a random prompt will appear that will force the survivor to press Spacebar to avoid getting detected by the killer. While escaping, survivors can make small barricades fall to block the path of the killer, and they can vault open windows. Meanwhile, the killer has to hit a survivor twice to make him fall to the ground, and when that happens he has to bring him to a hook to impale him. If another survivor doesn't manage to save him in time, the victim will die.\nEach one of the four survivors has different perks (one can run faster, another can disable traps faster, etc.), and each one of the three killers has a different skill: the Trapper can place bear traps, the Wraith can become invisible (but can't attack while in that state), and the Hillbilly can sprint with a chainsaw to instantly stun a survivor.\nThere is also the Bloodweb, an upgrade system that is randomly generated for each player: with the Bloodpoints you gain at the end of each match, you can buy perks, items (such as flashlights and medikits), add-ons, and offerings that last only one match.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nThe game is 100% balanced: good survivors can elude the killer, and a good killer can kill all survivors. The only thing that makes the game go from very fun to very frustrating is its community: a LOT of survivors will avoid saving you when impaled, opting to escape without even trying to help, and a LOT of killers will camp nearby the hook, stopping the survivors from trying to save you since it would result in their death as well.\nIf you are a hook camper and you are reading this, know that you are a really, REALLY dumb player, since getting only one kill won't lead to anything other than getting a mere 6000 points, instead of many more if you go find other survivors.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nSound is everything in this game: as a killer you can hear ravens that are startled by the survivors, and as a survivor your heartbeat will increase the closer the killer is to you. Once you are seen, the soundtrack kicks in, making you lose your shit.\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nThe game is highly replayable thanks to daily challenges, the Bloodweb system, constant updates, and 50 very hard-to-get achievements.\n\nWhile waiting for the upcoming [i]Friday the 13th Game[/i], this is a solid substitue that gets better with time: it is intense, it is fun, and it is highly replayable. Highly recommended.\n\n[h1]Story: n/a\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 10\nSound: 8.5\nReplayability: 9\n\n[b]ENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 7.5[/b][/h1]\n\nFollow me on Twitter:

Both are abusive of their powers and this makes it hard to enjoy the game.\nThat being said, I love the adrenaline rush that pumps through when the music picks up the tension, and how active listening, sighting and stealth is the way to winning- as well as teamwork, of course. You can either be a hero and save people whenever you can or be a isolated survivor and fend for yourself. The rounds' ending is completely at random, based on yours and others' efforts to either kill or survive.\nI expect the issues about abusive powers to be dealt with, however.","timestamp_created":1468841813,"timestamp_updated":1468841813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24388205","author":{"steamid":"76561198093833489","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1465929005},"language":"english","review":"Got boring after a while.","timestamp_created":1468841189,"timestamp_updated":1468841189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.379080981016159058","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24388015","author":{"steamid":"76561198071889269","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":112940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":974,"playtime_at_review":3978,"last_played":1660341799},"language":"german","review":"Die Bugs erhöhen sogar noch den Schwierigkeitsgrad, das macht alles noch viel spannender. :)","timestamp_created":1468840342,"timestamp_updated":1468840342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24387913","author":{"steamid":"76561198075744486","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3430,"last_played":1580666488},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoyed this game for a while but it is so unbalanced that is almost unplayable on high levels as a killer unless you are a god or the survivors mess up.

В общем 4 человека на маленькой карте, в ловушке одного из трёх, пока что доступных в игре маньяков, должны включить четыре из 5 или 6 генераторов на карте, что бы затем можно было открыть ворота главного выхода и свалить ко всем чертям оттуда.\n\nО самой игре и её сеттинге: Мы можем играть за одного из четырёх выживших или за одного из трёх маньяков. За выжившего у вас есть специальные перки, причём у каждого из четырёх есть свои собственные, вы играете от 3-его лица, а маньяк нет, но у него выше скорость, поэтому на картах есть доски, которые можно ранять прямо на маньяка, камни за которыми можно спрятаться, окна, через которые можно сигануть и многое другое.

It seems like nobody actually tests this game.\n\nEdit: After not playing this game for probably 9 months because of how poor the quality of it was, I came back to try to play it today, only to be met with an error code that they can't read my save file. So now I can't even play it. I'm probably never going to buy anything from this studio again.
