There is no other asymmetrical game on the level of Dead By Daylight as all the others have failed commercially, but that's also a major problem.\n\nThis game suffers from a combination of things that include: poor game design, bafflingly incompetent developers, cheaters, hackers, excessive grinding, bugs, glitches, slow updates/quality of life fixes, stale meta game, toxicity, mistreatment of content creators/players, NFTs, DDoSing, etc.\n\nThe game revolves around agency manipulation, being able to minimize how much the other side is able to do at any given time. If one side has too much agency and their choices matter too much, then the other side suffers because their agency is removed. Dead By Daylight proudly totes its manipulation of what players are able to do at any given time as a viable strategy: one side being unable to do anything against the other is a valid tactic that developers encourage, which means one side isn't going to be having fun [b]BY DESIGN[/b].\n\nDead By Daylight operates on a system of four Survivors versus one Killer: the goal of the Survivors is to complete five generators which are spread throughout the map, to power the exit gates, open them, and escape. If all but one Survivor is alive, The Hatch opens and they may escape through that, though the Killer may close it and activate the exit gates. \n\nThe goal of the Killer is to reverse the namesake of the Survivors by killing them: they can do this by utilizing hooks throughout the map to place the Survivor on and once a Survivor has been hooked three times, they are out of the game. If the Survivor is on the hook too long, they will progress a hook state. A Survivor may save them-self or be saved by another Survivor.\n\nThat's a brief fly by, but even a ignorant fool can look at this brief summary and ask \"Well, what keeps the Killer from just waiting by the hook once they got someone?\" Fantastic question, nothing. Besides losing out on stopping generators from being repaired, there is no reason for a Killer to leave a hooked Survivor. That's not all, this game has several other mechanics that completely rob a player of their ability to play: Michael Myers with the right customization, can instantly Kill you by staring at you long enough and the way you counter this is by interacting with him as little as possible. There's a Killer in the game that has traps she can place near hooks to know when people go near them, which then they let her teleport there and attack whoever is trying to save the other person. There's a strategy where the Killer just opens the exit gates early, which starts the end game timer (if this timer goes to zero, every Survivor still in the trial dies) and then traps the Survivors in the trial so they can literally do nothing as they wait to inevitably die with no say in the matter. You know Amanda from the Saw franchise? Well, she's in this game and one strategy that she can utilize is having each Survivor start the match with a reverse bear trap on (same one she survived in the first movie); how do they get them off? By opening boxes around the map that have a key in them, but here's the rub: she can just stand in front of one and there's a chance the key to at least one Survivors trap is in the box she's standing in front of, so they can't get out of the trap and just end up dying through no fault of their own. This kind of stupid stuff is in the game all the time, ranging from by design to completely overlooked by the developers.\n\nGame balance, fixing, and quality of life changes arrive at a snail's pace: The Trapper, the very first Killer in the game, didn't get buffs or changes until 2021, this game came out in 2016. They released a Killer called The Legion is such a broken state that they nerfed him into the ground and they're only getting a rework THIS YEAR (The Killer came out in 2018) and even worse, the premise promised to us by the trailer, an Among Us style Killer that pretends to be a Survivor, was not the final product by any means. There are abilities and perks in the game that are either useless, extremely niche, or overpowered and yet hardly receive any changes from patch to patch, but you can damn well be sure they're on that three month content schedule to pump out more DLC like flies on shit so they can make money.\n\nThe game has been out since 2016 and still only has one game mode, as well as forces you into Skill Based Match Making whether you like it or not, which by the way is only determined by how many escapes you get as Survivor or kills you get as Killer: nothing else registers where you're placed with in games besides the end results, which I'm pretty sure because the developers don't know how to accurately read game data from actual matches and just read results based on their point system, is the reason they came up with how it works. They spent three years developing this system by the way, something anyone could have come up with in an afternoon.\n\nCheaters and hackers are diligently cracking Dead By Daylight's security, selling their exploits constantly to those willing to buy and while Behavior says they're trying to do something about it, the end result of their efforts has been unnoticeable or non-existent. Content creators suffer from this the most, having their matches taken hostage and being unable to do anything but disconnect, receiving a penalty that they had no control over. Behavior doesn't like to listen to their content creators and even punish them by taking away their exclusive cosmetics if they get a little too critical of the way they do things.\n\nThe grind is atrocious. For reference, you earn on average 20,000 points to 35,000 points a match excluding offerings, perks, and events. These points going into buying items on the Blood Web, the character progression system that's semi-randomly generated. Each Blood Web takes on average, 80,000-90,000 points. Perks are ways you change how your character plays and you must level a perk three times in the Blood Web for maximum effectiveness. This means in order to get a perk from tier 1 to 3, you must spend at least a quarter of a million points and that's if the game even gives you those other tiers: the Blood Web is partially based on random number generation, so you might just want to level one perk to tier three but end up going through a stupid amount of Blood Webs to do so. There's also having to level up each character to get their teachable perks for other characters, which means leveling a Survivor or Killer to 40, takes around 3,000,000 points.

Wieso?\nNun, das ist relativ simpel. DbD ist halt (mal abgesehen von den Tunnler und Camper Runden) in jedem Spiel anders. Durch die unzähligen Killer und Maps gibts selten zweimal das gleiche Spielerlebnis und man ist gefordert seine Taktik der des Killers anzupassen um zu Überleben. Teamwork wäre eigentlich ein wichtiger Bestandteil und trotzdem muss man auch mal gegen seine trollenden Mitspieler ankommen. Oder man wird selbst zum Troll, das ist auch immer eine Option. \nKlar, das Gen reparieren wird wohl kaum jemand als tolle Beschäftigung anpreisen, trotzdem hat es teilweise schon fast etwas meditatives.\nDer Spass liegt natürlich darin den Killer in eine endlose Jagd zu verwickeln und sein Können immer und immer wieder unter Beweis zu stellen. \nUnd ganz ehrlich, kein Spiel hat bei mir bis jetzt so viele verschiedene Emotionen geweckt wie DbD. Es ist witzig, frustrierend, herausfordernd, überfordernd, unterfordernd, zynisch, episch, heroisch usw. \nFür mich ist genau das der Grund um immer wieder zu spielen. Nach jeder beschissenen Runde gebe ich dem Spiel erneut eine Chance (teilweise einfach mit genügend Zeit dazwischen). \nDie Killer sind sehr individuell und haben teilweise grandiose Eigenschaften die mit der richtigen Taktik schon ziemlich stark sein können. \nEs gibt aber auch einige Killer die meiner Meinung nach nicht unbedingt im Spiel bleiben müssten ;) aber auch da muss ich sagen, gehört halt auch zu DbD. \n\nOb diese Rezession jetzt für oder gegen DbD spricht muss im Endeffekt jeder für sich entscheiden. \nFür mich, nach etwa 3000 Spielstunden, ist es trotz des Frustes und Hasses halt doch mein Lieblingsspiel und wird es vermutlich noch lange bleiben. \n\nNun wünsche ich auf jeden Fall viel Spass beim Überleben/Töten und Taktiken erlernen :)","timestamp_created":1634572708,"timestamp_updated":1645029175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101253626","author":{"steamid":"76561197971666481","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":95279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":818,"playtime_at_review":61945,"last_played":1660520847},"language":"english","review":"I'm Still playing this","timestamp_created":1634571944,"timestamp_updated":1634571944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477346032857894897","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101253495","author":{"steamid":"76561198861750351","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":26752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21973,"last_played":1659259973},"language":"russian","review":"New code: DBDDAYJP2021 202100 blood points","timestamp_created":1634571759,"timestamp_updated":1634571759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42bWEyvwCd5egggM="}
