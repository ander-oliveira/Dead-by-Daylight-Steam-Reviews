Jedoch hat sich das mit den neuesten Updates gewaltig geändert. Ich verstehe das die Überlebenden damals mehr Vorteile hatten, jedoch müssen diese die ganze Arbeit leisten! 1 von 6 Überlebenden kann sich gegen den Killer wehren, während die Killer immer mehr an unfairen Vorteilen dazu gewinnen. Bestes Beispiel Michael Myers. Stalking Modus, wodurch jegliche Perks wie kalter Rückenschauer und Vorahnung unbrauchbar werden und sich dieser unbemerkt anschleichen kann, während man selbst durch Generator-Reparatur oder Haken-Sabotage Krach macht. Zu dem die 3 Stufen der \"Evil Within\", bei der Michael an Geschwindigkeit ansteigt und die Survivor mit einem Schlag zu Boden bringen kann. gebufft bis zum geht nicht mehr. Zu dem wird das Campen nicht einmal bestraft, nein ich habe das Gefühl es wird eher gepusht.\nEin Abzug von Punkten fürs Campen wäre angebracht, damit das mal aufhört, ansonsten leidet nur der Teamgeist unter den Überlebenden und das ist an erster Stelle nicht der Sinn!\nKiller erhalten mehr Punkte als früher und sogar für den Disconnect der Survivor erhalten sie Punkte?! Während man die Punkte der Surivor sogar noch um die Hälfte z.b. bei Haken-Sabotage reduziert hat.\nDen Survivorn stehen ebenfalls Bonus-Punkte zu..\n\nMein nächster Mangel: der Keller.\nKiller stellt sich an die Treppe und Body-blocked die Survivor, die dadurch nicht einmal eine Chance zu fliehen haben.\nFairness? Wohl kaum. Ein zweiter Ausgang wäre angebracht.\nVon Balance haben die Spiele Entwickler wohl noch nie gehört. Spiel überhaupt nicht zu empfehlen, da für die Survivor die OP Killer kaum zu managen sind.\nWer jedoch auf nervige Camper steht, ist hier genau richtig.\nNehmt die Buffs von den Killern ab oder bufft die Survivor genauso um eine Balance zu schaffen, vorher würde ich dieses Spiel nicht einmal mit meinem Allerwertesten ansehen.","timestamp_created":1477525832,"timestamp_updated":1477525832,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":120,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596330940723419189","comment_count":19,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26238140","author":{"steamid":"76561198017326340","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":14861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1657254645},"language":"english","review":"Game would be good if you could actually join a game. \"No matches found, please try again\" 20 minutes later finally can get into a game....

It has been sitting in my library for a long time now, and i have been looking at it, saying to myself that one day, one day i will play this again, but it has yet to happen. If you dont have 5 friends to play with, or even 4, the game becomes boring incredibly fast. The Survivors are often so slow and suck at everything, that you end up cringing sometimes just because your survivor just was too stupid to jump over that piece of wood to run from the killer. This basically makes it so that you HAVE to have some friends to coordinate with, because otherwise you most often just end up getting killed as the survivor.\n\nHowever, playing the killer is something else. I win almost every game i play as killer, but not nearly as much as survivor.

It's broken as hell and the devs don't seem to know what the hell they're doing half the time.\n\nAnd that's perfectly okay.\n\nDead by Daylight is a very fun game to play, solo or otherwise. The pure adrenaline of running away from the killer is something quite extraordinary. Learning all the different ways to juke the killer is something to behold as it will take hours to get right. But once you do, it's incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe current gripe the community has with the game (v1.2.1) is that the new killer, Michael Myers, is incredibly OP. This is not the case. He came out approximately 15 hours before posting this review and already the community is whining about the new killer. \n\nIf there's anything to take from that is that the community for this game can sometimes be sub-par due to them being really picky about how the game plays and are impatient about learning how to play against a killer who changes the way you play just a bit.\n\nAnother gripe the community has is that the [b]Halloween[/b] DLC makes the game Play to Win. Once again, this is not the case. Yes, the DLC is $7 and includes a killer and survivor. But that doesn't mean you have to pay to get them. You can unlock the killer and survivor in game, but you cannot level them up. Yes it does suck that it's behind a paywall to get any big use out of them but that isn't pay to win, it's just inconvinient. \n\nOverall, Dead by Daylight is an incredibly fun game that can keep you entertained for hours with its \"one more game\" mentality.

To me it feels like the more the game is updated the worse the game gets. Main reason for me is new content.\n\nThe devs focus too much on adding new stuff (characters and maps) rather than expanding on already existing stuff. I know they have tried this with for example the recently introduced breakable walls and the graphics update, but while these changes were definitely exciting the impact for these changes were way smaller than I expected, a little underwhelming. For instance With the graphics updates I was expecting more graphics options.\n\nI think the game needs new game mechanics and new ways to play. While new killer powers are exciting, they are basically the only changes we get with each chapter. a new killer with a new power. Or during mid chapter patches we get changes to killer powers. Secondary objectives would be cool or perhaps new game modes and such.\n\nA big suggestion for me would be survivor powers. While it's a very arguable idea, I don't know what is the point of having so many survivors when they can all do the exact same thing eventually. Killers also get to use more perks since some perks are better for certain killers and so on. I think survivors need some love. while they are more powerful at the moment, I think they need more versatility. \n\n","timestamp_created":1477484645,"timestamp_updated":1605293670,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495260685682296753","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26229533","author":{"steamid":"76561198284234786","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12601,"last_played":1549627167},"language":"thai","review":"ซื้อDLC แล้ว prak หาย คืออะไร","timestamp_created":1477484605,"timestamp_updated":1477484605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500416278839111328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26229386","author":{"steamid":"76561198284584675","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":55122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3427,"last_played":1645221728},"language":"german","review":"Super!\n\nEinfach nur super besonders wenn man mit oder gegen Freunde spielt :D","timestamp_created":1477483738,"timestamp_updated":1477483738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26229343","author":{"steamid":"76561198122870183","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5327,"last_played":1657134223},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏性非常好，非常耐玩。BGM也很有感觉\n但优化有待加强。 就像辣条一样","timestamp_created":1477483460,"timestamp_updated":1477483460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496775716543197632","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26229276","author":{"steamid":"76561198092326138","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":3564,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1384,"last_played":1568480993},"language":"russian","review":"Уберите Майкла как маньяка или измените его способности.
