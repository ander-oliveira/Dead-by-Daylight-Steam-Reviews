I always recommended this game because it was so much fun with the horror aspect. How it gave such a great impression when I started out, facing scary killers or unexpected abilities.\nNow, I do not recommend it, and for me, my friends ALWAYS tell me that I am always playing DBD when I have free time. I know overtime, there were frustrations of \"survivors or too OP\" or \"killers or too OP\". Really, it came down whether to player themselves know how to utilize the max times as a survivor in looping and prioritizing situations in either healing, cleansing, or (first thing to do) do gens.\nFor a killer, probably whether they know how to mind game very well using their red stains and predicting survivor movements.\n\nNow, it's just really survivor-sided. Personally, I didn't see it often but now the hit validation are so broken including dead hard. I could no, LEGIT, could not down a survivor when they were vaulting a pallet even though the hit registered on my end. It still gave me the hit cooldowns, so going against very good players, definitely game-breaking to win.\n\nI see that killers are frustrated because when I played killer, a great amount of killers kept bringing in noed because they were at such a disadvantage that the game would drag on until end-game.\n\nAlso, yeah people say both sides are OP at one point, but this is such a survive with friends type of game which is about fun, trolling, and memeing at times.\nBut the game at this point, instead of fixing these bugs and ESPECIALLY the MMR, pretty much lost hope. I heard that Hellraiser had copyright issues where they collaborated with NFT (basically I believe something to do with black market or VERY SHADY business). Yet I still gave them the benefit of the doubt because maybe it was a mistake, but I don't believe that anymore.\n\nDBD has been my main game for a couple of years and it's so sad to see I have this game into its shelf to find other games to play.\nI know there are quite a bit of games that feature a 4 survivor and 1 killer games, so I'm starting to look elswhere as you should too.\n\nI've been their frequent players where I even recommended MANY friends to come join in.

The game has changed a lot since I first started playing, and not in a good way.\n\nWhat started as a fun \"hide and seek\" style game has since developed into \"rush objectives and mock your opponent.\" The overall game play has sped up significantly, so if you're not rushing your objectives your falling behind. Slow to get gens done, and you'll find everyone on death hook before 2 gens have even finished. Likewise, as the killer if you don't hook enough survivors in the first 2 minutes and you'll find more then half the gens are done before the match even gets started.\n\nTactics have changed for the worse too. Survivors adapt fast builds to pump out gens and speed heal allies, while killers are camping more and tunneling down those they've already caught once before. Survivors that party together also use 3rd party voice chats like discord (when the lack of communication is part of the game play experience) to get a tactical advantage, leaving the killers to adapt to more ruthless camping/tunneling techniques to try and draw out those overly altruistic survivors and catch them as well.\n\nThis all in turn causes everyone to get mad at the other side, claiming they each have the shorter end of the stick. Now its almost impossible to play either side of the game without being hated just for trying to have fun. If your a survivor, killers just assume you part of a party, and thus must be punished. As a killer, its assumed your the worst of the worst and will be mocked in end game chat even if a single player escapes. Win or lose, rush objectives or enjoy the game, at the end of the day the only guarantee is that you will be mocked and bullied in the end game chat,","timestamp_created":1636247905,"timestamp_updated":1645409132,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102355663","author":{"steamid":"76561199114843236","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1636142802},"language":"english","review":"it gets boring fast.","timestamp_created":1636247806,"timestamp_updated":1636247806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102355369","author":{"steamid":"76561198123583799","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":67,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1659724801},"language":"russian","review":"абасрався","timestamp_created":1636247321,"timestamp_updated":1636247321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102355266","author":{"steamid":"76561198823876190","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":252,"playtime_at_review":4043,"last_played":1660531467},"language":"russian","review":"КРУТО\n\n","timestamp_created":1636247161,"timestamp_updated":1636247161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102354509","author":{"steamid":"76561198437142580","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":3837,"last_played":1660086970},"language":"english","review":"I've had this game for a while now. I'm not much of a killer player, so I can't say much on that. Except, of course, that playing the killer is very relaxing. You're not getting chased by anyone!\nOn the survivor side of things, I enjoy playing this game a lot when it's with friends. We can be much better with strategy, keeping each apprised of what's going on, etc. Plus humor. That helps a lot. \nThe only real buggy things I've dealt with have to be the huntress hitbox and the occasional blowup of the party (we've found you just have to close out of the game and reboot it). It's a fun game to chip away at just for the sake of playing. You can keep things fresh by switching up who you play or resetting character progress with prestige. There's always achievements and progressions and challenges to be had. It's a good game. \nBy myself, it's still a pretty fun game.

Once your skill level is high as killer, survivors are the power roll and the killer is their plaything. Survivors can have more than four perks if one person runs a boon perk. There are other perks that work for the whole team but they're not as strong as boons. If you had trouble pressuring gens before, now you have another objective which is snuffing boons. If you don't snuff them you will lose survivors because they have no scratch marks and if you do snuff them you lose more gens. Lose lose. Using brain dead strategies likes camping, tunneling, and one shot perks/add-ons are encouraged because the skill cap for killer is very low. Furthermore, killers receive more nerfs if players can utilize their abilities and perks well. Survivor perks get buffed if not many people use them while killer perks get rendered useless if they give the slightest advantage. I've played a lot of survivor(i want to have fun from time to time and not sweat). I find that i never have to run many of the meta perks or builds because i can just abuse the killer's weaknesses. Even though getting in game currency is a grind for both roles you can still play well without strong survivor perks.

El asesino debe matar y evitar que los supervivientes reparen los generadores que hayan en el mapa y escapen. Puede llegar a haber bastante diversión jugando como superviviente, donde también puedes jugar con amigos, que lo convierte en algo incluso más divertido. Se siente muy bien jugar como killer (aunque provoque el deseo de cortarse las arterias). La variedad de estos y de los supervivientes es algo MUY destacable del juego, ya que participan símbolos de terror propios de Behaviour Interactive y otros crossovers tan célebres y populares como Michael Myers y Laurie Strode (Halloween), Ghost Face (Scream), Freddy Krueger y Quentin Smith (Nightmare At Elm Street), Nemesis junto a Jill Valentine y Leon S. Kennedy (Resident Evil), Pinhead (Hellraiser), Pigsaw y el Detective Tapp (Saw), etcétera. \n\nAparte de poder jugar como asesino y como superviviente, también puedes jugar con amigos en partidas de 5, en la que 1 de vosotros puede ser asesino contra los 4 demás; cosa que en matchmaking público no se puede hacer, ya que por troleo y juego sucio, la cola para jugar como supervivientes está limitada a 4 jugadores contra un asesino aleatorio. \n\nLas habilidades de asesinos y supervivientes están bastante bien, y le añaden mucho más jugo, objetivos y contenido al juego, cosa bastante importante.\n\nEl juego en si y el concepto es bastante interesante, sin embargo, se vuelve relativamente repetitivo en ocasiones: el hecho de tener que reparar generadores como superviviente y huir es muchas veces lo mismo, igual que como pasa con la tarea del asesino. A esto hay que añadirle los bugs y el GRAN desbalanceo de Dead By Daylight, junto con el mal matchmaking que no solo tarda mucho en ocasiones, sino que además te empareja con gente a muy claramente otro nivel. Estos son los mayores y más importantes errores de Dead By Daylight.\n\nAparte de eso, Dead By Daylight nos puede proporcionar muchísimas horas de diversión, y aunque parezca que tenga más ventajas que desventajas, este juego sigue siendo bastante bueno y tiene mucho que ofrecer.\n\nPersonalmente, creo que Dead By Daylight es un juegazo pero que hay bastantes problemas presentes, así que es un juego lejos de lo perfecto. Mi parte favorita del juego son los killers, sobretodo los killers invitados. También me gustaría que hubieran más skins para más cosas, en vez de tener un montón de amuletos estúpidos que no sirven para nada, por ejemplo podrían haber skins de objetos o habilidades de killers.\n\n\n===[Modos de juego]===\n❌Un jugador.\n✔️Cooperativo.\n❌Cooperativo Local.\n✔️Multijugador.\n\n===[Gráficos]===\n❌Muy malos.\n❌Malos.\n❌Normales.\n❌Correctos.\n✔️Buenos.\n❌Muy buenos.\n❌Excelentes.\n\n===[Bugs]===\n❌El juego en si es un bug.\n❌Los bugs empañan la experiencia.\n❌Muchos bugs.\n✔️Bastantes bugs.\n❌Algunos bugs.\n❌Apenas tiene y no empañan la experiencia.\n❌No tiene.\n\n===[Rendimiento]===\n❌Injugable.\n❌Caída de FPS de vez en cuando.\n✔️ Bueno.\n❌Muy bueno.\n\n===[Precio/calidad]===\n✔️Cómpralo, No seas rata.\n✔️Espera a que baje de precio.\n❌Acorde a lo que ofrece.\n❌Pide reembolso si puedes.\n❌No lo compres.\n❌Its, free.\n❌Sigue actualizando (Early Access).\n\n===[Requisitos]===\n❌Pc's antiguos.\n✔️Pc's Medio.\n❌Pc's Gaming.\n❌Mucha potencia.\n❌Ordenador de la NASA.\n\n===[Dificultad]===\n❌Muy fácil.\n❌Fácil.\n✔️Fácil de aprender/difícil de dominar.\n✔️Dificultad media.\n✔️Difícil.\n❌Muy difícil.\n❌Extremo.\n\n===[Jugabilidad]===\n❌Injugable.\n❌Pasable.\n✔️Buena.\n❌Excelente.\n❌Única.\n\n===[Horas de juego]===\n❌Muy corto (menos de 2 horas).\n❌Corto (2 - 8 horas).\n❌Tiempo de juego medio (de 8 a 12 horas historia normal).\n❌Largo (más de 12 horas).\n❌Muy Largo (de 50 horas en adelante) (Si jugas el modo libre)\n✔️Lo que le quieras dedicar (Juego online).\n❌No se puede jugar por falta de jugadores.\n\n===[Personajes]===\n❌No hay como tal.\n❌Carecen de importancia.\n❌Normales.\n✔️Memorables.\n❌De lo mejor que existe.\n\n===[Historia] ===\n✔️No tiene.\n❌Pasa desapercibida.\n❌Del montón.\n❌Buena.\n❌Fantástica.\n❌Obra de arte.\n\n===[Panorama/Ambientación]===\n❌Malos.\n❌Deficientes.\n❌Mediocres.\n❌Buenos.\n✔️Notables.\n❌Muy Buenos.\n❌Excelentes.\n\n===[Banda Sonora]===\n❌Deficiente.\n❌Aceptable.\n❌Regular.\n✔️Buena.\n❌Muy Buena.\n❌Excelente.\n\n===[Recomendacion Final]===\n❌No te lo recomiendo por nada del mundo.\n❌Poco recomendable.\n❌Solo recomendable si te gusta la propuesta.\n❌Recomendable.\n✔️Muy recomendable si te gusta la propuesta.\n❌Recomendadísimo.\n❌Lo mejor que he probado en mi vida\n\n===[ASPECTOS NEGATIVOS Y POSITIVOS]===\n🔴Negativos:\n-Repetitividad.\n-Desbalanceo tremendo.\n-Matchmaking a veces lento y bastante nefasto.\n\n🟢Positivos:\n-Gran variedad de supervivientes, killers y legendarios personajes.\n-Mucha diversión.\n\nEn resumen, un juego desequilibrado y repetitivo, aunque extremadamente entretenido que puede dar mucho vicio, sobretodo cuando se juega con amigos.
