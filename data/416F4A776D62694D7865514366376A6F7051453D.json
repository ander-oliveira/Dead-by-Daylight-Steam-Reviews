your friends=フレンドと殺し合う／*以後KYFと略す)がある。\n\nオススメする点\n・KYFで鬼を順番に回して遊び合うのが本当に楽しい、ぜひやって欲しい。\n\n・世界観や雰囲気が中々に私は好みだ。このゲームの最大の魅力だと私は思う。キラーサバイバー共に設定がありアイテムやパーク(特殊スキルのようなもの)などに添えられたフレーバーテキスト、そういった所から色々バックグラウンドを考察したりするのも楽しい。\n\n・パーク、アドオン、オファリング(詳細は省くが、特殊なスキルや効果をもたらすもの)それらの構成を考え自分好みの戦略を練るのも中々楽しい。\n\n・最近追加された要素でゲーム内でスキンを入手出来るようになった。それに伴ってキラーサバイバー共にスキンが増えた！嬉しい。割とデザインが色んな意味で面白い。更にチャームも増えた！キラーはフックに。サバイバーはベルト辺りにつけられる。\n\n・steam版のDbDでは他ゲームや名作映画とのコラボがなされている。私はこれまで余りホラー映画を見たことが無かったが、DbDを通して原作の映画を全て見た。その上で思った事だが。コラボの仕方というか演出というかそういった部分が本当に素晴らしいと感じた。\n\n・ゲーム内イベントが割と行われている。イベントは色々体験してきたが基本的にはイベント専用のオファリング(ゲーム開始時に使う消耗アイテムのような物だ、映画のチケットの様な感じだね)を使い。使う事によってそのゲーム内にイベント限定のオブジェクト(大体は発電機とフック)が発生しゲーム終了後に会得出来るブラッドポイント(キラーやサバイバーを成長させるのに使う経験値のようなもの*以後BP)が通常よりもかなり増える。という感じだ。またBPが増えるだけでなくイベントでは限定スキンや限定アイテム等も手に入るので楽しい。\n私はハロウィンライトが可愛くて好きだ。後は爆竹等も面白くて好きだ。\n\n・アーカイブが追加された！こなしていくとBPが貰えチャーム等も貰え特しかないのでぜひやってみて！またアーカイブを進めていくとキラーやサバイバーのバックグラウンドを見る事が出来る。DbDの世界観を更にエンジョイできるだろう。\n\n\n\nオススメしない点\n・野良の全体的な環境は、はっきり言うとよくない。初期に比べ徐々に良くはなって来ていると思うが中々安定しない。これはオンライン対戦ゲーム全てにおいて言える事だが。野良環境で楽しめるマッチに巡り合える事が中々ない、というかまず基本的な状態でゲームが行われる事が少ない。(1キラー4サバイバー状態が無い)実は私はそこも含めて面白いと感じる、私はね。逆に言えばいいゲームができた時は本当に楽しい。勝っても負けてもスリリングでドラマチックなゲームが楽しめた時なんかは本当に最高だ。\n\n次に、サバイバーキラー両側共に煽りが多い。私は余り気にしないタイプだがそういうのが苦手な人は購入はしない方がいい。(チャット暴言、ジェスチャー煽り等)　もしくは野良に潜らずフレンドたちと遊ぶゲームと割り切るのもありだ。KYFは1キラー4サバイバー状態でなくとも遊べるからね。最低でも2人いればいい。1キラー1サバイバー。\n\nあと、やはり目につくのは回線切断、チーター、ラグスイッチャー、ボット等。最近ボットはほぼ完全にいなくなった感じがする。初期の頃は多かった。\nチーターに関してはイージーアンチチートが感知して弾いてくれる。最近は安定してきておりほぼ合わなくなった。\n回線切断に関しては公式がペナルティを設けた為ほぼなくなったに等しいが行う人もまだわずかに存在する。\n\n後は最初にも述べたがこのゲームは有線でネット回線を繋がないと回線落ちが頻発してしまう感じがした。これは体感でしかないが。対戦型のオンラインゲームをやるなら有線でネット回線を確保するのがやはり安心だろう。(私は有線でしかほとんど利用していなかったので盲点だった)\n\n\n・キラーがやりたい方へ\nまず注意、キラーはサバイバーよりもマシンスペックが更に求められる。私もサバイバーよりはキラーがやりたくて購入したがキラーはかなり厳しい苦しい。でも4吊りは最高に楽しいやばい楽しい！！現環境はまあまあなのでキラーの腕を磨くにはいいかもしれない。\n\n・サバイバーがやりたいけど不安な方へ\n大丈夫皆んな最初はそう。そして私もそう。そして私は未だにサバイバーはキラーより余り好きじゃないです。何故なら操作ボタンがキラーより多いのと協力するのに頭を使うから。\nだからまず最初は第一発見者にならない事を祈ろう！後はどうとでもなるさ！しんで覚えていくうちに段々と自分なりの立ち回りも確立してくると思うよ。ごめんね、余りサバイバーに関しては有益なアドバイス出来ないんだ！何故なら私サバイバー未だによくわかんないから！とりあえず発電機回して！ゲート開けて！脱出だー！オッケー！\n\n以上、少しでも参考になれば幸いだ。\n\nあと、この作品は割とセールされるので(DLC含め)　購入を考えているならセールを待つのをオススメする。マシンスペックに不安がある方はフリープレイの機会に試すと安心だ。","timestamp_created":1531404968,"timestamp_updated":1591590497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.646019041538238525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43484210","author":{"steamid":"76561197996934780","num_games_owned":513,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":85509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":186,"playtime_at_review":3351,"last_played":1660240547},"language":"english","review":"Shitty

Thats 100% not the case. If the survivior is chasing the KILLER with a flashlight, you definetly messed something up devs. \nLike seriously, I came back after 1 a half year, and i couldnt trust my eys. They're keep patching for low rank players, but whats going on in high rank just isnt important, itleast thats what is seems like.\n\nThe game is mostly abt toxic ppl, who dont want you to have fun, so that means: youre getting teabagged! If you did well, you're a hacker, camper, tunnler, dribbler. If you had a bad round, you're noob killer. Thats what most of the surviviors say. At this point, i give you the hint to take another look at my playtime, because alot of ppl might be upset here already.\n\nBtw, hitboxes buggy/bad af at some points of some maps, also have alot of other game bugs even in the main menu.\n\nAnyway, the game is so unbalanced still, there's a fucking lot they could improve to make it more fun or ANYTHING. But no, instead they prefer to release some new 7€ dlc's, when they cant even balance the killers they just have. After 2 years they never got the hint, that gens are just going way to fast. But hey, 4 surviviors and 1 killer, so 80% of the people in the game are happy :)   ........\n\nYou dont belive me? look how 50% of my games as killer looks like, and im way better than the devs, i can confirm.\n--> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98e-Y4Lu8w\n\nI also think it is pretty much a bit of pay to win. Since i havent buy ANY of the dlc's i dont have all the uniqe perks, and there're some of them you need at the current patch, which i cant get, unless i get lucky and they're in the shrine, which is probably like 0.02% chance.\n\nIn the end it's probably worth the 20€, tho i just told ya more then 1 reason to now buy it. The game is getting made by the players, and if more then the half of them are assholes it really isnt fun anymore. You can have better fun with 20€.\n\nEdit: So after 3 more years, they still didnt add an option to adjust mouse sensivity.. thats how much the devs care about the game^^\n\nEdit2: Its 2k21 and still, bugs exist who did exist 3 years ago. They still havent got the hint, that sfw creates a platform to be broken. They still allow the toxicity to breath, clicky clicky and teabagging. They still dont give rat shits about their game.

The devs solution to this is that they added a mechanic (bloodlust) that makes the killer run faster after a period of chasing instead of reviewing the design of the map. Apparently this mechanic resets upon breaking a pallet so basically it is merry go round simulator until the killer is moving too fast, that is the timing whereby the survivor will drop the pallet and turn the game back to a f*&k Feast of merry go round again. \n\n-Genius matchmaking whereby the players are Q into red ping (>300ms) rooms 70% of the time and they have to constanly re-Q and roll the RNG dice in order to finally get into a room with stable latency. In order to make it more frustrating, they added a 5 sec delay where users that left the room are unable to find another room. The time adds up considering the % of time where the users find a room of unstable latency.\n\nAlthough we can see the devs putting in some form of effort (Creating more skins?!?!?! nani????) to address the issues faced by players, i strongly do not recommend the purchase of this game is you are spending >$10 as there are better games out there for this

Classic Killers like Freddy, Leatherface, and Michael Myers are absolute trash and among the most likely to get ♥♥♥♥♥ed on. In the current state of the game, it is incredibly frustrating to play as the Killer; if you are prone to gamer rages, struggling with the horrendous game mechanics will unleash a fury within you as never experienced before. The game was literally designed to make it hard for Killers to perform their roles, with bizarre mechanics such as Killers having first-person view (survivors have third person view), narrow field of view, horrible map designs, and long interactions that give survivors ample time to get away.\n\nHowever, playing as the survivor is pretty chill. No matter what you are guaranteed to have a good time. The game is especially fun if you are able to play in a party, during which the Killer is especially helpless to challenge you. Be aware that the survivor experience is one of schadenfreude at the expense of the Killer.\n\nOther than that, the game is buggy as hell, meaningful updates are infrequent (once a month if lucky), and the community is toxic. Servers are NOT dedicated; they are peer-to-peer with the Killer as the host so you will frequently suffer from laggy matches if the Killer is laggy. \n\nBTW, if you do not have a solid graphics card and processor, then you will suffer severe performance issues. I suggest that you play a demo of the game if possible. The game is EXTREMELY resource intensive; I have a GTX 1070 graphics card, Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, 16 GB of RAM, AND I play with the cooler boost function on, yet I still have frequent FPS drops and my computer heats up. I can't imagine how poorly the game plays on poorer specs.\n\nLastly, in order to truly enjoy the game and be competitive, you need to buy the content dlc as most of them offer perks that are meta/necessary for Killers to not get rekted. This totals ~$40 or $60 including the base game. Keep in mind that future premium dlc will continue to release perks and characters that may be meta, so the price tag will continue to inflate. Otherwise, you will have to grind hundreds of hours and still be nowhere near acquiring the necessary perks to perform at a high level. This includes survivors and killers. Recently, an ingame shop was released that sells some survivors and Killers separately, but they are terribly priced to the point where you would get more value from buying the direct dlc (containing the survivor and Killer), then buying either individually.\n\nLet me reiterate; this is by far the most unbalanced, horribly designed game that I ever had the displeasure to play in my 15+ years of gaming. I have played betas that were more polished than this crap.\n\nYou have been warned.","timestamp_created":1531360016,"timestamp_updated":1531360016,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510480880737304688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43475160","author":{"steamid":"76561198108683024","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2034,"last_played":1537723022},"language":"english","review":"Funny and can be scary.
