Je dirais que j'ai pris le coche un peu tard mais ca a un aspect positif et un autre fortement négatif. \n\nPour commencer si on allonge les sous pour tout les petit dlc. Il y a une vingtaine de survivant différent et une vingtaine de tueur. De quoi avoir des gameplay varié côté tueur et permettre de renouveler ses traques. Côté survivant je ne trouve pas ça terrible, certes ils commencent avec des compétences de bases différents mais au premier abord cela ne m'a pas semblé hyper impactant de changer de personnages en étant nouveau. Il faudra farm les niveaux de certains survivant pour débloqué leur compétences enseignable et comme j'ai pu le constater jouer les même talent mais sur différent personnages. \n\nDu coup le plus agréable si on est seul est de jouer le tueur et en groupe les survivants. La communication passe mieux donc plus facile a gérer les tueurs. Mais j'ai surtout préféré le côté tueur pour ma part.\n\nDes compétences qui changent littéralement la manière d'aborder la traque. Allant d'une simple tronçonneuse, a des pièges, de la folie, du contrôle sur la zone. Il y a vraiment de quoi faire et c'est extrêmement plaisant. Malheureusement comme dit plus haut je vais arrivé sur l'aspect fortement négatif. \n\nLa triste mentalité des joueurs sur un jeu en ligne. Il n'y a aucune communication entre les joueurs et le tueur avant le résultat de fin de partie. Mais cela ne les empêchera pas de se foutre de votre gueule tout le long du jeu. Je peux faire des partie équilibré avec d'autre débutant ou alors tout simplement me retrouver face a un rang 1 ou alors des gens qui ont farmé déjà plus de 200h le jeu au minimum et quand ils sont en groupe ca devient juste ennuyeux. Les partie ressembleront a ce shéma la du coup : \n\nTu traque la première personne tu la met a terre tu l'accroche, tu pars voir autre choses elle se fera rapidement décroché, tu traque ils tournent en rond, T bag, spam les clignotement de lampe torche pour dire tout simplement tu ne nous aura pas. Bon le jeu est de les traqué et voir si on peux en tuer un ou deux au passage. Donc tu les poursuis, tu ne connais pas trop les cartes tu te fais berné ils te tournent en bourrique, joue très bien avec les palettes et te font perdre beaucoup de temps. Très bien joué a eux. Je continue a tenté de prendre mes repères et ils répètent le même shéma a nargué et dans le cas ou ils arrivent a vous échapper. Ils ne vont réparé que 4 générateur sur 5 et freeze la partie jusqu'a ce qu'ils se lassent de se foutre de votre gueule et décide de clôturer la partie mais attention une fois la dernière porte ouverte, ça doit être un rituel les survivant ne fuient pas et spam devant la sortie pour que tu les traque mais biensur sans succès au vue de la distance juste pour dire et ouai on est tous partie et t'as rien pu faire. S'ensuit l'après match ou ils peuvent communiquer avec le tueur et lache une multitude d'ez, noob de manière général et de tu pue la merde, tu sers a rien, pourquoi tu joue a ce jeu pour faire ca quand tu tombe sur des francophones.\n\nDonc voila ce jeu n'est absolument pas fait pour les débutant. Le temps de comprendre, de découvrir, d'obtenir les compétences tu passera un bon nombre de partie a te faire insulter et ridiculisé. Il est plutôt intéressant et j'ai vraiment apprécié mes parties contre des gens qui ne sont pas en vocal. Ca donne un certain équilibre et surtout si ils n'ont pas toute les compétences rang 3 alors que toi tu n'a qu'une compétence rang 1.\n\nA voir ce qu'il donnera en fin de jeu quand il y a un certain équilibre de chaque côté en terme de connaissance de jeu.","timestamp_created":1624802393,"timestamp_updated":1624802393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94505482","author":{"steamid":"76561198863881477","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1060,"last_played":1653914470},"language":"schinese","review":"杀手蛮棒的\n","timestamp_created":1624802009,"timestamp_updated":1624802009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94505365","author":{"steamid":"76561198116600538","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":37325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26238,"last_played":1633473955},"language":"english","review":"Love DBD","timestamp_created":1624801913,"timestamp_updated":1624801913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94505363","author":{"steamid":"76561198803682173","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":19348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10199,"last_played":1650577863},"language":"german","review":"Mega Geeeil!\n","timestamp_created":1624801911,"timestamp_updated":1624801911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94505246","author":{"steamid":"76561198212716812","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":17673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3127,"last_played":1648428553},"language":"english","review":"A fantastic 4v1 game for those who are into slight horror with an interesting objective based strategy niche.

There are several reasons for this which I will point out below and the fact that I have over 800+ hours game play goes to show how much I have considered before deciding to post a review for a game I have committed to since October 2020.\n\nTo start off, Dead by Daylight is a masterpiece on its own, from the game play to the experience you get (initially). However, that excitement you get from running away from killers to chasing down survivors slowly turns into a kind of numbness from dealing with the issues faced as a loyal player. It will be a long post but it is a detailed feedback from myself as a fan of the game as I have to come to a point where I can no longer stay quiet anymore.\n\nMy collective feedback \n1. Bug fixes and QOL updates\n- For obvious reasons, new content gets pushed out regularly for the sake of game development and monetisation and we as a community do our job to provide feedback to the devs to improve the quality of our game play in exchange for the support we show towards the game itself. It is a fair exchange, right? Unfortunately, that is not the case.\n- I regularly look out for the presence of the player community for their feedback and the way they felt about the game. One of the main issues old-timers would point out are the bugs in the game. It is justifiably a common occurrence for bugs to exist in a game but the childishness and lack of initiative from the devs completely ruins the game for players as they do not work to solve the tiny bugs that occur in the game, most importantly the ones that go on without any fixes for 2 to 3 chapters straight. \n- When you as a loyal player consistently play 15-20 matches per day, you will start to feel the pointlessness of playing the game when the bugs are there to ruin the game play for you. It is completely fine to have bugs for a week to two as the BHVR team do need time to go through our feedback and sort the bugs accordingly but the fact that bugs can stretch on for months does say a lot about how the community is being treated.\n\n2. Progression and monetisation:\n- I will be combining the two above mentioned topics as they both provide a sense of achievement which serves as a motivation which drives us as players to continue playing the game.\n- As a new player, the progression system can seem tedious and you will feel like you are starting on a journey that will take a lot our of your time. But you will not exactly experience the grind until after you have progressed considerably through the game contents. This is because the devs continuously produce new content (all normal) and players who have poured in their precious time for the game will eventually feel burned out, for example if you want to level up all perks on a single character. I do not deny that you get a huge sense of accomplishment from doing so but the question is \"What is at the end of it?\" \n- The next points are the prestige system and player level/devotion system. The prestige system by itself is quite self-explanatory-- you trade off hours of progression to obtain a unique piece of item (which cannot be bought) other players can't get their hands on without putting in the time. It is a fair trade because you know you are exchanging your progression for cosmetics. Monetisation, a vital aspect of an online game, helps drive the economy of the game and serves to provide players with various bonus content, otherwise not obtainable unless you pay money for it. Nothing much can be said for this unless you want to discuss about the direction of it by the devs.\n- Now, to summarise -- The biggest pain comes from the fact that: the more you grind through the game, the more helpless you feel. Hours of your time is poured into the game and yet the game does not justify the rewards, other than you being able to hone and master your skills for the sake of gameplay. Progression is simply leveling your bloodweb infinitely (literally) and hoping you get the perks you want and devotion provides shards which you can use to obtain certain monetised content. To simplify what I mean, you are basically just hoarding a bunch of things from the game and end up feeling burned out indefinitely. I can equate this to a typical work life in real life but the truth is worse than that -- you will end up saying \"I have just wasted my time doing this\"\n\n3. Community health and engagement\n- I will say that BHVR does a good job at engaging with the community and to hear us out with new ideas as well as the improvement of the game as a whole. But the part that fell on deaf ears are the types of feedback that needed to be taken to a higher level of priority compared to the other matters being worked on by the devs. It is okay and perfectly acceptable to focus on future of the game/source of money for the BHVR team but it becomes an irresponsible act to ignore the pleas of the community when we players are already screaming out for help towards the parts of the game that should be fixed first. \n- To make matters worse, BHVR barely acknowledges what the community is trying to express in the form of boycotts/grievances and takes quite an avoidant stance towards the recent trend on the internet.\n\nThe above comments are my personal take on the state of the game and the community and by no means serve as a formal complaint nor should you agree fully without going through the process of what I have done first. You should (as my advice) play the game for a while and experience it from your perspective before referring to my review again.

Para Churrasco de cerdo al horno\nCostillas de cerdo\n750 g\nOrégano\n1 c/c\nTomillo\nMedia c/c\nAjo\n1 diente\nPimentón Dulce\nMedia c/c\nAceite de oliva virgen extra\n1 c/s\nSal\nReceta:\n1) Lo primero que haremos para preparar esta receta será limpiar la costilla de cerdo. Le quitamos el posible exceso de grasa, la cortamos a la mitad para que nos entre bien en el horno y opcionalmente le podemos retirar la telilla que recubre la costilla por la parte del hueso. Al cocinar la costilla al horno, esta telilla se suele secar y resultar algo incómoda en el momento de comer el churrasco.\n2) Uno de los pasos importantes para que nos quede un churrasco al horno lo más parecido al que cocinamos en la brasa es este adobo que vamos a preparar y en el que, si podemos por cuestión de tiempo, dejaremos las costillas desde la noche anterior.\nEn un bol incorporamos orégano, tomillo, sal, ajo rallado, un poco de pimentón dulce para dar un toque ahumado y aceite de oliva virgen extra.\n3) Cuando tengamos todos los ingredientes del adobo, los mezclamos bien y pincelamos las costillas por ambas partes. Como dijimos en el paso anterior, intentaremos dejar las costillas en adobo por lo menos durante unas horas.\n4) Para que nos quede un churrasco bien dorado y crujiente pero jugoso en el interior, vamos a colocar un recipiente con agua que sea apto para horno en la parte inferior del horno. Encendemos el horno con calor arriba y abajo a 180ºC y cuando lo tengamos en temperatura, metemos las costillas a media altura durante 30 minutos. Pasados los primeros 30 minutos podemos ver como la superficie ya se encuentra algo dorada, les damos la vuelta y continuamos el horneado otros 30 minutos más.\nCuando llevemos 60 minutos de horneado, salamos las costillas al gusto y le damos nuevamente la vuelta continuando el horneado.\n5) El tiempo de horneado de esta última vuelta que le damos al churrasco va a depender del grosor de las costillas y de la potencia del horno. Tendremos el churrasco en su punto cuando veamos que los extremos de las costillas están tostados y la carne se empieza a encoger dejando el hueso al descubierto. Para que quede el churrasco en el punto que veis en las fotos, lo tuve horneando 80 minutos y en la última vuelta aproveché para preparar unas patatas fritas.\n6) Ya tenemos el churrasco de cerdo al horno listo, crujiente en el exterior pero jugoso en el interior ya que al poner el recipiente con agua en el interior del horno evitamos que se seque.\n¿QUÉ OPINAS DE ESTA RECETA DE CHURRASCO DE CERDO COCINADO EN HORNO?\nPuedes dejar un comentario más abajo, compartir la receta o puntuarla.\nY si te animas a preparar este churrasco en casa, me encantaría saber si el resultado fue similar al churrasco a la brasa o si te ha surgido alguna duda.\n","timestamp_created":1624784882,"timestamp_updated":1624784882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":228,"votes_funny":67,"weighted_vote_score":"0.870912909507751465","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94487850","author":{"steamid":"76561198180084826","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":16047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11010,"last_played":1659081513},"language":"schinese","review":" 行\n","timestamp_created":1624784717,"timestamp_updated":1629458540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94487826","author":{"steamid":"76561198405888569","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10958,"last_played":1659015832},"language":"schinese","review":"如果删了0妹，就还不错吧。","timestamp_created":1624784688,"timestamp_updated":1624784688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94487671","author":{"steamid":"76561197998051243","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1536,"last_played":1644662171},"language":"english","review":"haha","timestamp_created":1624784507,"timestamp_updated":1624784507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94487670","author":{"steamid":"76561197985638280","num_games_owned":626,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":251671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":247,"playtime_at_review":216001,"last_played":1660431645},"language":"english","review":"3600 hours on this game, but its time to write a negative review, and yes I know that sounds crazy after this many hours but lets hear the arguments.\n\nDBD is pretty much a unique type of game, there are no competitors which means its this game or nothing.\nAt the core it does a great job, the team did a LOT of things reaaally well hence I and so many others played this game so much and will probably continue to do so.\n\nHOWEVER, it is important to know something, this game is still being worked on, like GTA/RD Online, like No Man Sky, like warframe and like so many others this is a game released years ago and just build upon, more content for the players, more money for the developers.\n\nAnd what is important about that is to know that companies can change how they do things and the reason this is a negative review is how this company has decided to do this, every update they half ass quality checking, they have literally said they only work when they need to, let me be blunt and say that I think BHVR in terms of being money focused instead of community focused is probably the single worst company out there.\n\nSo many glaring problems that players have come to the forums for for YEARS now never get addressed and long time visitors/contributors get banned because they say one to many negative things about the developers, moderators on the forums (bhvr employees) are also friends/moderators with/for some of the streamer/content creators in their fogwhisperer program which of course creates tremendously skewed conflict of interest situations regarding the power and freedom those specific streamers have. They can be as toxic as they want against the community and will never see repercussions.\n\nThe most recent offence at the time of making of this review is the new DLC, the Resident Evil chapter, DLC that is completely broken and don't think these are the kind of devs who are on it to fix things asap, they take their sweet time, they have your money already anyway, but the RE map to this day since release has not been made active for the game because they simple did not spend time or money on QA.....because why bother right?\n\nWorst still imo is that they made \"set cosmetics\", set cosmetics are cosmetics that are locked together as one set, usually outfits can be changed between 3 parts but these cannot and obviously cost a lot of money... and its completely transparent why they do so, Jill Valentine's head on her expensive locked cosmetic is EXACTLY the same as her normal head, zero effort....so people would obviously not spend 4 ffing dollars....on that head.....but hey, if you lock it you can ask your 15 dollars and there ya go, minimum effort, maximum profit.\n\nAnother thing regarding that, before this update people managed to glitch those set cosmetics, being able to mix and match them, but people were afraid that Behavior, the company, the devs....would BAN them for doing that...... now think about that for a second, how incredibly messed up is the relationship between the developers and the players if the players feel so despised that they are afraid the devs would ban them for mixing cosmetics......\n\nbut guess what? happy days, the devs for once actually spoke to the community and made sure everyone knew they would not get banned for it, so yay, happy days! everyone spending waaay too much money to show off their cool thought up cosmetic combinations.....and then the RE chapter drops and that glitch has been addressed..... ez money before blocking it, this is one of those typical BHVR (the developer) moves that is just simply disgusting and worse then just about any developer of anything out there.\n\nNow I could go on EASILY with more, we have YEARS of the same crap with this messed up company. The game is great but the people behind it should not be working on it, I welcome ANY, I repeat, ANY publisher to buy this, fire everyone, and do a better job.\n\nAnd yeah at the end of all of this, if you are new, just.....dont buy this, play something else, this is one of those companies that wants to milk you for all the money you got when you are new and excited and then you can just leave if the frustrations with the devs becomes too much for all they care, they got your money.","timestamp_created":1624784507,"timestamp_updated":1624828188,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591383755207061768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94487477","author":{"steamid":"76561198322309478","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":3840,"last_played":1659597939},"language":"french","review":"Bien
