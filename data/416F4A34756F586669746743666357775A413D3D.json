Das Spielprinzip ist relativ einfach gestrickt, aber totzdem ist es genial! Dieses Spiel hat einen riesen Suchtfaktor. Man möchte immer weiter und  höher mit seinem Level kommen, mehr Blutpunkte erlangen und dafür echt tolle Belohnungen kriegen und vorallem möchte man eines- überleben/alle töten. :D Was ich erstaunlich und bewundernswert finde ist, dass obwohl man eigentlich immer das gleiche macht, es nie langweilig wird.\nDenn irgendwie ist jede einzelne Runde nochmal anders. Jeder Killer tickt anders, und da man sich immer seinem Spielstil anpassen muss (um bestenfalls zu überleben) wird es nicht langweilig. Man spielt jede Runde immer etwas anders. Und als Killer ist es genau das gleiche. Hier gibt es ja derzeit 5 verschiedene: den Fallensteller, den Geist, den Hinterwäldler, die Krankenschwester und, den neuesten, Michael Myers.\nund ich finde es unglaublich schön, dass jeder sozusagen seine eigene Fähigkeit hat. Somit spielt hat man auch mit jedem einzelnen Killer eine verschiedene Taktik.\nEin weiterer Punkt, warum es nicht langweilig wird ist, dass es immer neue Updates gibt, an neuen Maps, Verbesserungen usw gearbeitet wird ( wie jetzt z.B beim Halloweenupdate ), wodurch es nicht immer das gleiche ist, sondern man halt oft Neues kennenlernt.\nund zu guter Letzt will ich noch sagen, dass ich es sehr schön finde, dass man mit seinen Freunden überleben/seine Freunde töten kann. Durch diese Funktion sind schon viele lustige Runden entstanden :D.\nSomit kann ich dieses Spiel nur wärmstens empfehlen.

Dead by daylight is a game that i used to enjoy, it has some really bad moments that will make you hate your life and also very good moments where you are on the edge of your seat (For example when you're the last survivor playing against a bloodwarden/noed killer and trying to stay alive until bloodwarden goes on cooldown so you can escape) with a increased heartbeat. \n\nBut after 300 hours i'm just kinda done with this game. Note, i'm not really the best player out there and never pretend to be so. If i die from making a mistake (When my autistic brain for example fails to understand something, such as when there's to much going on making me lose the entire overview of the match i'm in. Hence why i'm not the best player out there and never will be which is fine) than that's indeed on myself, this is just purely how i feel about it.\n\nThe matchmaking is imo the biggest issue the game currently has. As a survivor you will either get paired up with beginners or bots who don't know what their doing who will simply stand still/throw the game, or you will get paired up with the most godlike survivors you've ever seen who end the game in 10 minutes or less leaving you to barely even playing the game at all.. Killer side is similar to this, you will either get a easy 3-4k or you will have the most annoying time of your life. Not to forget that you can also get matched up with either survivors or killers that literally have 10 times the amount of hours that you have, which makes it pretty much impossible for you to do anything.\n\nDead by daylight also has one of the most toxic communities like ever, both sides (Survivor and killer) has enough players that will say the worst stuff possible in the endgame chat (The chat after a match). The toxicity in the dead by daylight community makes the old days of mw2 lobbies look like it was the most tame/mildest crap ever.\n\nThe developers also don't seem to care much about ongoing issues such as straight up hacking/cheating, you can report players all you want who use illegal software/programs to gain a advantage but the developers appearently barely ever act on it. Not only that but there's also still some issues with hitboxes.. Take huntress as the main example (In my opinion), the hitboxes of her hatchets are still beyond broken.. Either you will throw your hatchet straight at someone and it completely passes trough them or you can literally flick your mouse, throw your hatchet 200km away from the survivor that you want to to throw it at and you will still hit them.. Why?.. It's absolutely wild and i have 0 idea on why it's still a thing.\n\nAnyways... Does all of that mean that there's no fun in dead by daylight? No, ofcourse not. You can have plenty of fun in dead by daylight and you can jump in as a newer player just fine, just be beware of all the negatives dead by daylight has which made me drop the ball. Dead by daylight also consists of a insane grind and the only stuff that's actually behind paywalls is killers and survivors themselves, you can still get the newer perks for free though trough the shop when they are in rotation and you can play on every single DLC map without paying due to the map rotation. Dead by daylight also has a insane learning curve, if you master certain things than you can do some really crazy plays..\n\nAnyways, that's it for me. I will leave it at that.. I won't really bother with this game anymore until there's some actual changes, mainly just the broken matchmaking that needs a change/fix.","timestamp_created":1477833093,"timestamp_updated":1643518061,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26315015","author":{"steamid":"76561198069427034","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":135,"playtime_at_review":4775,"last_played":1660587172},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1477832779,"timestamp_updated":1654160109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528295040130615234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26314558","author":{"steamid":"76561198204940457","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":43841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":275,"playtime_at_review":23526,"last_played":1660237103},"language":"english","review":"This game is a lot of fun if you play it with your friends. The only thing that makes this game miserable is the stupid bugs and exploits. The killers can lag switch making your game laggy in favor of the killer. The developers haven t fixed a ton of bugs since the release of this game. The game also favors killers and produces a lot of new maps that don t have an open space so you can t loop the killer or 360 them. The developers want to make this game a scarry one where survivors don t loop killers and bully them, instead they hide in fear when they hear the heartbeat. Even the main menu of this game is as buggy as the game. It disconnects you from the aftermatch without updating your rank . It kicks you from your friend s lobby and you have to be invited again. \nI would not have a problem if all of these happen like once a day or once a week, but NO. These bugs happen EVERY hour. 1/4 games kick you out of the game to the main menu and won t update ur rank. The animation when the survivor is on the hook is buggy as hell. You are like 1m away from where you should be hanging. Also the hitbox that the survivor have is a HUGE BOX where the killer can hit you. It s almost impossible to not get hit  by the Killer. The hitbox is that big because they don t want survivors to do 360. The killers also have auto aim. Buy  this game just to play killer. You won t have any fun as survivor at all. \nDon t buy this game if you are looking for a competitive game where skill matters.","timestamp_created":1477831299,"timestamp_updated":1591348992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26314369","author":{"steamid":"76561198315633771","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2818,"last_played":1588411721},"language":"thai","review":"โปรเยอะไปนะเล่นทีไรก็เจอโปรแก้หน่อยไอพวกเด็กเหี้ยๆแม่งโปรจังไอสัส","timestamp_created":1477830830,"timestamp_updated":1477830830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26314350","author":{"steamid":"76561198024708767","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1480273733},"language":"french","review":"super jeux mais faudrait q il rajoute plus de tueur comme le tueur de vendredi 13  \n","timestamp_created":1477830785,"timestamp_updated":1477830785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26314158","author":{"steamid":"76561198095387662","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2091,"last_played":1566555553},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏对新手非常不友好，非常！","timestamp_created":1477830282,"timestamp_updated":1477830282,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499898523092269897","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26314027","author":{"steamid":"76561198049860255","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1653824511},"language":"thai","review":"ห่วย 1.2.0","timestamp_created":1477829841,"timestamp_updated":1477829841,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499750107526779175","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26313821","author":{"steamid":"76561198303980326","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1581094431},"language":"turkish","review":"kaç yada öl burada bolca var av yada avcı bence tavsiyem","timestamp_created":1477829209,"timestamp_updated":1477829209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uoXfitgCfcWwZA=="}
