This game is really fun, but it has more flaws than I could ever count.

Is this game good? I don't think so. Especially with the matchmaking system for lower rank killers (in the EU region specifically) it just sucks, going against 4 red ranks as your first killer match ever is the worst.

This is basically a multiplayer game for horror fans. If you enjoy the genre as a whole, this game might just be for you, simply because of all the characters that are included. Michael Myers was the sole reason I wanted to play this game, because I already was a big fan of the Halloween franchise and his character and I believe at least one licensed character can get quite a few horror fans excited.\n\nDBD has a unique artstyle, music and atmosphere. \nThe game has a unique uncomfortable horror vibe, even if it isn't exactly 'scary'. \nThe creepy, fleshy sounds the UI makes are recognizable as hell and give a nice vibe. \nThe art style is unique and good. The artists working at Behavior are incredibly talented and passionate. While the game might not have the best graphics, it has a really cool artstyle which I personally enjoy. \nThanks to this, this maps (for the most part) look very nice and atmospheric. \nThe music in this game is for the most part amazing. The different chase and terror radius themes each killer has are unique, uncomfortable and/or absolute bangers. Each gives each killer a unique identity and makes them stand out. I personally wish they would add unique themes for each map to play in the background outside of chase/the killers terror radius.\nThe sound design is also very satisfying. The squishy splatter sound survivors make when getting hit. for example, is very exciting.\n\nDBD has a unique gameplay concept.\nA 4v1 cat and mouse type game. The thrill of hiding and running away from the killer and the thrill of hunting down survivors is great and really fun most of the times.\nAs killer you have to track down and kill all 4 survivors, before the survivors repair all generators and escape.\nYou have to play time efficient and plan ahead. You have to make lots of decisions in very short time and while it can be frustrating it is also satisfying.\nAs survivor you face the killer in a team of 4 and have to work together to survive. \nSurvivors can either hide or loop the killer. That includes running to structures and trying to mindgame the killer to keep them busy for as long as possible. Looping a killer is almost like parkour. You have to be aware of your surroundings at all times and keep in mind that there is a killer with a unique ability chasing you down.\n\nDBD has huge variety in maps and killers.\nThere are a lot of unique maps, that all play and feel differently. Not only that, but the layout is randomized each time, meaning that certain tiles, doors and windows  spawn differently each match. \nThere are well over 20 killers in this game, each having a unique ability. There is a killer for pretty much everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe grind in this game is immense. \nIt takes forever to entirely level up all characters with all perks. I currently have 463 hours. I have exactly 3 killers with all perks unlocked that are currently available for me, only one of which is prestiged to level 3. You probably have to sacrifice over 1000 hours to completely level up everything. But then again; the grind ensures that there is a goal to work towards. \n\nA lot of killers and perks are locked behind huge paywalls. \nYou have to pay a huge amount of money to unlock all the characters and the perks, some of which are essential for playing on high level, so you will sort of be forced to pay more than 20 bucks to be able to compete after a certain point. I already paid way too much into this game than I'd like to admit, simply because I wanted to have certain perks a survivor or killer had.\n\nThere are plenty of balancing issues.\nExample being the recent inclusion of the perk \"Boon: Circle of Healing\" which completely broke the meta and pretty much killed a whole playstyle for killer. \nOther than that, there are maps that are very sided towards either killers or survivors. \nOn top of that, the meta is very stale. Naturally, you could apply this to any multiplayer game, but out of the hundreds and hundreds of perks you mostly see only around 6 each match in high level.\n\nThe community can be toxic. \nI personally changed my profile settings so that only my friends could comment because I have received several \"-rep camper and tunneler\" or \"-rep bad teammate\" at best and much worse insults at worst because of this game. The players in this game are very entitled. Many survivor mains expect killers to play a certain way to be nice and considerate of their fun (They usually aren't considerate in return) and blame the killer for their failure. You have to have a rather thick skin because you'll be insulted quite a bit and be able to take it. \n\nThe devs are confusing.\nI do not understand them. Sometimes they make good changes and other times they seem incompetent, almost as if they didn't know their own game. \nBHVR are one of the weirdest (and maybe worst) game developers I've come across, to the point, where I genuinely don't know what to expect from them.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game is not for everyone. It is a niche type of multiplayer game that not everyone can enjoy to the same degree. It can serve as a nice party-type game with friends, but you can also sweat the hell out of it and dedicated loads of money and hours into this. There are plenty of downsides, but I think the game is still fun and can be enjoyed. Since this is a multiplayer game, where the community has an overall competitive attitude, you cannot expect each match to go great or be fun. The lows in this game can be incredibly low and the highs can be incredibly high. \nI would still recommend this game, and tell people to try it out, especially if they enjoy the horror genre.","timestamp_created":1624219734,"timestamp_updated":1650635383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94080497","author":{"steamid":"76561198849190021","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1648867031},"language":"schinese","review":"被屠夫疯狂虐杀，我爱屠夫","timestamp_created":1624219486,"timestamp_updated":1624219486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94080427","author":{"steamid":"76561199017706467","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1640879083},"language":"polish","review":"pog\n","timestamp_created":1624219391,"timestamp_updated":1624219391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94080418","author":{"steamid":"76561198973131397","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1657653180},"language":"french","review":"wlh

Kendi arkadaşlarınızla oynarken nasıl keyifli olduğunu siz düşünün.","timestamp_created":1624217316,"timestamp_updated":1646811791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94078873","author":{"steamid":"76561198334001980","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":36043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3060,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1660595323},"language":"turkish","review":"400 saatim var katil oynuyınm karşıma 4k saatlik adamlar geliyor neyseki maçı alıyom ama böyle olmaz dbd","timestamp_created":1624217304,"timestamp_updated":1653213967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94078632","author":{"steamid":"76561198147107860","num_games_owned":413,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":8332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7283,"last_played":1658683105},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра","timestamp_created":1624216942,"timestamp_updated":1624216942,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94078530","author":{"steamid":"76561198855702350","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":29,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1660100103},"language":"english","review":"Freddy go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr","timestamp_created":1624216800,"timestamp_updated":1624216800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94078317","author":{"steamid":"76561198346599069","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9425,"last_played":1630756280},"language":"english","review":"Kinda laggy sometimes and the hitboxes are so big but I've enjoyed this game a lot\n","timestamp_created":1624216525,"timestamp_updated":1624216525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94078282","author":{"steamid":"76561198356747060","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":17091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1257,"last_played":1653223575},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é ótimo, porém tem alguns bugs e a comunidade é meio tóxica (como qualquer outro jogo ). \nE  para que você consiga a maioria dos personagens você vai ter gastar  entre 14 ou 24 reais ( sem contar os descontos ou as \"dlcs\" que só vem um personagem)","timestamp_created":1624216470,"timestamp_updated":1624216470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604519784450531006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94078238","author":{"steamid":"76561199024630873","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1649686403},"language":"russian","review":"игра топ","timestamp_created":1624216403,"timestamp_updated":1624216403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94077957","author":{"steamid":"76561198121721811","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1639367530},"language":"english","review":"I purchased this game after years of my friends asking me to buy it and play with them.

It was nowhere near as buggy but ever so much a shitfest of a game. Super sluggish controls, terrible skill checks during an already stressful hide and seek game, and also the killer apparently has never seen a pallet or ever missed a swing before because everytime you are faced with either of those things the Killer just stands there like \"my brain no understand wut just happin\" and you cant move.

Атмосфера (особенно в первое время) на высоте! Долгое время я играл за выживших (сурвов), но для разнообразия пересел на убийц. Расскажу подробней про игру за обе стороны.\nСурвы:\n\n1) Первое время вы будете бояться каждого шороха, сидеть в шкафу и молиться, чтобы киллер вас не нашел.\n2) Когда вы научитесь убегать, мансить и прятаться, уровень сложности в игре внезапно изменится для вас на TOO EZ.\n3) Добравшись до высоких рангов, вам станет слишком скучно просто заводить генераторы и сбегать. Вот тогда и начинается аутизм, который поражает большинство скилловых игроков (если у вас есть склонность к токсик поведению, то это определенно ваш случай). В чем это заключается:\nТеперь ваша задача - выбесить киллера настолько, насколько это возможно. Генераторы уходят на второй план.\nВ руке на выбор: тулбокс на почти мгновенную починку генератора, топовый фонарик (почти мгновенное ослепление маньяка) либо аптечка на мгновенный прохил.\nИз перков: обязательно Borrowed Time (чтобы успеть спасти другого БМящего сурва, которого наконец-то поймали), Decisive Strike (чтобы спрыгнуть с плеча маньяка, когда поймают вас), Self-care (чтобы стопить маньяка, мешая ему ударить других сурвов/донести до крюка, показывая, насколько вам не страшно), ну и Sprint Burst/Dead Hard (чтобы дольше мансить).\nКнопка Ctrl теперь вам нужна не для того, чтобы присесть и скрыться от киллера. Ее надо использовать, чтобы показать свое превосходство. Застанили маньяка доской? Поприседайте, покажите ему, какой он неудачник. Смогли добежать до ворот? Стойте там и ждите пока маньяк придет, чтобы показать, как плохо он сыграл. Киллер не может вас поймать? Ну вы просто обязаны показать ему, насколько вы круты.\nДля почти 100% вероятности сбежать всем, играйте вчетвером с друзьями с голосовой связью, идеальным сочетанием перков и предметов.\nПосле игры не забудьте написать в чат, насколько плох маньяк, что он нуб и должен умереть. Не сдерживайтесь в оскорблениях.\n\nВ целом игру за сурвов на высоких можно описать как \"детский\" режим сложности, в котором вы с одноклассниками издеваетесь над несчастными пенсионерами, которые тщетно пытаются вас прогнать.\n\nКиллеры:\n\nИгра за убийц - хард мод, в котором вы проходите серьезную проверку навыков.\n1) В начале игры вам будут попадаться новички, которые не умеют толком убегать, сидят за кустом и смотрят на вас (как будто вы их не видите -_-) и совершают кучу ошибок. В этот момент вы будете думать, что играть за киллеров слишком просто (типичная ошибка мейн сурвов, которые отыграют 1 катку на маньяке, а потом пишут, как все легко).\n2) Со временем вы опять же подниметесь до высоких рангов. Если к этому моменту вы не научились идеально играть за маньяка, то начнется АД. Как это выглядит:\nВы появились, пошли в сторону какого-то генератора, видите Дуайта в розовых штанах с фонариком в руке, который машет вам рукой и приседает. Он даже не пытается прятаться. 3 минуты пытаетесь его поймать. Опишу погоню: вы бегаете как идиот кругами вокруг пачки коробок раз 10, после чего он скидывает на вас доску, приседает и слепит фонариком в лицо. После этого он ведет вас к другой такой пачке коробок и все повторяется (игроки называют это pallet looping). За это время заводят 3 генератора, остается 2, и вы понимаете, что находитесь в полной ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. \"Ну и ладно\", - думаете вы. - \"Пойду ловить кого-то еще.\" Как бы не так. Дуайт не пытается от вас убежать, а ходит за вами и продолжает отвлекать фонариком, прыгать в окна и приседать. При любой попытке наказать наглеца он возвращается к своим любимым доскам. Вы находите Клодеттку, которая мирно чинит генератор. Довольно легко ловите ее и предвкушаете, как наконец-то повесите хоть кого на крюк. Но в момент поднятия перед вами появляется Дуайт, слепит вас, вы роняете Клодеттку, она убегает. А вы остаетесь смотреть на Дуайта, который продолжает приседать. Заводят 4-ый генератор. Вы решаете дальше гоняться за Дуайтом, каким-то магическим образом его ловите и готовитесь нести на крюк. Но даже не надейтесь! У него есть перк Decisive Strike, с помощью которого он спрыгивает с плеча и продолжает заниматься аутизмом. Заводят 5-ый генератор, питание на ворота подано. Вы решаете во что бы то ни стало поймать мерзкого Дуайта, который испортил вам игру, и не упускаете его из вида. Ловите. Несете на крюк и вешаете. За это время другие сурвы успели открыть ворота, но убегать они не спешат. \"Дуайт бесил меня всю игру и должен умереть\" - думаете вы и стоите рядом с крюком. Но у вас нет шансов. Прибегает та самая Клодеттка, полностью игнорируя вас, и снимает Дуайта с крюка. Вы ударяете его, но он не падает! Он продолжает бежать прямо к воротам, а пока вы бежите за ним, Клодеттка бегает перед глазами и замедляет вас. Дуайт добегает до ворот. Все четверо приседают перед выходом и убегают. После этого в чате вам напишут \"нуб\", \"кемпер\", \"убей себя\" и т. д. Если у вас открыт профиль, то туда вам напишут \"-rep даун, кемпер, нуб, не умеет играть\" и так далее, после чего играть \"честно\" (по мнению сурвов) у вас уже нет ни малейшего желания.\nЧерез несколько игр у вас уже не будет настроения играть за маньяков, так как это очень изматывает и разочаровывает в людях. Поэтому несколько раз подумайте, игра за киллеров не для слабонервных.\n\"И в чем плюс игры за маньяков, зачем ты за них играешь?\" - спросите вы. А я отвечу:\n1) Вы учитесь думать наперед. Прикидываете, что стоит делать и куда идти, продумываете стратегию, и это научит вас учиться на своих ошибках.\n2) Вы учитесь экономить время. В условиях недостатка времени нет смысла тратить его на подобных Дуайтов, цель которых - ваше время отнять. Вы учитесь делать именно то, что будет для вас полезно.\n3) Вы тренируете стрессоустойчивость. Действительно, эта игра - наверное лучшее место, чтобы тренировать свои нервы и терпение, а также внимание. И вы ничем не рискуете, ведь последствий на вашу реальную жизнь игра не окажет.\n\nТаким образом, в то время как для сурвов это \"детская игра\", для киллеров DBD является своеобразной \"школой жизни\", после которой вы научитесь не обращать внимание на злых людей, которые только и пытаются вас спровоцировать.\n\nИменно поэтому я продолжаю страдать за убийц и проводить время с пользой.\n\nНадеюсь, что мой отзыв хоть как-то помог вам сделать свой выбор. Крепких нервов вам!

With 496 hours (6/19/21), I've had many experiences with this game, both good and bad. Not every game is perfect, and not every game will be of everyone's liking. I hope this review helps identify the aspects of this game well to help you with your purchase! :)\n\n[u] General [/u]\nIn my personal opinion, I would rate this game a 7/10, but of course, this is heavily subject to change. Am I saying this is a bad game? No, in fact, this is probably my favorite game, despite the cons that are followed. If you aren't clearly aware of what this game is, it's a 4v1 multiplayer game, where there are four survivors and one killer. The survivors' objective is to repair five out of eight generators and escape before being sacrificed to the entity by the killer. The killer's job, surprise surprise, is to kill all four survivors and not let any of them escape. More specifically, you must hook each survivor three times to sacrifice them to the entity, which renders them dead. \n\nOne of the things I like most about this game is the amount of collaborations with licensed characters the devs added, such as Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Nemesis, and my favorite, the Demogorgon. This game itself has brought me into watching the horror movies these characters came from, which is now my favorite genre. Overall, this game has shaped my likings, with being my favorite game as well as welcoming me to new experiences in every day life.\n\n[u] Pros and Cons of DBD [/u]\nHere I will list the pros and cons of Dead by Daylight.\n\nPROS:\n- Straight forward game, not very difficult to get the hang of.\n- Use of teamwork and team bonding.\n- Very efficient game to play with friends on.\n- Make new friends and enter a new community.\n- Easy to make videos with, stream, clip, etc.\n- Playable killers and survivors from familiar movies / shows.\n- Consistent major updates (every 3 months) with new killers and survivors.\n- Devs host meaningful and fun events, such as the LGBTQ live streams, holiday events, anniversary events, etc.\n- Though sometimes toxic, a great community to share likings with others.\n- Devs constantly striving to make the game look better/feel better. (New animations, new UI, remodeled meshes, reworked maps, etc.)\n\nCONS:\n- Occasional bugs/glitches/crashes, especially after a major update before bug fixes.\n- Maps rarely disabled due to issues.\n- Common boring matches, where killers decide to either tunnel, camp, slug, etc.\n- Match making screws up often. Lots of reports for players who go against much higher or much lower ranks than their own.\n- Finding a match can take quite a bit of time, especially at night.\n- Updating the game seems fairly quickly, but unpacking can take about 20 minutes.\n- **Hitboxes** (for example, a killer can hit you from their screen when you're far away from them on yours).\n- VPNing/lag switching/bad ping/bad internet can lead to a very laggy game.\n\n[u] Conclusion [/u]\nI hope this review slightly helps! Overall, this game is my favorite game of all, even though there are slight cons to this game. This kind of game is one of those love/hate games, where you either love it or hate it, depending on the match you have. Hope this helped, and I hope you have a great day/night! :)\n\n-KimShaY / Maddie","timestamp_created":1624214758,"timestamp_updated":1624214758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94076797","author":{"steamid":"76561198846223306","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":15209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":195,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1660483620},"language":"russian","review":"Наиграл около 60 часов, игра всё еще не надоедает :)","timestamp_created":1624214587,"timestamp_updated":1638007319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94076454","author":{"steamid":"76561198142104738","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":75905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":440,"playtime_at_review":11191,"last_played":1660509310},"language":"english","review":"This is a fun game with friends. its scary at first to play as survivorbut when you learn a little bit about the killers and survivors its more fun.
