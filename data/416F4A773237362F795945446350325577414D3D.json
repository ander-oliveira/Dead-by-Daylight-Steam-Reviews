It is quite scary but it's not he scariest. I've had a few moments were I've been jumped scared but its not often. Another thing that I love about this game is the prestige system. I love how they make it so where if you can get a character up to a high enough level it will actually keep those perks so you can use them on other characters. The downfall to this game is the survivor nerfs. I think they need to balance out the game between survivors and killers. A basic run down of this game is there are four survivors and one killer. The killer objective is to find the four survivors and hang them. The survivors goal is to fix all the generators and open the door to escape. The fun part about this game is the pure adrenaline that comes from running away from the killer. Coming from a non horror fan, this game is amazing. The non stop grinding for Blood points (the games currency to level up your characters} and the fun I've had with my friends is truly UN-forgettable.

There's nothing like the thrill of hitting a cross-map hatchet throw with the Huntress.\n♦ There are microtransactions, but it's not as in-your-face as other games. You can earn most of the cosmetics by playing the game, but you have to play a lot. Would avoid if you have severe impulse control issues.\n♦ There are some major reworks coming soon, which will probably drastically change the meta game, so if you're a player who decided to walk away, give it a go.\n\n[h1]THE LONG VERSION:[/h1]\n\nDead by Daylight is a game that I have played since the summer of 2017. I started on console, which is where most of my progress lies. I have seen a lot of this game's history. I've made memories which will follow me forever in this game. I was there when they announced the Nightmare on Elm Street chapter. I remember playing against OG Legion when they had them on PTB. My friend changed his stream name to reflect a moment we experienced in this game. I've also purchased this game for my brother, fiancée, and some friend. So, to say that I enjoy it is a bit of an understatement.\n\nAs someone with a sports game background, I am not a stranger to playing against people online. The players in those communities are typical of many other gaming communities in that they talk a lot of trash. While this community has its toxic members, there are so many kind and accepting people in its ranks as well. We've all spammed the crouch button as a means to greet, taunt, and thank other players. And a lot of us know this, and appreciate the experiences that other players have had, and acknowledge the shortcomings of the game as well as our own play-styles.\n\nThere have been times I have doubted this game. There have been times where perks straight-up did not work on console, and sometimes that bleeds into the PC arena. Issues still plague the code, and there are a lot of things that need to be fixed, but it would be a mistake to say that the developers at BHVR don't care. The devs of this game, from an outside perspective, seem to be some of the hardest working people in the industry. Game development, after all, is hard work. But this team has been expertly squashing bugs for the five years I've been playing, and they deserve credit for that.\n\nSo, if you're reading this, thanks, devs.\n\nThat being said, I suppose I should actually review the game.\n\nDead by Daylight has been around since 2016, it is a 4v1 asymmetric horror game which pits four survivors in an eternal battle against the rotating roster of killers.\n\nThe original characters range from obvious references to horror legends to icons in the horror genre ranging from Sadako (Ringu) to Nemesis (Resident Evil) to Pyramid Head (Silent Hill) and the list goes on. Chances are, if your favorite horror legend isn't in Dead by Daylight, they may show up in the future. The objective of the killer is pretty much what it says on the tin: you have to kill survivors. You get a basic attack as well as a special power (which can range from projectiles to a one hit down).\n\nSurvivors, on the other hand, are responsible for repairing five generators and attempting to escape through the exit gates. There isn't a lot to say about survivor play, it's pretty much the same no matter which character you select. This is the role I have the most experience with, as I mostly play this game with friends, which is the best way to enjoy this mode. At the very least, you can share in the pain of getting wrecked by a weirdly matched killer. At the most, you develop an unspoken synergy that leads to you being a great teammate.\n\nThe graphics have recently been overhauled, and it looks different than it did when I started playing. Some players disagree on whether it's better or worse, but it's definitely more vibrant, which I appreciate.\n\nThe developers have also been reworking a lot of the killer chase music lately, to the point where if you play as Legion and use a Mixtape offering (a consumable item which modifies your power), you get a different type of chase music. It's neat little add-ons like this that make the game so cool to me, and help it stand out as a labor of love.\n\nThere are microtransactions and a premium currency in this game, which are the biggest marks against it. You can earn most of the cosmetics in the game by playing the game, but you have to play a lot. There is also a season pass for the Tome which costs about $10 at time of writing, and if you play a lot, you can unlock things like Auric Cells (the game's premium currency), cosmetics, and charms. To me, it isn't as insidious or in-your-face as some games, but again, if you have any issues with impulse control, it might be wise to avoid.\n\nAll told, I recommend this game to most players who are looking to play a good party game. It's the granddaddy of all asymmetric horror, as far as I'm concerned, and it's had staying power for a reason. If you can grab it while it's on sale, definitely do so; or if you have XBox Game Pass, you can play it as long as you have a subscription (again, as of time of writing).\n\nIn summary, if you are a horror fan who loves teamwork, as well as the thrill of winning a lethal game of tag, I hope that you decide to play this game. If you do, I look forward to seeing you in the Fog.\n\nThanks for reading, y'all.","timestamp_created":1656049070,"timestamp_updated":1656049369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117496105","author":{"steamid":"76561198981718662","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1656141066},"language":"schinese","review":"够格","timestamp_created":1656048299,"timestamp_updated":1656048299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117496023","author":{"steamid":"76561199160877843","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3826,"last_played":1659048152},"language":"english","review":"its

How many times I've gotten a kill streak etc etc. This game needs a stats update!","timestamp_created":1656028898,"timestamp_updated":1656028898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117483659","author":{"steamid":"76561199220200142","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1657307581},"language":"english","review":"Pretty Gaming","timestamp_created":1656028829,"timestamp_updated":1656028829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117483472","author":{"steamid":"76561199241942442","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":9253,"last_played":1660081993},"language":"english","review":"no.","timestamp_created":1656028526,"timestamp_updated":1656028526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw276/yYEDcP2UwAM="}
