game itself is pretty good in terms of the game mechanism, but it's too bad to balance and match the mechanism. The fun of the game itself is that there is no communication between the teammates. Everyone has their own ideas, which leads to the altruistic or egoistic behavior, and the game and decision-making are a great highlight. China's black racing team has completely destroyed this. Due to the accessibility of information in the convoy, the high efficiency repair and rescue actions achieved by the butcher's location are mutually assured. Especially in the aspect of machine repair, it can be said that the speed of repair by motorcade is two times that of passers-by. The impact of the team on the game environment and its bad: 1, the team likes to bully the novice butcher in the 20 paragraph to satisfy his ugly lust, seriously affecting the new players to join the Dead by Daylight 2, the speed and mockery of the motorcade has led to the butcher's widespread adoption of the corpse strategy. At the same time, this strategy has spread to the pedestrian Bureau, causing a double loss of human and butcher's game experience. Conclusion: almost all the corpses at present, the motor repair is too fast, and the butcher experience is poor. Almost all these problems are caused by the black racing team. However, the official is not aware of this, and every update is only made to make some fur changes on the undercut, and the bad effects of the real motorcade are unheard of.","timestamp_created":1527317949,"timestamp_updated":1527317949,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561487734317779541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42269864","author":{"steamid":"76561198359022176","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8104,"last_played":1540894728},"language":"schinese","review":"黎明杀机天下第一","timestamp_created":1527317703,"timestamp_updated":1527317703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42269674","author":{"steamid":"76561198321515811","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1642358971},"language":"russian","review":"=)\n","timestamp_created":1527317216,"timestamp_updated":1629987102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42269528","author":{"steamid":"76561198346485753","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":63542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52479,"last_played":1637851228},"language":"thai","review":"ดรี","timestamp_created":1527316716,"timestamp_updated":1527316716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42269480","author":{"steamid":"76561198816046386","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":139178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1539,"last_played":1625506028},"language":"spanish","review":"EXCELENTE","timestamp_created":1527316581,"timestamp_updated":1527316581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42269131","author":{"steamid":"76561198396200400","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24793,"last_played":1612716230},"language":"schinese","review":"黎明杀机真尼玛好玩！","timestamp_created":1527315472,"timestamp_updated":1527315472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42268792","author":{"steamid":"76561198282433166","num_games_owned":468,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1655435142},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好玩的，就是你这匹配速度太尼玛的快了，我tm等了5分钟，连个毛都没有","timestamp_created":1527314523,"timestamp_updated":1587734695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42268570","author":{"steamid":"76561198372506786","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2505,"last_played":1657964729},"language":"schinese","review":"海星，就是匹配bug快点修复，半天排不到人","timestamp_created":1527313890,"timestamp_updated":1527313890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42268489","author":{"steamid":"76561198124779846","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":23750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":143,"playtime_at_review":3638,"last_played":1660470926},"language":"schinese","review":"确实很耐玩而且新手的惊慌感，值得入手而且，不挂加速器可以玩，好玩！推荐！","timestamp_created":1527313620,"timestamp_updated":1527313620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42268191","author":{"steamid":"76561198309669587","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":9741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":62,"playtime_at_review":7678,"last_played":1659726703},"language":"schinese","review":"遛屠夫","timestamp_created":1527312714,"timestamp_updated":1527312714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42268186","author":{"steamid":"76561198283510561","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":

A major aspect of this is the proof-of-work protocol required to regulate and verify blockchain transactions on networks such as Ethereum, which consumes a large amount of electricity; Estimating the carbon footprint of a given NFT transaction involves a variety of assumptions about the manner in which that transaction is set up on the blockchain, the economic behavior of blockchain miners (and the energy demands of their mining equipment), as well as the amount of renewable energy being used on these networks. There are also conceptual questions, such as whether the carbon footprint estimate for an NFT purchase should incorporate some portion of the ongoing energy demand of the underlying network, or just the marginal impact of that particular purchase. An analogy that's been described for this is the footprint associated with an additional passenger on a given airline flight.\n\nSome more recent NFT technologies use alternative validation protocols, such as proof of stake, that have much less energy usage for a given validation cycle. Other approaches to reducing electricity include the use of off-chain transactions as part of minting an NFT. A number of NFT art sites are also looking to address these concerns, and some are moving to using technologies and protocols with lower associated footprints. Others now allow the option of buying carbon offsets when making NFT purchases, although the environmental benefits of this have been questioned. In some instances, NFT artists have decided against selling some of their own work to limit carbon emission contributions.","timestamp_created":1527302740,"timestamp_updated":1634745417,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42264778","author":{"steamid":"76561198449864205","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":38091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5986,"last_played":1655989060},"language":"tchinese","review":"粉好玩","timestamp_created":1527302432,"timestamp_updated":1527302432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42264678","author":{"steamid":"76561198359153720","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1638628886},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏不错，但是匹配机制对新手也太不友好了，我一个技能对上四个技能的屠夫，不用玩了好吧~_~","timestamp_created":1527302077,"timestamp_updated":1527302077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42264251","author":{"steamid":"76561198373574415","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3675,"last_played":1546600184},"language":"schinese","review":"ena","timestamp_created":1527300748,"timestamp_updated":1527300748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42264121","author":{"steamid":"76561198207113629","num_games_owned":530,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":360523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1400,"playtime_at_review":359044,"last_played":1660547332},"language":"spanish","review":"Al igual que netflix los desarrolladores son unos pelotudos que terminan matando mas a su juego, con parches cada vez mas horribles, en vez de balancear el juego lo hunden cada vez mas y le sacan las cosas divertidas.","timestamp_created":1527300387,"timestamp_updated":1658477707,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530813336372375488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42264065","author":{"steamid":"76561198071421056","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1473558810},"language":"english","review":"chiefd20","timestamp_created":1527300201,"timestamp_updated":1527300201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42263959","author":{"steamid":"76561198386182174","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":20315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3482,"last_played":1614674487},"language":"schinese","review":"非常好玩的游戏，萌新玩的是恐怖游戏，玩久了就是欢乐农场，推荐大家来玩耍","timestamp_created":1527299817,"timestamp_updated":1527299817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42263573","author":{"steamid":"76561198120507236","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":220,"playtime_at_review":3259,"last_played":1660446954},"language":"english","review":"Balancing issues, Rank issues, toxic community.

BHVR has reached an all time low in my opinion with what they have done to the game. Their greed knows no bounds and their only concern seems to be pushing out overpriced skins and DLC, with no bug fixes, no quality of life improvements, no proper balance/meta shifts, no reworks on the killers/addons/items/perks that need them. Just push push push the DLC and fix stuff on the sidelines once it starts becoming too much of a problem. \n\n     The 4.5 patch seems like it might be the final nail in the coffin for me and I'm sad to see it happen. I love this game, I started playing in 2017 and I've met most of my current online friends through this game and the different communities brought together by it. But this patch is a slap in the face to old, new, and future players with BHVR's continued selfishness and stubbornness. \n\n     Before even putting out the PTB for this patch, they made an announcement that they knew we'd be upset over the UI and survivor locomotion, but that we would get used to it. They didn't care about our feedback or opinions on these changes, and immediately dismissed any criticism they would receive by saying this. They do not care what the players think. They have Fog Whisperers who are a variety of content creators meant to promote the game, engage with the community, and offer advice and direct feedback to the devs but they seem to never listen to them. \n\n     As a colorblind player I'm also unbelievably frustrated that it has taken them this long to even begin implementing a colorblind mode. They claimed on twitter after the announcement that they had been working on it for a few months now and felt now would be a good time to tell us but I call ʙᴜʟʟꜱʜɪᴛ. They used [url=https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1352376019077001219?s=20] [u] generic in-game screenshots with photoshopped changes to the generator aura/atmosphere and scratches on the ground. [/u] [/url]\n\n     Previously they were of the opinion that it would give non-colorblind players a competitive advantage.. but even that didn't make sense. It's not like we were asking for fluorescent colors that would allow us to see a Claudette from 100m away, we just wanted to SEE the stuff that we are meant to be seeing: scratches, blood, and auras. To other players, it makes no difference if auras are red, blue, yellow, green or purple. But to colorblind players it's been a huge ꜰᴜᴄᴋɪɴɢ deal. It took @stevenspohn to call them out on their ꜱʜɪᴛ after the Lead Game Designer Ethan, AKA Almo, [url=https://streamable.com/b5mj1q] [u] expressed his continued annoyance to colorblind feature requests. [/u] [/url] Constantly dismissing them as if it was such a burden for him. How do the devs think WE feel? \n\n     Nobody asks for half the changes they make. They have time and time again made adjustments to killers/sounds/visual indicators and now UI and movement - that nobody wanted and have complained about. The devs don't care. It does not matter how long you have played this game, how much of an influence you have on the community, how much money you have spent - you are nothing to them and whatever they say goes. \n\nDo yourself a favor and don't buy this ꜰᴜᴄᴋɪɴɢ game.","timestamp_created":1527289919,"timestamp_updated":1612916813,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521276593208312988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42260516","author":{"steamid":"76561198040409639","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":45247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31289,"last_played":1659222468},"language":"english","review":"entity

Não é o caso. Eu recomendo mas o jogo não é perfeito. E para que fique mais claro vou deixar em pontos:\n\nPositivo: \n- Jogabilidade: Fluida, tranquila. Sem (MUITOS) bugs. Acho que quando comecei era BEM pior os bugs, senhor. A cada atualização fica melhor mas nada é perfeito né.\n\n- Sistema de Perks e Recompensas\n\n- Jogo praticamente interminavel: Se você procura um jogo \"quero fazer todas as conquistas mas que demore muito tempo e seja bem dificil\" então esse é o seu jogo para fazer. \n\n- Otimo para jogar junto: O jogo em time é muito bom e perfeito para jogar com amigos.\n\n\nNegativo:\n- Servidor: que Hosteia é o killer então deve se esperar que as pessoas tenham boa internet e boa fé para não ficar de legs de sacanagem é claro.\n- História: O jogo na real tem até uma históriazinha (inha, inha) de cada personagem em si. Mas do enredo não tem. É realmente um 4x1 em que ou você o sobrevivente, ou o Killer.\n\n- DLC's: O jogo cresceu tanto que vários personagens (Freddy, Michael Myers etc) você tem que comprar a parte. O pior realmente não é esse e sim que você vai acabar jogando contra os personagens que são de DLCS ou que tem os Perks dessas dlcs. Você não tem como ter acesso a esses perks a não ser com a sorte da Shine que muda toda a semana.\n\n- Dinheiro: Se você for contar o quanto você vai gastar com DLCs, Jogo base etc... Não acho que valeria a  pena todo esse dinheiro.\n\n- Comunidade Tóxica: Ao mesmo tempo que é um otimo jogo para passar o tempo com os amigos o jogo também tem uma comunidade tóxica. Tanto killers (campers) quanto survivors (quitters, pallet loop). São pessoas sem paciencia, sem mãe, sem maturidade etc... Galera que vai xingar no perfil, que fica bolado com tudo, que quer reportar tudo... Enfim... Mas acho que é só um adendo mesmo porque né... O mundo é assim: cheio de gente escrota, então como um jogo totalmente online não vai ser?","timestamp_created":1527278946,"timestamp_updated":1527278946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":51,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.827742099761962891","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42256891","author":{"steamid":"76561198060488985","num_games_owned":331,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":450,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1494438092},"language":"german","review":"Läuft bei mir Kappa","timestamp_created":1527278821,"timestamp_updated":1527278821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505824685096740723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42256560","author":{"steamid":"76561198132318232","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":32759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7407,"last_played":1641596318},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1527278083,"timestamp_updated":1527278083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42256360","author":{"steamid":"76561198440100827","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1554733931},"language":"english","review":"yes iss vry nice","timestamp_created":1527277671,"timestamp_updated":1527277671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42256144","author":{"steamid":"76561198358295655","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1461,"last_played":1586698255},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno pero para jugar con equipo completo :D","timestamp_created":1527277143,"timestamp_updated":1527277143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vfizzOMCcPGYoQE="}
