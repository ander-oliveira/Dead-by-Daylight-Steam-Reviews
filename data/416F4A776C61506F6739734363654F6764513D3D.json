However it has many flaws that can and probably will cause you to steer clear of it in it's triple digit hours. I would still personally reccomend you get it though.\n\nIf you're going to read my long ass and quite controversial review, here's a short overview of the actual gameplay for you.\n\nTHE GAME:\n\nSURVIVOR: You must escape and survive the round. You do this by fixing the generators scattered around the map. You need atleast 5 generators fixed to escape, and have 3 other survivors you can and probably should work together with to win. However, the killer will try to prevent you from escaping by damaging worked on generators (not finished) and trying to sacrifice and chase found survivors. You can (and should) help your endangered survivors by healing them if they're bleeding (as they'll make noise and leave a trail of blood when bleeding) or if they're already on the hook, take em off of it. Obviously that's a short version of it but hey, that's BASICALLY it.\n\nKILLER: You must sacrifice the aforementioned survivors to the one and only spider god, The Entity. You do this by hitting the survivors twice, one to injure them, the second to make them flop to the floor. Once they're sufficiently flopped you pick them up (WARNING: They can wiggle out of your grasp if you take too long, or stab you once during the match to get out if they have a specific perk) and carry them to the hook. Once they're hooked the entity will slowly engulf the hook, once the entity has progressed though the entire hook, that survivor will be sacrificed and lose the match. You technically win after one sacrifice, but should always shoot for being an overachiever and try to get all four.\n\nNow that you know how to play the game, assuming you didn't already, the actual review will now start. Warning: It's long and sorta controversial in its opinions so, yeah.\n\nOkay, so this game is getting a lot of hate, and honestly, it kinda deserves it. Those points (which I'll get to in a bit) are valid. However, I don't really think that those problems are big enough to \"steer clear\" of the whole game as MANY reviews state. This game has issues, yes, but it's really one of the most original and creative games to come out in recent years. Not to mention incredibly addictive torwards the start of when you first get it. But, just to gloss over some of the big pros and cons, I'll list some pros and cons. \n\nPROS:\nGameplay itself is fun and original, if not a bit repetitive when you know what you're doing. You won't find many other titles that have similar gameplay to this game, and it's pretty damn fun when you first start out.\nLots of charm. This game is pretty far out there when you think about it... Spider god feasting on some random kids to harvest their \"hope\" huh, well that's interesting... Not to mention an interesting but admittingly incomplete lore if you look for it.\nPretty damn skill based, now a lot of people could disagree with me on this but getting to rank one isn't easy. It's a game you can very well \"git gud\" at. If people disagree, just ask them to pull a \"kobe\" as survivor or be able to track blood and identify breathing as a killer. It takes practice!\nDifferent survivors with different perks that impact playstyle. While this may not hold up later in the game experience, it matters hugely at the very beginning. Wanna run? Meg. Wanna boost effiency? Dwight. Wanna heal? Claudette. Wanna be a pain in the killer's ass? Jake!\nDifferent killers with different perks and hugely different abilities.  This holds up all game, if you choose to play a killer you will need to test them all out. There's a killer for each playstyle, and even some adaptability for some of them. Like, if you like how the Trapper looks but hate taking the time to set traps, just play \"Man with a machete\" mode, who even cares?\nLearnable maps that are randomly generated, to an extent. Some maps are way more different than others, such as \"Gas Heaven\" being part of the same set as \"Autohaven Wreckers\" they seriously aren't that alike at all. However, most are just rearranged closests and chests, which allow for some degree of memorization.\nJust to mention it, this game IS infinitely more fun with friends, the difference is that this game makes it near paramount. It completely changes the nature of the game. I highly reccomend that a friend has the game, you buy a friend the game, or even make some friends while playing the game.\n\nCONS:\nOkay so it's about to seem like I hate the game, which isn't THAT true. It just has a lot of flaws that do need to be adressed. The devs often livestream, and do seem like nice guys, but I'm just not sure if they ever do fix the many things that they know and address that are broken.\nFor a start, Campers are fucking everywhere, jesus. There seriously needs to be a fix or some kind of counter to this. So far the only counter is \"Lmao forget that dying guy let's just fix more gens XD!!!\" which, this might just be me, makes me kinda sad. I should have the power to save him! So far the only perk that addresses this is something called \"Borrowed Time\" which allows you to stay standing after being hit as long as you took that hit to save someone. Seeing as the effect is temporary, and can only be used once during a match really ruins the perk for me. The sad thing is, this may never be fixed as one of the Devs is a camping trapper main.\nMatchmaking, oh lord the matchmaking. This really needs to be fixed, and was fixed for a while, but broke again. How does that happen? Anyway, what happens is that it takes a LONG time to get into games, and when you do get in game, you might be in a game with four rank 1 survivors as a rank 20 killer, or vice versa. One protip though, as a reward for reading this huge thing: If you join via \"Survive with friends\" instead of play as survivor your chance of getting in a game will be heightened dramatically. Even if you don't invite any friends to the queue.\nCheap strats, cause in a game that is as grindy as this game is, why actually play when you can cheapskate your way through it? This does include camping, but I'm also calling out saboteur (which allows survivors to break hooks) and machine gun builds (which essentially make you die if you get hit once). But, because they're perks that have been packaged with the game they're obviously totally fine and fair. C'mon guys seriously, y'know they make the game boring and not fun for anyone and everyone, just stop? K?\nThe Community, now I actually kinda disagree about this one. But it is still worthy of mention. More often than not, the killer you did so well against will complain and flame you in end game chat. Or, the survivors that you steamrolled will have a nice circlejerk on your performance. However, what game doesn't have this problem? Maybe not to the extent of this game's community but I still have made plenty of friends playing it, and honestly, it really doesn't bother that much. Nor did it really ever bother me. Still, if that's a problem for you, that's understandable, and be aware of the community.\nThere's more problems, but I feel like you get the big picture.\n\nSo, again, overall this game has a lot of bugs. Those bugs are somewhat gamebreaking and I'm not sure if they'll be fixed. However, those problems won't pop up until like level 30-40 and maybe like 50 hours into the game. A $20 dollar game. Get it for those first 50 hours, cause it truly is something magical, hell I have 150+ hours and I still enjoy it wholeheartedly. Just be careful not to wear yourself out on it because it IS repetitive. \n\nSo, if you read this huge ol' review and liked it, feel free to leave a comment. Played the game and disagree with the review? Comment why below. I'm actually interested, no, seriously, I mean it. Anyway, I hope you get the game and enjoy it, maybe even make some friends while playing it. So uh, bye and have a good day.","timestamp_created":1490586434,"timestamp_updated":1490586434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537091970443725586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30765062","author":{"steamid":"76561198277232125","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5957,"last_played":1595929798},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра, можно поугорать с друзьями да или одному","timestamp_created":1490584944,"timestamp_updated":1490584944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30764855","author":{"steamid":"76561198346616129","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4350,"last_played":1596380970},"language":"thai","review":"ดี\n","timestamp_created":1490583622,"timestamp_updated":1490583622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30764300","author":{"steamid":"76561198183879377","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1490515551},"language":"brazilian","review":"Joguem essa porra sz\n","timestamp_created":1490580483,"timestamp_updated":1490580483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30764295","author":{"steamid":"76561198313254099","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2823,"last_played":1616133742},"language":"russian","review":"Rhenfffff","timestamp_created":1490580448,"timestamp_updated":1490580448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30763954","author":{"steamid":"76561198373636737","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":52,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1490479585},"language":"english","review":"Impossible to find lobbies.
