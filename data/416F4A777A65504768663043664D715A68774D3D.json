polecam ze względu na błędy z serwerami, robię se misje, jest już zrobiona tylko muszę skończyć meczyk, a tu nagle mnie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ z meczu i nie dość, że nie dostaje bloodpointsów za mecz, nie dostaję też progresu do questa, a jedyne co dostaję to ban na 5 minut za opuszczenie rozgrywki. Nie jest to już pierwsza taka sytuacja, przy intensywnych rozgrywkach dzieje mi się tak średnio raz na tydzień, dwa. Co ciekawe sytuacja występuje jedynie gdy gram killerem, podczas gry survem jeszcze nie zdarzyło mi się, żeby mnie wywaliło. I nie, nie jest to problem z moim internetem, gdyż mam go na kablu ze światłowodu i od razu jak mnie wywala, to alt tabuję i wszystko inne mi chodzi, po minucie gierka się znowu odpala, ale co mi z tego jak straciłem możliwość dokończenia jedynego w swoim rodzaju meczu, który trwał już jakieś 20 minut. Z innych negatywnych aspektów można wymienić także fakt długiego procesu levelowania postaci (jeśli chcesz tworzyć jakieś sensowne kombinacje perków, to przydałoby się mieć już trochę godzin). Survem praktycznie nie da się grać samemu, chyba że jesteś bardzo dobry albo akurat trafią Ci się sensowni ludzie lub killer nie ogarnia, ale przeważnie twoi kompani będą przeszkadzać Ci w twoim planie na rozgrywkę. Killer często może też kampić i tunelować, bo 4 graczy, jeśli są ogarnięci i grają zespołowo ma pewną przewagę nad killerem, dlatego najłatwiejszym sposobem na \"zwycięstwo\" jest wyeliminowanie już na początku rozgrywki jednego z survów, a często nawet i dwóch, żeby nie pozostawić im żadnych realnych szans. Eventy polegają jedynie na kolejnej dawce challengów, za których wykonanie możesz zdobyć jeden skin dla surva i killera lub po prostu na wpisaniu odpowiedniego kodu, z którego dostaniesz breloczek do postaci lub haka. System dobierania meczu też nie jest najlepszy, killera dopasowuje do podobnej liczby mmr grupy survów, możesz być początkujący w grze i nie znać jeszcze wszystkich sztuczek, ale trafiać na zaawansowanych killerów lub survów, tylko dlatego że średnia survów jest podobna do killera, mimo że umiejętności graczy często odbiegają od siebie. Killerzy są mocno niezbalansowani, jednak taka jest idea, żeby każdy się czymś wyróżniał, większością gra się podobnie, to nawet na plus. Ale co z tego wszystkiego jak i tak dalej będziesz w to grał, bo nie ma innej takiej podobnej gry z taką bazą graczy.","timestamp_created":1636592755,"timestamp_updated":1636666602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102565019","author":{"steamid":"76561198218326019","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":17774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15862,"last_played":1658437001},"language":"english","review":"its ok","timestamp_created":1636592542,"timestamp_updated":1636592542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102564773","author":{"steamid":"76561198283431475","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1659295361},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo de pega pega, só que se você não souber se esconder... pagará com sua vida nobre soldado!!!","timestamp_created":1636592085,"timestamp_updated":1636592085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102564485","author":{"steamid":"76561199096381920","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":201,"playtime_at_review":7968,"last_played":1659829670},"language":"brazilian","review":"ruim","timestamp_created":1636591544,"timestamp_updated":1636591544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102563912","author":{"steamid":"76561199121686594","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3835,"last_played":1650487697},"language":"english","review":"the best game to ever exist 10/10 would recommend im you disagree you like boys \n\n\n\n\nand this guy named volicot is fruity","timestamp_created":1636590554,"timestamp_updated":1636590554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498275190591812134","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102563441","author":{"steamid":"76561199215898015","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1636393264},"language":"russian","review":"хочу вернуть бабки","timestamp_created":1636589717,"timestamp_updated":1636589717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102563346","author":{"steamid":"76561198216998445","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":19547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":10167,"last_played":1660075921},"language":"english","review":"It becomes more fun the longer you play, learn the perks and how they change the game.

TL:DR – Good Game.  Bad Community.  Get the game if you are playing private matches with 5 friends.  Otherwise, save your time and money.\n\nLET ME BE CLEAR:  The game itself is a solid:  The gameplay is as tense as it is engaging. If you're a survivor, you're constantly looking over your shoulder.  If you're the killer, you are stressed out about generators and chasing down survivors.  When a chase begins, **chef kiss** it is pure perfection.  The sounds, the music, the visuals; the craftsmanship here is on full display.  The game has a lot of potential to be very fun.  But like all multiplayer-only games, the community decides if you will enjoy this game.  And the community has decided that you don't deserve a good time.\n\nThe toxicity of the community is unparalleled these days; and that's coming from someone that came up in arcades playing Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter.  If anyone remembers how bad Halo was, or how caustic people were in DOTA, then this community will seem very familiar.  Tea-bagging, condescension, gatekeeping, and elitism saturate every match you play.  My first match as killer I was being taunted with flashlights and tea-bagged after pallet drops.  In the post-game chat, I said GG and said it was my first time as killer; hoping to get some advice or at least a “Keep at it, we all sucked our first time.”  I was, instead, smothered under an avalanche of comments about how I suck, should uninstall the game, then kill myself.  I tried to power thru.  I played a few more matches and got, I think, a lot better as killer.  But the final straw came when my friend sent me the Youtube video of that first match.  He came across this video while browsing Dead by Daylight strategies:  It was a premade group of 4 friends on voice comms and at least one of them was Twitch streaming.  Dead by Daylight does not have in game voice communication.  This was on purpose.  So, using 3rd party comms will give you an advantage over the killer.  This may work for facing higher level Killers.  But when facing someone on their first Killer match, this isn’t in the same zip code as fair.  Which wouldn’t be so soul crushing if they didn’t put it on Twitch and Youtube mocking, laughing at, and in general ridiculing a new player to the delight of a room full of viewers cheering on this bullying.  This community greets new players not with hospitality and acceptance, but with distain and indignation. This is evident in the wait times for matches.  You’ll wait between 5 and 10 minutes to find a match as a survivor.  But the Killer queue is ~1 minute.  So, the game needs new Killers, but the survivors are intent on scaring them all off.  \nI don’t know, or care about, the NFTs.  If the publishers did something shady, it doesn’t change how fun the game is to play.  But the endless DLC needs to be noted:  $20 USD for the base game, $30 per “expansion pack” with nameless characters, and $5 or more per named characters (EG Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Ash Williams, etc.).  The base game only includes ~8 survivors and ~5 killers.   You’ll have to spend $250 for the entire game play experience.  This isn’t a deal breaker, but is a serious mark against.  \nThe biggest surprise was when a few friends invited me to play Killer against them in a private game.  These 4 have been playing since the game released.  I fully expected to get stomped out.  So imagine my surprise when the games were the most fun I’ve had since installing the game.  I could hear their communications about my whereabouts, but I could also hear their screams of terror when I dropped someone.  Teabags were replaced with helpful tips on chasing down a survivor.  Missed attacks were now followed with friendly banter and encouraging comments.  When I had a question about how someone did something, these four were there explaining the perks they use. When I had a question on one of the MANY poorly explained symbols in the game, they were there to address my query. And when I snuck up on my friend of 15 years, yelled into the mic “Oh it’s me, Charles!” and downed him for his final hook, my ears were awash with laughter and (most importantly) a voice saying “Great job man, I did not see that coming.”  Just typing this story out has made me smile. This shows that the game IS fun; the game IS good.  THIS is how the game is meant to be played.  If you have 4 or more friends that want this game, buy it; I cannot recommend this game enough for the private matches.  But that is the only scenario where I can endorse purchasing this game.  I plan to keep the game installed.  But until something is done to address the absolutely malignant community, I will be playing exclusively with friends.","timestamp_created":1636574592,"timestamp_updated":1638158873,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552794992923736572","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102554465","author":{"steamid":"76561199088070942","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":98,"playtime_at_review":10171,"last_played":1660079095},"language":"english","review":"stinky","timestamp_created":1636574512,"timestamp_updated":1636574512,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102554431","author":{"steamid":"76561198081600966","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2157,"last_played":1653541499},"language":"spanish","review":"genial
