It all started when I queued into a game of Dead By Daylight. I brought a toolbox with a grip wrench. I loaded into the game and immediately started working on a generator. I heard the killers heart beat so I started running. Eventually the killer known as \"The Spirit\" caught up to me and I could see her. Immediately my penis rose higher than the empire state building and I jumped up from the erection shock. I couldn't handle myself. I immediately took off my spiderman pajamas and started touching myself furiously and passionately. Overall this game is a 9/10 because it would be better if sex was added as an intended feature.","timestamp_created":1643425921,"timestamp_updated":1643425921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108990367","author":{"steamid":"76561198210002743","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4389,"last_played":1654912894},"language":"english","review":"This shit fire no cap","timestamp_created":1643425522,"timestamp_updated":1643425522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108990103","author":{"steamid":"76561199196859893","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":105,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1660517817},"language":"english","review":"Very Fune","timestamp_created":1643425178,"timestamp_updated":1643425178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108989841","author":{"steamid":"76561198419698535","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":52789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1116,"playtime_at_review":24534,"last_played":1660534015},"language":"english","review":"If you haven't started playing DBD, do not start now.

Now, well...\n\nI've got more to say, but let me describe a couple of things that I've witnessed.\n\n- When I was still relatively new, I was playing a game as The Nurse. For the uninitiated, The Nurse is one of those killers where if you know what you're doing, you're absolutely terrifying, and if you don't, good luck even hitting someone. Furthermore, the almighty algorithm decided to pit me against 4 MAX RANK survivors, who seemed to be in one big group. During the game I got increasingly frustrated as they would continually heal each other and block my access to hooks (the goal for the killer is to hang survivors on hooks), and generally didn't even go for their objectives. But afterwards all I got from them were compliments. They told me how they respected my trying to get better at the hardest killer in the game, and even congratulated me for getting better as the match went on. I didn't realise they were giving me an opportunity to practice my Nurse gameplay, and the very next match I was doing significantly better as her. These moments have been few and far between, but let me say that the community isn't 100% toxic - the vast majority of matches I've played on either side people barely even communicate, or just give a gg.\n\n- Just 15 minutes ago I got out of a match, where once again the algorithm pitted someone who was clearly newer to the game against myself and 4 other high level survivors. And the killer won. What followed was the killer giving a 'gg' and then a couple of my teammates verbally abusing him for the next few minutes. They accused him of camping, despite the fact that he clearly left hooked survivors to chase down other people, and said he was tunnelling us (focusing on one survivor), despite them clearly unhooking each other when he was still nearby (a bad strategy). In other words, they were mad at a new player for making completely strategic, rational decisions - they blamed him for their own bad decisions.\n\nThe thing is, DBD feels like it's partially designed in a way that inadvertently promotes toxicity. The degree of whether or not you'll do well is often in proportion to how much of a nob you want to be. As a killer, there's nothing more infuriating than survivors breaking hooks or body blocking, and there are several perks that promote and reward survivors doing this. Some killers, particularly the 3rd party ones, have mechanics which feel completely broken. And since there's no way to play casual matches(outside private games) people are more likely to take the game way too seriously, especially if they're almost at the highest rank.\n\nBut that's why I also consistently try to be respectful to other players. As a killer I often drop the last survivor off by the exit if I wipe everyone quickly. As a survivor I try to look after my teammates, and unless it's completely hopeless I do everything I can to get them out of a bad situation. I know I'm not the only person in the community to think this way. What the game really needs in the community are more players willing to put fun & encouragement over rank. \n\nIf you do think you might like DBD, I recommend waiting for a sale or free weekend to try. The base game is pretty anaemic when it comes to content, so waiting for a sale means if you want new characters it's significantly cheaper Also, for the love of god, don't start playing on the 13th of a month; that's when rankings reset and it's way more likely you'll get matched with folks who take things way too seriously.\n\nBut if you take the 3 week correspondence course that is reading the Wiki, take some time to familiarise yourself with the game's idiosyncrasies, and just focus on having a good time regardless, there's a lot to love in this game. \n\n\nAlthough the devs did support NFTs, so personally I wouldn't have bought Pinhead if I'd known beforehand :/","timestamp_created":1643421241,"timestamp_updated":1643421241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108987049","author":{"steamid":"76561198805480823","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":598,"playtime_at_review":4289,"last_played":1660278775},"language":"english","review":"Good Survivors, Bad Killers","timestamp_created":1643421040,"timestamp_updated":1643421040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108986898","author":{"steamid":"76561198067242640","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":15417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11259,"last_played":1655692624},"language":"english","review":"I think this game is really fun to play!

Not all that grand, and way more entertaining when you have someone to shoot the shit with, joke about, or actually strategize with. Or bitch with when you get one of Those opponents. If you're less likely to play with people you know, the fun wears extremely fast. It's silent, awkward and grating. Spinning at people's fun though.\n\nMechanically it's an interesting concept, but there's a lot keeping it down. The fact that there have been certain metas to winning as killer that make the game exceedingly unfun for the rest of the game and minimal ways to counter it is a strong issue that's been in play longer than I've even known of the game. It's discouraging, and while I wouldn't call fixing the lack of communication the key to fixing it, but it's certainly an unexplored (or ignored) avenue. Asymmetric gameplay's hard to really make even kind of \"balanced\" and I get that, but if it isn't fun it isn't fun.\n\nDBD's a fun un-fun game, although half of the good comes from playing with friends.","timestamp_created":1643393537,"timestamp_updated":1643393805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108962019","author":{"steamid":"76561197963701612","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5585,"last_played":1656078405},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun harika özellikle kadın olarak oynayan oyuncuları doğramak büyük bir zevk bu zevkten kendimi alıkoyamıyorum sadistliğim çok fena tutuyor yeni katiller ve özellikle KADIN kurbanlar bekliyorum 😀","timestamp_created":1643393065,"timestamp_updated":1643393065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520725429058074951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108961887","author":{"steamid":"76561198865153943","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":12612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":11727,"last_played":1659728353},"language":"english","review":"shit game","timestamp_created":1643392936,"timestamp_updated":1643392936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108961767","author":{"steamid":"76561199230010205","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":885,"last_played":1659031560},"language":"english","review":"fav game","timestamp_created":1643392830,"timestamp_updated":1643392830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo5H20P4Cd/7TnwM="}
