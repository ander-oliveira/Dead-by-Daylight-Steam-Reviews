you asked me about this game a few months back I would of praised this game above and beyond. The community wasn't great but it was toned down a bit. Here in my opinion is why this game got worse, take it with a grain of salt:\n\n- The Emblem System:\nIt's great for killers, horrible for survivors. I mainly play survivor so I got the short end of the stick but from time to time I do mess around as the killer. Killer became way more fun than survivor, and it's sad cause it was the other way around. Also it's difficult to pip as the survivor but not difficult at all as killer. Maybe they should of pushed this system after it's been nicely polished and balanced instead of shoving it down our throats.\n\n- Community:\nIt became super toxic to players fucking with each other or fucking with the killer. I honestly do hate survivors who toy with the killer and t-bag them. Survivors barely work together and even with the emblem trying to force them to work together, it's a big NOPE. (Im guilty of this from time to time)\n\n- Bugs:\nTONS of bugs. Some were fixed but it's still not great having to play the game and notice a bug from 6 months ago.\n\n- No Dedicated Servers:\nI GET IT GAME DEVS, YOU WANNA SAVE MONEY. But please invest in a dedicated server for games because I can't stand killers with horrible pings (which is a good 85% of them) and able to take advantage of the fact by either forcing themselves to lag. It ruins the game experience. \n\nI have 240 hours into this game and I used to enjoy and love playing it but now it's just killing me inside. If you feel you can put all these things aside then by all means please buy it, but at the current state it's in I'd rather wait for things to change up or buy another.","timestamp_created":1526871438,"timestamp_updated":1526871438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544879913330078125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42152636","author":{"steamid":"76561198440215258","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":106769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2076,"playtime_at_review":79022,"last_played":1660579964},"language":"english","review":"Drunk by Daylight.

While in the first week or two when it was the 3 killers and 4 survivors to choose from, I played this game for hours upon hours, now I can't play it for more than a single match or two. In its current form, it's grown far too much for its own good and this is a classic case of \"Less is more.\" \n\nWith each new killer/character they release, comes new perks that can be learned through the Bloodweb, which sounds great in theory being that new content is usually a welcome thing in the gaming universe. In my personal opinion, all this does is break the balance that game was capable of in the early stages, add convoluted new systems and even more potential for perk abuse. Which leads to my next point.\n\nThe community of this game is the most toxic community I've ever seen, next to League of Legends. It's a constant \"Us vs Them\" mentality between Killer mains and Survivor mains where both sides do nothing but cry and complain about broken perks, abuse of abilities and how easy the other side has it. \n\nAs someone who has played both killer and survivor, my personal opinion is thus. With respawning hooks to negate sabotage, more hooks on the map, ability to kick generators being added, killers have such a distinct advantage that it's actually boring to play as killer because winning every game only stays fun for so long... and as survivor, unless you're playing against a killer who has literally never played before, it's going to be fairly uncommon to actually win in the conventional way.\n\nTLDR: Unbalanced gameplay, toxic community, too much content to allow for balance, and a fanbase too divided to ever allow a happy medium.

И в итоге понял что надо брать. Эта игра не имела и до сих пор не имеет аналогов в своем жанре. 4 выживших и один маньяк который хочет всех покрошить, а выжившие хотят убежать. Смотря, а потом уже играя в нее ты испытываешь большой приток адреналина и желания выжить, играя за выжившего. Но если ты играешь за маньяка тобой движет желание крови, желание поймать всех и в зависимости от подношений убить самым что не на есть изощренным способом. Рассказывать про механику нет смысла тут приходит понимание во время игры, но командное взаимодействие порой творит чудеса, если ты играешь за выжившего. У маньяка все просто. Поймать,повесить,убить и покрамсать. Я в игре можно сказать с момента ее выхода и ни разу не пожалел о ее покупке.Да конечно менялись какие-то механики, исправлялись баги, но эта игра не стала от этого хуже.

With the hours that i have played every match is diffrent with each playstyle of each individual player. I can recomend this game weather you have friends to play it with or if you are going to play it solo as there is always something to do wheather you trying to get a killer  or a suvivor to max rank or just wanting to bet that infamous rank 1 killer there is always fun times to be had.\n\nWith all the good like anything i have come across a few bad parts but that wouldnt make me stop playing the game at all. Most of the issues that i have come across is people whom use cheats or hacks just so that they can get an easy win. That being said they are few and far between but needs to be said so people whom may be looking into buying this know what could happen. This may not be an issue but as a side note that may turn somepeople is there is a diffrent skill level for this game but nothing you cant adjust to if you have played anyother multiplayer game.\n\nAll that being said this game is one of the funnest games i have played regardless if i endup dieing early or something like that. If you looking for a game where you can play out killing 4 survivors or running for you life trying to get the killer this is deffintly the only game that fits that list ( yes i just decribed the game XD ) Honestly though if you looking for a fun game when you can just jump in and have some fun right off the bat DEAD BY DAYLIGHT will provide that.","timestamp_created":1526778337,"timestamp_updated":1542859325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42129314","author":{"steamid":"76561198828720917","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":67329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47376,"last_played":1533505337},"language":"russian","review":"Игра Tоп4ик)))))))))))))))))))","timestamp_created":1526769479,"timestamp_updated":1530481624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48308950662612915","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42129093","author":{"steamid":"76561198417862018","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10055,"last_played":1643316226},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏的可玩性很高，多样性的玩法，丰富了游戏的乐趣！","timestamp_created":1526768525,"timestamp_updated":1526768525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508928596973419189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42129063","author":{"steamid":"76561197984026663","num_games_owned":456,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":114872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":85,"playtime_at_review":30114,"last_played":1659589473},"language":"english","review":"EDIT 10/23: Holy shit.

Good with friends, random with... randomers. Overall the game runs okay, but can be a bit flakey and certain parts still need addressing.\n\nNow, for the juicy somewhat detailed version. \n\nDead By Daylight generally is a decent game, that can be fun for friends to play (as survivors), though you will need an external voice chat IF you wish to talk. (I'll say now the game wasn't designed to be played originally with friends, but feel this is a feature they added and makes somewhat sense) The in-game options are to point away or to come here. If you plan to play solo, you're more better off as a killer than a survivor but you can still do that, but the quality of your game is very dependent on who you get with you. Most of the players are pretty sweet, however there are a few salty/toxic players which do ruin the game for everyone.\n\nThe characters do have some interesting perks, which it's quite nice that they become teachable so you can use your perks with other survivors/killers. My only issue is there's not enough perk options. Some are okay when you have nothing else, but as you level up and prestige, you'll generally end up using a variation of about 8 different perks at most and the remainder are pointless, unless you're chasing achievements or want to increase the difficulty for yourself.. I would say possibly killers have a little bit more and better variety in this sense but it's minimal.\n\nThe game runs via peer to peer and really does need some dedicated servers, most games are fine.. but sometimes pings can be horrible, the odd kick out, etc. can leave much to be desired. On top of this, there can be a lot of lobby dodging from Killers, which again can be frustrating when you're having to wait 10 mins or more for a single game. There's also times playing as killer, that i end up changing to survivor simply because no one joins the lobby.\n\nOverall the game is fun and the developers are still giving this some love after almost 2 years, however it does need some more work done to it, but I doubt this will happen with the move to a new game... The point system which recently got revamped is a nice idea but still marginally flawed, the skins are a little lame at times with events very sparingly used and some of the decisions haven't been for the better. But if you don't take the game too seriously and just want some fun, either solo or with friends, then this is a decent game and not the worse by any means.","timestamp_created":1526744890,"timestamp_updated":1526744890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.649839341640472412","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42122538","author":{"steamid":"76561198795753903","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":201637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":58,"playtime_at_review":200151,"last_played":1660522356},"language":"english","review":"This game is one of its kind.
