Does it execute this simply premise? The answer is.... kinda. There's a few reasons i don't recommend the game in it's current release state.\n\nFirst reason is balance, and the severe lack thereof. Survivors are stupidly overpowered once you start giving them perks. 20 second cooldown speed boosts, healing that is capable of recovering your bloodied state quicker than the killer can recover from hitting you, being able to infinitely jump through sets of windows where the killer has zero chance of killing you. Those are just the few things the killer has going against them, the other is the fact that if a survivor doesn't want to lose rank, they pull the plug on their internet to D/C which comes with 0 penalty for the survivor other than you don't get your bloodpoints for that match, but the killer gets nothing which results in them losing rank.\n\nAlso since it isn't including in it's release state even though the devs have said they are going to implement it, is for a game based on 4v1, not having the survive with friends mode available at launch is also bad.\n\nIf you're playing as the survivor, you better pray your killer host has a stable internet connection. This leads to another important issue that was overlooked for launch. In a game where the killer is the host, why don't you have a region option for connections, or a browser for games where you can see the hosts ping. \n\nReleasing a game right at E3, then going to said convention as your game is being blown up by critics for game inbalances, D/C's going unpunished and punishing the killer for them, seems a bit off.\n\nNow i've finished bashing the game, there's a good game underneath the inheirant problems surrounding the game. The fact that they held a beta that lasted all the way until 2 days from game release was another oversight that if it allowed people to progress to test it further might have prevented these issues.","timestamp_created":1466465416,"timestamp_updated":1466465416,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549984991550445557","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23677188","author":{"steamid":"76561198082834326","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":37099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35179,"last_played":1635015385},"language":"russian","review":"Вернули сейвы и бладпоинты,спасибо разрабам за то что отреагировали на проблему)","timestamp_created":1466465187,"timestamp_updated":1513272661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502240121364593506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23677163","author":{"steamid":"76561198022706301","num_games_owned":554,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1470986797},"language":"english","review":"I'll change it to a thumbs up as soon as you can queue with friends.

Con il passare degli anni l'equilibrio del gioco è migliorato, non si muore più (o quasi più) immediatamente e tutti quanti dopo pochi secondi dall'inizio del gioco, il matchmaking finalmente funziona e non si può negare che gli sviluppatori abbiano fatto grandi sforzi per tenere aggiornato e rinnovare il gioco (con una gran quantità di rilasci di addon e con la creazione di uno shop interno che permette personalizzazioni interessanti) e per migliorare l'esperienza dal punto di vista della comunità, inserendo una serie di meccanismi di notifica di comportamenti scorretti, di cui non conosciamo l'effettiva funzionalità, ma che comunque hanno raggiunto l'obiettivo di funzionare come deterrenti.\nIl gioco è divertente, mette alla prova e in maniera alternata concede grandi soddisfazioni e cocenti delusioni.\nDi sicuro è un gioco che necessita di molte ore di esperienza e di cui bisogna conoscere, con il tempo, tutte le sfumature dei vari personaggi.\nFondamentale per migliorare, di tanto, l'esperienza di gioco, è riuscire a trovare persone con cui giocarlo e con cui condividere sia il livello di esperienza che gli obiettivi, altrimenti il rischio di trovarsi in un partita in cui tutti fanno come gli pare, portando inevitabilmente ad una brutta fine, sono altissime.\n\n(OLD)\nComplessivamente valido, bella idea, abbastanza vario ma ha alcuni difetti che rovinano pesantemente il risultato finale. Il primo è il fatto che per riuscire a giocare ci vuole una vita, il secondo è che secondo me è troppo sbilanciato a favore del killer. Riuscire ad uscire in 4 vivi è un'impresa veramente molto ma molto improbabile. In più il sistema di gioco non premia chi riesce a scappare, anche una volta preso, dal killer, perché immediatamente dopo essersi liberati, 99 volte su 100 il killer con estrema facilità vi prenderà di nuovo.\nInsomma andrebbe bilanciato meglio e corretti alcuni bug pesanti.\nFondamentalmente ti trova sempre, a prescindere da quello che fai, l'unico vero modo e stare completamente fermo, non c'è realmente modo di nascondersi, spesso il campo di gioco è estremamente luminoso. Insomma, è diventata veramente quasi impossibile passare indenne anche solo una partita. Credo dovrebbero pensarci sopra, perché alla lunga il rischio che perda completamente di appeal.\nE poi il Matchmaking è da denuncia e, cosa che sembrava impossibile, è molto peggiorato con gli aggiornamenti.

Camping is still a thing but honestly, there are so many perks that counter it now, so its no sweat really. Dedicated servers are coming soon and that is all I am excited for since many hosts have the WORST internet connection and some tend to Lag switch so with dedicated servers on the way many people will finally be denied the ability to use their horrible internet to their advantage. Also with dedicated servers, it will be easier to track and punish people who DC from games that are not going well for them, killers and survivors alike. I actually am for this change since stupid streamers like Angry Pug and some other popular DbD streamers  would DC from games thus making it look like its OK to DC from games that are going poorly... Another thing that is coming that needed to be in the game ages ago is SWF staying in Queue together after a game, but besides that I am really excited for the future of this game since so many quality of life improvements are heading to this game so soon! I have high hopes for this game, and I really really want this game to succeed, so as far as a rating goes, I give this game a 7/10.\n\n\nNew Review!\n\nThey Finally did it, this game is actually playable now! DEAR LORD THANK YOU! Now I can die in peace knowing that you can actually find matches without having to wait 15min, but one thing that hasnt change that still urks me is camping, but you know the old saying, \"just don't get caught then\" ;) Anyways this game is finally worthy of getting a thumbs up from me!\n\n\nOld Review!\n\nUntil this game gives a friend queue system, Ill change my review. I really REALLY like this game, but the fact that it is still missing stuff and is pretty much released, it just confuses me... Why couldn't the DEVs put this game in alpha or anything? Then it would make more sense on why this game is missing so much, and there are people complaining about the graphics quality.... You pay 20$ (without disccounts) to play this game, do you really think that you will get fully imersive graphics like Battlefield or something? The graphics are as good as it gets and it's pretty damn good. Now for the random frame drops, that I can understand being a problem, but hey this fully released game will get a patch that will fix it eventually right? That kinda rustles my Jimmies, because I play LOTS of early access games, and Alphas and all that fun stuff, and they are constantly updating after years and years. These games ARE NOT EVEN DONE, and here's \"Dead by Daylight\" a not even finished game (CLEARLY) that should have gone alpha first. What did the DEVS do with the information from the players in the closed BETA? Nothing really it seems, the only reason this game got so much love is because H2O Delirious, Vannos, Dathi, and other famous youtubers started playing it. to conclude my little rant, I know I didn't put what bugs there are and how the gameplay is or any pros and cons, but those are all over the other peoples reviews so go read those, Im just mainly talking about why this game shouldn't have been released so early... Until this game is [b] truly fully released [/b] (<-----Why do I even have to say that?!?!)  I will keep my review as a Thumbs Down. Sorry BD Inc. I know this game has major potential, but you gotta work fast to keep this game going, with all the exploits and people complaining about this and that, you should probably understand that there is a problem that needs fixing ASAP.","timestamp_created":1466461317,"timestamp_updated":1567439682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487288117408752441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23676353","author":{"steamid":"76561198023959346","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1508609133},"language":"english","review":"If you dont want a game that crashes constantly, then stay away from this one.

There are definitely some bugs that need to be fixed with the game the crashing the mouse disappearing, even the glitches of you being the killer and have someone one hit away from being downed they go over a barricade you hit them and they are still standing up but it was a registered hit. Fixes need to be made or the game will just fall off after a while because of all the problems people are having or how unbalanced the game can be on both sides of the spectrum. Like not being able to control the hillbilly chainsaw sprint, Not enough hiding spaces for the survivor to get away. A majority of the time if you even get spotted your done for. Or another aspect when your the killer there being to many knockover barricades on the map it just becomes an aggravation, nuisanc, and overall makes it less fun and more hard to be the killing role. There a problems all over and thats alternately what happens when you release a game earlier than it should have been. Gaming companies are more for releasing them early then making sure the game is perfect and entertaining and fun for the players. People should NOT release games early.

I have never seen a ranking system so physically cringe worthy that screams \"I want to be different than every other rank system\" as this, this rank system is cancer, its one of those things that dosen't actually affect the game itself too much but just makes you question what the shit they were thinking when they made it.\n\nOne fucking gamemode. I shit you not, this strictly multiplayer game only has one fucking gamemode which, even then, is repetitive as fuck\n\nA shitty random skill tree that gives you randomised perks and items everytime you level up\n\nOfferings are alright\n\nin-game item modifications? meh, no comment\n\nGameplay itself is pretty good, in fact chases can get pretty intense on both ends\n\nand finally... oh... thats it, oh so this is the early access then, I see....\n\nWait, this is the full game. What the fuck. I wasted 15 fucking pounds on this shit? THIS. THIS IS NOT A FULL GAME. THIS IS MORE DESERVING OF EARLY ACCESS, SERIOUSLY WHY ISN'T IT?\n\n\"OH BUT THEY ARE GONNA ADD MORE CONTENT LIKE NEW KILLERS AND MAPS\"\n\nYeah? So? I ain't reviewing the new shit I am talking about the base game as of 22/06/2016\n\nOh did I mention all the bugs? This is a exceedingly buggy game.\n\nProbably some of the biggest downsides are things that you would think the developers would think of since they encourage multiplayer so much (being a strictly multiplayer experience):\n\n- The most appalling matchmaking I have ever come across from a new release, no seriously it takes about 10-20 attempts at searching for a game for me to join anyone, why couldn't the game just constantly search for a game until it finds one for me and auto-joins, why must I click once before the game tells me \"Couldn't find a game to connect to\" and then I have to keep clicking\n\nThat wasn't an exaggeration by the way, it litterally takes me an average of 10-20 attempts before it finds a suitable match for me to join, I counted multiple times.\n\n- Lack of a party system, this game was pushed forward as being a experience in which you can hunt down and kill your friends and yet they fail to add a party system.\n\nNo seriously these things would be common knowledge for a game that is STRICTLY MULTIPLAYER. I want to emphasise that, this game is a strictly multiplayer experience in which you have shit matchmaking and no party system.\n\nAll in all the game is buggy, incomplete and not worth the money unless it is on 50% (minimum) steam sale. The content available dosen't warrant the price and with the lack of an offline gamemode you are forced to spend about 5-10 mins in the game's shitty matchmaking just to find a match in which you will probably just fight a fucking Wraith 10 times in a row.\n\nDead by Daylight gets 3/10 Keemstars from me, the game isn't worth your time or money as of right now, perhaps that will change should the devs listen to critiscism.\n\nAs of right now, Dead by Daylight is absolute garbage.","timestamp_created":1466454282,"timestamp_updated":1466619634,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504774868488311768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23674763","author":{"steamid":"76561198133972483","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1634834330},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever","timestamp_created":1466454190,"timestamp_updated":1466454190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491183876991271973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23674713","author":{"steamid":"76561198073839413","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1604849576},"language":"russian","review":"Дерьмо редкостное, увидел совместное прохождение и думал можно с друзьями повыживать против маньяка, а на самом деле тут совместной игрой и не пахнет!

It's 4 v 1 and there are no bots or singleplayer.  While the game has a few glitches and crashes, it still holds true to what I hoped and envisioned for this game to be.  Please pay no attention to the negative reviews regarding being able to play with friends online.  Those people writing the bad reviews would be the same people writing a bad review if friends were able to join.  Communication with teamates during this game would ruin it.  If you want to play a survivor horror with your friends, go play the million other games out there in which you can.  Dead by Daylight has elements in the game that are meant to make the player extremely anxious, nervous, and panic. My wife, son, daughter, and I all take turns playing this on the big screen as it works well with the steam controller.  We all scream when we're being chased!\n\nAgain, don't listen to the bad reviews about being able to play with friends, or how the killer just camps the hooks.  It's all strategy.  If the killer camps the hooks, it leaves time for the remaining survivors to get some generators.   \n\nThe game is very well balanced and the graphics are great.  I can tell there was alot of work put into this game by Behaviour and this is with no doubt a successfull launch!  \n\n9/10\n\nP.S. Thank you Behaviour and Starbreeze!

Or you can play as one out of three killers that's job is to hunt down the survivors and sacrfice them to some dark god by knocking down the survivors and hanging them on meat hooks. \n\nOutside of gameplay, you can customize your loadout with various items, perks, add-ons for your items and offerings that can be used to add elements to the upcoming match, and some cosmetic options (which at the time of this review is very limited, but I am sure they will add more later.) You can gain items for your loadout via the progression tree with the most metal name ever: The Blood Web. Here you can spend blood points that you earn at the end of every round. Everything that can be added to your loadout can be found in the Blood Web.\n\nPlaying as the killer is fun. It makes you feel powerful and I personally got a kick out of just messing with survivors and watch them run in fear. However playing as the killer is a little cluncky but that is mainly for balancing purposes. Examples are, when you take a swing there is a slow recovery animation and when you actually hit someone there is an even slower  animation as the killer feels the need to wipe the blood off his weapon everytime he hits someone. When you carry survivors they can sometimes struggle and mess with your movement as you try to carry them to the meathooks. The killer is also slow to climb over low walls and debris that the survivors can pull down to break your chase. The key to playing the Killer is to outsmart your prey. Instead of just blindly chasing them, you have to predict their movements and then nab them. At the time of this review, there are three killers available: The Trapper that can set bear traps that are scattered around the level, the Wraith that has a special bell that he must ring in order to go invisible, and finally the Hillbilly, that has a chainsaw that when reved up he will take off in a sprint forward and instantly down any survivor he hits.\n\nPlaying as the survivors seems impossible compared to a very powerful killer, but it really isn't. Survivors are given advance warning that the killer is nearby by the sound of heartbeats. The louder and faster they get, the closer they are. It is at this point that you either hide or run away. As you are being chased you can jump over low walls or pull down debris to put some distance between you two. The controls of the survivors are much more tighter and more responsive to the point where charging the killer and slipper by them is possible (though not advised.) If you choose to hide, you can duck into some closets that are scattered throughout the level, or you can stick to the long grass in hopes that you can slip by the killer. The game's tutorial even says that if you don't panic and play it smart, survival is possible. That is what the core game is all about: a big mind game. If by chance you do get downed and captured by the killer you still have a chance. You can wiggle out of their grasp and run away. If this doesn't work out, you will be hung on meat hooks to be sacrificed. It is possible to break out of the hook but, I haven't personally been able to. If you struggle and don't break free then the entity spawns on the hook faster. Once it has fully spawned you have one last hope: struggle long enough and hope your teammates are able to help you. A teammate can pull you out of the hook set you free. It is possible, but most times, the killer likes to camp out next to a hooked person. It is at this point that the rest of the team has to coordinate a rescue or to let you buy enough time so they could escape. It is at this point that some of the issues of the game begin to arise, but more on that later. Once you have activated the five generators you need, the exit doors are powered and you can open them, be warned that they will not open immedietly and there will still be some time for the killer to get you. Alternatively, if you happen to be the last survivor alive, you can find an escape hatch that works just like an exit. \n\nAs the survivors you can find various items such as the med-kit, or a tool box. These these items can be recieved from the blood web or inside boxes in the level. If you choose not to use the items you find in the game, you can add them to your inventory for later use in other games (or so I was told by the online manual). They make the game much easier, for example the med-kit allows you to heal faster, the tool box allows you to repair generators and sabatoge traps faster and the flashlight allows you to stun the killer if you shine it in their face. Be warned though, that if you equip an item to your loadout and don't use it throughout the round, it will still be consumed (or at least it did for me).\n\nNow for the issues of the game. Though the core gameplay is rock solid, the other aspects of it are not. Most notibly the matchmaking. To create a lobby you have to play as the killer as it seems only the killer can create the lobby. This would ensure that there will always be a killer in the game but if you are like me, you don't want to kill your friends and instead want to survive with them. The game does not give you the option to invite friends to your current online game unless you are playing a private game, which disables progression. Hopefully the add a way to play a game with your friends with people online. Gameplaywise, the only complaint I have is campers. Weather it be the killer who just stands there as you or your teammated get sacrificed, not allowing a rescue or other teammates who find hatches camp in a locker and wait for the rest of the team to die off so they get an easy escape. The game could spawn hatches out in the open away from lockers to prevent surivor campers and the killer campers can be easily overcome with a coordinated rescue, and here it reveals another problem: lack of communication. There is no chat nor voice chat in game for the surivors which make it really hard to cooperate. Hopefully allow some sort of communication in game later down the line.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Absolutely. This game is loads of fun, even with all of it's issues. Even playing with randos is fun. Though if those issues are addressed then this game would be loads better.\n\nFinal rating: 7 Burnt Offerings/ 10\n\nEdit: I made a mistake and said that your item gets consumed even when you don't use it. In reality, it doesn't get consumed and instead the add-on you put on it get consumed.","timestamp_created":1466451362,"timestamp_updated":1466455843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23674013","author":{"steamid":"76561198030312178","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2997,"last_played":1545434602},"language":"german","review":"Now a good game","timestamp_created":1466451180,"timestamp_updated":1612968829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23674001","author":{"steamid":"76561198034693041","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1536278004},"language":"turkish","review":"Game is good , idea is good but there is some problem about playing with friends... why i cant play with my friend/friends ?

[b]Перки[/b] понятно скиллы для персонажа они постоянны. [b]Аддоны[/b] и [b]подношения[/b] их можно использовать только на 1 бой. Что они дают. [b]Аддоны[/b] это небольшие модификации. Например, для Tool Box можно поставить 2 аддона – увеличивает прочность, количество. Для Фонаря большая батарея, Карту больше можно использовать и т.д.\n[b]Подношения[/b] Это например: Сильно сгущает темный туман на карте, Дает на 25% больше Bloodpoints в категории брутальности, Создает на карте один дополнительный сундук и т.д.\nВ игре 3 карты каждая из которых случайным образом выпадает. На карте все дома, постройки, генераторы остаются всегда на месте, тока люк рандомно генерируется.\nНи каких ограничений по времени нету, можно хоть час чинить генераторы.\nВ игре нет такой функции как играть с друзьями в 4 против маньяка, нет голосовой связи, чат есть только в лобби, когда уже начали играть его нету. С рандомами играть тяжеловато есть нормальные которые спокойно чинят генераторы, и передвигаются по карте никого не блокируя.  Ну и наоборот чинишь спокойно генераторы и тебе прибегает чувак вместе с маньяком и начинается веселуха, либо починил %80 уже генератор, приходит помощник и начинается дискотека бух-бах. Бежишь раненый рядом с игроком, в надежде что он тебя похилит но ему все равно ему надо генераторы чинить или заняться чем-то другим.\nМаньяк бегает быстрее, но уступает, когда перелазит через окно, ограждения.\nНа каждый из 3 карт есть такие места где тебя Маньяк не догонит, ты просто можешь спокойно туда-сюда прыгать из 1 окна в другое, или просто перепрыгивая ограждения. \nВсего надо починить 5 генераторов. Когда начинаешь чинить генераторы появляется мини-игра когда нужно успеть попасть в область, промазал бахает.\nЕсли осталось 3 генератора и остался 1 выживший, то он может сбежать через люк.\nЕсть читеры, но такого серьезного ничего не видел (типо бесмертия, летает по карте и т.д.) просто апнут 1 RANK или 3 INFAMY. (Просто кто-то скинул сохранение с всеми топовыми скиллами и много bloodpoint’s)\nINFAMY дает окровавленные шмотки типо куртки, штанов.  И самое главное нет функции кикнуть игрока! (хост маньяк)\nВ игре есть как прокачка левела, так и и прокачка ранга. Если апнул 25 левел то можно использовать 4 перка сразу (в игре их полно), левел никогда не падает.\nРанг зависит от того как ты сыграл, по умолчанию он у всех 20. Если набрал больше 10к опыта, то тебе дают ромбик, получишь еще 2 будет 19 и т.д. Если набрал меньше, то его забирают ну и ранг понизиться.\nПо мне самый сильный их маньяков это наверно Trapper -> Wraith ->  HillBilly. На капканы постоянно многие попадают, призрака тоже многие бояться. HillBilly тяжело его контролировать, это бензопила не управляема практически, да и + шумит на всю карту.\nИз выживших тоже надо подумать за кого лучше играть.  CLAUDETTE MORRELL у нее если прокачать скилл, то может лечить раны самостоятельно без использование аптек. JAKE PARK – может ломать крюки если есть скилл Saboteur. DWIGHT FAIRFIELD – командный перс (бонус к скорости ремонта, лечащим. Когда как другие игроки находятся рядом), MEG THOMAS – тихий бег, спринт.\nЕсли заходишь за выжившего, то все быстро происходит игра запускается моментально. Если хочешь за маньяка то надо ждать 5 минут (у меня так). Некоторые рекомендуют поменять регион загрузки.\nНасчет багов у меня ничего не было, да было пару раз, когда не мог играть, но это проблемы были у Хоста (меня выкинуло). FPS в игре не прыгает, все плавно идет.\nХочу, чтобы проект дальше развивался. Выходили новые карты, маньяки, доработали античит.\nИгрой доволен!
