Was sich erstmal eigentlich ganz gut anh√∂rt, wenn es denn gut funktionieren w√ºrde. Das Spiel will n√§mlich daf√ºr sorgen das nat√ºrlich alle Spa√ü haben auch der Killer also bring es meistens 2 gute und 2 schlechtere Spieler zusammen um denn Killer nicht gegen 4 Starke Spieler spielen zu lassen. Das Problem dabei, die meisten guten Spieler lassen sich von dem Killer Jagen, W√§hrend die anderen Generatoren reparieren. Das f√ºhrt dazu das in manchen f√§llen die 2 schlechteren Lebend entkommen, w√§hrend die 2 guten Sterben. Die 2 guten Spieler werden damit bestraft daf√ºr das sie denn Killer abgelenkt haben und die 2 schlechteren Spieler werden belohnt daf√ºr das sie die meiste zeit mit verstecken verbringen. Aber wie sieht das aus Killer Sicht aus ? \num es schnell zu sagen, der Killer muss jede Runde alles geben, was daf√ºr sorgt das man keine entspante Runde Spielen kann.\nWas ich ebenfalls nicht mag, ist das manche Bugs leider zu lange im Game bleiben und die Entwickler sich zu oft um neue Killer und √úberlebende k√ºmmern, das hat sich aber zum Gl√ºck in denn letzten 2 Jahren verbessert.\nLeider leidet das Spiel unter einem gewissen Balance Problem in meinen Augen zum Bespiel:\nManche Perks sind einfach zu Stark und werden in Jeder Runde benutzt, auf der Seite der √úberlebenden w√§ren das: Dead Hard, Borrowed time, Decisive Strike, und Boon circle of healing.\nAuf Killer Seite: Hex Ruin, Hex No one escapes death und Pop goes the weasel.\nEiner dieser Perks werden zu 90% von einem Spieler in der Runde benutzt und das nimmt meiner Meinung nach etwas die Variation raus.\nWas manchen gefallen tut, ich aber etwas nervig finde ist das man nach sogar 800 Stunden immer noch nicht im Ansatz alle seine Charaktere aufs Maximale Level bringen kann (Aller auf Prestige Stufe 3).\n\nZu denn guten Dingen\nIch finde es sehr gut das dass Spiel nach fast 6 Jahren Supported wird und mit neuen Inhalten versorgt wird, k√∂nnte sogar etwas weniger sein wenn dadurch mehr am Balancing und an Bugs gearbeitet wird. \nBesonders gut gef√§llt mir als Horror Fan, das Killer und √úberlebende aus Filmen, Serien und Spielen ebenfalls Spielbar sind.\nDurch diese anzahl an verschiedenen Killern und √úberlebende wird das Game nicht langweilig f√ºr die meisten, auch nicht nach 800 Stunden habe ich das Gef√ºhl das mir das Spiel keinen Spa√ü mehr macht.\nJede Runde die ich Spiele f√ºhlt sich anders an, da jeder einen Anderen Spiel Stiel hat.\nAu√üerdem macht es Spa√ü mit oder gegen Freunde zu Spielen und dem entsprechend seine Strategie an zu passen.\nWas sich im ersten Moment etwas komisch anh√∂rt, ist das es sogar Spa√ü macht sich aufzuregen, wenn ein Killer sich zum Beispiel dazu entschieden hat, nur dich alleine zu verfolgen und die anderen in ruhe l√§sst.\n\nMeine W√ºnsche f√ºr die Zukunft\nIch hoffe das sie weiterhin an dem Spiel arbeiten werden und nat√ºrlich weitere Coole Charaktere in das Spiel rein bringen.\nDas Spiel k√∂nnte ebenfalls mal eine Art neuen Modus gebrauchen oder ein neues Ziel auf das man hinarbeiten kann.\nEs w√ºrde mich ebenfalls freuen wenn sie einsehen das SBMM ein gro√üer Fehler war und es aus dem Spiel nehmen.\n\n\nMein Fazit\nDas Spiel kann einen viel Spa√ü machen, besonders mit Freunden, aber es kann auch genau so frustrierend sein, besonders wenn SBMM sich daf√ºr entschieden hat dich in ein Offenes Messer rennen zu lassen.\nEgal auf welcher Seite ich Spiele ich habe nach 800 Stunden Spielzeit immer noch Spa√ü und hoffe das dies auch in Zukunft so bleibt.\n\n","timestamp_created":1643488718,"timestamp_updated":1643488718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109050479","author":{"steamid":"76561199021213076","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":8188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":45,"playtime_at_review":4470,"last_played":1660249452},"language":"russian","review":"–±—É–±–∞ —Ç–æ–ø —Ç—è–Ω","timestamp_created":1643488619,"timestamp_updated":1643488619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109050329","author":{"steamid":"76561197991965903","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":173301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1520,"playtime_at_review":153165,"last_played":1660601833},"language":"english","review":"It was a difficult decision choosing not to recommend the game overall.

by Daylight is 4 vs 1 horror game, where survivors try to get five (5) generators activated, while hunter tries to hit survivors and incapacitate them so that they can be hanged for execution.\n\nGameplay is solid and vast cast of survivors and hunters grant game lot of smaller variation between matches (all be it noted that vast majority of them are locked behind DLC purchase, thus it's best to pick this game & it's DLC's on sales).\n\nThe survivor experience is definitely best with three (3) friends in voip and thinking each match as a horror movie, where one (1) of survivors will not make it to the home, or one barely makes it out alive.

I played against pinhead a couple days ago and it surprised me when he suddenly said \"DON'T DO THAT\" in a really loud deep voice after he attacked me XD Lmao. 1000/10 would recommend this game :)","timestamp_created":1643473088,"timestamp_updated":1643473088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109032593","author":{"steamid":"76561198208186672","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":51562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44176,"last_played":1649572416},"language":"japanese","review":"„Éê„Ç∞„ÅåÂ§ö„Åô„Åé„Çã‰∏ä„Å´„ÉÅ„Éº„Çø„Éº„ÇÇÂ§ö„ÅÑ„ÄÇ„Éû„Éä„Éº„ÅÆÊÇ™„ÅÑ„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„ÇÇÂ§ö„ÅÑ„ÄÇ","timestamp_created":1643473077,"timestamp_updated":1643473077,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508485496044158936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109032399","author":{"steamid":"76561198986288610","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1656446500},"language":"russian","review":"–∫—Ä—É—Ç–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞","timestamp_created":1643472912,"timestamp_updated":1643472912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109032381","author":{"steamid":"76561199239044191","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1658339446},"language":"schinese","review":"1","timestamp_created":1643472898,"timestamp_updated":1643472898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109032199","author":{"steamid":"76561198033198837","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8187,"last_played":1657804068},"language":"english","review":"Nice re2 map, idiots","timestamp_created":1643472733,"timestamp_updated":1643472733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109031940","author":{"steamid":"76561198121146933","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":49359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48670,"last_played":1658227477},"language":"english","review":"A very fun game to play with friends.

Ich habe etwa 180 Stunden, also etwas mehr als eine Woche Lebenszeit, an dieses Spiel verschwendet. In einer Woche kann man viel schaffen. Man kann seine Wohnung streichen, man kann in den Urlaub fahren oder man kann besoffen am Kiosk an der Ecke stehen und sich in feinstem Arbeitslosengeld-II-Deutsch √ºber die steigenden Zigarettenpreise beschweren. Diese 180 Stunden habe ich mir auf meinem Zettel \"Beklagenswerte Zeitverluste\" notiert. Wenn es dann soweit ist und mir nur wenig Zeit bleibt, um meinem Sch√∂pfer entgegenzutreten, nehme ich mir die Zeit, jede dieser Zeitverschwendungen zu beweinen, kurz bevor ich komisch huste und im Beisein meiner Familie ein qualvolles Ableben vollziehe. Und so schlie√üt sich der Kreis, denn in Dead by Daylight geht es ja im Allgemeinen um qualvolles Ableben. F√ºr Berufsgruppen wie Erzieher, Lehrer, medizinische Fachangestellte und Altenpfleger ist dieses Spiel eine willkommene M√∂glichkeit, seinen Frust und Menschenhass zu kanalisieren und einen - zumindest bis zur n√§chsten Gehaltserh√∂hung - dazu zu motivieren, nicht mit der alten Kriegspistole des Gro√üvaters Amok laufen zu gehen. Und weil Hass gut f√ºr den Kreislauf ist, spart man sich bei diesem Spiel das l√§stige Kardio-Training im Fitnesscenter, was man sowieso nur macht, damit der schei√ü Arzt endlich die Fresse h√§lt. Wenn ihr euch allerdings in l√§ngst veralteten Prinzipien wie \"Hilfsbereitschaft\" oder \"N√§chstenliebe\" √ºben wollt, so solltet ihr als √úberlebender spielen. Doof ist dabei aber, dass 95% der √úberlebenden diese Rolle nur spielen, weil sie vor f√ºnf Erdzeitaltern einmal Killer gespielt haben, nichts gebacken bekommen haben und mit der darauffolgenden Farce an H√§nseleien, Europaletten im Gesicht und 60.000-Watt-Taschenlampen, die einem Rusflocken in die sadistischen Sehnerven brennen, nicht abschlie√üen konnten. Ihren Menschenhass lassen diese ausgewachsenen Embryos lieber an ihren Mitspielern aus. So ist es gel√§ufig, sich zu einem anderen √úberlebenden zu gesellen, der seinen Generator zu 95% fertig hat, und dreimal hintereinander die Skillchecks so blindw√ºtig zu verk*cken, dass der Killer sofort hinter einem steht. Und dreimal d√ºrft ihr raten, wen er dann jagt. Das schlimmste, was einem passieren kann ist jedoch, wenn alles zusammenkommt, was man an diesem Spiel hasst; und das ist leider nicht die Seltenheit. Man stelle sich vor, kurz bevor die Ausg√§nge ge√∂ffnet werden, kommt dieser inzestu√∂se Eimerkopf mit seiner Kettens√§ge angerauscht und massiert dir den R√ºcken so krass, dass du ihn nicht mehr sp√ºrst. Er nimmt dich auf seine schwitzige und etwas nach rohem Pangasius riechende Schulter w√§hrend du dich in Schmerz und Fluchtbem√ºhungen windest, wie ein Silberfisch, der in eine Steckdose gekrabbelt ist. Kurz bevor du die Freiheit riechen kannst, taucht irgendwann aus dem Nichts so ein besch*ssener Haken auf, den er sogleich nutzt, um deine unterern√§hrte H√ºlle deiner Selbst auf besagten Hinh√§ngeapparat zu spie√üen. Jetzt denkt man sich zun√§chst \"och naja, da sind ja noch andere, die holen mich bestimmt\", doch in diesem Augenblick merkst du, dass sich dieser Kettens√§genfetischist nicht auch nur einen Mikrometer von der Stelle bewegt, um den √úberlebenden, der 20 Meter weiter den Ausgang √∂ffnet, abzuschlachten. Stattdessen steht er einfach nur da und guckt dich an mit seinen halbkaputten Augen, die an Rosinen mit integrierter LED-Beleuchtung erinnern. Der Rest kommt lebend raus, aber ausgerechnet du, der du gef√ºhlt alle Generatoren im Alleingang fertig gemacht hast, muss in die ewigen Jagdgr√ºnde eingehen, w√§hrend dieses egozentrische Pack an restlichen √úberlebenden sich alle vier Sekunden im Schrank versteckt hat, weil sie ihren Mittagsteller nicht leer gemacht haben und daf√ºr die Strafe Gottes f√ºrchten.\n\nDas ist Spiel also ganz ok. Spielt es mit Freunden, dann werdet ihr schnell kreativ, was neue Beleidigungen angeht.\n\nIch bin raus,\nOnkel

But I would say in general this game is not worth your time and money. I‚Äôll try to be unbiased while explaining why by starting with some positive things.\n\nGraphics. Pretty good. It‚Äôs a little behind the times I‚Äôd say, but it‚Äôs good. 7/10\n\nThe Lore. The lore is good. Not incredible but good. It has some interesting elements and a unique flair that sets it apart from other games. It explores some dark and mystical themes with concepts such as The Entity who appears to be a malignant godlike force. There is a wide range of characters who have a backstory that explains how they were before the events of the game.There also is sometimes animations showing some of these events. Overall a 7/10\n\nCharacter Design. For the Survivors (despite most being locked), there is a wide range of characters who all have different backstories and personalities. They do a good job at showing who the character is just by looking at them. Each character also comes with 3 unique perks that fit them and affect gameplay. This also applies to the killers. I mean what‚Äôs there not to say? You can become one of your favorite infamous horror icons. And despite some balancing issues, each killer‚Äôs power fits well with the character and further immerses you into the role on top of the fact they also get 3 unique perks.\n\nGameplay. Now despite aesthetics, how does the gameplay fair? In the first few hours it's a mess. But a good one for the most part. Survivors run and hide and try to complete generators to escape the map and killers hunt and stalk survivors to try and sacrifice them on hooks to The Entity. Killers usually stomp at first like most other power roles in asymmetric games but its still somewhat fun to hide with dread and flee and scream in terror when they chase you. But with knowledge comes power and soon the tables are turned rather quickly once you reach a higher level of play. Killer will eventually hit a wall and survivors will laugh at their attempts if they have no idea how to play the game. But even when killers do learn how to play it is still a struggle a lot of the time. And I‚Äôll explain why and how.\n\nBalance. Oh boy. This game upon release was broken. The development team intended for survivors to run and hide except survivors found a strong tactic called looping which clearly wasn‚Äôt intended from the start where a survivor finds an area (preferably with a pallet) and runs around that area before dropping the pallet when the killer is close. Looping became a core part of the game and killers attempted to find ways around it by ‚Äòmindgaming‚Äô and tricking survivors to make a mistake and go the wrong way or through a window granting them a hit or down. But many loops you couldn‚Äôt do this tactic, forcing the killer to run around and waste time before breaking the pallet when dropped. Later the developers finally acknowledged the technique and embraced the mechanic, balancing around it. How is the game now? Still fairly broken. Many killers are still underpowered compared to high level survivors. You‚Äôll only see the same 3 killers at high level and the same 8 perks despite the 150+ in the game. And this game is unbalanced at a fundamental level for the simple reason that 1 second wasted by the killer is 4 seconds gained for the survivors. And time is of the essence at higher level killer games. You will feel constant pressure and stress trying to do your job while survivors ironically are more laid back and calm while holding one button and occasionally clicking space. Survivors no longer feel fear aside from some rare occasions. And the funnest thing about survivor at high level is being chased. But usually this all results in the killer playing in a not so fun way to have a chance because the game‚Äôs poorly balanced and even incentivises this style of play. Yeah you read that correctly. There is an MMR system that gives you a hidden number or elo and this number raises based on whether you sacrifice or escape. Because the developers think this game is competitive ready. All of this culminates into the fact the developers clearly have a bias towards one side and it makes sense considering 4 people's fun over 1. But aside from that they also REFUSE to listen to feedback and even tell people to go play different games. Which obviously results in huge negativity towards them overall. These developers fit into the unholy trinity of bad qualities. Arrogance. Ignorance. And greed. Arrogance in that they believe they know what's best for the players. Ignorance in not understanding their own game or possibly not even playing it. And greed in the fact that to get all the dlc is 250$+ and many cosmetics in the in game store are 20$ despite the game not being free. They also implemented a 100 tier battle pass system called The Rift for some rewards that are free while the majority are locked behind a paywall that isn‚Äôt even worth the money. This isn‚Äôt to say that all the developers there are bad people, I‚Äôm sure some of them are nice. But it can‚Äôt be overlooked on how the product reflects overall. And this isn‚Äôt even mentioning some of the terrible bugs and glitches that take them months to fix, and the terrible grind they‚Äôve still failed to address. Along with the cheater epidemic that continues to plague this game. Also the fact that the community is one of the most toxic one‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen. The amount of mental gymnastics and entitlement (on both sides) is enough to make you wish an extinction level asteroid collided with earth. There are some great content creators however.\n\nConclusion. This game is unfortunately addictive. I‚Äôve spent many hours playing this game having some fun along the way. But my passion for the game is mere embers compared to what it was. I‚Äôve given up on trying to push it in a better direction. And as of now, except for the exceptions mentioned at the start, this game in my opinion is not worth your support, time, and money let alone this essay I typed.","timestamp_created":1643464719,"timestamp_updated":1643464996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109022837","author":{"steamid":"76561198870008332","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":888,"playtime_at_review":675,"last_played":1660572914},"language":"schinese","review":"nbbbbbbbbbbb","timestamp_created":1643464599,"timestamp_updated":1643464599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109022256","author":{"steamid":"76561198795963794","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":39264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":189,"playtime_at_review":28231,"last_played":1660569951},"language":"schinese","review":"Ê∏∏ÊàèÂæàÂ•ΩÔºåÊ≤ªÂ•Ω‰∫ÜÊàëÂ§öÂπ¥ÁöÑ‰ΩéË°ÄÂéã","timestamp_created":1643464091,"timestamp_updated":1643464091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109021903","author":{"steamid":"76561198871373021","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":7706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1658508610},"language":"russian","review":"–Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –≤–æ–ª–æ—Å–∞—Ç—ã–µ –º—É–∂–∏–∫–∏ –æ–±–º–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –º–∞—Å–ª–æ–º.","timestamp_created":1643463768,"timestamp_updated":1643463842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109021793","author":{"steamid":"76561198048221672","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":26150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12445,"last_played":1659273432},"language":"russian","review":"–ì–æ—Ä–∞ —á–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–≤","timestamp_created":1643463662,"timestamp_updated":1644574872,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm6uE0/4CcabxnwM="}
