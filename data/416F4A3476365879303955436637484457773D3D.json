Being a survivor of a horror-movie esq killer instantly captured my attention. Then, I found out you can become the killer himself. You'll get a thrill of the chase as the killer chases you with the classic movie music playing faster and faster as the killer nears. Great little skill-checks during completing objects, and teamwork to survive adds more excitement. Even though I found it easier to throw the other survivors to killer I found it more challenging to help.\n\nI find that it gets rather repeatitive the more you play the game. The maps aren't too different from eachother, and the tasks to escape the killer is the same.

But, there are some things in this game that ruins the fun of the game. My friends and I agree that this game has potential to be an amazing game, and it has an amazing concept, but there are a few things in the game that I feel like every player can agree need to be changed.\n1. There are far to many hooks in the maps. a lot of the time after getting downed or caught by the killer, there most likely is a hook within a few feet of where you died. This makes it far to easy for the killer to win.\n2. Broken game Machanics. Yes, I am aware that the devs are fixing this, but sometimes you could be just about to vault over a wall and you are over it, but the killer still grabs you because your feet werent on the ground. that is a little broken.\n3. The killer is to OP. Like in my last notes, they all point to the killer being too strong. this can be fixed by having less hooks and fixing gamebreaking glitches.\nAll in all, this game has a vast amount of potential to be an amazing game and i understand that it is still brand new, but still, some of the mechanics and updates seem to benefit the hunter, not the survivor.","timestamp_created":1467421839,"timestamp_updated":1467421839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24001802","author":{"steamid":"76561198106802235","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":108650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21647,"last_played":1642160351},"language":"koreana","review":"랭크 매칭 벨런스 못잡는 망겜","timestamp_created":1467421599,"timestamp_updated":1637892852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24001705","author":{"steamid":"76561198032789296","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":76,"playtime_at_review":6642,"last_played":1659680495},"language":"schinese","review":"a fuck shit game,always can't jump the windows,and too many hackers.too many bugs","timestamp_created":1467421224,"timestamp_updated":1467421224,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24001634","author":{"steamid":"76561198156647002","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":996,"last_played":1531746091},"language":"english","review":"Very good job!!","timestamp_created":1467421007,"timestamp_updated":1467421007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24001453","author":{"steamid":"76561198314376962","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":79289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69503,"last_played":1544729862},"language":"english","review":"В общем, поиграл я немного...

Also rare addons and some perks are sometimes so broken that you will just die when you don't know about them (wraith has a bell and is slow - oh with this addon he isn't, huntress needs to hit you twice - oh with this addon she doesn't, zombies are slow - oh with this addon they are fast -.-). Also hook camping and slugging happened the last 5 games I played so I can only recommend how fun it is to play the game as survivor purple rank and up by always doing only gens without being hunted and then 2 survivors escape (guess i just need the BT and Unbreakable perk instead of actually having fun with the other 100 ones). Much fun and thanks for the devs for enabling this shitty gameplay where nobody has fun and two survivors probably even derank/do not even get blood points at the end of the match - and every time if someone tried to save a hooked camped person the killer got a 3K or 4K which means it totally works (at least for the killer).\n\nAlso I hope that everyone that was toxic to me without any reason than just me losing because I am \"worse\" than them is proud of themselves and had fun doing this (and thanks to the developer for not banning or timing out a single person that ever did this to me - i am pretty sure they have not banned a single player since why ban people who give them money).\n\nTLDR: I would recommend this game if you have a friend group (probably with already someone being very good at the game) since the idea behind the game can be really fun, especially when you have fun playing with them (teamwork and communication in this game is really good). You also have fun watching 15+ hours of guides showing you how to utilize all the addons, perks and characters and how to counter/play every killer.\n\nBut if you don't want to watch hours of guides and don't have a friend group and think you can just solo queue your way to the top playing at different stages of your skill against people around your skill then you probably are better off never even playing the game. \n\nMatchmaking is shit since 2016 if you solo queue (even as killers) as long as you are not good enough to reach purple rank - the devs don't care and everybody that reached red rank says the matchmaking is fine just get better by outplaying these good players (\"I mean just get good even though i never need to play against players much better than me\").\nSWF (survivors that play in a group) also get just free games when they have at least two good players since they just rank against group average or long waiting low rank killers.\nBest thing is red ranks reset every month back to purple so sometimes you just go against super good players that are \"only\" purple - many killers still derank on purpose all the time (i know this because i play also survivor and because i watch DbD streams on Twitch where this shit happens at least every 5th game).\n\nIt's a shame that seemingly no one in this community or the developers want to improve anything about the matchmaking which is why as a newbie or not yet good player without any good friends you will just go against super good players (killers and survivors) all the time instead of people around your rank so you can actually have fun while improving from time to time.\n\nAlso be prepared to spend much money on DLCs alone since Perks, survivors and killers which are essential in this game can sometimes only be bought or in some cases can be gotten after putting 100 of hours into the game.\n\nIt's just frustrating to play the game since for example as a rank 13 killer in my last 10 games I got 2 lobbies where the people were so dumb that I could have easily gotten a 4K (but like why shit on dumb/new players that even die on the hook because they get not saved or miss the checks  - that is not my style), 3 lobbies where it was a hard fight and I got one or two dead people out of it or lost some hooks because I made rookie mistakes and the other 5 where I was utterly destroyed by super good survivors without getting more than 3 hooks the whole game.\nIt would be fucking good idea to just not put survivors that were red ranks or are red ranks in the last months against killers who did not even reach purple ranks but that shit is beyond me (like rank 3 to rank 13 has a difference of 10 ranks but the game still thinks that I have a chance outsmarting these players).\n\nNext to that you get a nice community that sometimes shits on you when you are bad (red/purple rank survivor to green/yellow rank survivor/killer: \"you are so bad\" - low rank: \"i know\" - high rank: \"uninstall the game retard\") and then there is facecamping, tunneling, flashlight clicking, teabagging (which are all techniques encouraged to do by the developers <3) and balanced killers like nurse, shape, spirit, wraith etc. (I know they \"can\" be outplayed but have you ever heard of addons or noed/make-my-choice/...?)\n\nAlso the queue times are fucked and there is neither transparency nor information about how many people are queuing with you or how many survivors/killers at your rank are currently also searching for a match.\nSometimes you get insta queues, sometimes you need to wait 10, sometimes 30 minutes until you get a lobby.","timestamp_created":1467414994,"timestamp_updated":1624421079,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23999507","author":{"steamid":"76561198049852365","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":2964,"last_played":1660103863},"language":"koreana","review":"게임

없을 만큼 피드백을 줬지만 모두 묵인하고 제멋대로 패치하는 개발진.\n#이 모든 것들을 '진심으로 정상적인 밸런스'라고 생각하며 게임을 점점 망가뜨리는 패치를 하는 개발진.\n=이제는 정말 거를 타선이 없어져 버렸습니다. 그래도 이 게임 하고싶으세요? 친구4명 모아서 다인큐하던지, 친구죽이기만 하세요. 그게 유일한 이 게임을 제대로 즐기는방법입니다.\n현재 데바데는 제 방식대로 표현하자면 어느 돈많은 졸부의 아들내미가 취미로 게임 개발해보겠답시고 돈 쏟아부어서 그래픽만 그럴듯하게 만들고 밸런스는 지 꼴리는대로 덕지덕지 주먹구구식으로 만든 게임. 딱 그정도 수준입니다.\np.s 아 그리고 혹자는 매튜(데바데 총괄디렉터)가 싸잡아서 욕먹는다고, 매튜는 얼굴마담일 뿐이지 아무잘못이 없다고, 밸런스가 잘못됐으면 밸런스팀이 잘못한거고, 패치방향이 잘못된거면 해당 부서가 잘못한거다라고 하는데, 말같지도 않은 소리입니다. '총괄'디렉터라는 것 자체가 '하나의 게임이라는 것을 이루는 거의 모든 것에 관여'하며, 특히 게임 내 전반에 걸쳐 전체적인 방향성이나, 각 부서들의 계획들을 '승인'할지, '폐기'할지, '보류'할지를 '결정'하는 막대한 권력이 있는 자리입니다.\n물론 이런 상황에 편승해서 옆에서 욕하니까 아무것도 모르고 따라 욕하는 것은 잘못된 행동이겠지만, 총괄디렉터는 얼굴마담일 뿐이고, 책임에 비해 너무 많이 욕을 먹는다? 그런 말을 하는 사람 거르십시오. 권력만능주의 정신병자일 확률이 큽니다.\n---------------\n스텔스 플레이와 추격전 그리고 심리전이 주요 포인트이고 대기방을 거쳐 게임을 시작하면 채팅불가이기 때문에 각자의 판단이 중요한데 이것 또한 이 게임만이 가지는 매력입니다. 어느 게임이나 그렇듯 게임 전반의 이해도,피지컬,순발력 등이 필요한데 데바데는 상황판단과 시간계산의 중요도가 특히나 높습니다.\n 예를들어 생존자를 플레이시 1픽이 갈고리에 걸리는 중이라면 구하러 갈 것인지, 발전기를 돌릴 것인지, 캐비넷에 들어가 바칠각을 피할 것인지 등을 잘 판단하여 행동해야 하고, 그 행동을 어느 타이밍에 해야 가장 적절할지 시간을 잘 계산해야 합니다. 아까의 예시를 이어서 1픽을 구하러 갈 것이라면 갈고리 게이지가 잠식으로 넘어가기 전에 살인마에게 들키더라도 지금 당장 일직선으로 달려가 구할 것인지, 갈고리 근처에서 스텔스하며 천천히 접근 후 간보다가 구할 것인지 등을 또다시 판단해야하며,이 와중에 내가 갈고리까지 달려간다면 걸리는 시간과 갈고리 잠식까지의 시간 등을 잘 계산해야 합니다. 만약 스텔스하며 구출각을 간보는 판단을 했는데 살인마가 저 멀리서 로밍을 갔다가 갈고리로 돌아오고 있는 중이라면, 들키더라도 살인마가 완전히 갈고리에 돌아오기전에 재빨리 구할 것인지, 살인마가 갈고리로 돌아온다음 다시 로밍을 가려고 할 때 구할 것인지 또한 잘 판단해야 합니다.\n 이 모든 순간의 상황판단들이 쌓이고 쌓여서 몇명이 생존할 수 있을지 판가름나고, 플레이중에 채팅이나 음성대화 시스템이 없기때문에 각자 스스로 판단해야한다는 것이 묘미입니다.\n이 와중에 각자의 생존자는 협력하여 최대한 많은 인원이 탈출 할 수 있도록 자신을 희생하는 용기있는 플레이를 하거나, 혹은 배신하여 혼자만 생존할 수도 있습니다.\n가끔 잘하는 생존자들을 만나면 서로 채팅하나 없지만 마치 텔레파시가 통하듯 적재적소의 타이밍에 올바른 상황판단으로 스스로를 희생하며 서로가 서로를 구하면서 살인마를 압도하는 플레이를 하기도 하는데 이런 플레이들은 데바데만이 가지는 특별한 매력이라고 생각합니다.\n 그러나 현시점에서는 그러한 각자의 상황판단 실력으로 플레이하는 경우는 드물고 대부분 다인큐로 플레이합니다. 다인큐 패널티는 전혀 없으며, 보통 음성채팅 프로그램을 사용하여 살인마,발전기,생존자,아이템의 위치 등 정보를 실시간으로 전부 공유하기 때문에 앞서 말한 각자 스스로의 상황판단을 할 필요가 없어져 굉장히 편하게 플레이가 가능하며 생존자가 압도적으로 유리할 수 밖에 없습니다.\n그리고 그렇게 상황판단 실력없이 다인큐빨로 랭크가 올라간 유저들이 솔큐를 돌릴 때면 같은 방에 잡힌 실력있는 솔큐 유저들은 고통받을 수 밖에 없겠죠. 이러한 고질적인 딜레마가 있습니다.\n또한 이 게임 특성상 다인큐로 인해 밸런스 딜레마가 생깁니다.\n생존자 4명이 각자 솔큐일 때를 기준으로 밸런스를 맞추면 다인큐4명일 때는 압도적으로 생존자가 유리합니다. 그렇다고 다인큐4명을 기준으로 밸런스를 맞추면 솔큐4명일 때는 압도적으로 생존자가 불리합니다. 거기다 생존자보다 살인마 플레이시 멘탈이 쉽게 피로해지기 때문에 만족감보다 압박감을 더 받기 쉽습니다.\n다인큐로 인한 생존자 밸런스 뿐만이 아니라, 살인마간의 밸런스와 퍽과 애드온의 밸런스도 심하게 깨져있어 고랭크로 갈수록 좋다고 정평이 난 것들 몇개 빼고는 안쓰는 것이 정신건강에 좋습니다. 굳이 사용하려면 좋은 에드온과 실력으로 커버가 어느정도 가능하나 힘듭니다. 꾸준히 신캐릭터와 신규퍽이 나오고 간간히 퍽 밸런스 패치를 하지만, 그때마다 개발진이 얼마나 이 게임의 이해도가 딸리고 밸런스에 관심이 없는지 알 수 있습니다. 심지어 개발진측에서 모든 살인마의 밸런스를 맞출 필요를 느끼지 못한다고 했답니다.\n또한 생존자와 살인마 모두 캐릭터마다 고유의 티처블퍽이 존재해 마음에 드는 퍽으로 조합하여 장착하려면 신전(신전은 매번 랜덤이기 때문에 자신이 원하는 퍽이 언제나올지 알 수 없어서 하염없이 기다려야 합니다.)에서 사지않는 이상은 여러캐릭터를 DLC로 구매해야하며, 일정 레벨까지는 필수로 키워야 합니다.\n개인의 실력과 판단도 중요하지만 고랭크로 갈수록 좋은 퍽과 아이템,오퍼링의 희귀도와 사용유무가 게임의 흐름을 크게 좌우합니다.\n\n#평소에 하드난이도 게임을 즐겨한다해도 추천하지않습니다. 이거 돈주고 할바에 유튜브나 보면서 대리만족이나 느끼고, 차라리 치킨사먹던지, 옷을 사 입으세요.","timestamp_created":1467412359,"timestamp_updated":1604233977,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23998352","author":{"steamid":"76561198269400834","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1657654226},"language":"german","review":"Nervenkitzel, Spannung und ein \"Mörder\"-Spaß!

These make for some great times and are tense just like clutching on CS:GO!\nSo much depth on the build you take and especially the perks.\nCan't win without working on the objective, promoting teamwork.\nNo voice or text chat. Having chat for survivors would make it incredibly unfair for the killer, which is also the reason why friends can't team up vs a solo survivor in Quick Play Games. Also no blaming each other.\nBalanced.\n\nCons:\n\nThere are some bugs which are getting tackled by the dev team (from queue bugs to in game bugs).\nThere are infinite loops in which the Killer can never catch the Survivor (single) however there was made a huge improvement on this. There are still some infinite loops but most of them were removed.
