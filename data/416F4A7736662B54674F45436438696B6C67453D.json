When it comes to the bug and optimization issues those can be fixed and made to be perfect, bringing this game up to a very positive review in my eyes. However the developers haven't done that so for now I will reccomend the game but it hasn't reached a 9 out of 10 for me just yet. The main thing that keeps this game from a perfect score in my opinion and I think a lot of people opinions as well is the balance of the game. The only issue with people complaining about this is that they will always be complaining about this issue. Dead by daylight is an asymmetrical pvp game, to be able to get q perfect balance in this game is going to be impossible especially given the its us against them mentality that a lot of players have in this community. Right now I personally think the game is very wel balanced and the reason I give for this is that most of my games have a fairly good 50/50 split of winning and losing on both killer and survivor. Is the game no longer in the palm of the salty survivors? No it's no longer in the hands. Is that a bad thing? No it isn't, it gives the game more dimensions and brings a new level of difficulty to the game. Over all this game is a solid 8/10 from me, the moment they fix their bugs and optimization issues it will ne raised to a 9/10. Anyway, I'll see you at the bonfire.","timestamp_created":1516245378,"timestamp_updated":1534358328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39427726","author":{"steamid":"76561198080559949","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":55584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21731,"last_played":1642735332},"language":"english","review":"This game has its flaws, lots of bugs, lots of rage, lots of disrespect but through it all the game is a whole new take on the pvp genre 4 v 1. four survivors with one killer allows for a crazy amount of things to happen. survivors aren't able to attack the killer unless they acquire perks that help get away from the killer. the killer is in all their glory the best killin machine if put in the right hands. Survivors main mission is to get generators running and escape the killer through obstacles that are in the map such as pallets, windows, and sneaky sneaks. there is a lot of outplay potential that can be had by the survivors hands and allows for some pretty fun chases. it may seem like the game is uneventful but i bet if you can understand the basics you'll put in hundreds of hours into this game.","timestamp_created":1516245006,"timestamp_updated":1516245006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39427186","author":{"steamid":"76561198130304514","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1536658825},"language":"english","review":"Getting chased caused my heart to burst out of my chest and land into my bowl of cereal which I ate anyways so yeah.","timestamp_created":1516242619,"timestamp_updated":1516242619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39427070","author":{"steamid":"76561198340244902","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1626009944},"language":"koreana","review":"개꿀잼이자너~","timestamp_created":1516242043,"timestamp_updated":1516242043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39426080","author":{"steamid":"76561198141714520","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":19157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12088,"last_played":1573207400},"language":"english","review":"very nice","timestamp_created":1516237466,"timestamp_updated":1516237466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39425979","author":{"steamid":"76561198390718735","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":428,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1659873596},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好玩的","timestamp_created":1516237014,"timestamp_updated":1516237014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39425250","author":{"steamid":"76561198367170051","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1512651928},"language":"schinese","review":"还行，没贪玩蓝月好玩","timestamp_created":1516233729,"timestamp_updated":1516233729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529191970825195313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39424754","author":{"steamid":"76561198070888368","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":909,"last_played":1657233839},"language":"polish","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1516231693,"timestamp_updated":1516231693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39424577","author":{"steamid":"76561198301001863","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1612239214},"language":"english","review":"Very fun, intense game to make you always check behind you.

Однообразная игра. Приготовьтесь поиграть в симулятор progress bar'а. Он везде: починка генератора, очистка тотема, оказание себе помощи или открытии сундука. Ты часто будешь видеть одни и те же ситуации, слышать одни и те же слова - \"ноед/барбекю и чили/проклятая земля/генрашер/кемпер/тунелер (сколько боли в этих словах)\". Про дисбаланс этой игры можно услышать с обеих сторон (как за маньяка, так и выжившего). Комьюнити игры ужасно, в неё играют либо маленькие дети, либо уже взрослые особи, которые обладают маниакальными наклонностями. \n\nВсе \"визуальные\" обновления карт ужасны. Одиночкам здесь делать нечего. Игра вызывает агрессию и ненависть. Присутствуют многие виды микротранзакций - платные персонажи, скины и боевой пропуск. Плохие сервера. \n\nИгра не как кардинально не изменяется от патча или покупки нового dlc, ты будешь чинить генераторы или убивать. Не присутствует \"мастерская\", нет возможности модификации игры, уникальных режимов тоже нет. \n\nНикакого наказания за токсичное поведение, отключение (у выживших отнимают очки за то что маньяк выйдет из игры), использование багов или \"геймплейных\" механик. \n\nМногие карты, особенно закрытые, ужасны спроектированы и вызывают отвращение.\nБольшинство перков бесполезны или являются из категории \"фановые\" и предназначены для того чтобы вы (возможно) посмеялись и погибли. Зачем перк \"уникальная возможность\" подсвечивает мне дверные проемы закрытыми деревяшками? С ними же может взаимодействовать только маньяк.\nМементо мори, особенно красное, было введено по ошибке. Если это не так, то почему выжившие не имеют в подношении красный шприц (который откатывался бы через время или выполнив действие) в подношении? Или \"новую деталь\"? Было бы справедливо чинить генераторы с большой скоростью, ведь маньяк же может использовать мементо.\n\nВсе больше маньяков который повторяют способности старых. Стрельба, ловушки и похожие перки по цене новых. Что нас ждет дальше? Стоит только догадываться.\n\nРадует что игра побила недавний пик онлайна в ~100к и имеет отличные отзывы. Надеюсь разработчикам получится добавлять все больше платных коллабораций и меньше оригинального и нужного контента, чтобы увеличивать количество проданных копий игры и для достижения новых вершин в количестве одновременно игравших. Спасибо вам, Behaviour Interactive, за прекрасную игру и рад (судя по загрузочным экранам посвященным пятой годовщине) что работа над ней вам доставляет только удовольствие.","timestamp_created":1516212899,"timestamp_updated":1625500663,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39418903","author":{"steamid":"76561198170260038","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":66422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1190,"last_played":1645476210},"language":"polish","review":"PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR!","timestamp_created":1516212642,"timestamp_updated":1575052608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39418899","author":{"steamid":"76561198090095216","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":67245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":6021,"last_played":1660064600},"language":"russian","review":"игра классная, больше мне нечего сказать","timestamp_created":1516212636,"timestamp_updated":1516212636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486486494541168213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39418657","author":{"steamid":"76561198292558887","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":23187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18977,"last_played":1639158548},"language":"polish","review":"Dead by Daylight, czyli jak zepsuć coś co działało..

Забросил потому что надоело играть в одно и тоже, да сценарий был одним и тем же.\n\nУже давно было ясно, что игра за манов на топовых рангах была очень сложной, если не играешь на нюрсе с рин и на кожаном лице.\n(любители кожаного лица это отдельная каста извращенцев, бытует мнение, что они и в жизни готовы ждать любого человека до смерти)\n\nИ спустя год возвращаюсь я такой, думая щас поиграю со слабыми игроками вспомню как играть за манов. И вроде ничего, 7 игр стабильные -4 за самых разных манов.\nНо на 8 игре мне попались какие то чуваки, которые завели ген за 3-4 минуты, а после окончания игры меня оказывается кинуло к красным рангам. Расслабившись, подумав просто не повезло стал играть дальше, а дальше мне игра таких хуев в рот накидало, что я в ахуе. Каждая  игра длилась 3-4 минуты и мои мысли щас только об удалении этой параши.\n\nПотому что почему блять меня игрока не игравшего почти год кидает к этим топам. Если я не могу поймать выжевшего как бывший мейнер манов, и знающий что то об этой параше, то как бывать простым новчикам???? Сука что это за балланс такой ебаный?\n\nНе покупайте эту игру пока они не поправят баллансировщик или просто учитесь играть за рин, мор или кожанного лица с нюрсой, остальные маны просто не играбельны. Потому что если хотите по трайхардить на других манах у вас скорее жопа сгорит от этой игры.\n\n\nА да еще ебаная регистрация урона, я как понял ее ввели в угода сурвам, теперь когда вы наносите хит и видите кровь, но сурв скинул палету или сыграл орешек игра покажет вам не урон, а толстый болт и положит на лоб вам","timestamp_created":1516182349,"timestamp_updated":1646405727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39408831","author":{"steamid":"76561198401492538","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1659625639},"language":"english","review":"This Game Gives Me The Chills","timestamp_created":1516179067,"timestamp_updated":1516179067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39408784","author":{"steamid":"76561198278961585","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":17041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1652375622},"language":"schinese","review":"我真的按了家人们","timestamp_created":1516178870,"timestamp_updated":1624798794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39408775","author":{"steamid":"76561198374731347","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":28,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1659922651},"language":"russian","review":"симулятор побега из саратова","timestamp_created":1516178774,"timestamp_updated":1649309444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39408507","author":{"steamid":"76561198060093710","num_games_owned":382,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":86944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38924,"last_played":1623857075},"language":"japanese","review":"神オブクソゲー\n\nみんなでやりましょう","timestamp_created":1516177600,"timestamp_updated":1533140582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514421761035919189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39408185","author":{"steamid":"76561198261207609","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":28011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27715,"last_played":1574337985},"language":"schinese","review":"玩腻了dota2，玩完dbd很有意思，这款游戏我认为不要在乎输赢，亮点是心理的博弈\n\nbad dev change so frequently\n\n几百小时的玩家了，对游戏也算是挺有感情了的，见到游戏制作组把一手好牌打成这样真是无语。\n\nsx制作者乱封禁乱改游戏，真不知道是赚钱想疯了还是真的脑子不好用了","timestamp_created":1516176023,"timestamp_updated":1554465783,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39407140","author":{"steamid":"76561198144269538","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":26921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":9261,"last_played":1659923608},"language":"english","review":"*FRIENDS ARE GOOD.*\nThe community is toxic.\nYou will always never be good enough in your teammates eyes.\nIts a cycle of hate no matter what you do or how you play.\n\n*Never would have put in as much hour into this game if I had friends to play it with.*\n","timestamp_created":1516171290,"timestamp_updated":1516171290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39406619","author":{"steamid":"76561198096737505","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":88566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32786,"last_played":1658344609},"language":"english","review":"I have to admit that I love this game to death, but the amount of malarcy both killers and survivors have to go through, mainly killers, has really made the game become less and less enjoyable for me.

The game is fun at times, but the fact that you waist so much time to get into a game, you can wait in the lobby then when you get into a game you get kicked out because the killer saw a flashlight or multiple people join so they are comunicating and that is \"cheating\". I have 300 hours in this game and probabaly 100 are just waiting. NO JOKE. with nothing. To. Do. The Blood Points that you can get as a survivor is very limmited.

AND the fact if you play the game as the killer and you want to get as many points as possible you can and most likely will be permanently banned. \n\nWhat i like: .... the Lore of the killers?\nyep. thats it\n\nrevise 1:\niv grown up a lot since i put this review up. but this game still sucks.\n\nrevise 2:\nStop making this game worse.

Where killing requires significantly more concentration, survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player, but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear, but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles, and the killers have completely different \"powers\" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something, then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.\nI would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time-waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame, but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game  factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. \nIt's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.","timestamp_created":1516152318,"timestamp_updated":1516152318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":643,"votes_funny":90,"weighted_vote_score":"0.875751614570617676","comment_count":45,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39402659","author":{"steamid":"76561198253091155","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":17726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1407,"last_played":1647237701},"language":"koreana","review":"opo","timestamp_created":1516150970,"timestamp_updated":1516150970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39402634","author":{"steamid":"76561197964607692","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":12649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8206,"last_played":1652879852},"language":"english","review":"I like the game sometimes","timestamp_created":1516150803,"timestamp_updated":1629170812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39402542","author":{"steamid":"76561198004762942","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13743,"last_played":1650540921},"language":"russian","review":"Good game!!!\nGood camper!!!\nGood f@cking team!!!\nGood bug!!!\n10/10","timestamp_created":1516150357,"timestamp_updated":1516150357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491803258657455444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39401372","author":{"steamid":"76561198329012848","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":30575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1658564162},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game \n","timestamp_created":1516144929,"timestamp_updated":1516144929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514563083648681641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39401351","author":{"steamid":"76561198099979872","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":816,"playtime_at_review":34212,"last_played":1660255558},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gutes spiel, empfehl ich jeden gl :)","timestamp_created":1516144863,"timestamp_updated":1516144863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39401020","author":{"steamid":"76561198357617085","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":15106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":31,"playtime_at_review":3046,"last_played":1660534244},"language":"english","review":"I think the gameplay it's great but it needs more work on performance , i think it has too big requirements for that graphics .","timestamp_created":1516143610,"timestamp_updated":1516143610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39400886","author":{"steamid":"76561198169999806","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":134193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25340,"last_played":1658659352},"language":"english","review":"There is a game inside this bug.","timestamp_created":1516143081,"timestamp_updated":1516143081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506666660308837891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39400726","author":{"steamid":"76561198418048551","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":25893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":423,"playtime_at_review":22273,"last_played":1660217914},"language":"english","review":"Love the game but it's a little annoying since my internet loves to drop out for no reason so I end up having to wait an entire day to play again just due to my internet not cooperating with me.

But trust me that isn't the case. Something about playing match after match of this game and completing the tasks, leading the killer away for minutes or downing all survivors really satisfies something in you. \n\nThere are regular new characters to the game with new perks, keeping the game fresh, and it really can be a fun pass time. Don't mistake it for a horror game as after the first 10 or so hours of playing it really isn't about getting scared at all and you don't really bat an eye lid when you see the killer. Hell sometimes you look for him if you try imitate your favourite youtuber and be cool. It's more of a game where you play online matches and its about winning those matches and gathering bloodpoints to level your characters rather than the horror aspect.\n\nFinally regarding the community, there can be a lot of toxic people and I don't mean people who make you run circles, who loop, you for ages if you're playing killer, or if killers who use 'toxic' perks. That is part of the game and they can be outplayed easily and why blame people for using things at their disposal. But i mean people who purposefully try annoy you and bully you and are just toxic to you. Personally it doesn't bother me but it might be a discouragement to some. But it can get a bit annoying if you're on a loosing streak. Having said that you also meet a lot of very friendly people who let you go as a killer if you're the last one and tried hard, which really make your day.\n\nSince the games are 4 survivors versus a killer, and you can't talk with other survivors in online matches, if you play as a survivor it is much more fun to play with friends. You will get good laughs and can cooperate during the games. You can also play in a private lobby where a friend can be a killer. It is still very fun alone, killer or survivor, but as a survivor it is much more enjoyable with friends.","timestamp_created":1516137392,"timestamp_updated":1604843037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39399312","author":{"steamid":"76561198406890486","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":20227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1772,"last_played":1655162086},"language":"english","review":"a pretty damn fine game, although the \" idea \" of gameplay is one of the oldest game the childrend play, \" the wolf ' or cop and thief...exept here you get killed if you get catch\n\nthe sound effect is AWESOME, of course, when a game use Wwise, it better be , well IT IS ! woaw woaw woaw, the movement are fluids, extremely addictive , I LIKE IT A LOT\n\nalthough, Campers...players who choose to play killers and keep on camping next to the hooked victim, this is the most annoying part, it s allowed yes ok, it s a part of the gameplay..but it s truly fucking annoying... but that's all :) EXCELENT GAME what so ever.","timestamp_created":1516137280,"timestamp_updated":1516137280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39399132","author":{"steamid":"76561198298398397","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":81232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52538,"last_played":1602579487},"language":"english","review":"Absolutly one of the most addictive games out there.
