game is undeniably entertaining, and slightly fairer than one might initially expect in giving survivors chances to escape from a threat they can't physically confront. There is thrill in both the hunt and escaping the hunt. Different killers provide a lot of variation to the gameplay, and it can be fun to see some of your friends from other franchises like Ghostface.\n\nThe extra monetisation method is kinder than a play restricting phone game, but should still be considered predatory. Developers do deserve money, and these ones do continue to support their game. There are perks to make the game interesting, or help combat some of the inherent flaws in the imbalanced nature of the game - such as perks for if a killer decides they want to kill specifically you. But if you want them, you have to play forever to unlock them, or pay for them. In general the game favours those that have played longer because they have more options available to them.\nTo expand a little more on this - each survivor or killer comes with three unique perks. Levelling them up lets you unlock these perks to use on other characters. This.. both allows for more customisation, but in a way can also dilute some of the individuality of each character. Once you play survivors enough the person you pick is just a model switch and doesn't mean anything. While killers are still stuck with their core function, they can take perks from other killers to pick a set that provides the least potential for escape. Good in theory, cruel in practice.\n\n\nFrustration is inherent in all things competitive, particularly when not clean cut mirror matches, but at the end of the day there is little in this an individual survivor can do if a killer decides on purpose or by accident that you don't get to have fun that match. The game relies on a silent agreement with most killers that they aren't going to tunnel, camp, or generally be poor sports about the chase.\n\nAt the same time, playing as killer can be similarly frustrating, and often comes with greater pressure, when against the well coordinated, or just particularly evasive. This leaves both parties feeling frustrated or running around with the notion of 'get effed'.\n\nI will probably keep playing though, even though I've uninstalled it ~five times, because I want to play with friends, and it -can- be fun.\nAll in all, spent way too much money, got upset with game. Griefed myself.","timestamp_created":1654515605,"timestamp_updated":1654646432,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581511795520782471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116569965","author":{"steamid":"76561198989505558","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1655641297},"language":"english","review":"nigger","timestamp_created":1654513965,"timestamp_updated":1654513965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116569963","author":{"steamid":"76561199039210352","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11032,"last_played":1658599002},"language":"thai","review":"c","timestamp_created":1654513960,"timestamp_updated":1654513960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116569507","author":{"steamid":"76561199173419753","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1171,"playtime_at_review":25404,"last_played":1660487582},"language":"russian","review":"Нерофните клодеток пж","timestamp_created":1654513004,"timestamp_updated":1654513004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116568961","author":{"steamid":"76561199132228144","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1654721996},"language":"russian","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1654511815,"timestamp_updated":1654511815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116568255","author":{"steamid":"76561199310239309","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":780,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1660599821},"language":"schinese","review":"玩两局就断联一次就很烦","timestamp_created":1654510360,"timestamp_updated":1654510360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116567577","author":{"steamid":"76561198111195048","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18764,"last_played":1658665545},"language":"english","review":"it's like being in a toxic relationship with someone. except that there's no sex.\n\ndear devs, pls fix ur game (and maybe add sex while you're at it)","timestamp_created":1654509019,"timestamp_updated":1654509019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563390076160430908","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116567525","author":{"steamid":"76561198992914261","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1832,"playtime_at_review":50422,"last_played":1660592044},"language":"hungarian","review":"Gyakorlatilag már több, mint egy éve játszom a játékkal és még mindig élvezem a meccseket, tudok izgulni, ha olyan a szituáció, hogy kijutok e vagy sem.

Usually playing as a survivor in the game I find that later in the day about after 8:00 P.M. matchmaking definitely isn't the best and for me can take up to 5 - 20 minutes.  On the other hand playing as a killer at any time of the day my matchmaking has been great I normally get into the game fairly quickly.  In Dead By Daylight I usually enjoy the custom matches the best because I can invite four other friends and use the best perks, choose which map to play, and get into games instantly.  I would recommend playing this game if you have at least one other person to play with, but if not it can still be enjoyable.  Before I played this game for way more hours on my PS4 but I don't have much hours at all on my PC so my opinion could be different.\n\nIf I had to rank the game I would probably say for me it's around probably 8 - 8.5, even could be a 9 in my opinion.  Many people like the game because of the exclusive characters you can play as such as Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, Leatherface, and even Freddy Krueger.  And many other great survivors and killers created by Dead By Daylight that can be great to use.  Also people enjoy for the thrill of the game.\n\nPeople might not like the game because of the matchmaking at times or for the early frustration they may get when first starting, but I recommend giving it some time and getting used to the characters to truly explore the whole game and see if it's your type of game to play.\n\nBut overall in my experience I would 100% recommend this game because it has been very fun for me and is definitely one of my favorite games to this date.  And I've mainly played the game on console for almost 4 years but some gaps in there because of friends lost of interest or just not having time.  I've had many great moments playing this game that have been fun, funny, and rewarding when you win the game or unlock something hard to get.  So for the short answer yes I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play!","timestamp_created":1654497271,"timestamp_updated":1654497271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116562529","author":{"steamid":"76561199174955134","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1654424693},"language":"english","review":"no servers unfortunatley\n","timestamp_created":1654496973,"timestamp_updated":1654496973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116562155","author":{"steamid":"76561198381530148","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3254,"last_played":1658590969},"language":"english","review":"Mostly toxic community, unfriendly and bming.

In the beginning, it hurts. As time passes the pain subsides and you go into the slight giddy laughter. Dead by Daylight is one of the few rare combinations of gaming that can be fun to play, and at times an absolute chore. You either choose to play as the Survivor or the Killer. As the Survivor your job is to activate 5 generators while avoiding the killer. You work with your teammates to escape in various maps ranging from an Insane Asylum, an old lumberyard, and more. As the killer your job is as implies. To eliminate the survivors to please the entity. Both killer and survivor have their pros and cons. I personally have enjoyed playing the Survivors with my friends as we all try to keep our sanity. If you are a fan of hide and seek and classic horror movie tropes, give this game a go!\n\nWarning: I would be dismissive not to include the following. This game has been known to have a few players here and there who cheat. Though I haven't encountered any of these cheaters yet (Knock on wood), there are instances of people who have reported hacking. There are also a number of players who tend to cheat the system either by hiding in a corner preventing rescue, or campers and t-baggers. If you are easily offended by reactions such as this, this game may feel tedious at times. However if you are willing to look past this, one can honestly find enjoyment in playing Dead by Daylight.\n\nI have put in only 12 hours on the PC already, and so far I have enjoyed every moment of it. If you're feeling brave to encounter these horrors, hop on to Dead by Daylight!\n\nPROS: \n-Fun Game of Hide and Seek\n-Different Survivors for different skills and abilities\n-Killer's all original and from popular media\n-Holiday Give aways\n-Fairly Easy Game mechanics to understand\n\nCONS: \n-Noted Hackers in the Past\n-Occasional Times of consistent loses\n-Can become tedious playing alone\n-MUST BE ONLINE TO PLAY","timestamp_created":1654483279,"timestamp_updated":1654483279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116556422","author":{"steamid":"76561198435943734","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":75455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4609,"playtime_at_review":72323,"last_played":1660578009},"language":"koreana","review":"핵 좀 잡아 메튜야","timestamp_created":1654482365,"timestamp_updated":1659815266,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116556347","author":{"steamid":"76561199112723337","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18095,"last_played":1658819160},"language":"english","review":"da shit fire bruh","timestamp_created":1654482229,"timestamp_updated":1654482229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116556335","author":{"steamid":"76561198870392131","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1222,"playtime_at_review":5823,"last_played":1660581746},"language":"japanese","review":"先月頭に始めたばかりのキラー専ですが、ゲーム性自体は間違いなく面白いものとなっています。\n問題は、運営と一部プレイヤーがゲーム性をまるで理解していないこと。後者によるネガキャンなんかも問題ではありますが、それ以上に深刻なのが前者が招くとんでもないバランス調整。\n確かにヤバすぎるものはサバイバーでも弱体化してくれますが、基本的に運営はキラーに対してかーなーり厳しいです。\nそもそも運営がマッチの回転率を上げたいとして行った発電機の調整なども含めて、基本的にキラーがどんどんキツい調整をしていった結果、キラー自体の人口が大きく減ってしまい、却ってサバのマッチ回転率が落ちているという悪循環や、特定パークに使用率が偏るという状態を引き起こしています。\n運営はそのことをま　る　で認識していません。というか、公式がキラーを割と蔑ろにしています。\n(サバは逃げきれたからokなど)\n運営がこのゲームがそもそもどういうゲームなのかを忘れてしまっている、という点には留意した方がよろしいです。\n運によっては正直ゲームになりませんので。","timestamp_created":1654482207,"timestamp_updated":1654482207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529234230518341064","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116555633","author":{"steamid":"76561198336460737","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":50818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1073,"playtime_at_review":42284,"last_played":1660594111},"language":"english","review":"Playing too much dead by daylight may shorten your lifespan or possibly lead to death.
