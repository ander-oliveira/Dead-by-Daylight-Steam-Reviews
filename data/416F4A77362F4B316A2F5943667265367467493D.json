by Daylight é um jogo divertido. A ideia do jogo é simples: repare cinco geradores para gerar energia e fugir pelos portões da saída enquanto um killer corre atrás de você e de seus outros 3 amigos.\nComo todo jogo, tem sua comunidade tóxica, mas ainda sim é um dos jogos mais saudáveis que eu encontrei até hoje. No começo do game, quando se ainda é rank baixo (rank 20), é provável que pareça assustador, difícil e tóxico. Conforme o tempo passa isso melhora. É ótimo para jogar com amigos, com ou sem discord para ter uma experiência legal. Eu gosto de jogar sem discord as vezes para realmente me sentir no jogo e consigo me comunicar pelo o que o jogo oferece (gestos e alguns outros que nós mesmos players inventamos). Dead by daylight é o único game onde um killer escolhe \"perder\" uma partida para se divertir com os sobreviventes. É o único game onde sobreviventes escolhem morrer para ajudar um killer inexperiente. É um jogo muito bom, competitivo porém saudável, mesmo morrendo você ainda pode subir de rank, mesmo morrendo você ainda pode se divertir e rir muito nas partidas.","timestamp_created":1606839637,"timestamp_updated":1606839779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.707369029521942139","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81394684","author":{"steamid":"76561198135766775","num_games_owned":599,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":42840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":243,"playtime_at_review":5430,"last_played":1659641424},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game.

И даже после глобального решения игра не запустилась, выдав сначала абсолютно новую ошибку, а после вновь ту же ошибку с файлом \"normaliz.dll\". Анти-чит абсолютно во всех случаях не давал запустить игру, выдавая ошибку. Что это за игра, которую ты покупаешь чтобы играть в неё, имея хорошее оборудование и систему, и в итогах она у тебя даже не запускается??? Первая игра которая даже не запустилась. Я разочарована в стиме и в этой игре. Ожидания были очень высокими.","timestamp_created":1606839253,"timestamp_updated":1606839253,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393662","author":{"steamid":"76561198108129267","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":53324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39782,"last_played":1636135028},"language":"russian","review":"+++","timestamp_created":1606839167,"timestamp_updated":1606839167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393593","author":{"steamid":"76561198060574360","num_games_owned":410,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":652,"last_played":1618517284},"language":"english","review":"Great Fun","timestamp_created":1606839130,"timestamp_updated":1606839130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393555","author":{"steamid":"76561198387265656","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7955,"last_played":1658587612},"language":"koreana","review":"채팅을 영어로만 허용시켜서 한국인들의 욕설이 없을 줄 알겠지만... 한국인들이 영어로 패드립 혹은 입에 담지 못 할 욕설들을 함... 고랭크로 갈수록 유난히 게임이 끝난 후 욕설이 심해지는 편이며 저랭크까지는 무난히 즐길만함. 그러나 랭크 올리기가 워낙 수월한 편이라 금방 고랭크로 가버려서 그만큼 힘듬.... 그리고 유료겜인만큼 버그랑 렉 좀 고쳤으면 좋겠음. 재밌게 즐기긴 했으나 갈수록 심해지는 한국인들의 욕설에 지쳐서 플레이 시간을 줄이고 있음..","timestamp_created":1606839113,"timestamp_updated":1606839113,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393502","author":{"steamid":"76561199012960441","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1657246959},"language":"english","review":"AMAZINNG GAME I LOVE IT\n","timestamp_created":1606839092,"timestamp_updated":1606839092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393476","author":{"steamid":"76561199071732610","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1652752207},"language":"spanish","review":"Me gusto, es entretenido <3\n","timestamp_created":1606839079,"timestamp_updated":1606839079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393465","author":{"steamid":"76561199072041182","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":132497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87658,"last_played":1658547382},"language":"thai","review":"เกมกาก ผีโคตรแคมป์ เซอร์ก็โคตรบูลลี่","timestamp_created":1606839075,"timestamp_updated":1650098907,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81393395","author":{"steamid":"76561198907973710","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":70348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28782,"last_played":1644535440},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo sempre tem um bug, sempre uns problemas, mas a gente ama.

un jeu que je recommande car il déchaîne les passions et fait ressortir de nombreuses émotions que cela soit en bien comme en mal. \nVous y passerez de très bons moments et vous aurez également de bonnes frustrations...\nPour faire simple, c'est excellent simulateur de vie courante et d'amitié avec larmes, et crochets inclus.\n\nPour résumer succinctement et grossièrement, c'est un jeu multijoueur (uniquement) asymétrique où 4 survivants doivent échapper à un tueur spécifique (originaux ou tueur emblématique de film ou série sous licence) en réparant 5 générateurs pour ouvrir une porte ou s'échapper par une trappe qui fait office de sortie de secours et apparaît sous certaines conditions. A cela rajouté des poursuites et autres éléments de cache cache comme des casiers pour disparaître, des palettes pour blesser et étourdir les tueurs, des totems de malédiction à détruire pour affaiblir le tueur (ou pas), des pièges et encore d'autres interactions spécifiques pour pimenter votre expérience.\n\nComme énoncé, DBD est un excellent jeu où vous allez éprouver divers sentiments qui passeront par le bonheur de survivre ou trucider tous le monde, la rage d'avoir une équipe de m****, ou au contraire une équipe qui donne tout pour vous sauver voir un tueur qui vous camp salement ou qui s'acharne sur vous voir encore plus rare un qui est fair play (ça change du conn*** qui en tunnel un le tue, qui mori le second et qui après laisse fuir les deux derniers pour avoir un \"ty\" je te met un report positif - 2vs2 pour pas trop abuser niveau karma) ou encore mieux l'amère expérimentation des nombreux bugs ou abus de gameplay de surtout sur certains tueurs qui sortent sans être réellement testés (because they \"did a pretty good job so far\" et qu'ils \"ont étés entraînés à la dure dans leurs équipes avec une infirmière qui se téléportait 7 fois\" ahaha merci les palettes servent plus à rien, comment détruire une mécanique du jeu, palettes où le survivant les faisaient tomber avec lui du mauvais côté, loops infinis et abusés, stucks dans décors etc. etc. Bref une quantité astronomique de joie et d'amour distribués qui vous feront ressentir des choses) ainsi qu'une communauté extraordinaire et qui pour le coup n'est vraiment pas toxique (face camp, tbag, spam flashlight, intentional unhook near the killer, tunneling etc.). \n\nRien que pour cela et pour ressentir tout cet amour au moins une fois dans votre vie et faire des rencontres inoubliables, foncez !\n\nPS : Les devs et l'équipe derrière ont un très bon jeu, qu'ils aiment et font vivre avec passion (même lorsqu'ils \"corrigent un bug et que 99 autres apparaissent\" et qu'on aimerait qu'ils soient un peu plus réactif -raclement de gorge-) et il y a aussi d'excellents comportements au niveau de la communauté des joueurs (même si comme tout bon film d'horreur il y a la grosse victime et

blatte).","timestamp_created":1606836116,"timestamp_updated":1606838644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529147982597351074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81386367","author":{"steamid":"76561198237793796","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1374,"last_played":1652016416},"language":"german","review":"gut","timestamp_created":1606836086,"timestamp_updated":1606836086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81386155","author":{"steamid":"76561199104029325","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1607359466},"language":"polish","review":"XD

The game has devised its own unique imprint for online games. This is what makes the game very difficult to review, as its hard to compare to similar titles. This game will have a different effect on many people, some will be captivated and fall in love with this cat-and-mouse genre, others will gloss over it without too much thought, and others will struggle to find enjoyment.\n\nSo let's look at some things that potential Dead by Daylight players should recognise to determine whether or not they believe this game appropriate for them:\n\n+/- Horror themed; the trailers and general marketing of this game attempts to put forth that this game is a horror game, it really isn't, while the notion of killing and survival is obviously horror-related a player will quickly learn that this is merely a skin that is cast over the convoluted chasing game that is going on at a game-play level, that's not to say this game doesn't have its frightening moments though.\n\n+ Lots of content; the developers are frequently faulted on many aspects however it's no question that through the over four years of activity this game has seen, there has been no slow of content to be released, meaning that there is almost always something new to tryout in this game, which really does wonders for the longevity of the title.\n\n- With this large amount of content, coupled with a unique and unfamiliar genre of game, comes a very steep learning curve for beginner players to struggle through. With 22 (at the time of writing) different killers each with unique powers and add-ons, nearly 200 perks total in the game, many different maps, etc there is so much to learn that a new player will be overwhelmed.\n\n- Another negative to the large amount of content is the way that players access and unlock this content. In other words this game is a huge grind. At the time of writing I have 824.6 hours in the game and I am yet to unlock every perk on every killer. The systems that are currently in place to unlock things or remnants from the early life of the game, when there was much less content, so as the game has grown so too has the grind. While you do not need to have every single aspect of the game unlocked to enjoy, it is something to note. Additionally, much of the content in the game is held within DLC packs that are pretty costly when added together, most of these DLC can be grinded out, but that just adds to the aforementioned problem. In my opinion this is one of the most egregious aspects of the game.\n\n- Buggy. Like Holy. This game is a technical mess. I'm not going to be going into detail on all the bugs in this game because the review would be longer than the bible, but players need to accept that it is not uncommon for the game to rob you of plays simply due spaghetti code that is this games foundation. It is *somewhat* better than it used to be, but still at the popularity this game has reached, there really isn't any excuse.\n\n+/- The community. A lot of people complain about the community, and its not without merit, there are lots of aspects of the community that really are toxic (player entitlement being a big issue) however, and this might just be because I'm coming from a background in DotA 2, the community is not the worst I've seen, but I won't praise the community either, just something to keep in mind.\n\n+/- Large RNG reliance. From semi-procedurally generated maps to the ability of some killers having chance baked into the foundations, a significant enough portion of this game is down to luck, which to no small degree does hurt the more competitive side of the game.\n\nI have a lot more I could talk about here but I'm a sleepy boy so I'll leave with this final discussion:\n\nSo who is Dead by Daylight for? It's hard to say, and while a lot of my review may seem negative, I still recommend the game as, for me at least, I was part of the players to fall in love and while the game is certainly not flawless (very far from it) it still is currently the only title on the market (for all intensive purposes) to be doing this style of game. So I'll say this game is worth a try, if not for the personal longevity that you might find then for the unique experience that this game offers.\n\nHopefully I didn't butcher what I wanted to say too badly.","timestamp_created":1606835488,"timestamp_updated":1606835869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81384698","author":{"steamid":"76561199011767839","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7604,"last_played":1656656879},"language":"koreana","review":"나는... 살인마 안 한다... 너네도 하지 말아라...ㅆ","timestamp_created":1606835377,"timestamp_updated":1606835377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81384670","author":{"steamid":"76561199045481695","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1648966731},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego esta muy bien hecho, el juego en si no trata nada mas de un asesino tratando de cazar 4 supervivientes, va mas alla.\nLa historia del juego esta basada en la literatura de lovecraft o de stephen king, un ente de procedencia desconocida creando ambientes o mapas parecidos al mundo, se alimenta de los supervivientes metiendoles miedo, el ente representa un entorno bajo los conocimientos que este tiene del mundo y de los seres humanos y tambien crea a los personajes de terror cuya funcion es alimentar al ente.\nJUEGAZO.","timestamp_created":1606835368,"timestamp_updated":1607707098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81384520","author":{"steamid":"76561198098164511","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1658924029},"language":"russian","review":"а","timestamp_created":1606835295,"timestamp_updated":1606835295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81384375","author":{"steamid":"76561198242826332","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2049,"last_played":1607829562},"language":"english","review":"Good game but Unbalanced AF, some killers are super op.
