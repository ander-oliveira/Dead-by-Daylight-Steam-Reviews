Natürlich geht es nicht das man nach 3 Sek. schon von der Schulter ist aber diese länge die man Wiggeln muss ist einfach extrem lang.","timestamp_created":1615822933,"timestamp_updated":1615822933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88486583","author":{"steamid":"76561198321466821","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":57653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45754,"last_played":1656005644},"language":"english","review":"very cool","timestamp_created":1615822643,"timestamp_updated":1615822643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88486476","author":{"steamid":"76561197978895775","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":7518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1616667807},"language":"german","review":"It´s very good ^^","timestamp_created":1615822534,"timestamp_updated":1615822534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88486439","author":{"steamid":"76561199123946442","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":176034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":982,"playtime_at_review":173965,"last_played":1660129604},"language":"english","review":"Before this day I've had an amazing review written at 31h which said how much I enjoyed this game.\nAnd I really did. Now I have 3k hours, and it's time to admit - this game has stopped making me happy long time ago and at least a thousand hours were played only due to addiction and friends.\nFor some of you, this game might seem just a competitive horror survival. To me, it was a source. A tool to find friends and distract myself from a heavy depression. \nIt all started on 2021 may, I bought this game, doubting if I will end up liking it.\nA friend who told me about DBD played a few matches with me and was gone for a while.\nSo until I reached 300h, I was solo queuing like a champion. And to me, the first 500-700h will remain the best forever. I met a friend at about 300h who showed me the new sides of this game - you can \"loop\" the killers, outplay and outsmart them, using pallets and vaults \nand you know, it made the experience even more exciting than hiding in a bush 2 inches away from a killer and hearing your own heartbeat louder than the game sounds.\nGaining experience in chases and learning perks and its value (or uselessness) we build a nice friendship and started playing together almost every day. \nBut that's not really important, I know. The matchmaking before the rank system update wasn't perfect, I suppose. But the game was at least enjoyable as much as for the killer, as for survivor. If you were a bushette - you would never get to red ranks, which at the time was kinda competitive arena. So you were matched rather with people who know what they're doing, or rather toxic Neas/Aces with flashlights. No Bushettes and baby Bills. NOED campers and insidious bubbas would never get past 13-10 ranks as the kills they get wouldn't be rewarded even if it's a 4k.\nAfter they announced this new matchmaking system, it was an upside down, and the never ending circle has begun. You can't always escape, of course. But due to having base mmr, killers who usually rely on noed, hook-trade and camping got matched with the rest of the world, instead of their usual newbies and Bushettes. Which created this circle - if you're not 4 man swf\nyou're alone against this killer.\nWhich stopped making the game balanced and fair, cause however high your skills are, you always rely on your team. Even if you're good at chase, you need team to fix gens. Which random Bushettes refuse to do - they better sniff bushes and open chests. So at the end you die, because:\n1. You got tunneled because that random Meg ran away after farming you.\n2. You got facecamped cuz killer was dumb, and you ran him for 5 gens, but the team with 0 hooks refuses to unhook you, they gotta buttdance at the gates.\n3. You happened to be chased as second or third person and all the pallets were dropped tho the match has only started. I'm not saying they shouldn't have used them. It's just you kinda need to make the best of it, because you have other teammates.\n4. You were doing gens, but your team were babies, and they died at 4 gens because killer wasn't a baby.\nSee? Of course, sometimes you would get matched with normal people and have sixty escapes in a row. But as I said, tunneling and camping became rewarded. \nNow, killers usually cry about survivors having meta builds. Have you tried playing survivor without meta build? I mean, surely you can, but meta increases your chances to survive. Killers who have meta builds, especially those who overuse certain perks because it fits their killer style, don't think that they're doing something wrong. But survivors do, somehow.\nYou actually need to rely on so many things while playing this game, no matter which side you chose: ping, constant motherf*cking rubber banding, perks that for some reason don't work as they should, steam motherf*cking maitenance that got you 1 million hours ban, idiotic cosmetic choices for your favorite characters, Kate f*cking Densons new f*cking ugly a*s face, stan me if you saw Trappers broken leg, Jill Valentine who ate f*cking bees for like two months (TWICE), Claire who looks like a forty y.o midget with drug addiction, Attack on Titan misery collection, stupid killers like Artist, Trickster and Cenobite, and etc etc etc.\nI've been playing as both killer and survivor. I mean, look at my achievements, I'm not a baby killer. DH, BT, DS and IW never made me much trouble and I didn't cry to my mama or broke my keyboard over perks in the game, nor losing the game. Empowering killers who tunnel you out of the game is one of the dumbest sh*t this game ever witnessed. Nerfing meta either, even if you nerfed killer's perks. It's not equal. They don't even need those motherf*cking perks now, you know? I wrecked 4 man swf party with over 1k hours on a motherf*cking trapper with one perk equipped - brutal strengh. Without the need to camp or tunnel. Are you kidding me? Bringing BT to a basekit is such a f*cking pathetic move, this game exists for 6 years now, yet devs decided to bring this to action at 6.1.0 update which made survivor solo gameplay unberable. What are you pathetic p*ssies afraid of? Campers and tunnelers (decent 90% of killer mains) leaving the game because it'd have something to prevent it? First match after update landed, I played solo, and you f*cking know what? Random Yui left 90% gen we worked on (we had ruin ok) because her godd@mn spine chill went on, so I got hit. Pressing new DH didn't get me much of anything - I got clapped in the middle of the animation. So they did unhook me. Killer went after me, and I've run him for 4 gens. Dropped 0 pallets. Those apes didn't bother to heal me or take hits, tho they were nearby. Amazing and rewarding match.\nAlso, can we talk about how really rewarding and community based this game is? Because it's so not. We don't f*cking need yo stupid charms and free bloodpoints. Even Fortnite is doing better. For god's sake, even Roblox. When devs are sorry for something they give you 100k BP that you can earn in a few matches, yay woo fantastic giveaway. I'm not asking for free stuff, but are you for real. BP and charms. I see. \nAnyhow. In conclusion, it's sad and really heartbreaking for me to let go of my favorite game. Memories created, people I met - they will remain with me (or not). But the pain from realization that my favorite game does not bring me joy anymore because of what devs have done to it would never be eased. This is goodbye, Dead by Daylight. Thank you for moments you gave me, and for the most beautiful person I could ever wish to meet.\n","timestamp_created":1615822505,"timestamp_updated":1658272904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49824562668800354","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88486346","author":{"steamid":"76561198112638971","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":19397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8980,"last_played":1659228887},"language":"spanish","review":"para

game is highly addictive with interesting mechanics and gameplay. It is packed with tense moments and the key is obviously to make good decisions. I see myself spending a ton of more hours on this game BUT, and there is a big but too... The game is not only kinda glitchy and acts wierd at times, but certain perks, hitboxes and killers are just unbalanced or in some cases even broken. I've been playing with a couple of friends who are way better than me and have tons more experience, and one of the things they keep telling me is that the survivors have the advantage, but honestly.... certain add ons and hitboxes just makes it ridiculous at points, and i just lose all motivation to even try. I swear Freddie Kruegers hitbox is the most broken thing ever, so honestly until they fix all these issues, it's a downvote from me. BUT! It is a really good game at its core, and addictive, but can be overly infuriating at times which makes it.. kinda not worth it.\n\n\nEDIT: I've been playing this game for almost 100 hours now and i gotta say the amount of problems with this game keeps getting more and more evident... I've been practicing dodging against killers non stop now and have almost mastered looping at this point but man... It does not fucking matter how much time and effort you put in with these broken hitboxes. The huntress throws axes with the hitbox of a fucking truck, victor can lunge himself at you with guess what? The hitbox of a FUCKING TRUCK! And some killers just hit you regardless of how good you are at dodging, as if they have some sort of 360 radius on their hits or some bs. I've come across killers who way to many times now seem to almost lock on to your movements when they strike, as if they are almost charging forward like the god damn demogorgon. It is complete BS when freddie krueger is in a chase with you but then suddenly charges you at the speed of fucking sound with his hit even though it would look like you have a fairly safe distance beetween each other. \n\n\nAlso! The game in no way shape or form punishes camping killers. I've played too many games at this point where the killers just straight up refuse to leave the hooks, which ruins all the fun for that particular player, but also just gives the other survivors a huge disatvantage by not even giving us a chance! And the game does nothing about this! Basically if you WANT to be an ass, you totally can no problem, and it does not punish killers for targetting a single survivor either. Just now i probably played my like 100th game where the killer actively decides to target ME specificelly or someone else just because why not! And that is EVEN if there are litterally 3 other survivors there that they could go after, but nope! Let's ruin the game for this ONE specific player and not give a damn. \n\n\nNow these are the key negative factors i could think of at the moment, BUT! The game is still highly addictive and super fun to play with friends, and if you happen to come across a fair killer, then the game instantly becomes more fun for everyone. \n\n\nThere is one thing i appreciate about this games balancing system! Even if you die in a match, you can still go up in rank and gain tons of bloodpoints based on how much you've contributed to the match. Basically unlike many other games, it notices some of your potential and accomplishments, and actually rewards you for it. This is where targetting and camping killers become a huge issue though... The game does not realize that this is entirely out of your control. If you get singled out and die right away with shit stats, the game does not care, you WILL get deranked and barely earn bloodpoints (the currency of the game). So if you just happen to be unlucky and run into a killer that hates you and wants to ruin your day, then well the game ain't gonna stop them :') \n\n\nI still really like how diverse this game is. There really are a ton of different directions you can take in building your character with different perks, items and addons. Some perks are obviously better than others, but you can make the use of most perks in my opinion, it really depends on the way you communicate with your teammates and how you play. There are tons of different cool combinations you could do with your perks and items, which is really appreciated, even though i see a lot of people on the internett claiming that most perks are useless, which i can see to some extent, granted i am still relatively new to the game. Overall with the right people and right \"conditions\" i guess, the game is super fun! Glitchy and definately flawed, but super fun! But as mentioned before, if you get singled out, the game does NOT care and your game could be ruined. I guess if you feel like you are having a shitty day, you could allways play custom matches with friends. \n\n\nAt this point i really feel that the negatives outweigh the positives, so it is still a no from me. DO NOT buy this game in its current state. Wait until they balance it out more and fix these issues.","timestamp_created":1615820324,"timestamp_updated":1616779550,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527214944362640381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88484216","author":{"steamid":"76561197978071432","num_games_owned":830,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":142535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2236,"playtime_at_review":81030,"last_played":1660483851},"language":"spanish","review":"basura","timestamp_created":1615819756,"timestamp_updated":1642984005,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88484114","author":{"steamid":"76561198264850168","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2201,"last_played":1630757023},"language":"schinese","review":"上树模拟器","timestamp_created":1615819634,"timestamp_updated":1615819634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88483929","author":{"steamid":"76561198063462543","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":59104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41865,"last_played":1656676096},"language":"polish","review":"Gra

back to this game after 3 months, this is what I learned:\nPros:\n-Good concept and stories for killers (with a few exceptions)\n-Susie looks absolutely incredible\nCons:\n-Game devs are insistent on fixing things that aren't broken and fuck what was once an incredible UI\n-Face camping is aokay, the devs won't read your reports anyway\n-The devs temporary ban you for leaving a game you already died in because someone face camped you\n-So insistent on fixing \"graphics quality\" that everyone already has on low, that the game is now literally unplayable on the lowest possible graphics setting. (Low 65%)\n-The devs like skins more than balancing things for the player base\n-Auric cell economy is actual garbage\n-I have to spend 30 minutes to get into a lobby that people will either immediately leave, troll in, or someone will get screwed by the 3 player glitch\n-I still don't know why there's no compensation for the 3 player glitch yet, you have 4 generators for KYF, just add in code to check for it. It's been so long, just GIVE A SHIT\n-Steam will not let me refund this piece of cancer\n-100/5 stars, go buy a happy meal at McDonald's.
