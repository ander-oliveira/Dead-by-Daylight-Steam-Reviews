starts with a new player discovering Dead by Daylight for the first time.\n\nAt first, there's so much to learn, and the game is so full of potential, since it's a one-of-a-kind game with such an unique asymmetrical style of gameplay. There's so many different characters and perks, all the characters have unique designs and mechanics. And the cosmetics look stunning! All locked off in the market, of course, but the free skins and characters are still cool!\n\nIn the first few matches, the player experiences the thrill of the hunt- being chased or chasing down survivors. It's bloodpumping. It's exciting! And when they win a match, it's almost liberating.\n\nThen after a few hours of the game, the initial excitement begins to wear off. The player becomes smarter and realizes that their teammates aren't exactly optimal in most of their time. More of the killer matches they play begin to culminate in losses or ties. This realization slowly builds into frustration. After their frustration begins to build up into bottled anger, and after that? Everything feels more annoying. Irritating. Now their \"inexperienced teammates\" become \"useless noobs\", and \"experienced survivors\" become \"bully squads\" and \"toxic meta players\". \n\nOf course, the player calms down a bit and then comes to one of the two possible conclusions: 1) This game is toxic and maybe they shouldn't play, or at least take a break. 2) Maybe it's just because they don't have a good character or set of perks.\n\nSo of course, they then look towards the alluring market and use real money to buy a new killer or survivor.\n\nThe cycle repeats: the player gets a rush of excitement in playing a new character, then slowly builds up frustration as the excitement wears off until they decide they need to buy a new character to enjoy the game... all until when there are finally no more new characters to buy.\n\nExcept, oh wait! There will ALWAYS be more! Because the devs realize that their source of income is not through maintaining a balanced game and listening to the community, but by releasing more skins and characters through DLC packs! \n\nAnd the cycle continues- a cycle of naivety, frustration, toxicity, and addiction that preys on gaining new players and locking them in.","timestamp_created":1651771555,"timestamp_updated":1656688198,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114996509","author":{"steamid":"76561199015807521","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2997,"last_played":1658330422},"language":"english","review":"very good game yeees","timestamp_created":1651770683,"timestamp_updated":1651770683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114996285","author":{"steamid":"76561198449202069","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":23,"playtime_at_review":1220,"last_played":1659853210},"language":"english","review":"Incredible game, fun and very frustrating at the same time lmao","timestamp_created":1651770412,"timestamp_updated":1651770412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114996245","author":{"steamid":"76561198979637148","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":47994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":283,"playtime_at_review":42239,"last_played":1660230005},"language":"french","review":"Le concept du jeu est intéressant, et du contenu nouveau et plutôt varié est ajouté régulièrement, ce qui est un bon point.
