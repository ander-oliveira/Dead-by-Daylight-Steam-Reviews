I highly recommend you use discord or a voice chat system, though half of the fun is playing (and getting good) with randoms you can only point at. Getting into a community discord can be really helpful too because there is a lot to learn about the game.\n\nIf you have no friends, don't worry, like me you can go around and try to kill everyone who does have friends with what is a broadly over powered monster. (Huntress is probably a good learning one.)\n\nWhile it is a 'horror' game in aesthetic, lore (oh boy is there tons of lore), and even gameplay style (powerless survivors) - I really like to judge it as if it were attempting to be a \"Stealth-Genre Multiplayer\" game. As a survivor your job is to be out of sight or, whenever they eventually find you (and they will), to get out of sight. You've got to really use your wits as you attempt to complete generators, unlock chests for important items, or cleanse totems.\n\nAll the characters play broadly in a specific role based on the unique perks they get. Meg is a runner, she is supposed to kite and distract the killer. Claudette heals and supports well. Dwight is a beast when it comes to gen repair and teamwork. But you can mix and match these 'unique' perks after enough time to get them teachable to any other character.\n\nA last few things:\n\nFirst, I want to say that you get no shortage of good or fun killers with the base game, don't be afraid to get the base game. This is the version I bought (along with the Silent Hill DLC pack). Of course if a sale were on I'd highly recommend the Large Game Bundle (right now I believe its marketed as the Silent Hill Bundle) as that comes with a ton of DLC.\n\nSecond, there is in-game progression for perks and items you can bring along. As a survivor you lose any items you die with (I still always would recommend bring a health kit for newbies, only way you can self heal). If you want to mix and match playstyles you'll need to get a character to a certain level and unlock their teachable perks.\n\nLastly, while all original survivors/killers are available through their in-game store and w/ in-game progression points, any character from another franchise MUST be bought due to licensing issues. (On sale they can be quite worth it, but if you're a fan you might just find them worth it!)","timestamp_created":1609169856,"timestamp_updated":1609169856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83397246","author":{"steamid":"76561199080122049","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":83891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":830,"playtime_at_review":11878,"last_played":1660251564},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1609169725,"timestamp_updated":1609169725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486401736736297607","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83397201","author":{"steamid":"76561198808761714","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1609176304},"language":"russian","review":"Хуета","timestamp_created":1609169689,"timestamp_updated":1609169689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83397125","author":{"steamid":"76561197979372845","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1612720240},"language":"german","review":"Ich spiele dieses Game ausschließlich als Surviver weil ich habe leider kein sadistisches interesse andere Menschen zu jagen und zu quälen!

by daylight 4v1 asimetrik bir korku oyunu. Oyunda 4 survivor, 1 killer var. Survivorlar haritadaki jeneratörleri tamir ederek kapıyı açıp kaçmaya çalışıyor. Killer ise survivorların jeneratör tamir etmelerini engellemeye ve yakaladığını asarak öldürmeye çalışıyor. Survivorların 2 kere asılma hakkı var. Asılanları takım arkadaşları kurtarabiliyor. 3 kere asılan ölüyor. Killer'a vurayım döveyim öldüreyim yok. Cs go, zula, wolfteam değil bu oyun. Hayatında cs go dışında oyun oynamamışlar ve kurtlar vadisini 1289465 kere izlemiş düz tipleri sarmaz. O oyuncu profilini anlatabildim mi? Profile polat alemdar fotosu koyan tipler. Onlar zaten ölene kadar dust 2 oynamaya devam etsin.\n\nHem survivor hem katil cephesinde farklı karakterler var. Doğal olarak bu karakterlerin perkleri de farklı. Karakterlerin kimisi ana oyunla beraber geliyor, kimisi ek paketlerle. İsterseniz oyun içi kazandığımız puanlarla ister parayla karakter ve kostüm alabiliyoruz. Hem oyun hem dlc'ler sık sık indirime giriyor. Tavsiyem 12,40 tl iken alın. 31 tl iken almaya değmez mi? Kesinlikle değer ama zaten düşecek bir oyuna fazladan para vermeye gerek yok. Artan parayla ek paket alırsınız ama hemen almayın ek paketleri. Önce bir oynayın 50-60 saat. Bakın bakalım beğenecek misiniz. Çok nadir beğenmeyen insan gördüm. Bu oyun cidden bir başka arkadaşlar. Türünün eşsiz bir örneği. Şahsen bu zevki verecek başka oyunlar aradım ama bulamadım. Sakın benim gibi gaza gelip Friday the 13th: The Game almayın. SAKIN! Oyun hem terkedilmiş hem de ♥♥♥ gibi. DBD'yi (dead by daylight) 7000-8000 saat oynayan insanlar var. 1000 küsür saat oynayanlar gırla zaten. Bilmem bu size bir fikir verir mi? ;)\n\nMümkünse 4 kişi, mümkün değilse 2-3 arkadaş aynı anda alın, aynı anda korkun, aynı anda keşfedin, aynı anda öğrenin. İlla 4 kişi oynamak zorunda değilsiniz. Varsın diğeri yabancı olsun. Diğer bir husus, başlangıçta oyunu bir bilenle oynamanızı tavsiye etmiyorum. Keşfetmenin zevki, büyüsü gidiyor öyle olunca. Tabi bu bence bütün oyunlar için geçerli. Bu oyunu ilk 50 saat akşam karanlıkta ışıkları söndürerek kulaklık ile oynayın. Zaten en zevkli zamanları oyuna ilk başlanan zamanlar. Tadını çıkarın. Peki sonra zevki kaçıyor mu, bıkıyor muyuz? Hayır, ama belli bir süre sonra oyuna alıştığımız için korkmaz oluyoruz. Fakat korku yerine daha başka zevkler devreye giriyor.\n\nİlk başlarda oyunu anlamayacaksınız, katil nasıl beni buldu diye şaşıracaksınız. Merak etmeyin oyunun 20'den 1'e olmak üzere bir rank sistemi var. Yeni oynayanlar rank 20'den başlıyor. Ustalaştıkça rank 1'e yükseliyorsunuz. Siz rank 20 iken katil de rank 20 veya 19 gelecek. Yani o da oyunu bilmiyor olacak, o da sizin gibi öğrenme aşamasında olacak. Sakın sıkılıp kızıp bırakmayın. Zamanla oynaya oynaya öğreniyorsunuz. Öğrenmekte acele etmeyin. Gidip bir sürü rehber okumayın. Aceleniz yok. Korkmaya ve zevk almaya geldiniz :)\n\nDiğer incelemelerde sık sık katillerin face camp attığını okuyorum. Öncelikle sizi temin ederim böyle bir şey yok. Katiller sürekli face camp atmıyor. 100 oyunun bazen 3'ünde bazen 5'inde denk gelirsiniz. Bazen de 200 oyun denk gelmezsiniz sonra üst üste 15 oyun denk gelir ondan sonra da diğer kullanıcılar gibi sürekli facecampciler varmış gibi yorum yaparsınız o sinirle. Tamamen şans işi. Bug konusunda ise oynamaya engel bir durum yok. 20 saatte bir tane bug oldu diye çıldıran öfkeli tipler onlar. Sanırsın 5 dk'da bir bug oluyor. Facecamp ve bug, oyunu almaya kesinlikle ama kesinlikle engel değil.\n\n(Facecamp : katilin yakaladığı survivorın başında beklemesi, beklediği için de diğer survivorların asılmış survivorı kurtaramaması. Facecamp'in çözümü jeneratör yapıp kaçmak. Evet böyle yaparak kancadaki survivor'ı ölüme teslim etmiş oluyoruz. Napalım, her zaman 4 survivor'ın 4'ü de kaçacak diye bir kural yok.)\n\nOyun çok eski pc'lerde randımanlı çalışmıyor. Örneğin 10-11 yıllık pc'niz veya 6-7 yıllık laptop'unuz varsa grafiklerin takılmasından keyif alamayabilirsiniz. Arkadaşımın tecrübesinden hareketle fx 6200 işlemci, hd7870 ekran kartında ayarları kısarak takılmadan çalıştığını söyleyebilirim. Bir diğer arkadaşın laptopta i5 8. nesil işlemci, geforce mx 150 ekran kartı ile ayarları kısarak oynuyordu. Başta oyun sorunsuz çalışırken kısa bir süre sonra laptop çok ısınıp mangal yapacak hale geliyormuş. Ama ben bu incelemeyi yazdıktan sonra büyük bir güncelleme gelir de çalışmazsa bilemem. Gördüğünüz gibi elimdeki işlemci-ekran kartı veri tabanım oldukça geniş :)\n\nGerçekten herkesin DBD tecrübesini yaşamasını isterim. Hani bazı oyunlar vardır ya ölmeden önce bir tatmak istersiniz, işte DBD de öyle bir oyun.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609167454,"timestamp_updated":1609167454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.703366577625274658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83394459","author":{"steamid":"76561199111663610","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1655570363},"language":"english","review":"very fun but very scary lol","timestamp_created":1609167386,"timestamp_updated":1609167386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83394395","author":{"steamid":"76561199092419139","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8954,"last_played":1611777326},"language":"english","review":"A great game with a lot of issues.","timestamp_created":1609167342,"timestamp_updated":1609167342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83394145","author":{"steamid":"76561199084101395","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":247,"playtime_at_review":19610,"last_played":1660196249},"language":"russian","review":"Балдеж","timestamp_created":1609167133,"timestamp_updated":1609167133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83394104","author":{"steamid":"76561198419595868","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":48073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17380,"last_played":1644697624},"language":"schinese","review":"欢乐农庄，玩了就知道","timestamp_created":1609167095,"timestamp_updated":1609167095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83393923","author":{"steamid":"76561199045746774","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":398,"last_played":1642812279},"language":"english","review":"Very Fun Survival Game, But If You Like Free Roam Or PvP Survival, Try Rust!!!","timestamp_created":1609166956,"timestamp_updated":1609166956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83393515","author":{"steamid":"76561198804308585","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1657093418},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunun içinde fazla zaman geçirmesemde oynadığım vakitlerde gerçekten eğlenceli ve zaman öldüren bir oyundu, arakdaş grubunuz varsa ve oyun arıyor iseniz bu oyunu almanızı şiddetle tavsiye ederim.

I really do. I've never felt such a love-hate relationship with a game before. \n\nThe bloodweb system is very addicting in my opinion. Earning and spending bloodpoints is satisfying as hell. But bloodpoints come in very VERY small amounts, so much that any double bloodpoint event feels like a godsend. Luckily they have challenges to earn bloodpoints however. This is easily one of the most appealing parts of the game. It gives you a goal, and it feels rewarding. I don't personally own the 'premium' battle pass, and, as much as I wish I could earn more cosmetics for free instead of paying for the premium pass, the shards you earn are enough to scratch that itch temporarily. \n\nHowever, as much as I find the grind strangely addicting and satisfying, the gameplay itself is enough to take you to a dark place. \n\nAs someone that recently decided to solely play killer, 95% of my games I feel like someone's plaything. I can't remember the last time I exited the game and felt \"that was fun\". If you're lucky enough to not be blinded for the majority of the match by 3 survivors bringing flashlights, you'll be bullied at the exit gate. You'll be pointed at, teabagged, and most likely laughed at. I can understand wanting to celebrate a win after a match that took forever, or a match you barely escaped from, but SO many people take advantage of their guaranteed win and make sure you KNOW that you've lost. \n\nI probably sound like a snowflake, but I've encountered this with a hell of a lot of survivors. They're always waiting to feed their ego in whatever way they can. Not only that, but the devs' priorities are whack. Instead of fixing near enough game-breaking bugs, they'll add new cosmetics and look at you with sad puppy eyes, in the hope you'll forget. Instead of fixing their matchmaking system, they'll release a new unfinished killer. I'm not even angry. I'm just disappointed, because it's really addicting if you can get past all of that. But you can't.\n\nOverall, playing survivor is boring (for me personally) and playing killer is a recipe for toxicity and being straight-up bullied by people who shouldn't even be matched with you in the first place. You're probably thinking \"well you can't fix how the players act\", but if these things were somehow fixed, or the game at least encouraged a more positive community, this game could be a blast. But sadly I don't think it'll ever get there. And it's sad.","timestamp_created":1609165260,"timestamp_updated":1609372581,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574988603591918945","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83391482","author":{"steamid":"76561198438398518","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":17854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3644,"last_played":1659390943},"language":"german","review":"gardenn soUp","timestamp_created":1609164927,"timestamp_updated":1610755039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83391086","author":{"steamid":"76561198936391687","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":18429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1643774883},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1609164589,"timestamp_updated":1609164589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83391075","author":{"steamid":"76561199032109986","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1652601637},"language":"english","review":"I love this game so much!

It is one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played. The match-making is quick, the controls are easy, the game itself is fun and simple to learn, but requires real determination to escape the killer or to sacrifice/kill all the survivors. My nagging issue with this game is that it is easy for new players to be paired with high level players and that can create an unbalanced climate. However, this rarely occurs and while being annoying, it is easy to get over. The amount of variation each character has is fantastic. Each killer and survivor having their own unique perks and perks which counter other perks. This game is graphically stunning and is fairly simple to run. There is no pay to win aspect in this game as most characters or skills can be unlocked through gameplay.  Overall, I would rate this game a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1609162801,"timestamp_updated":1609162801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83388574","author":{"steamid":"76561198846230799","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1301,"last_played":1658170523},"language":"italian","review":"Per chi ama il multiplayer ed il genere horror, questo gioco è perfetto.","timestamp_created":1609162372,"timestamp_updated":1609162372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83388473","author":{"steamid":"76561198049458879","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1609183380},"language":"polish","review":"petardzioszka","timestamp_created":1609162274,"timestamp_updated":1609162274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83388023","author":{"steamid":"76561198168379882","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":49,"playtime_at_review":2970,"last_played":1660050282},"language":"hungarian","review":"naon vices par baratal megjob, sok a kocsog de jo a jatek, vanak csalok de nekik megolom az anyjukat is.","timestamp_created":1609161888,"timestamp_updated":1609161888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83387842","author":{"steamid":"76561198007866042","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1649362445},"language":"polish","review":"If you like to fear in realistic game just play it !","timestamp_created":1609161724,"timestamp_updated":1609161724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhurg1PYCctyMvgI="}
