Why aren't they included for free? 3 extra bucks for all the original killers is wayyyy too much ontop of the original price tag.\n-Some perks are very OP and can only be unlocked if you have DLC characters or if you find them on the shrine\n\nEven with all those complaints, I really am enjoying this game.

brightness setting for the game, my tv is an older model and so the brightness will reset after 10 mins so i can be playing fine but half way in a game and the screen goes near pitch black and i have

You will either get decimated by no ed with a bunch of sheed survivors or get bullied by a team of sweaty red rank swfs. Ther is no enjoyment to be had here. At its absolute best on the survivor side you hold down your mouse for like 3 minutes and the game is over. There is no content. There is no gameplay loop. Its like you pay money for a game to get the ability to be a minion that the killer gets to kill with no counter play. When people first play this game and ask how they are supposed to get away from a killer and you explain that its literally impossible its hilarious how many people instantly realize what a terrible game this is. Killer is more fun but still hilariously boring. There is almost no interesting things that can even happen. You wonder around with op perks from killers  you have to buy to maybe find a random survivor caught out and then you click. Thats the whole game. OSRS has significantly more engaging combat and gameplay mechanics and that game was was with wood and play dough.","timestamp_created":1626124045,"timestamp_updated":1626124045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95625418","author":{"steamid":"76561198873672000","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":676,"last_played":1626379201},"language":"english","review":"*Blink* Hello, time to have your bones sawed, get thrown on a hook and be pulled to the heavens by the almighty Entity!

On the other hand, I wish I could've given more praise to this game overall. So, where do we begin? I guess we'll get the obvious crap out of the way.\n\n- Overview:\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game. Specifically, a 4 (survivors) versus 1 (killer). The survivors must work together to complete 5 of 7 generators on the map, which powers an exit gate, which you must then open to escape. The killer's job is to kill survivors (gee, who knew?) and preventing them from working on generators. The aforementioned killing part consists of putting a survivor on meat hooks 1-3 times. Simple, right? Well, not really, but that explanation will come later. While I normally just advise people to purchase a game, try it for ~2 hours and refund it if possible, this game is one of the few exceptions where I would highly recommend not going into this game blind AT ALL and base your purchase on gameplay footage and reviews (admittedly, if you're going to do that, that's probably why you're here in the first place). With that out of the way, let's dive into what about Dead By Daylight forms the basis of this review.\n\n- The Good:\nDead by Daylight is the current star in this asymmetrical horror multiplayer genre. Where other games have tried and failed to make their mark, Dead by Daylight has not only outlived, but in some ways outperformed the former competition. Matches can rarely play out the same way, with over 20 unique killers (some licensed from well known IPs and franchises, others of Behaviour Interactive's own design) each with their own relatively unique power that can influence their playstyles, and each player (survivor and killer) is capable of bringing 4 perks (auxiliary abilities, essentially) that can wildly change matches as well as quickly end or greatly extend match times. For the most part, matches will be fun and should almost always never play out the same way. \n\n\"(some licensed from well known IPs and franchises, others of Behaviour Interactive's own design)\" To further elaborate on this, no other game has adapted literal horror icons in both cinema and video game history as well as Dead by Daylight has. It's a common meme to joke about how Bill Overbeck and Quentin Smith can save Cheryl Mason by blinding the Demogorgon with a flashlight on Gideon Meat Plant. And with the latest addition of Resident Evil, it doesn't seem like the game is going to slow down any time soon. \n\nIn terms of atmosphere, those first 100 or so hours can really make you tense and afraid, especially when you have no idea what each killer does. Killer designs can be frightening in different ways, and I still find myself a bit scared when going against some killers. The art design in this game is great. Default killer outfits are certainly good, and cosmetics offer customization of both outfits (and in the case of killers, weapons as well). Outfits are inspired and can look very different, even on the same killer. It's safe to say that the general community has no issue with the work of the art team of Dead by Daylight. Visual fidelity in general is pretty good in this game. There are some hiccups here and there, but as of the writing of this review, even old face models for both survivor and killer are getting reworked to more modern standards. \n\nYou can play with friends! That's a plus for some people.\n\n- The Bad:\nHoo, where do I even begin? Like many multiplayer match based games (or just games in general, now that I think about it) there's a progression system, and this one is...rather extensive. There are currently 27 survivors and 24 killers. Each character comes with 3 unique perks that, when you level up that respective character to a certain point, can be taught to other characters. Each character can be levelled up to a maximum 50, and can rest their level 3 times to obtain a slightly altered cosmetic set. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. This is where the beginning of my many disappoints with this game start.\n\nPerks are auxiliary abilities both killers and survivors are able to bring to a match, up to 4 perks per player. Many players bring perks to make up for their preferred character's shortcomings, to gain an advantage over the other side, or to have fun. Each perk, regardless of whether they belong to survivors or killers, have 3 tiers that make its effects increase with each tier. There are also general perks for each side that you don't have to get other characters for. With over 170 perks total, you do the math and you're looking at quite the grind. This is only exacerbated with how these perks are actually acquired. \n\nIntroducing: The Bloodweb, essentially the skill tree in Dead by Daylight that allows you to gain perks, as well as other items, but we'll touch on those later. You can clear bloodwebs by investing bloodpoints, which you accrue over time by performing well in matches. Each time you clear a bloodweb, all the items on that bloodweb refresh, including perks. I should also mention this is how you advance perk tiers. At lower levels, the amount of bloodpoints you acquire per match is perfectly reasonable. You can easily clear 2 or 3 bloodwebs if you do extremely well...if you play killer. If you play survivor, well, tough luck. Your bloodpoint gains pale in comparison, often through no fault of your own. At level 30 and higher, you can't even clear 1 bloodweb with one match's worth of bloodpoints, regardless of what role you play. Again, 170 perks total. 3 tiers each. This system worked fine when there were only maybe 50 or so perks total. It made sense to have tiers as a way to make sure people don't steamroll all of the available content when the game was much, much smaller. That's not the case today. The issue is not the content, but rather the way the game drip feeds it to you despite the amount of matches you play. And this problem will get worse as more killers and survivors are added into the game. For the people who buy every DLC (not me), it can feel like the game is punishing you with this insane, insurmountable grind.\n\nMoving onto meta, everyone's favorite discussion I'm sure. Of the 170 perks total, you'll maybe see around ~25 perks regularly ran on killer side, and even fewer on survivor. Despite constant requests to change the meta, to buff weaker killers, weaker perks, and nerf stronger, more oppressive ones, they've remained stagnant. Bugs that showed up years ago are still present, and new bugs are added with each new patch or DLC Chapter release. There are probably still bugs in the game, some of which are game breaking. There are probably still bugs as of you reading this review. Did I mention the possibility of bugs being present in the game yet? Because there might be bugs still in the game. It's clear that Behaviour cares about this game, it's evident with how they've wonderfully remained as loyal as possible to licensed additions to their game, but their passion is misguided. \n\nMany mechanics in this game remain unexplained or barely mentioned at best. Even simple numerical values are rejected in favor of describing them as \"slightly\", \"moderately\", \"considerably\", and \"tremendously\". These phrases aren't standard across perks either. \"Moderately\" on one killer's addons might be a \"slightly\" on another killer. There's rarely any noticeable consistency.\n\nWhile I understand that different departments handle different aspects of the game, it's hard to accept that when you see vastly more cosmetics more often than you do see bug fixes.\n\nTLDR: I cannot recommend this game to you in good conscience. Had you asked me 500 hours ago, this would've been an easy thumbs up. Not so much now, unless you either A) are extremely goal drive, or B) have all the time in the world.
