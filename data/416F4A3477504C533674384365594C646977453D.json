Многое время, я решил заглянуть в ДБД опять, посмотреть, изменилось ли что-нибудь с моего последнего визита. \nИ.. Что я могу сказать, чёрт подери да!\nКонечно, многие проблемы остались, но разработчики решили \"Обойти\" их, найдя им интересные решения.\nНачнём, конечно-же, с убийц. Как и было раньше, первые часы для вас будут лёгким бризом, вы будете гнобить Выживших и прочее и прочее. Однако-же, когда против вас пойдут более опытные выжившие, вы заметите что игра становится сложнее и нечестнее! Если раньше вы не имели выхода а были вынуждены смирится со своей судьбою, на данный момент каждая способность убийц получила более высокий \"Потолок скилла\", что означает что почти каждая способность может контрить почти всё, главное научится ею играть. Игра превратилась из симулятора бегания вокруг досок в симулятор практики, что не есть плохо. Много неприятных механник ( Вроде мнгновенно ослепления ) были убраны, многие багы пофикшены, а если нет, фиксятся и по сей день.\nИгра за Сурвов, впрочем, особо не изменилась. Несмотря на то что Убийцы получили много чего нового, для сурвов как была так и осталась тактика - Бегай вокруг досок. Мета ( Лучшие перки ) не поменялась, тактики остались прежними. Для оригинальных сурвов появились новые перки, позволяющие проверять интересные стратегии, но на высоких-средних рангах они отпадают как ненужные. Баланс сохраняется, Баги фиксятся, но нового особо ничего нет - Вы сами вынуждены делать свою игру разнообразной ( Что, конечно, не является плохим, но блен D: ).\n\nВ общем :\nГеймплей : Как всегда зависит от стороны. За Убийц - от 5 до 10, зависит от вас и от вашего убийцы ( хнык-хнык, бафните фредди D: ). За Сурвов - От 6 до 9, опять-же, зависит от вас. Соблюдая мету плохо вам не будет, но заскучает.\nЛокализация : 8/10, как всегда, перевод неплохой.\nБаланс : 7/10, обе комманды сбалансированны, но есть определённые убийцы/меты которые полностью переворачивают его ( Медсестра ( ака нюрса) , например )\nЛор ( ака история ) : 5/10.

Why release updates to an unfinished and broken game, when instead we can release paid dlc and shove it down the troats of every customer? Instead of fixing known issue they simply add more content as dlc, then nerf that content, and continue pumping out killers and survivors. What amazes me even more is that this policy existed back when this game was still in early access. Back when any addition to the game shouldn't be locked behind a paywall, this of course excludes cosmetic items. However, to add content to a broken game for a PRICE and also ignoring the issues preventing many users from enjoying the game is one of the most backwards and insane policies imanginable. If the devs were to simply focus on the conent they have already produced and turned dbd into an enjoyable experience then the results would not only be a better game, but a more profitable one as well. If a game manages to do what it sets out to do correctly and produces something of value, while not instantaniously being profitable, is a much better idea in the long term. But the devs are too focused of making short, quick cash by adding new features before fixing the old ones. I used to love this game back when it came out, as instead of focusing on dlc they did try to fix the game, while this experience was short it was much better than any I could have today. In today's matches survivors or killers, depending on which side you are on, both have perks that are very useful, however, when one side complains the devs only response is to nerf the shit out of it until it is utterly useless. Instead of say, balancing the game with perks that could counteract each other the devs decide that everyone only deserves at most, mediocre perks. This of course happens every time they introduce a new dlc character and some new mechanic that only serves as something broken and exploitable due to a complete lack of forethought.\n\nI would rate this game as a 4/10. It has the potential to be closer to an 8/10 but through a sheer lack of responsibility on the part of the devs the game suffers overall as a completely medeocre and often frustrating experience.","timestamp_created":1511126267,"timestamp_updated":1511126267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36633182","author":{"steamid":"76561197989528922","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":15475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2382,"last_played":1567951121},"language":"russian","review":"фиксите сервера,ублюдки","timestamp_created":1511125142,"timestamp_updated":1511125142,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486725658178329468","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36632922","author":{"steamid":"76561198249820308","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2319,"last_played":1615391892},"language":"english","review":"trtr","timestamp_created":1511124414,"timestamp_updated":1511124414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36632631","author":{"steamid":"76561198076584532","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1641159134},"language":"english","review":"Too scary","timestamp_created":1511123769,"timestamp_updated":1511123769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504587173461914063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36631645","author":{"steamid":"76561198282025160","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":29374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12706,"last_played":1630551107},"language":"english","review":"So... Dead by Daylight. I haven't had it for too long, and in all honesty I have a problem. It's an amazing game, and even with all of the horrible facecampers and McDonald wifi-ers, it's still really fun.\n\nPros-\n-Mostly balanced\n-Fun for a long time\n-Has custom lobbies to play against your friends, or with your friends to triumph\n-Very flexible gameplay, can play as killer OR survivor at will (atm killer queue times are taking forever though)\n-Many perks, makes for a lot of fun if you like building perk setups and trying them out (takes a while to get the perks necessary)\n\nCons-\n-Don't get me wrong, you get a lot for $20, but the game is a lot more fun with DLC. the DLC is fairly cheap, and gives you some cool stuff like a new killer and survivor with new perks to boot (personally, I recommend the Halloween DLC; Myers is really good, and Laurie's perks are great)\n-semi-bad community (I've played against a lot of stream snipers, lag switchers, facecampers, etc.)\n-Takes a while to get good. This one is important. a lot of players get rekt because they're noobs. stick with the game. Trust me, it's worth it.\n-Killer is severely underpowered at the moment... hope the devs fix that. honestly survivors have just been getting buff after buff while already bad killers (cough cough freddy) is getting nerfed because low ranks are crying about it. c'mon devs, fix this. how come low rank survivors have more influence then high tier killers?\n\nSo, if you've got extra cash, definitely consider getting this game. I'm pretty sure I got it when it was on sale, but it's definitely worth $20.\n\nGood Luck, Have Fun <3","timestamp_created":1511121011,"timestamp_updated":1511573326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508384168148040771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36631588","author":{"steamid":"76561198091869682","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13884,"last_played":1658820687},"language":"french","review":"Super jeu","timestamp_created":1511120846,"timestamp_updated":1511120846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520419001579284668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36631579","author":{"steamid":"76561198306465138","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":30603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13480,"last_played":1633471259},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é viciante e depois de um tempo você vai começar a gostar.

Whether it be in the iconic neighborhood of Haddonfield from Halloween or the Coal Tower of the Macmillan Estate, the goal for both sides remain the same. Survivors must repair five generators and escape while the killer must sacrifice the survivors to the Entity, a arachnid-like monstrosity of the sky. \n\nThis game is fine-tuned to give you a scare with horrifyingly beautiful graphics and ghastly sounds. Everything in the game is more than adequately detailed, with dark lore to add to your experience. \n\nAlong with that, the overall gameplay in Dead by Daylight is polished for the player's experience. Dead by Daylight has relatively few bugs and those that do exist are rarely gamebreaking. Content in this game is well fleshed-out and no two experiences are ever the same with the numerous combinations of items to take into matches as well as game-changing offerings.\n\nFinally, Dead by Daylight is still being actively worked on by its developers, with Freddy Krueger being released into the fog only last month! (Edit: Now the Spirit has been added and with the huge success of the Hallowed Blight event, another killer is being teased!)\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Dead by Daylight to anyone thinking of purchasing it!","timestamp_created":1511119993,"timestamp_updated":1543300759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36631017","author":{"steamid":"76561198141858328","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":176755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16985,"last_played":1609139019},"language":"english","review":"As much fun as the game is... there are too many flaws to recommend this game.

Glitches (Some profiles have been completely wiped meaning players have lost all there saved Data)\n- Falling though floors OR getting stuck (~happens 1 time for every 50 games)\n4. Survivors that disconnections from Matches (20% of games OR 1 out of 5 games)\n5. Progression is SO SLOW and it got worst.  The number of blood poitns you get after a session has decreased and it only feel slighttly better than a free to play game but not by much. \n\nThe developers care more about DLC sales then fixing the problems of this game.\n\nTIPS:\n1.\tDO NOT buy Teachable Perks unless you are 100% intent on using them with every character.  They will waste space that will prevent you from using perks that you will use. \n2.\tALWAYS use items and offerings in every battle.  You will have enough so do not be afraid to use them.  By the time you get to level 50 you will want to Prestige a character ASAP.  \n3.\tAlways have a level 50 Player to use during matches… (When you Prestige you character goes back to LVL 1 and you lose all your items.) \n4.\tIf you Loop OR Camp – (People will write you death threats on your steam wall…  some of the time it is funny)\n5.\tLAG IS THE TRUE KILLER – if you see RED then do not play OR you will be Dead. \n\n6.\tTOP TIER SURVIVORS: \na.\tCLAUDETTE:  [Self Care Perk]\nb.\tNEA: [URBAN EVASION PERK]\nc.\tWILLIAM \"BILL\" [BORROWED TIME]\nd.\tFENG MIN [LITHE PERK]\ne.\tLAURIE [Decisive Strike Perk]\n\n7.\tTOP TIER KILLERS:  \na.\tNURSE: Hard to master but worth it\nb.\tHILLBILLY: \nc.\tHUNTRESS: Projectiles are the anti-looper\n* THE REST SUCK OR ARE TOO WEAK. \n\nThe truth is that despite that this is one of the most fun I have had an online game...
