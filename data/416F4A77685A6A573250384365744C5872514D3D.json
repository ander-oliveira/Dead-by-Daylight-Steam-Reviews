Zusätzlich zu der furchtbaren Balance in den perks und maps, die davor schon existiert, hat Behavior es geschafft, auch das matchmaking System zu versauen. Durch das neue \"casual\" matchmaking hat das Spiel jegliche Langzeit-Motivation verloren. Dazu bleibt die MMR, die man bekommt, auch nach Monaten Abstinenz bestehen, sodass man nach langer Zeit ohne Dead by Daylight trotzdem noch gegen Killer ran muss, die auf höchstem Niveau spielen.
