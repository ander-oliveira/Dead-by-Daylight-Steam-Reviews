Which, in an asymmetrical game where 4 players are up against a single player is already a fundamentally bad idea, as every survivor being of the same skill level is massively advantageous to them, whereas the lone killer gains nothing from the higher MMR. But of course on top of that, the system is simply completely broken, and you will be matched against people who have played for thousands of hours the moment you purchase the game. Both survivors and killers play the game much more aggressively now, and having anything close to a fun game is essentially completely impossible.","timestamp_created":1466014967,"timestamp_updated":1635017302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23573857","author":{"steamid":"76561197999494448","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1635467029},"language":"english","review":"When playing survivor: Heart is beating, I am scared, my hands are sweating...\n\nKiller: Feel empowered, \"run my little mice RUUUN\" because I will get you :D :D :D\n\nThis game is definitely fun!

First off the game is wondedrful and unique. I love how the developers wanted to capture the essence of human error in the game with both surviving and hunting. As of right now you can play with friends in a private lobby, and not recieve experience, but the devs. have said they are going to add a party system where you and friends can play together in public matches. They just didn't want it on release, and now I am not entirely sure why they would do this, but I am assuming it is because they don't want a premade team of survivors playing against a new killer and then winning by a landslide. They may also want to get the community more willing to talk and communicate with randoms, who knows.

Призрак - вся суть его в том, что когда он в инвизе, полагаться приходится на зрение. Однако каждый раз, когда он прячется, то начинает звенеть бубенцами на всю карту. На этом вся его сложность. Любимая тактика: насадить на крюк и встать в углу невидимым. Всегда говорю \"спасибо\". Потому что в инвизе бить он не может и ты тупо подлетаешь к крюку, начинаешь стаскивать другана. Он пока яйцами позвенит и войдёт в боевой режим, вы уже как тараканы от света разлетелись.\n3. Сельский дурачок с бензопилой - парень, который постоянно, сука, постоянно капает на мозг.

Detta cosi´ il gameplay sembra noioso e ripetitivo ... E INVECE NO.\n\n--------------------Prima di tutto bisogna dire che ---------\n*le mappe non sono mai le stesse , studiarle servirä a poco  (tranne per gli edici , quelli so sempre gli stessi all interno) , quindi ci si troverä sempre in un area con dei pattern sconosciuti e si potrebbe avere alcune difficoltä a trovare i generatori richiesti.\n\n*ad ogni lv up si droppano un sacco di item che vengono spesi a partita , il tuo loot non e´eterno perche´se muori lo perdi definitivamente, ergo ogni scelta  varia il metodo di gioco o le sorti della partita nel meglio  o nel peggio . Ma la soddisfazione nel riuscire a trovare una chest e a portarsi a casa il bottino (scappando ovviamente) e´troppo grande.\nCon questo tipo di meccanica , le situazioni sono imprevedibili , potresti avere un giorno un medikit per curarti , ma avere una cassetta degli attrezzi un altro giorno per riparare in fretta , e la stessa cosa si puo´dire per il killer che puo´essere  piu´veloce a colpirti del solito o piu´silenzioso (tutto grazie a perk e molti oggetti).\n\n*la tensione e´alle stelle , non scherzo , in questo gioco il poco gameplay viene compensato da una grandissima tensione e senso di stress che ti porta a sbagliare . \"meglio andare a destra o a sinistra ? salvare l amico o scappare? piuttosto riparare questo generatore o scappare?\" le scelte non saranno tante , ma lo stress e´abbondante.\n\n*i diversi killer hanno diverse abilitä che li portano ad avere diversi stili di gioco , il che rende il tutto imprevedibile SOPRATUTTO CONTANDO IL FATTO CHE I  4 SOPRAVVISSUTI NON SAPRANNO QUALÉ´ LA CLASSE DEL KILLER FINO A CHE NON LO INCONTRANO. Il trapper usa delle trappole per orsi , uno diventa invisibile e un altro corre come un pazzo agitando una motosega. Il brivido della caccia e´palpabile e ogni sacrificio e´ una soddisfazione tremenda .\n\n-questo gioco va assolutamente giocato con le cuffie , poiche´i killer possono sentire i passi dei sopravissuti , i loro lamenti quando feriti  o le loro sporche manacce trafficare sui generatori.\nE la stessa cosa vale per i sopravissuti che con il battito cardiaco e una musica tetra di sottofondo capirete se siete vicini o lontani dal pericolo .\n\n*grazie ad una patch ora si puo´giocare con alcuni amici in partite con altri giocatori (assassini inclusi) ergo il problema delle attese e´diminuito drasticamente. \n\n\n--------ora le cose negative----------\n\nil sistema delle lobby e´mal costruito e le attese sono un po´fastidiose , dato che qualcuno puo sempre rimanere fermo e non premere accetta .( i dev hanno gia fatto diversi cambiamenti migliorando la situazione )\n\n\nle mappe so 3 , i nemici so 3  e i modi per scappare o uccidere so sempre gli stessi , sinceramente non trovo questo un grosso effetto negativo , ma si puo´ben sperare in qualche futura novitä .\n\nnon aspettateve di poter usare il microfono con degli sconosciuti , i dev non vogliono mettere il voip perche´rovinerebbe l immersione , io sono d accordo comunque con sta cosa ma e´dovere di cronaca avvisare.\n(se mai permetteranno di giocare con degi amici , usare roba come curse voice , steamchat o teamspeak non e´assolutamente vietato anzi e´incoraggiato ).\n\n\n----------------------\n\nQuesto e´ un gioco buono , non ottimo ma decente , non merita piu´di 20 euro ma sicuramente da delle belle emozioni.\nSe siete fan di venerdi´13 potreste provare sto gioco , ma anche no , aspettando l uscita del gioco ufficiale di quel franchise che comunque mostra delle meccaniche ben diverse e molto meglio sviluppate dato che e´ in sviluppo da una societä ben piu´matura ed esperta di questa.\n\nBisogna ricordarsi che gli sviluppatori dietro questo gioco sono giovani e alle prime armi , errori , bugs e altri problemi sono inevitabili , ma io voglio supportarli perche´sono stufo della solita roba e voglio che migliorino.\n\nIl gioco e´piccolo nei contenuti , forte nelle emozioni e ha delle grandi possibilitä in futuro . \n20 euro sono piu´che onesti ; ma a vostro rischio.\n\nvoto 7 / 10 se amate le emozioni come il brivido della paura o della caccia.\n\nSe la ripetitivitä vi stufa e vi arrabbiate facilmente se morite , non prendetelo , perche´e´assai normale che potreste essere spesso i primi a morire ( come il classico stereotipo del ragazzo sfigato nei film trash horror che muore sempre per primo.)\n\n--------\npiccola postilla , \nil gioco di venerdi 13 si presenta con meccaniche molto piu´complesse e ricche , con un jason estremamente piu´ forte dei mostri di sto gioco , con un gioco di tranelli e inganni molto piu´avanzato e molti ma molti piu´ metodi di sterminio di questo. Se vi piace Dead By Daylight potrebbe piacervi Venerdi 13 ma non posso confermare il contrario ,dato che la differenza e´gia ben notabile dalle alpha montage.","timestamp_created":1466010552,"timestamp_updated":1468265145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586936771869659424","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23572718","author":{"steamid":"76561198093777467","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":1589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1352,"last_played":1550991017},"language":"english","review":"Very simple settings, you can't change key binding, simple graphic setting(don't have advanced),...\nmany problem in match making ...\nvery unbalance between hunter and survivors(95% of games hunter win the game maybe more)...\nand many other terrible problems in the core game...\n\nin fact this game is like an alpha version (no beta and no ready for release) ...\ndon't buy the game in current condition and w8 for many patches ...\n","timestamp_created":1466010448,"timestamp_updated":1466010448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48913043737411499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23572685","author":{"steamid":"76561198036339713","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1466008403},"language":"german","review":"Im großen und ganzen finde ich das Game richtig cool.\nDas ist ein für mich neues Spielerlebniss,welches ich so im MP noch nicht kenne.\nAllerdings ist mir die Balance von den jeweiligen Rollen die man spielt zu unfair.\nNicht das ich ein verbesserungsvorschlag hätte,aber ich merke wie schwer es ist zu überleben und vergleichsweise einfach zu jagen.\nSo sollte es jedenfalls nicht sein.\nMöglicherweise ist es auch genau so gewollt,aber mir ist es ehrlich gesagt derzeit etwas zu schwer als überlebender.\nIch würde das Spiel als nicht schlecht bewerten,da es schon für mich gesehen ein lückenfüller für zwischendurch ist.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1466010317,"timestamp_updated":1466010317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23572642","author":{"steamid":"76561198260879122","num_games_owned":431,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1558971167},"language":"english","review":"Bad Review?\nYes, of course.\nWhy?

Bought every DLC, paid for the rift pass, bought some skins to support them.\n\nBut over time it became too obvious that this game needs a shake-up. Yes there's 4 new killers and/or survivors every year with brand new perks (which later becomes a part of the problem and I will explain that in a bit) but the core gameplay remains the same.\n\nThe mediocre matchmaking this game always had did not remedy the situation either. Especially after BHVR introduced dedicated servers and removed the ability to switch regions. You'll be stuck with the same players for the majority of the season with matchmaking being at least slightly diluted during the rank reset week (but at the same time that meant you'll get players that are not on your skill level and the games turn into a clown fiesta). Needless to say that the latest addition to the game - SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) is a complete joke and only made things worse.\n\nCheaters. The game always had problems with them, from perk stacking, to bots, to holding the game hostage and much more - all BHVR's pathetic attemps to curb the rampant cheater problem yielded no results. The EAC does absolutely nothing and at this point I can't even call it anti-cheat software. Reporting system that was half-implemented into the game does absolutely nothing, there is no feedback whether or not a cheater that you've had in your game has been banned or not. Your best option would be to have Steam deal with it by reporting the players profile directly.\n\nSkin factory and the updates. Unfortunately, BHVR's decision to push out 4 major chapters in a year  inevitably lead to problems. Instead of balancing the game like reworking/releasing better maps, making sure that the perks are well tested and not borderline broken - devs are stuck in this \"catch up\" loop that results in community waiting for major fixes and changes for weeks or months before an issue is tackled. And of course I've got to mention the skins - their main source of revenue. People love cosmetics, sure. Even I bought them in my time. But when the devs release cosmetics on almost weekly basis instead of rolling out the improvements to the game - it becomes crystal clear where the focus of the development has shifted.\n\nThe endless pointless grind. For a veteran player it might not be that big of an issue to get the new killer/survivor to P3 all perks, but when you take into consideration someone who just started or are in the middle of their grind journey - you quickly realize just how much perks there is and the pile just keeps growing. It can and I'm sure it is daunting to see the amount of them.

The intensity and the gameplay is awesome. I think it is well developed but i do have one problem. Trying to joni a lobbly is a pain> I would click join lobby it would say waiting, but then nothing would happen afterward.

I look around, viewing hooks caked in the blood of those who were there and have already passed. I look to my immediate right as i manage to stand up, my strength returning. I see a blade made of metal, and remember it from my old life. The same one i crafted out of the metal of my father's mines. I walk through the forest, seeing an old mask lying on a table, i carve it and make it into my own form, i then place it over myself. Understanding my purpose now, i grab a bear trap. I walk into the night and begin to prepare.\n\nNight 2: I notice strange scratches that glow like embers on a wall nearby, i hear the faint breath of another being close by. I follow suit, eventually coming to a red painted locker, i look at it and listen, hearing breaths. This is it. I open the locker- my first victim- splayed out before me, like an offering to the gods. I grab him and drag him from the locker by the throat. I lift him over my shoulder and carry him to one of the hooks, understanding it's purpose, yet not it's function. I place several bear traps around the perimeter and wait in the shadows.\n\nNight 3: My victim long dead, taken up into the night by some strange claws. These claws, this Entity, calls to me. I find more of the strange scratches, yet this time, as i follow, i hear a loud noise and turn to see a light in the distant sky. This will not go unpunished. I hastily make my way to the light, finding tools and various supplies scattered around a generator, i realize my objective now. To defend these generators. I go a few meters away from the generator and hear rustling behind a tree near me. I stop in my tracks, listening, and hearing the breath of this person, this... sacrifice. I go towards the tree and around it, seeing the person attempting to hide amongst the grasses. I reach for him, but he jumps up and runs, i give chase, thrilled. As i chase him, he pulls down obstacles to get in my way, but as he is pulling one down, i strike him.\n\nNight 4: I followed the blood trail to another set of generators, the trail stopped. I look around, hearing sounds of medical supplies being applied. I go around the corner and a woman is helping the man i had injured. Makeshift bandages being replaced by real ones from the medical supplies contained in the chests. I go towards them, swinging my cleaver and hitting the man i had previously injured, the bandages are gone through and it goes into his back, disabling him. I grab the woman as she jumps over a barricade. I then drag them both, screaming, to a hook, hang one, another hook, and hang the other. This cycle will never end, the pain will never end. I will spill blood until i have no use to the Entity that sustains me.\n\nNight 5: Capture, Hang, Repeat. Capture, Hang, Repeat. Capture, Hang, Repeat.
