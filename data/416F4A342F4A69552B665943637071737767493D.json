Realy sad because theres a potentialy great game in there.","timestamp_created":1610410999,"timestamp_updated":1610410999,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496212124824523926","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84522562","author":{"steamid":"76561199121590391","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1653196203},"language":"english","review":"very good, love ranking down to be rewarded with sweaty games and nothing extra in return","timestamp_created":1610410768,"timestamp_updated":1610410768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84522484","author":{"steamid":"76561199120349357","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1655711971},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1610410636,"timestamp_updated":1610410636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84522411","author":{"steamid":"76561198077789052","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":32025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":302,"playtime_at_review":5139,"last_played":1660187446},"language":"brazilian","review":"Se vc jogar esse jogo, sua biluga aumenta 7cm.","timestamp_created":1610410509,"timestamp_updated":1610410509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84522007","author":{"steamid":"76561199124962228","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1654790540},"language":"english","review":"its a fun game and it looks great.","timestamp_created":1610409889,"timestamp_updated":1610409889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84520220","author":{"steamid":"76561198807338813","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":501,"playtime_at_review":1012,"last_played":1660241622},"language":"english","review":"I like getting bullied by survivers or killers","timestamp_created":1610407048,"timestamp_updated":1610407048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84520045","author":{"steamid":"76561198065373459","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":14902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":30,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1660603545},"language":"english","review":"Fun with friends...And friends only.","timestamp_created":1610406777,"timestamp_updated":1610406777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512987017631530762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84519810","author":{"steamid":"76561198216704344","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":32319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1658631000},"language":"english","review":"Quite great fun, honestly you just need to adjust to the controls and how you should play.","timestamp_created":1610406421,"timestamp_updated":1610406421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84519746","author":{"steamid":"76561198443577167","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":61150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":57,"playtime_at_review":58112,"last_played":1660392183},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Zarina[/h1]\n[i]A story of heartbreak, Deceipt and lazy videogame companies.\nBased on true events[/i]\n\n[b][If you only want to know the conclusion, skip to Chapter IV][/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Chapter I: It all started with that outfit[/b]\n\n\nSo a while ago, back when I was still playing this game very actively I obtained the battle pass for it and I completed it. Among the unlocked outfits there was one in particular which I really liked. It was an outfit for Zarina Cassir, a character which I have never picked up before.\nThat was until I saw her in that outfit.\n\nThat's where this tragic love story begins.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Chapter II: Bonding[/b]\n\n\nSo I started doing some work. I first played her to prestiege 3. (max. Level)\nEasy enough!\nThen one by one I started unlocking every single perk in the game on her.\nOne. By. One...\n\nWith every game we've played together I grew closer to her and I kid you not when I'm saying that I never saw anyone else use that particular skin.\nNot even once.\n\nThe last anniversary was probably the highlight on our journey.\nWe managed to obtain roughly 140 sacrificial cakes. And that was the day that I officially started calling her my 'main'.\nThere was no ceremony.\n[i]Just me...[/i]\n[i]...and her[/i]\n\nShe managed to turn me from a cold-hearted killer main into a 'friendly survivor'.\n\nBut the tides were about to turn...\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Chapter III: I did not understand[/b]\n\n\nSo we come to the present day, where the anniversary has ended about a month ago and a new Battle Pass has made its way to the live servers and I start a game.\n\nSo there I was in the lobby and noticed something peculiar.\nSomeone was using the same Zarina outfit as I did I wasn't bothered at all at first since everyone who also worked their way through the Battle Pass to obtain their outfits through hard work I consider family at this point.\nbut after I told that other Zarina that I liked her skin, she said the words that changed everything:\n\"haha, thx. I got it today <3\"\n\n\"Impossible.\", I thought to myself. Still I immediately left the lobby to check for myself. But sure enough.\nThere she was...\nOn display. Obtainable for measly 10€.\n\nI was disgusted. Speechless. Heartbroken.\nAnd when I looked into the new battle pass... Now that made me really sick...\n\nThere was a 'new' Zarina skin in there.\nBut it wasn't actually new.\nIt was a red re-coloring of the very same outfit that I originally fell in love with.\n\nI tried to understand.\nWhy couldnt they just ship the red version to the store?\nWhy didn't they just leave the red version in the new battle pass. But without ruining the integrity of my blue one.\nI did not understand.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Chapter IV: Bad Behaviour and disappointment[/b]\n\n\nAfter unlocking basically everything that is obtainable just by playing the game the more exciting thing to me became collecting exclusive skins.\nEveryone makes their own goals. For some it is rank. For some it's achievements and for me it was collecting skins combined with that previously mentioned sense of exclusivity, that kept me engaged after all those hours.\n\nSo regardless how petty it might come off to anyone reading this.\nThis event took all the motivation and passion for this game that I had left away.\n\nI might eventually return to the game and find new goals to work towards but it's little things like these that made me keep losing more and more respect for Behaviour.\nThey keep making these anti-consumer decisions like there's no tomorrow. And it doesn't even matter, since there isn't really competition with a game like this. People at best will just say something along the lines of \"hitboxes bad, servers bad, balancing bad, etc.\" but end up shrugging it off and sinking in another 3000 hours.\n\nMeanwhile behavior will just go out of their way to be as lazy as they can by just re-releasing old exclusive skins instead of just putting in the effort to come up with new ones heck, a slight redesign to distinguish the different versions would have already been enough for me.\n\nSadly they just can't be bothered to give two sh*ts about their game...\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nTL:DR I can't wait to buy the legacy skins for 10€

been playing this game since July 2017 on PS4 and only until 2020 when I got my PC did I move to PC, so I have well over [u]5k hours[/u] in this game and I can proudly say, I [b]love/hate[/b] this game like many others. The game has had many ups and downs but no matter what I will always return. Any game like that deserves to be recommended. I love this game like a sibling and only want to see the devs do good with it. The devs do tend to be survivor biased and killers will always be annoyed with SWFs groups (Survive with Friends) but once you can get passed it and understand some games are just out of your hands, you'll have more fun. Survivor is by far the more relaxing side as weird as it sounds. Once you get better you will have almost no problem being chased for minutes on end on some maps.\n\n[u]TLDR- It's worth the purchase for sure.[/u]\n\nNew Review: Over time they've shown more and more to not give a shit about their killer community and i'm tired of it. They consistently nerf killer sided things that don't need nerfs, don't fix bugs after years of them existing, peddle cosmetics while the game is unplayable, and refuse to ban cheaters while banning the mod community that made better cosmetics than they ever have. BHVR has lost all respect and my faith in them. I don't recommend this game anymore until they stop being biased and fix the issues that have plagued the game for years. Maybe BHVR is the plague...\n\n[u]TLDR- It's not worth the purchase anymore.[/u]","timestamp_created":1610395837,"timestamp_updated":1634659752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84511713","author":{"steamid":"76561198853564154","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":16326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":403,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1660530650},"language":"spanish","review":"god","timestamp_created":1610395783,"timestamp_updated":1610395783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84511342","author":{"steamid":"76561198217699356","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":28931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28175,"last_played":1648750106},"language":"russian","review":"Стадии игрока в DbD:\n1)Купил игру, думаешь что поиграешь в какой-то за3батый хоррор\n3)(Неважно что это 2 по сути) Пытаешься битый час найти этот 3бучий генератор.
