It took me about 200 hours before I felt like I had the bare minimum of skill required to be competent in this game, which I think is a really good thing. This game is a time sink with a high skill ceiling, plain and simple. And yet, unlike other high skill, time sink games like Team Fortress 2 or Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I still have the same passion to play this game that I did when I first started. While the game has a multitude of issues, such as balancing problems and a seemingly unlimited supply of glitches, those problems still haven't kept me from playing 200 hours, and I honestly don't think they will keep me from playing 2,000.\n\nOh, and that's only 50% of the game, seeing as how I only play Survivor.\n\nEDIT: This game fucking sucks.

This was back in October 2017 when I bought the game on sale to play with friends who had already been playing. We played some kill your friends together to get the hang of the controls and objectives.\nAfter that we jumped into Survive With Friends where we were afraid, but we were afraid together. I'll never forget the time we were all sitting in the open exit gate area and Freddy Krueger popped some sort of perk that blocked the exits for a period of time and we all panicked and ran around laughing and freaking out.\n\nBut then we started playing less because it was frustrating waiting any where from five to fifteen minutes to get into another game if one of us died early and had to sit around and wait for the others.\n\nShortly after The Pig DLC was released, a friend and I decided to play some ol DBD cause nothing else sounded fun to play. First game of the night was with The Pig. We knew it was her because we saw the puzzle boxes. I started working on a generator and after twenty seconds i see her about fifteen feet away stalking me and it scares THE SHIRT out of me. I mean I threw my mouse away and half closed my laptop, screaming WHAT THE FORK in a VERY high pitched tone. To my credit, I hadn't been playing seriously and all other killers (besides the shape, but he was tall) had a terror radius that I relied on along with my friends callouts to avoid any surprises. Well that night with the Pig, i only played two more games, still shaken up. I even had a nightmare that i was being stalked in my own home by Hillbilly and Doctor.\n\nThat next morning I decided I had to face my fears. No one was online so I logged in and jumped into queue alone. And you know what? I had so much fun. And I still do! I almost exclusively solo-queue and now I play more Killer too! Today I bought the Halloween DLC and i had a BLAST playing The Shape, no wonder everyone reccommends it! \n\nRemember that it is a multiplayer game, so expect a certain amount of toxicity, but I've found that as long as you throw the ol GG in at the end, people seems to hold onto their EZs.\n\nThis game gets a lot of hate for being such a creative, immersive, and addictive experience. It's not just one way to play, it's many. The bugs have been annoying at times, but I think DBD is at a great place right now. \n\nI don't play any games like DBD and I wouldn't have thought this was going to be something I'd like, but it's one of my favorites to play after a long day in the office and I'm glad I gave it a chance! :)","timestamp_created":1520920849,"timestamp_updated":1520920849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40780663","author":{"steamid":"76561198157195091","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":41470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20415,"last_played":1636775926},"language":"english","review":"Old Review below.  Devs have been working hard to stabilize power gap between Survivor and Killer.  Not perfect but much better than the past.  Will submit full re-review after another 100-200 hours back in the game.  +EDIT+ After being back, game has shown really good signs of a turn-around.  Balance is better than before; the only problem newer players may encounter is killers/survivors with over 1000 hours in the game de-ranking to newbie ranks in order to curbstomp newer players.  Frustrating as all hell, but push through it and know they are not in every match.  Archives and the Rift are quite nice, I love getting more lore and they're all voiced which is cool.  \n\n\n+ OLD REVIEW + \n\nNot recommended in it's current form.  Was my favorite game to play, but each patch introduces more and more bugs, old exploits are never addressed or fixed, and devs are completely deaf to half the community.  Forums are some of the most toxic you will ever see, which is to be expected in an assymetrical game, the problem is that as the game continues, balance is becoming increasingly one-sided. \nIn it's simplest form, game is 1 killer vs. 4 survivors.  While survivors have number advantage, killer is (supposedly) more powerful to offest this.  The problem is that many of the perks Survivors can acquire to strengthen themselves is about getting information (where other survivors are, where the killer is, etc).  The game is literally balanced around a team of survivors who can NOT communicate in real-time, but instead have to use their own cunning and awareness to succeed. \nOnce the devs allowed friends on steam to team-up (and thereby introduced Discord voice comms to a game *built* on this NOT being an option), it's just gotten worse and worse.  \nFar from being the singular powerful entity, Killers at this juncture are reduced to simpering morons who can only hope to win the game through the mistakes of the Survivors.  If you get lucky and pull a game against an organized 4-man team of friends with voice comms?  They will toy with you and watch you flail helplessly, powerless to actually do anything that might win you the game.\nThis measure of balance is brought up over and over again by high-profile streamers -and- the devs themsevles in their weekly livestreams, but they have taken a hard stance that nothing is wrong and put their heads in the sand ... presumably, because they either don't know *how* to fix their game or just don't want to bother putting the effort in.\nGame is now just an excuse to release and sell new licensed Killers as DLC, but each release sees more and more bugs that never get fixed.  Map exploits and bugs like getting stuck trying to walk between two trees due to model collision are ignored ... in fact, they only actually have ONE developer who works on the maps themselves, and he's usually kept busy creating new maps to sell more DLC faster, rather than fix the problems with the existing ones.\nIt's a sad state of affairs at this point, and a quick trip to the forums will show you how divisive and angry the community is with each other and the developers -- this game has already peaked, and will begin a slow decline now.  I myself, as a Killer main, already moved on after getting sick of punishing myself trying to play against an opponent who not only outnumbers you 4-to-1, but is also stronger than you mechanic wise.\nI am not kidding that some of the top streamers of this game have already made community challenges, videos, etc to point out that Killers can *only* succeed and win based on Survivors screwing up.  Meaning once you hit high ranks against organized teams, you are in most cases guaranteed to lose (unless you hit the lottery and face 4 randoms who are boosted).\nIf you're thinking of jumping onto this ship now, don't feel disheartened that it's not what you expected.  The good days are over, and there's nothing left now but the decline ... which the devs seem all to happy to oblige.\n\n\"Killer is frustrating and unbalanced?  Just try playing Survivor then, or play something else (Civilization V).\"  Statement from the game lead pretty much says it all.","timestamp_created":1520920313,"timestamp_updated":1573623566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505300343036651611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40780594","author":{"steamid":"76561198265771515","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":807,"last_played":1522483522},"language":"spanish","review":"muchos bugs alv","timestamp_created":1520919922,"timestamp_updated":1520919922,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40779709","author":{"steamid":"76561198120336773","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":161414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2659,"playtime_at_review":10035,"last_played":1660539696},"language":"spanish","review":"NO LO COMPRES ESTA MRD DE JUEGO ES UN BUG ANDANTE Y LO UNICO QUE SE DEDICAN LOS DESARROLLADORES ES SACAR SKIN Y SKIN","timestamp_created":1520915645,"timestamp_updated":1606690089,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40779705","author":{"steamid":"76561198229974328","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":16335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1627210498},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую","timestamp_created":1520915620,"timestamp_updated":1593265794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40779542","author":{"steamid":"76561198147950779","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":39561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30041,"last_played":1657043113},"language":"english","review":"I have over 500 hours in this game, so obviously I enjoyed it at one point. This used to be my favorite game and I would play it for several hours every day. But now it's a honestly such a terrible game and is only getting worse, and let me tell you why.\nThe game is centered around the idea of a killer and 4 survivors with the killer in the dominant role. There are various killers to choose from that all have cool unique abilities, but the problem is that the killer is no longer the dominant role, making the survivors both the group AND the dominant role. It started out correctly, it was buggy but it was done right with the killers actually being scary. As of now there have been so many survivor buffs and killer nerfs that playing killer is a joke and isn't fun anymore. Being a killer main I have personally experienced this gradual degression into nothingness that the developers of the game have enforced.\nThe other main problem is that the developers are the most disconnected people that I have ever seen, completely ingoring the blatently obvious problems that there game has. They focus gameplay around lower level survivors which means more experienced players are almost impossible to kill. The killer nerfs have gotten so bad that even the survivor side of the community is complaining, and that's saying something. Usually the survivors are pretty toxic, so for them to recognize a problem on the killer end of things should have been a wake up call to the developers, but to no avail.\nTo end this I would like to quote one of the developers who was asked the question \"Do you have any ideas on how you are going to impove the killer experience?\"  This was responded to with \"Maybe try survivor for a bit, or play something else for like a week. Try civilization or something.\" This was literally a developer saying that they aren't going to fix the obvious balance issues that there game has. I hope that in the future this game will be fixed and will once again be a magnificent and unique horror game, but for now please avoid it for your own sake.","timestamp_created":1520914957,"timestamp_updated":1522599725,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":209,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.790563464164733887","comment_count":29,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40779407","author":{"steamid":"76561198186828494","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":106446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":34209,"last_played":1660556990},"language":"schinese","review":"玩到500小时丢档了！ 然后官方10天给了我补偿 真的很良心~","timestamp_created":1520914291,"timestamp_updated":1520914291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40778983","author":{"steamid":"76561198141730868","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":28331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":99,"playtime_at_review":15633,"last_played":1660122509},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is such a unique game- you can experience the game from both the chaser (killer) or the chased (survivor) POV. \nQuite a simple concept but requires team play, strategy (sort of), and luck.
