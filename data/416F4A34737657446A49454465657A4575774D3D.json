As a coordinated SWF is far more effective than four randoms, that unbalance furthermore leads to the problem of impossible balancing between survivors and killer. On the same skill level (and above low MMR) the gameplay is roughly balanced between solo queue and killer, but other aspects like map design (hardly any killer sided maps) or perks (loads of second chance perks) tend to push that scale towards the survivors.\n\n- Yet there is one way for the killer to tip it the other side again: camping and tunneling. Camping a hook to prevent an unhook or going for an unhooked survivor is the best way to get rid of one survivor and have an easier match. However, from a game design perspective, it is unfathomable these techniques are still in game. And it is without a doubt bad game design when the survivor's game experience consists of hanging on a hook without much chance of being rescued/protected because saving/protecting against a camping/tunneling killer takes some coordination that is harder to manage in solo queue.\n\nThe only reason why camping and tunneling are still in game though is because they are the only ways of balancing killer vs. SWF. On the same skill level and MMR (and without playing one of the few op killers) there would need to be trolling or some heavy misplays on the SWF's side for the killer to even stand a chance. Camping and tunneling give you that chance, but even with them, SWFs are still in comfortable advantage as they are usually able to prevent both. \n\nIn conclusion: To give killers some chance against SWFs the game offers bad game design mechanics that are naturally used against solo queue survivors more effectively and are thus ruining their game while still being quite ineffective vs. well coordinated SWFs. So you either play killer and while getting better and thus climbing in MMR will face more SWFs who have so much of an advantage that they will ruin your day with troll/toxic gameplay, or you play solo queue where you will be frequently camped and tunneled giving you an absolutely awful game experience.\n\nOr you take the easy and most fun road and play with your friends.","timestamp_created":1654026065,"timestamp_updated":1654605837,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509782850742340088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116302082","author":{"steamid":"76561198824667885","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":183,"playtime_at_review":13855,"last_played":1660320929},"language":"english","review":"fnstuffffffffff","timestamp_created":1654026015,"timestamp_updated":1654026015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116301996","author":{"steamid":"76561199085525547","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4659,"last_played":1654531535},"language":"english","review":"kazige
