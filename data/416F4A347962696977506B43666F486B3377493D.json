Chases can feel unfair if it is a strong or high tier killer with meta perks.\n\nThen you play as killer, where it's you up against 4 other survivors. You try to avoid the same bs tactics as a killer that you faced when you were a survivor, only to not get a single kill, survivors healing extremely quick due to new totem perks, watching corners for flashlights, etc etc. These games end with all remaining survivors tbagging at the exit gate and flashlight clicks in sync with each other.\n\nThen you begin to think, wow, killer / survivor is so weak compared to the other side. The truth is, it doesn't matter, it's the toxic community that once again ruins a game. When you have such limited time to play games and many games offer actual fair and fun experiences, it makes it very hard to come back to this game that I once loved.\n\nThe cherry on top is when the devs \"test\" new features in their public test environment, such as adding a new killer, and release to the main branch of the game, features unrelated to the addition (maps) break and are locked for months.

Игра не стоит той цены, что есть в стиме. 180 потолок, со скидкой можно взять по фану поиграть, потратив себе по итогу нервы...","timestamp_created":1621360219,"timestamp_updated":1633250316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92218174","author":{"steamid":"76561198882654566","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":23421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17786,"last_played":1655996575},"language":"russian","review":"Норм","timestamp_created":1621360142,"timestamp_updated":1648677967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92218084","author":{"steamid":"76561198043644301","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":106480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":738,"playtime_at_review":81898,"last_played":1660584927},"language":"english","review":"Awful game, awful developers and for the most part an awful player base. The matchmaking and ranking systems ruin the game, especially with console players. Killers are overpowered and survivors don't understand the need or refuse to work together, which is the only way to win. There's a reason the developers abandoned their other game \"Deathgarden Bloodharvest\", because they're terrible and only care about making money off in game cosmetic items. Don't waste your time or money.","timestamp_created":1621360029,"timestamp_updated":1627912614,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92218048","author":{"steamid":"76561199122347975","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2830,"last_played":1656444525},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1621359950,"timestamp_updated":1621359950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92218034","author":{"steamid":"76561198828642635","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":100612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":871,"playtime_at_review":64030,"last_played":1660596714},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo bom até, quando funciona direito, o que é o grande problema. Sempre tem um erro novo acontecendo, o que faz com que você perca mais tempo procurando soluções para eles do que jogando. E sim, você tem que procurar, pois o suporte do jogo é simplesmente o mesmo ou menos que nada. Já logo aviso que você provavelmente vai se estressar com um negócio chamado EAC, que vai \"inventar\" literalmente algum erro pra te quitar de uma partida. E quando você voltar, vai ficar na fila de punição como se a culpa fosse sua. \n\nA comunidade deste jogo é bem tóxica, sempre tem algo tosco para falarem. A maioria são seres humanos com ânus no lugar da boca. \n\nDe resto é um jogo bom. Não recomento pra quem tem problemas com ansiedade e estresse. \n\nPs: Jogue no gráfico mais baixo possível, porque faz pouca diferença e vai deixar algumas mapas mais claros e menos lagados. \n\nBoa sorte. \n\nPs²: Escrevi essa análise enquanto faço uma correção de erro.
