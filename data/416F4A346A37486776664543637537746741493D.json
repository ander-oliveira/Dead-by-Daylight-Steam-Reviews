First of all, the game is really fun in the beginning (save for some smurfs on both the killer and survivor side, bullying new players).  However, the more and more your rank rises, the more and more toxic and stressful the game becomes. For example, as killer, you have less than a minute before 1 or 2 of your 5 gens gets completed, putting you at an extreme disadvantage.  Snowballing off this point, the devs do not seem to have a clear understanding of their own game.  The must-have perk killers had to run to avoid gens being completed too fast (Hex: Ruin) was nerfed a few months ago, completely shifting the game heavily in the survivor's favor.  This causes many survivors to rank up to high ranks, filling the high rank areas with survivors who could hold M1 most effectively, and not for their ability to avoid or run away from the killer.  Furthermore, the meta shift also made it much easier for really good survivors to rush gens at the beginning of the match, making it extremely difficult (although not impossible) for the killer to kill everyone before the gens are done.  The devs keep making small changes that are good as far as QOL fixes go, but no much needed changes are being made for both survivors and killers alike.\nNow that we have game mechanics out of the way, lets move on to the player community.  The most infuriating part of DBD is the toxicity.  While there are both toxic survivors and toxic killers, I notice that toxic behavior is much more common on the survivors side.  Despite what the appearance insinuates about the game, killers are not frightening, all-powerful opponents.  It is extremely easy to bully killers and make it had for the killer to get anything meaningful done.  I find that most of the toxicity among survivors come from players that ONLY play survivor, who do not understand the complexity and difficulty that comes with killer gameplay.  A joke among the killer community is the infamous \"Survivor's Guide for Killers\" which basically consists of a bunch of things survivor will get angry and toxic about if a killer performs certain actions, run certain perks, or use certain add-ons.  However, there's no \"Killer's guide for Survivors\", so there's no toxicity for survivors running annoying or over powered perks or using unfair items or add-ons.  Once again, a product of survivor players not understanding killer POV.\nGiven the gameplay and development issues, along with the toxic community, I have to give this a negative review.  This game is fun, at least for a while.  The problems that come with this game pile on gradually to the point where I find myself playing well, but having no fun because of the stress of the game and/or the toxicity of the survivor gameplay or end-game chat.  If you are looking to play DBD, take note of these points.\n1. Don't take the game to seriously, you'll burn yourself out and the game will get less and less fun.\n2.  Be sure to play both killer and survivor, that way you know the struggles and strengths that come with both sides\n3. Don't be toxic, it can be easy to fall into it with the community, but try not to be part of the problem yourself\n\nHave fun","timestamp_created":1586944117,"timestamp_updated":1586944117,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67353828","author":{"steamid":"76561198811741024","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1632693283},"language":"russian","review":"Ну вот жизнь как игра, получается.

You basically have to hope everyone in the game signed a treaty to not be an asshole. If all goes well, it can definitely be fun and exciting, outplaying and outsmarting one another. Matchmaking is a coin flip to not get teamates who suicide first hook(you can get hooked up to 2 times and live) or on the other side, a group of SWF(premade group, in which DBD was not designed to be played as).

It helps to communicate.\nHunters: It's hide and go seek with a hatchet! Each hunter is unique in abilities, from range attacks, to blinking through walls. Needless to say, so long as you chase, slice, and hurt a bit, you'll get points. Use points to make yourself better, grind a hunter up, you'll be finding people in no time.\nSounds, movement, understanding the area, are all key elements you will need to understand to win the games.

Even to make a group the headache starts!\n\nFrustration at not achieving the goals is part of any good and challenging game, but in DBD this is quite different, there are simply cases where nothing else could have been done.\n\nAnd it only says that it is balanced for survivors who do not know how to play killer, as a good killer dominates any game with perks and owerpowered addons, for example, where there is Killer arriving without making a noise, exposing the survivor and with a hit knocking him down, or killers crossing the map in 3 seconds and also with a hit knocking down anyone. If this is balanced my bag is beautiful too!\n\nAnd I don’t say this based only on my matches, in which the majority were in group on Discord with much more experienced people, but you only have to watch the DBD streams to see that the same thing happens with groups of survivors with more than 3, 4 or 5,000 hours of play, where there is almost always someone fighting with someone or cursing the killer for the above-mentioned.

O jogo desde que comprei foi bem atualizado em seus gráficos, servidores e afins. Parece que me ouviram (claro, eu não sou a última bolacha do pacote e eu sei disso) em relação a tudo que eu reclamei desde aquela última análise. Mudaram o sistema de ranks e balancearam bastante os perks, não vi até agora algo op que me impediu de jogar de killer ou de survivor, foram partidas super balanceadas e divertidas depois de tempos que passei raiva até desinstalar o game.\n\nO jogo é estilo PAYDAY 2: pague o jogo base e se quiser mais, pague por esse conteúdo picado também. Na minha opinião as DLC's são bem feitas e que valem a pena cada centavo.","timestamp_created":1586915484,"timestamp_updated":1646556867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67334027","author":{"steamid":"76561198311388281","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":102706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94791,"last_played":1648130997},"language":"english","review":"Great game have been playing since beta. it has its issues like any other game but i still keep coming back to it. over 1,500 hours played and plan to play more.","timestamp_created":1586915250,"timestamp_updated":1586915250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67333858","author":{"steamid":"76561198874210314","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":75487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1511,"playtime_at_review":63820,"last_played":1660350707},"language":"english","review":"i hate it","timestamp_created":1586915019,"timestamp_updated":1624651609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j7HgvfECcu7tgAI="}
