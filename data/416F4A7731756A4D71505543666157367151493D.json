This game, like many other games, is balanced by people that don't even play or understand it on a high level, which results in horrible balance problems.\n\nThis game is really predatory when it comes to your money. It's one of those games that makes you feel like a pauper after you actually buy it. You pay hard earned cash to buy this game, only to realize that you'll have to buy tons of DLCs to actually have access to vital content in the game. The meta is dominated by Laurie Strodes, Ghostface, Nancy Wheeler, Freddy Krueger, etc. These characters can only be acquired by paying real life money, you [b]cannot[/b] grind for them.\n\nSeveral Killers are so weak that they are nearly unplayable (Clown, Trapper, etc) and have been in this sad state since release, with no effort to rework them or even modify them.\n\nThere are 158 perks in the game, yet you'll only see around 8 different Survivor perks and 8 different Killer perks in your matches simply because out of those 158 perks, around 142 are objectively useless and clearly designed by people who don't understand the game and have no business balancing it.\n\nThe only jumpscares you'll experience in this \"horror game\" are the abrupt and uncalled for changes the developers decide to implement out of the blue. Their latest mishap being the \"breakable walls\", a bizarre unnecessary new mechanic they are going out of their way to implement on every map, wasting time and resources, despite the community desperately asking for simple balance changes instead.\n\nThe game is awful no matter which role you decide to play. If you play survivor, your success or failure is determined by the teammates you get. You could be the best survivor player ever but if your teammates are drowning in their own drool you are destined to lose. On the other hand, if you get insane teammates, then you win no matter what you do. This makes playing survivor feel like a dice roll.\nOn the other hand, if you play Killer, you feel like a spectator. Your only input is making the right calls and using your character correctly. Whether you win or lose depends on the survivors and the map. If the survivors are good you lose, simple as that, because the game is balanced in their favor. If they are bad then you have a chance.\n\nThe maps in this game are horribly imbalanced, to the point where the outcome of the match can be roughly determined as soon as you see which map you are on. For example, if the map is \"Lery's Memorial Institute\" and the killer is The Hillbilly, the killer loses instantly, because his power is rendered useless. On the other hand if the Killer is Ghostface on the same exact map, the killer will have a huge advantage because of how easy stealth is in this map. Yet another dice roll.\n\nDo I recommend buying this game after playing it for 640 hours? [b]NO.[/b] The game has a ton of potential, but anything short of these awful devs getting abducted by aliens and replaced by replicas that actually know how to balance a game is not going to be enough to salvage it. Every change we've seen push it farther and farther away from a good game. The only reason this game is not dead and forgotten is that it's the most polished representation of this awesome genre of asymmetrical horror games.","timestamp_created":1603391968,"timestamp_updated":1603391968,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527099013328552246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77980997","author":{"steamid":"76561198327325043","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":38569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4224,"last_played":1652534218},"language":"russian","review":"Очень много недоработок, иногда из-за этого невозможно играть.

However, there is always meta which stands way above other builds.\nIf you want to play casually it shouldn't matter to you, but if you want to achieve something then you have to polish your \"looping\" skills. You will also have to use at least some of meta perks to counter killers' meta perks.\nThere are problems with connection too - after the introduction of dedicated servers there were some issues - major and minor. And there are still some, but the creators are trying to improve the game.\nI recommend buying it if you:\na) have a bunch of friends which are willing to play together with you\nb) want to play a game where jumpscares are common for some killers\nc) want to teabag someone and face the consequences of your actions.","timestamp_created":1603386534,"timestamp_updated":1603386534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77977017","author":{"steamid":"76561198292237673","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1625565865},"language":"koreana","review":"살생마들이 판을 친다 어휴 고인물들!","timestamp_created":1603386304,"timestamp_updated":1603386304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77977001","author":{"steamid":"76561198160150031","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":14433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14297,"last_played":1638028483},"language":"english","review":"EAC","timestamp_created":1603386279,"timestamp_updated":1603386279,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77976708","author":{"steamid":"76561199032202437","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":21104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2177,"last_played":1655220704},"language":"russian","review":"прикольная игруха, правда нет голосового чата-- большой минус, но в целом играбельна, всем советую, но лучше покупать по скидке","timestamp_created":1603385873,"timestamp_updated":1603385873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77976482","author":{"steamid":"76561199048026836","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3228,"last_played":1655853245},"language":"russian","review":"просто можно поинрать с друзьями","timestamp_created":1603385537,"timestamp_updated":1603385537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77976157","author":{"steamid":"76561198992201702","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":66845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":634,"playtime_at_review":40383,"last_played":1660562095},"language":"hungarian","review":"Jó játék ha nem vagdosom az ereimet egy kenőkéssel","timestamp_created":1603385116,"timestamp_updated":1634490333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1ujMqPUCfaW6qQI="}
