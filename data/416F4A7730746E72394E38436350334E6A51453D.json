A game I have put many hours into since I first started playing years ago, and even to this day. A game that has certainly had it's fair share of scrutiny over that time. Dead By Daylight is one of those games you are either going to love... or hate. However, there is a third route that you can take, this route being that you love it, just for years later to hate it. I've always attempted my best at being fair with the developers, and also fair with the community. Unfortunately through the years this leniency I gave, and this hope that I had for the game continued to diminish. I started playing the game a lot in late 2017 with a few breaks here and there all the way up until now in 2020. I am certainly not deserving of a \"veteran\" tag for this game, though I do think playing 1000 hours is [b] more [/b] than enough to give my thoughts and opinions on it.\n\n\n[h1] The Game [/h1] \nFor the new people thinking about purchasing Dead By Daylight, I would 100% hold off as of right now. The game is in one of it's shakiest times we've had in a while, and the changes that have been and are [b] being made [/b] are some that I don't fully agree with. As of today March 27th, 2020, this game [b] still [/b] has a very broken base-frame. Instead of fixing a problem we have [b] ALL [/b] had for as long as I can remember (Gen Speeds), BHVR continues to only provide band-aid fixes and solutions that only P**s us off even more. In the end this is only hurting the game more than it is helping. I know a lot of friends that have quit the game due to the developers poor decision making, and for their what seems like lack of interest in getting certain things done. I understand we are all human, and even after seeing what the developers have done with the game, I still proceed to try my best and give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\n[h1] The Community [/h1]\nPrepare yourself for one of the most Toxic communities you can find (There is certainly worse). Though don't let that scare you, not everyone in the game is a rude b****. As with any game community there is the good side, the nice people, the people who realize that you are a human being too. The toxic people will always be there no matter what you do, and it is up to you as a human to realize that they don't matter. We don't know what they are going through in life, so the best thing you can do is just ignore it and keep moving on. If you are the feint of heart, I'd reconsider getting this game, though you can turn off the post game chat box if it gets too much.\n\n\n[h1] The Developers [/h1]\nThe Devs have always had their moments, good... and bad. As stated above some of the decision making has been wonky, though if you can just bare with them, sometimes they actually pull through. They have done a few in-game themed events, for which the most part people enjoyed. You NEED to keep in mind that you'll be putting a LOT of faith into the developers IF you purchase this game. They've made many big changes since I've started playing, and I can only expect they will do more in the future, good or not. My final point is the balance state of the game. The game has an EXTREME Meta for the most part, and any serious group of players will run these builds no question. It's sad because it makes experimenting with other perk builds unappealing if you are wanting to win the game, as most of the time not running a certain build will end in your demise.\n\n[h1] In Conclusion [/h1]\nAt the time of posting this I plan on being done with Dead By Daylight after this most recent tome (Didn't touch on tomes and a lot of other things, but I don't want this review to last ages). Should you purchase Dead By Daylight? No. Though if you don't want to listen to me, at least wait for a sale before buying the game. As for me I'm done, I've given DBD 1,000 hours of my time, and I don't plan on giving them much more. Thank You for reading this review all the way, I apologize for my plethora of comma splices, and poor grammar choices but there is a reason why I am not an English Major.

This is my opinion on the game and is suggestive. I’ll start with the good stuff. The game look amazing, the game sounds amazing and the game feels… frustrating. To elaborate, the game looks very good and runs well on most computers. The sound of this game is probably one of its best features. I can’t begin to explain how vital it is to the game. Sound can either save you from a jumpscare, or tell you wtf everyone is hiding from you (If you’re killer). The gameplay is pretty good and original. I will say this, the game feels unique, whether good or bad, that is suggestive. I personally feel this is a fun game, I enjoy it on my own and I enjoy scaring my friends too. \nUnfortunately the devs don’t do enough for the game. Sure they bring out a new killer once in a while and add an update or two, but nothing is done to gamebreaking mechanics. In the lower tiers the game favours the killer, in the higher tiers the game favours the survivors so much. To add to the problem is a lot of people salt this game because they aren’t used to losing or having fun. If the killer gets you, suck it up buttercup, if he camps. So what, the killer isn’t there for your enjoyment. The killer isn’t playing on your team. He is there to make your life miserable so don’t be part of the problem. Be that player that commends a killer or survivor post match, adds him or her on steam and enjoys another few rounds of killing together. \nAll in all, I say the game is good. The community feels a bit salty in general because some killers are “over- powered” but people forget how easy they make the game for the survivors. Items that allow you to instantly open a door and escape, perks that allow you to pop 4 gens in half a minute and then there are…. Pallets… \nThe bottom line is that if you can ignore salty players and enjoy the game on your own or with friends who have the game or want the game, pick it up, it has a fair price, ton of replay ability and the game is actually fun on it’s own. If you feel unhappy or even satisfied, post a review, join forums or send feedback. Taking it out on fellow players won’t magically change the game.\n\nP.S – If you don’t know anybody that has the game and you want friends to jam the game with, add me on steam and I’ll happily show you the ropes. \n","timestamp_created":1511455742,"timestamp_updated":1511455742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37131128","author":{"steamid":"76561197977988367","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19002,"last_played":1573496404},"language":"german","review":"macht Spaß und super zeit vertreib =)","timestamp_created":1511455720,"timestamp_updated":1511455720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37131036","author":{"steamid":"76561198116496504","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":66785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22941,"last_played":1633979363},"language":"russian","review":"Нормальная игра.
