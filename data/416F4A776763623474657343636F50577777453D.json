Провёл я прекрасные 120 часов в этой игре и пора, думаю, сделать на неё обзор:\nКупил я эту игру по рекомендации своего друга в далёком 2017 году (спустя год после выхода игры) и столько багов я увидел в период игры в Dead by Daylight, что мне стало плохо и я забил на эту игру на год.\nНо позже я решил вернуться в неё (в конце 2018) и увидел, что игра-то развилась очень неплохо: \n- Теперь я практически не встречаю багов в этой игре (они есть, но их гораздо меньше, чем было);\n- Добавили много новых маньяков и выживших и это не может не радовать;\n- Добавили визуальный контент (хоть я не особо это люблю, но тем не менее, это хорошо);\n- Игра стала более оптимизированной;\n\nИз минусов выделю только то, что хостом каждого матча является маньяк (если у убийцы слабый интернет, то всю команду выживших будет телепортировать по карте)\nМногие говорят, что есть некое преимущество у разных новых маньяков, но это не так. Просто некоторые ещё не научились играть против них, вот и ноют по этому поводу.\n\nКак итог, хочу сказать то, что Dead by Daylight очень эволюционировала с тех времён и сейчас является достойной

\nLiterally the worst \"developers\" of any game I have ever played. They don't listen to the players. They spend more time adding cosmetics than actually balancing their game. 100% confident these devs don't play their own game. I tried killer again after a long break which makes my rank the lowest, yet I was going up against all 2-4 man SWF with higher ranks than me. Its pretty disgusting after over 5 years these devs cant fix the issues of their game. I am uninstalling and hoping the worst for Behavior. I hope that one day their game servers will be closed and their company is closed. No one needs game developers like this. \nLove/hate this game. \n\nLove the idea of this game and the occasional troll is good laughs. But be prepared, its full of toxic behavior and attitudes on both sides(killer & survivor). Which mostly isn't the players fault. This game enables this behavior as they have too many busted killers/perks which leads to looping the killer, camping hooks, tunneling survivors, and exploiting anything broken in its design. The devs seem like this behavior because they have changed everything enjoyable with every \"update\" for the worse. They don't work on balancing the killers/survivors and rarely ever fix all issues with the animations being buggy or broken hitboxes(watch any known streamer playing survivor you will see sus hitboxes).\n\nHere's an idea: Make the perks specific to killer/survivor stay that way. Stop this perk crossover mess because none of the survivors/killers are unique after this. Example: you can play as the Nurse and have all perks from Michael Myers... this idea is pretty dumb. People literally only play the Hag so they can get Hex:Ruin for every other killer, Claudette for self-healing, Laurie for decisive strike, and the list goes on. Why not make each character unique in their style of play and perks.\n\nLastly, where is Death Garden? Shouldn't you be ashamed taking money from players on a half-assed game that is shut down less than 2 years after its public? The game failed because of one big reason: YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO BALANCE YOUR GAMES. Its very apparent when you have decent concepts and cant pull your head out of your *** to figure out what gamers want. Its not hard either. You have multiple killers in DBD that do the same things, perks are free for alls, and everything loses its individuality.  You guys have literally became a meme because you have no idea how your game is and its pretty obvious most of you either dont play or play the killer because of the updates. They always come out the same way: nerf to survivor direct or indirect through map updates and taking out loops or nerfing survivor perks and buffing killer perks. The only time the killer has a hard time is when its 3 or 4 SWF. In this case disabling prove thyself would be fine or think of something to balance the game. But I am sure I am speaking to no one since you guys dont listen.","timestamp_created":1560922680,"timestamp_updated":1642154717,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535943865776062012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51301823","author":{"steamid":"76561198947730917","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1581591844},"language":"schinese","review":"无法启动啊；重装游戏还是不行，弹窗显示缺少msvcp140.dll文件","timestamp_created":1560922584,"timestamp_updated":1560922584,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432537764310836792","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51301115","author":{"steamid":"76561198394288877","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":10152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1653933938},"language":"english","review":"great game and entertaining. but alot better if play with friend","timestamp_created":1560918069,"timestamp_updated":1640686614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51301037","author":{"steamid":"76561198147382154","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":19916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":13165,"last_played":1659618693},"language":"schinese","review":"大爱杀鸡","timestamp_created":1560917564,"timestamp_updated":1560917564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51300584","author":{"steamid":"76561198846385067","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6080,"last_played":1639497066},"language":"polish","review":"Naprawdę  boża gierka, polecam i Major też","timestamp_created":1560914793,"timestamp_updated":1560914793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51300513","author":{"steamid":"76561198077602629","num_games_owned":546,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":74769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":918,"playtime_at_review":6596,"last_played":1660276375},"language":"english","review":"Imagine you have a button.\n\nWhen you press it, one of two things happen:\nEither you get a nice piece of candy or your head is smashed into the floor and trampled on.\n\nThis is Dead By Daylight.\n\nCouldn't recommend it more.","timestamp_created":1560914348,"timestamp_updated":1560914348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51300421","author":{"steamid":"76561198162934307","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":60867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56095,"last_played":1652446241},"language":"schinese","review":"我叼你m制作组瞎几把改 改你m隔壁","timestamp_created":1560913819,"timestamp_updated":1560913819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492415249347686768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51300369","author":{"steamid":"76561198336384777","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":33174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":78,"playtime_at_review":22144,"last_played":1660442917},"language":"brazilian","review":"ótimo jogo , bom em todos quesitos , é muito divertido jogar com amigos , recomendo muito !!

I love the characters, the setting and the idea of constantly being hounded by a 6'5\" beast wanting slash you open as you try to complete all the generators.\n\nHowever, with the current state the game is in, I can't recommend it. The community is HORRIBLY toxic, like so toxic to the point a toxic player from League of Legends would cry. Butt-dancing survivors that just pallet loop and make it an un-enjoyable experience for killers are pretty much the normal these days so don't be surprised when you lose a match at least 1 survivor is gonna shit on you post-game lobby. Not to mention the abusive report system. People get banned left and right for shit they didn't even do (almost like Riot ironically). \n\nHitboxes are buggy as hell. A survivor can be out running me during a pallet loop, and when they're half way across the pallet I can lunge a whole corner and stab them while they're MID PALLET SLIDE. I don't understand why even make a Killer meant for combating pallet looping when I can stab them with my flubber arms! \n\nEven as a killer main, I can say survivors get the shit end of the stick. The only forms of combating killers they have are Self-Care, Pallets and a Flashlight. That's really it. Although Self-Care is used and abused like my meat at 3:00 AM, there's even ways to counter people WHILE THEY ARE HEALING (a.k.a. Nurse's Calling). Speaking of perks,\n\nKillers really don't have unique builds. Sure they have unique perks and abilities, but the meta is so strict for killers. If you don't take a certain set of perks for most killers, you're bound to fail since most of the survivors will take full advantage of you not having something like BBQ and Chili. \n\nMatch-making is a mess as well. Play as a survivor and you can get a lobby in less than 3 minutes. Killers? They gotta wait 10+ minutes for one lobby and when they do get a lobby it's most likely gonna be a Survive With Friends group that have 3 high rank survivors and one low rank survivor so they can match with under-experienced killers and essentially just bully the killer with tight mechanics. What happens when you kill high ranking survivors and win a game flawlessly? They go out of their way to slander you and go as far as visiting your profile to leave some nasty comments. \n\nAll in all, if you really want to buy DbD go ahead. This review sums up some of biggest problems in the game and you're more than likely to have the same experience. If you really just want a good time just do Kill Your Friends, a mode where one person plays a killer and everyone else plays as survivor in a private lobby. \n","timestamp_created":1560909668,"timestamp_updated":1560909668,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471982181072235107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51299442","author":{"steamid":"76561198302100283","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":66293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28381,"last_played":1632956804},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mui bam","timestamp_created":1560908268,"timestamp_updated":1560908268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51299432","author":{"steamid":"76561198964075847","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":129314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122217,"last_played":1615582830},"language":"english","review":"After over 3000 hours playing this game across various platforms my opinion has pretty much remained the same, the game is buggy and unbalanced, while it has dramatically improved over the years, which I am grateful for, it still has a long way to go, especially in the balance department, I have enjoyed the game just enough to get hooked on it, although some days after playing I feel like I never want to play it again, both sides have their frustrations and they are completely justified, killers a survivors alike often go out of their way to ruin each others experience just to make the other side angry, killers camp and tunnel which nobody likes, survivors find exploitable parts of the game like god loops that are difficult, if not impossible to end in a time efficient manner, and then gloat to the killer after the game because they couldn't catch them. Overall the most frustrating side to play in this game is definitely as the killer, 4 brains against one already gives the survivors the upper hand, let alone with SWF and all the second chance perks in the mix, I personally don't care about SWF being a thing because in a game like this it's absurd to not have an option to play with your friends, playing any killer that is not Billy, Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, Freddy or Oni can get very frustrating against coordinated teams and generators get done way too fast, survivors abuse DS which is supposed to be an \"anti-tunnelling perk\" which I completely agree with, but lately its become more of \"hahahaha I'm invincible for a whole minute and there's nothing you can do about\" than \"you tunnelled me off the hook so now you're gonna get punished\" Keys, Mori's, NOED, Spirit, Nurse are just a few examples of things that are not healthy for this game and need to be addressed as soon as possible, maps have become a lot more balanced lately and it's a step in the right direction, the game itself is pretty tolerable, but something that is not tolerable is the monumental toxicity of the community, everyone seems out to get each other, and survivors and killers argue to each other about how they think each side should play the game, and a huge part of the community brags and gloats about it when they win instead of just saying \"gg\" and moving on to the next game, being around this toxicity constantly is enough to corrupt anyone. I love this game and I'll probably never stop playing it but I just hope all this game's issues finally get addressed and maybe this game can finally be balanced and be an all around fun experience for everyone involved.","timestamp_created":1560908182,"timestamp_updated":1592437902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51298995","author":{"steamid":"76561198821383071","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1657298739},"language":"english","review":"pretty

Some of it negative and some of it positive. On balance though, this game is an easy recommend for me. Besides the engaging format that somehow never seems to get old, the game has a dev team that listens to the community and is constantly adding new content. This is one of a few games I know of that has consistently seemed to be improving. When something is wrong, the devs will fix it (even if it takes years to fix).
