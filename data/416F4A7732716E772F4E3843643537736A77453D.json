I picked this up during the Halloween sale so I have been playing it for about a month. I have about 70 hours on it so far. I mostly play survivor as I have been trying to level a good main and unlock some teachable perks. I have played some killer as well. \n\nThis game is a ton of fun and it also definitely brings out the salt in players. There is salt from both survivor mains and killer mains. I see both sides of the coin. Survivors can be annoying at times when playing killer and killers can be annoying at times when playing survivor. Like most games there are those that would seek to exploit features and those who just want to have fun.\n\nI plan on running this game for quite a bit of time still. I sincerely hope that the devs continue to love, nurture, and grow it with future updates.\n","timestamp_created":1511743192,"timestamp_updated":1511743192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37734567","author":{"steamid":"76561198423738228","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":58802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":89,"playtime_at_review":987,"last_played":1660447260},"language":"english","review":"fun and exited.It's very exited when I played as a survivor and very fun to played as the killer.","timestamp_created":1511743089,"timestamp_updated":1511743089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37734087","author":{"steamid":"76561198214780496","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4155,"last_played":1588415308},"language":"tchinese","review":"非常棒 優秀的 遊戲,遊戲順暢度跟爽度都滿分 沒有重大bug也是我喜愛他的原因之一,不管被砍或砍人都好玩","timestamp_created":1511742558,"timestamp_updated":1511742558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37733872","author":{"steamid":"76561198137989110","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":114,"last_played":1578307322},"language":"schinese","review":"之前就很喜欢，昨天打了几把，很不错","timestamp_created":1511742322,"timestamp_updated":1511742322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37733015","author":{"steamid":"76561198123994656","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3204,"last_played":1658332129},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME FOR ME","timestamp_created":1511741524,"timestamp_updated":1511741524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37731484","author":{"steamid":"76561198073702222","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5906,"last_played":1616901477},"language":"brazilian","review":"Seja de Ssassino ou de vítima o jogo consegue ser insanamente divertido, os bugs dão ainda mais graça ao jogo.\nGosto exatamente por terem feito A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR!!!","timestamp_created":1511740018,"timestamp_updated":1511740018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37731319","author":{"steamid":"76561198342185995","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1763,"last_played":1657921191},"language":"brazilian","review":"Como não gostar","timestamp_created":1511739851,"timestamp_updated":1511739851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37731087","author":{"steamid":"76561198161529404","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":59697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28148,"last_played":1631379517},"language":"german","review":"Ich spiele Dead by Daylight jetzt schon eine ganze Weile und muss sagen, dass der Spielspaß weiterhin genauso groß ist, wie zu Anfangszeiten.

Obwohl ich dieses Spiel schon viele Stunden gespielt habe und villeicht noch weitere Stunden spielen werde, würde ich objektiv gesehen davon abraten.\n\nZu den Hightlight´s dieses Spiels kann man sagen, dass es eine interessante und aufregende Gameplayerfahrung bietet und das sowohl als Killer, wie auch als Survivor. Es gibt nicht vieles, was spannender ist, als sein erstes Match als Survivor zu verbringen, unwissend welcher Killer auf dich lauert und zudem auch keine Ahnung, wie man sich in seiner Situation am besten genau verhält. Dieses Spiel gibt einem als Überlebenden einen gewissen Kick und das Gameplay mit Freunden kann viel Spass bereiten. Als Killer hast du die Möglichkeit, deinen Alltagsfrust auf harmlose Überlebende auszulassen, die nicht mehr so harmlos sind, wenn sie dich erst einmal zur Weißglut gebracht haben. Denn nicht jeder Survivor hat sich mit seinem Schicksal abgefunden und versucht mit jeder Faser seines Restlebens, dir das deins so schwer zu machen, wie möglich.\n\nZu den Nachteilen, welche meiner Meinung leider überwiegen, lässt sich folgendes sagen:\n[list]\n[*]Du wirst eine Menge Geduld mitbringen müssen, denn alleine schon in einer Lobby zu kommen kann einiges an Zeit in Anspruch nehmen\n[*]Das Game ist offiziell released worden, hat aber noch einige Bugs\n[*]Mit jedem neuen Patch kommen neue Bugs hinzu\n[*]Fast jede Erweiterung ist kostenpflichtig und meiner Meinung nach ziemliche Geldmache\n[*]Ein hohes Troll- und Ragerisiko \n[*]Ein schwieriges Balancing/Unbalancing Problem\n[*]Ein unausgereiftes Ranked System\n[*]Lange Ladezeiten\n[*]Pingprobleme (Die Hostlobby wird vom Killer persönlich gestellt)\n[/list]\n\n[b]- Fazit - [/b]DeadbyDaylight kann dich auf jeden Fall in den Bann ziehen und eine Menge Spaß machen, allerdings ziehen die vielen Probleme das Gameplay runter und verderben einem oft die Lust noch, es weiterzuspielen. Zudem ist das Spiel, wenn man den ganzen Content genießen möchte, ziemlich preisintensiv. Ich würde euch nach derzeitigem Stand davon abraten, euch dieses Spiel zu kaufen.\n\n\nEDIT: Seit der Anfangszeit von Dead by Daylight hat sich viel verändert und das Spiel wurde wesentlich stabiler und nutzerfreundlicher konzipiert. Die oben genannten Nachteile sind größtenteils gefixed und ich kann das Game somit jeden ans Herz legen, der auf Horror Survival steht.","timestamp_created":1511735605,"timestamp_updated":1631353086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37726565","author":{"steamid":"76561198014687887","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8828,"last_played":1640410428},"language":"spanish","review":"muy entretenido","timestamp_created":1511735590,"timestamp_updated":1511735590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37725571","author":{"steamid":"76561198243139454","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1527361179},"language":"english","review":"Shoud i get this?

Here are my thoughts and general idea/issues with the game as it is now.\n\nWhat can you expect, when you purchase the game?\n\n1. Grind\nWhen you first get to the game, there's a lot going on:\nBloodpoints - A currency gained by playing and making actions. This is used for leveling up your characters. You need A LOT of it. Once you finally reach the \"Max level\", which is lv. 50, you can reset the Character levels by the so-called \"Prestige\", which completely resets any perks, items, add-ons you had on the character, so you start from the scratch again. After you gain \"Prestige 3\" (you just Prestige 3 times), you are good to go, you dont Prestige anymore, your character level is capped at 50, but you still can unlock things in the bloodweb.\n\nIridescent Shards - A  currency used to purchase selected characters (If you don't want to spend € on certain DLCs, you can't really buy characters the developers needed license for), costumes and perks from the Shrine (doing so unlocks the perk for every character you own to appear in a bloodweb). Even tho these aren't needed to play the game casually, they help to make the grind smaller. You get this by leveling up your \"Account level\". You get some every level you get.\n\nAuric Cells - A premium currency, you can buy DLC characters and costumes. Not really anything I can say about this. Its just less useful Iridescent Shards, but you dont need to grind the game, but your wallet while getting these.\n\nI really like that you can't buy progress in DbD, and even if you could, it wouldnt benefit you in any way if you got no idea how to use certain perks/characters(talking about killers).\nThe grind is really big if you want to get every perk you want to for a character you like. Not only that you have to level your fav. character 4 times (Prestigeless, prestige 1, prestige 2, prestige 3), you need to level up every other character to level 40. The only things that speeds things up are the Iridescent shards (Which I am highly grateful for!)\nConclusion: The Grind is high, but it's nothing if you aren't a complete casual gamer.\n\n2. High skill ceiling\nThis one is being talked a lot in the DbD community. Some killers get a nerf some patches (*cough cough* the Legion, the Pig *cough cough*), some get a buff/rework (the Doctor, the Nurse for example), the same stands for perks. Meta in the game doesn't really shift in a fast pace like for example in League of Legends, but it does shift.\nBeing able to run meta builds and play them to perfection definitely needs skill and making off-meta builds work needs skill too.\nIt doesn't matter what perks/characters you play as long as you know what they do atleast in theory, everything else comes naturally just by playing and testing things yourself.\nConclusion: Yeah, some nerfs/buffs are pretty stupid, but as long as you are a great player, you'll manage. Skill in this game needs time and every little mistake can cost you a game. Desicion making is crucial.\n\n3. High variety of characters\nIn the early days of the game, there weren't a lot of characters. Now, there's a lot, like a lot! This is a good thing and a bad thing at once. Why? Playing different survivors doesn't matter, every survivor can run, they all work the same. The problem comes with killers. Every killer is unique, not just by appearance, but by power aswell.\nConclusion: Its great you get to choose the characters, but it's a bit hard to keep up with all the different powers of killers, because you need to play atleast a bit differently against every single one.\n\n4. Toxic behavior\nI know the Devs have nothing to do with this, they are penalizing the players as much as they can, but it's still not enough. People leave when matched against a killer they dislike to play against. People leave when things don't go their way. People leave when they get cocky and punished afterwards.\nConclusion: Nothing that the Devs can do anything for this besides a higher penalty, the issue is that the game has to treat ragequitters and people with poor internet connections/peoploe disconnected thanks to a bug differently and it doesn't right now.\n\n5. Bugs, connection problems, matchmaking\nI didn't really want to talk about this at first, but oh boy there's so much wrong happening there. Before dedicated servers were a thing in this game, the killer was a host of the game. Every single time. So lagswitching was a thing(Thanks god people were getting banned for this). \nThe game prioritizes the game connection over rank, I mean, it's not really wrong, until you see the system in action, which matches a rank 1 (thats the highest rank) survivor against, like a rank 13 killer. The ranks go from 20(the lowest) to 1(the highest). This is definitely not something that should happen. Survivors being premade can singlehandedly bully the killer, because the matchmaking doesn't give them a higher rank killer, they give him a killer with an average rank from the premades (To explain this: The survivor premade are ranks 1 - 7 - 13 - 5, if you count the average, it means that the killer matched against them will be around rank 7)\nThe dedicated servers were meant to fix problems, but as they are now, they even make the problems more visible and worse. You see yourself behind a window? Well, too bad, you got a 130ms on that server, so you arent there. You used a Dead Hard perk, which makes you dodge any form of damage and dashing forward a bit? Well, it was used, but not really, here, take your damage. This should be fixed asap. Most of the servers have poor connection from Europe.\nNow, about bugs, you can vault window, meanwhile you don't really vault it. You can repair a generator when the Exit gates are powered up. You can get stuck behind an exit gate, which means you cannot leave the map (leaving you to die by the End Game collapse). And there's more...\nConclusion: Dedicated servers suck, they render some perks useless, they should be fixed. Matchmaking is said to be worked on, so we'll see how that will work out. Bugs will always be in any game you can find. the thing is, some bugs are in the game for way too long or are game breaking.\n\n6. Balance/ Map Tileset\nAfter playing the game for +-400 hours (with higher amount of time spent on the survivor side), I can surely say that a lot of maps are unbalanced. Indoor maps suck, its hard to find anything as a survivor, and finding a path as a killer.\nBecause of a random spawns of the map tilesets, a thing called a \"god loop\" by the players may occur. This \"god loop\" makes the killer IMPOSSIBLE to catch the survivor until the survivor completely leaves the area or makes a HUGE mistake. This sucks, this shouldnt be in the game.\nCurrent state and almost every state of the game it was in favors the survivor side, because it has a higher community I guess.\nConclusion: the Balance team are bunch of Pepegas that barely play the game imo. Tileset spawns should be fixed.\n\nCOMPLETE CONCLUSION:\nEven after pointing out so much what's wrong in the game, I still want to recommend it to anyone I meet. Why? It kept me there for 400 hours of gameplay, of fun, of frustration, of grind. If the game would be bad, I wouldn't be playing it for so long.\nThank you for reading my huge-ass long rating. I hope it helpeed you with the deciding of purchasing the game or not!","timestamp_created":1511733125,"timestamp_updated":1584692268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37723323","author":{"steamid":"76561198028617816","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":926,"last_played":1517951098},"language":"czech","review":"So hey the game could be good.

LOVE this game!\nThere are certain bugs that needs to be attended to and also certain balancing issues, but even with those the game is so fantastic, the devs are doing an amazing job at keeping it close with the players to make sure the gaming experience is as fine tuned as possible, I may not agree with all the changes but I think some might be for the better.\nI think in it's current state (patch 1.8.2) the game is fairly balanced. There are some killers who stand above others and survivors are slightly favored if it's Survive with Friends and everyone knows what they are doing.\nBut with around 500 hours I've had some great fun and made tons of friends playing the game! There's always gonna be the salty bunch that only thinks about winning and if they loose they have to turn it against you in some way, but with this much game time I realise that pretty much every single playstyle is valid (even though some might seem more annoying/unfair than others).\nImagine yourself as a fresh survivor for example... You spawned in for the first time and hear your first heartbeat. It scares the living **** out of you, I've ofcourse been there myself. You're getting chased and you have no idea where to run or how to go about loosing the killer. You get caught an probably facecamped. Don't be sad or discouraged to try again, you will learn the game as you play, try to take tips from others, DBD has a nice streaming and youtube comunity that should be exploited to the fullest, heck you can even ask the killer after the game, they might give you some advice on what you did wrong and it might help you, there's also a great tutorial made by the devs and the players.\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that some strategies are easier and some harder but probably more efficient and you're gonna learn that with time.\nTake a facecamping killer for example, let's say he stands right infront of you and if someone goes for a save and he immediately smack you down, struggle for those extra points aswell as help your team. In the killers case, he is gonna learn the hard way that it sure does take some time for the survivors to die on hooks and the gens vs 3 survivors are gonna go really quickly, aswell as there are so many more bloodpoints to acquire by playing aggresive and stopping those pesky genrushers.\nHow you play the game is up to you and how every match plays out differently makes the game so fantastic, that's why I don't think I'll ever completely leave this game.","timestamp_created":1511730510,"timestamp_updated":1511730510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37719390","author":{"steamid":"76561198055249741","num_games_owned":511,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":20758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8936,"last_played":1654928039},"language":"english","review":"12/10","timestamp_created":1511730313,"timestamp_updated":1511730313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37718638","author":{"steamid":"76561198151667313","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":72170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":32618,"last_played":1660506867},"language":"english","review":"100% bug free","timestamp_created":1511729803,"timestamp_updated":1511729803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461506366729736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37718614","author":{"steamid":"76561198076403695","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6246,"last_played":1649492127},"language":"russian","review":"Качественная хоррор игра!","timestamp_created":1511729789,"timestamp_updated":1511729789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37718590","author":{"steamid":"76561198329396152","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31307,"last_played":1658641270},"language":"spanish","review":"Pese a los constantes reclamos de bugs, el juego es muy divertido y vale la pena jugar y aún más si es con amigos, se hace muy entretenido la intriga y la tensión que mete el juego se le pueden dedicar muchas horas y aún así no aburre","timestamp_created":1511729770,"timestamp_updated":1511729770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37718469","author":{"steamid":"76561198041211018","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":27416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10607,"last_played":1658236707},"language":"english","review":"Love it :D","timestamp_created":1511729677,"timestamp_updated":1511729677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37718397","author":{"steamid":"76561198066376759","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":53695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":457,"playtime_at_review":8798,"last_played":1660606086},"language":"english","review":"Good game and addictive.","timestamp_created":1511729638,"timestamp_updated":1511729638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37718009","author":{"steamid":"76561198044748583","num_games_owned":547,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":52444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44896,"last_played":1653086824},"language":"english","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1511729418,"timestamp_updated":1575122788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37717896","author":{"steamid":"76561197976641037","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1527214019},"language":"english","review":"I very much enjoy this game.

(Can talk to survivors in lobby)\n\n-Tiered rank up system making it harder to rank up as you get higher, but also harder to fall back down.\n\n-Ability to earn points playing with a character you like, then spend those points on another character to level them.\n\n-\"Teachable\" perks which allow you to give perks unique to specific characters to others\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes my poorly formatted review.
