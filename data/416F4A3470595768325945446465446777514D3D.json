off, let me say that I have a fairly significant amount of hours in this game considering I am giving it a negative review. The fact is that most of the time I have played has been with friends, and even if you are doing something you don't like you'll still have fun because you're doing it with your friends. Now that's out of the way, I'm going to continue with the review:\n\nI've played a few asymmetrical games, and I think the thing that defines how the game plays more than anything else is how much power is given to the side that has multiple players. That sets the bar for what general power level the game should have. In some games the \"survivors\" are supposed to be very weak, and in others they are flying around the map with jetpacks and machine guns. The single player side has to be designed with a matching level of power and that sets the tone of the game.\n\nMy issue with this game is that the developers appeared to originally be going for a very low powered game, but they didn't really seem to be all that good at their jobs. The initial concept was pretty much just a game of hide and seek, where the survivors tried to do their objectives and hide while the \"killer\" (single player side) looked around to find them and do slasher movie things to them. That was the concept, unfortunately the developers actually ended up creating an environment where the killer could easily get clowned on by survivors who knew what they were doing. To their credit they have balanced the game a lot better since the initial release, but by doing so I think they have lost the core of what the game was supposed to be about.\n\nThe developers have introduced a lot of options with a very high power level, for both sides, that distorts the game and pulls it away from the originally intended low power level vision they had. This results in a very un-fun experience because both sides have some tools that are the equivalent of bringing a tactical nuke to a knife fight. To their credit the developers have generally tried to fix the worst of these, but when they do a lot of their changes tend to reveal they don't actually know how their own game works and how it is played at a high level, so they generally create almost as many problems as they solve.\n\nThe root problem is that the base gameplay loop is incredibly simple. Survivors have to power 5 generators across the map, which requires sitting in front of them holding the mouse button for 90 seconds while occasional reaction test quicktime events pop up. After that they move to an exit gate and open it, again by standing in front of it and holding the mouse button (no reaction tests this time). The killer is trying to find the survivors and hit them so they fall down, then pick them up and put them on a sacrifice point called a hook, which requires the survivor to sit there as their death timer ticks down doing (what else) reaction test minigames until another survivor comes along and rescues them. This is a very basic shallow gameplay loop, and it works for the original low power level game the developers had in mind, but it doesn't really provide a lot of levers to adjust balance once you see that things are not working.\n\nThis really comes down to proactive vs reactive balancing. The entire history of this game seems to be that of reactive balancing, where the developers don't understand their game well enough to make the right balance fixes, so they are caught in an eternal cycle of nerfing the latest tactical nuke that makes all the players angry, rather than having a proactive plan for how they want their game to play and making changes that push the game in that direction. A side effect of this inconsistent balancing seems to be an incredibly bitter toxic community with an \"us vs them\" mentality. Sadly this is pretty common to asymmetrical games, because people don't seem to realize that both sides have to be balanced and fun to play or else the game will die.\n\nThe last thing I will leave you with is that I don't think this will ever get better. The developers have gone on record saying that they have no intentions of slowing down and doing a pure balance pass because they know they have to keep pumping new content into the game every few months (content that is usually licensed and purchasable with real life money). What's left is a game that doesn't know what it wants to be designed by developers who don't know how their game works, and with a community that seems to be more interested in either blaming the other side for being OP or telling the other side to get good than actually trying to figure out how to salvage this dumpster fire.\n\nThe only reason I can see for this game to have gotten so popular is that it happened to be in the right place at the right time and managed to land some licensing rights for classic horror movie characters. I would highly advise anybody looking at this to find another game that is made better rather than spending your time with this one.","timestamp_created":1656597938,"timestamp_updated":1656597938,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485960245132446289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117929953","author":{"steamid":"76561198807340771","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1656839209},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩！","timestamp_created":1656597783,"timestamp_updated":1656597783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117929262","author":{"steamid":"76561199112695371","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":942,"playtime_at_review":6179,"last_played":1660595945},"language":"english","review":"good game, just avoid meg mains, as they are roaches.\n\nP.S. slay","timestamp_created":1656597036,"timestamp_updated":1656597036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117927748","author":{"steamid":"76561199015462335","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1660050264},"language":"english","review":"nabung 10rb perhari akhirnya kebeli","timestamp_created":1656595418,"timestamp_updated":1656595418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117927141","author":{"steamid":"76561198136570901","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11722,"last_played":1656598506},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun and interactive i would recommend for anyone that wants a fun and scary horror game and it has some of the most famous killers in movie and game history","timestamp_created":1656594963,"timestamp_updated":1656594963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502297103404998779","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117924857","author":{"steamid":"76561198971146520","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1658391293},"language":"schinese","review":"对新人很不友好，匹配到的都是大佬，血压晚上来了","timestamp_created":1656593239,"timestamp_updated":1656593239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515459120273590088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117924712","author":{"steamid":"76561198007823635","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":23808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23730,"last_played":1656735087},"language":"english","review":"Game fell off a cliff when they started to censor.

They happen to me all the time.. I have also noticed them when watching different people stream on discord/twitch also... so I am assuming many people deal with the same issues.\n\n A few examples; \n* You could be running from the keebler and be a decent length away - yet somehow get hit. \n*Hitting the space bar to vault a pallet or a window is a 50/50 lately as sometimes it doesn't work properly and/or has a major delay where you \" freeze \" mid air after you hit space. \n* Hitting the space bar to pull a pallet is also a 50/50 chance, the 50% that it wont pull the pallet you're stuck right next to the pallet and get knocked by the keebler. \n* When another person DCs - SOMETIMES - it will count against the other players of the game that did not DC and cause a temporary play ban.\n* Randomly getting stuck on things you shouldn't get stuck on such as rocks/trees and things like that.\n\nThe body blocking is frustrating - along with the constant camping but the camping isn't as bad if you have a decent team, without a decent team the game will end FAST.

Also the survivors choose like the same 5 perks so its really annoying for the killers. Although there are some bad killers that do annoying things like tunnel which I bet only causes more survivors to use annoying perks like Dead Hard and Decisive Strike. The game doesn't look bad but it doesn't really look good either I don't know how to explain it. \n\nOther than those and couple other issues I can't bother mentioning, I have had some fun times with this game.

If you wish to get hit threw windows because the server that you playing on shows different things for both killer and survivor. Enjoy sitting there while your downed wondering how a hatchet hit you wile you are behind a wall.\n\n-It pulls you in by \"looking fun\" and then when you waste time and money in the game. You don't wanna stop playing because you put to much effort in the game. \n\n-Plus the community is mostly filled with toxic dickheads who wants to do nothing but ruin your experience with killer/survivor.
