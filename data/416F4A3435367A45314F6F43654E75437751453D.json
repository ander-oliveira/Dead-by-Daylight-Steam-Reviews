to CIV　(別ゲーしてろ）と言い放つ\n不手際でお漏らししてしまったバグ並みの強さを誇るパーク（英雄の奮起）は即導入。修正なし。\n途中退室の罰則がほぼ０の為、回線切りは日常茶飯事。肝心の通報システムは全く機能していない。\n\n書き出すとキリがないです。\n\nそして、一番致命的なのが外部ボイスチャットツールに対して何の対策も打たないこと。\n\n試合終了までキラー側のパークをみえないようにする「だけ」の対応に数年待たされました。\nしかしそれも根本的な解決には全くなっておらず、休日ゴールデンタイムのマッチングはずっと前から無法地帯です。\n\nちなみにVCPTを相手にキラーをプレイするのは、よほど手練れの猛者でもない限り勝ち目はありません。\nまた３人を斬り伏せても最後の一人にハッチ逃げされればチャット画面で言いたいように言われ放題です。\n（この辺りは、キラーの側に３人以上殺害でWINと表示すれば、それだけで溜飲が下がるはずなのにそれすら導入しません）\n以上のように、VCPTを相手にすることに一切のメリットがないにも関わらず、キラー側にはたまに混ざったVCPTに対して見た目では何の判断基準も与えられません。その為、一切の対策も打てません。\n同時に４人入ってきた時にキラーは部屋の解散を選択（対戦の拒否）が出来ます。が、この仕様がサバイバーのフラストレーションを高めています。\nそもそも、ボイチャ非推奨を謳っておきながらパーティー戦闘を可能にした事が本当に謎です。\n\n以上の点から、私は、これからこのゲームを検討中の方に購入をお勧めしません。\nキラー側とサバイバー側のマナーであるとか、バランスの問題はどちら側をより長くプレイしているかで大きく評価が変わるところでしょうが、運営の対応の劣悪さは異常です。プレイ時間が長くなるほどにその杜撰さが露呈します。\n人気タイトルですが、やはりその辺がインディーズの域を出ない作品に留まっている理由でしょう。\n\n一刻も早く運営の脳みそが入れ替わる事を祈っています。\n\n2019/06/28 追記\n\nついに公式からVCを認める発言が出ました。\n現在公式が調整に対して触れているのは、野良PTとVCPTの格差のみです。\n\nもうこのゲームは駄目です。絶対に買ってはいけません。\nまもなくキラーは絶滅します。","timestamp_created":1557734235,"timestamp_updated":1561708074,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":109,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.801404118537902832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50622290","author":{"steamid":"76561198028080103","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":49675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":592,"playtime_at_review":20762,"last_played":1659817362},"language":"english","review":"ระบบล็อบบี้ไม่ทำหราค้าบบบบ","timestamp_created":1557733995,"timestamp_updated":1557733995,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451612919569015503","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50621755","author":{"steamid":"76561198036733552","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":35022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3123,"last_played":1636990370},"language":"russian","review":"Я

I just lost the wounded survivor I was chasing, but that was okay - i knew exactly he was going to rescue the hooked one. I threw a hatchet just right - juicy splash sound and scream told me I just got another four-kills round. Just pick up the downed survivor, hook him, and prepare for post-game chat shitstorm. \nDead by Daylight follows a scheme of typical horror - group of friends try to escape a killer. Here we have four survivors and trying to fix 5 generators to power up gates that allow them to escape. Killer on the other had does what killers do - damages generators, hunts survivors and places them on sacrificial hooks. While it sounds simple, maybe even kinda boring (sometimes i catch myself wondering why i have fun watching progress bar of the generator), couple of thousand players every day gotta mean something. \nCurrently, there are 15 killers available in game - from Wraith with his invisibility, through hatchet-throwing Huntress to ever-stalking Shape. Killers differ between themselves by their powers, in addition to perks (later). And as such it requires different playstyle when playing as chainsaw-running Hillbilly, and different when playing as blinking Nurse. Killers also have power addons - they can use up to two of them each trail, with different effects depending on rarity - for example, Huntress can use addons that increase her speed when preparing to throw a hatchet, carry more hatchers, inflict various status effects on hit survivors, or simply down them upon successful throw (although this decreases amount of carried hatchets by 4, where default is 5).\nSurvivors have to outsmart (or outrun, later) the killer, fix generators, and finally open exit gates to survive the trial. They don't differ that much between themselves (other than looks or names) - they are defined by three personal perks, that with progression can be unlocked for other survivors (therefore i kinda see survivor selection as purely cosmetic to some degree). Additionally, they can bring to the trial (or find them in chests scattered around the map) items that can help them win - such as medkits to heal themselves or the others (survivors have 3 health states: Healthy, Wounded and Dying), toolboxes to speed up generator fixes or temporalily destroying hooks, flashlights to blind killers for a few seconds and so on. Just like Killers' powers, those items can have addons attached, which increase their effectiveness or duration of use.\nEvery action provides players with Bloodpoints, which are later used for character (or characters; Bloodpoints are collected per account, not per character) progression. This takes place on the Bloodweb, where each character is offered a few randomly generated nodes containing items, item/power addons, perks or offerings. Each completed bloodweb on given character increases their level, unlocks perk slots (at 5th, 10th and 15th level), and gradually increases the bloodweb size, up to level 50th (which allows to increase perstiege level on that character, in return for prestiege cosmetic set element).\nPerks give character special active or passive abilities which make some game aspects easier, or harder for opponent. Both killers and survivors have their own, shared pool of perks, and each character has 3 unique to them perks - that is until levels 30, 35 and 40 of bloodweb, where they can unlock them to be found by other killers/survivors. Each character can have up to 4 perks active at the same time, and i have to say - it's kinda fun to think of builds to use, even though there are some meta perks for both sides.\nLast type of unlockables, the offerings offer bonuses to the players. For example you can get 50-75-100% more Bloodpoints in given category (Objective, Survival, Altruism and Boldness for survivors, Hunting, Deviousness, Brutality and Sacrifice for killers), increase your, or every survivors' luck by few percent, increase Bloodpoints gained in all categories by 25 or 100% for either you or all players in the game. Some of them influence map layouts or visibility, by for example increasing/decreasing amount of chests with items spawning on the map, increasing/decreasing distance between hooks, or thickening or lessening the mist. Killers can also get Mori offerings, that allow them to either kill the last survivor by their hand, kill one survivor that was hooked at least once, or kill any survivor that was hooked at least once. \nIf you are wondering what to start learning first - Nurses blinks, distracting killers ect. - i'd say develop thick skin first, because the community can be the worst part of the game. There are plenty of ways players can be asses to each other - t-bagging survivors, killers standing next to hooked player to prevent his teammates from rescuing him ect. Truth is, both sides have their own made-up sets of rules, and as such survivors can blame killer for camping even if it was another survivor trying to loop killer near the hook (killers are slightly faster than survivors, so any straight chase in the open has only one ending. Survivors on the other hand have map elements to help negate killers speed, such as vaulting through the windows, dropping pallets ect. This is called looping - using map to distract or escape killer), or by simply checking area around the hook before leaving to find others. Another common \"rule\" is tunnelling - if the killer finds freshly-off-the-hook survivor and his rescuer, survivors are mad when killer goes after already wounded player (common sense, really - enemy you have to hit once to down him vs enemy you have to hit twice). Or calling killers off for using \"overpowered\" perks such as earlier mentioned NOED or Hex:Ruin, which slows generator fixing process (like, come on, there are just 5 totems spawning on each map, and these are in-game for a reason). Killers are no better - they tend to get mad for \"gen rushing\" - survivors focusing on quickly completing generators, usually when one of the survivors is a distraction for the killer (I DID mention that generators are the only thing survivors have to do? Yeah I did - blame survivors for doing their jobs). They also get mad for looping, \"overpowered\" survivor perks, or for bringing flashlights, but the most common reason for killers going toxic on survivors are SWF groups - players grouping up with their friends, usually with some communication app (apart from 2 hand gestures, there is no in-game communication), which gives them some coordination advantage. i'll just add that it's a good idea to play as both killers and survivors - learning strengths of the enemy can definitely help.\nI havent really ran into any major bugs so far (130hrs), there is a ranking system (kinda broken, as it requires tremendous amount of work to progress), and i'm kinda reaching the limit here - I had fun for over 100 hours, there is still plenty to unlock, microtransaction system deserves commendation, you can unlock most DLC characters can be unlocked with in-game currency (Iridescent Shards, for profile leveling), or just their perks on weekly-changing Shrine of Secrets (4 random perks per week, 2 for survivors, 2 for killers), premium currency only for cosmetics (some can be bought with shards).\nAll in all, I'm having fun","timestamp_created":1557656672,"timestamp_updated":1557656672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70601952075958252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50606170","author":{"steamid":"76561198868836156","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":41848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24862,"last_played":1656595606},"language":"english","review":"Remember gamers, bugs are features now","timestamp_created":1557653377,"timestamp_updated":1557653377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50605974","author":{"steamid":"76561198086398559","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":25774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3185,"last_played":1658215665},"language":"english","review":"killers too strong with stupids perks that makes evrything easy for them .\nhabilities with one hit and down","timestamp_created":1557652513,"timestamp_updated":1557652513,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493916571140289307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50605914","author":{"steamid":"76561198873870912","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9562,"last_played":1564844914},"language":"schinese","review":"机制越改越TM垃圾\n制作组都TM是玩屠夫的菜鸡玩意儿\n退游\n","timestamp_created":1557652286,"timestamp_updated":1557652286,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544398784637451172","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50605708","author":{"steamid":"76561198401547957","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2940,"last_played":1643723320},"language":"russian","review":"   Игра повествует о истории четверых подростков, трое из которых отбитые идиоты (разумеется, вы не один из них) и маньяке-педофиле, который питается ими (обожает тушёных Кладетток на обед и фаршированных Маг на ужин).\nВы играете в роли главного рациона маньяка, разумеется, по всем законам подлости, вы единственная надежда на победу.\n   Если же решили перейти линию закона, и рискнуть восемью годами жизни (стать маньяком), то учтите, вашими противниками на этот раз будут мусора под прикрытием, лучшие охотники на любителей \"помоложе\",  которые, будьте уверены, сбегут от вас нахрен.
