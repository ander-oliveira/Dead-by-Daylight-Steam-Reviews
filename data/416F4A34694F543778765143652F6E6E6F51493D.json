this game is torture for yourself, and this coming from a player with over 1500+ hours. Once you reach past the state of the game to where you know you've improved at a high degree and know you're a good player, you'll start to see how awfully designed this game is. First thing is that this is one of the most toxic games you'll ever play if you play for a reasonable amount of time. Doesn't matter whether you play killer or survivor, it's on both sides. In this game there are no winners, The only difference is whether or not the person playing killer is a degenerate who uses all of his perks to make the game as slow as possible. I think games are only supposed to last about 10-15 minutes, but when Reginald the Third has all of his perks dedicated to make the game last even longer it drains your soul ever so slowly to the point that you don't even wanna play anymore. Nobody has any honor at all, the game is toxic, don't purchase this game if you don't want to hate a game ever so slowly as i have. BHVR has no idea how to balance a game. Still awful and the animations are worse than ever. I suggest never playing this game for long, i dread every game i go into now. Both sides of the game are just not like they used to be. Killers used to require lots of skill to reach high ranks and apply good pressure towards survivors and be able to mind game situations to get downs. Now everyone dedicates their entire being to slowing the game down to last forever and playing like a jackass. Survivors to rank up doesn't require you to be good at the game anymore, it just hands it to you. I used to love playing as killer in early 2020 because high ranks you would see really good survivors and I loved playing against it, now you can't tell the difference between a rank 20 and a rank 1 because they all play the same. The player base has grown, but also just became worse in player skill as well. Toxicity is still high, doesn't matter the era in the game its just a toxic game. Just know I told you so when i say don't get addicted to this game because you'll hate yourself every step of the way. Good luck to you.","timestamp_created":1600123304,"timestamp_updated":1632705200,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75981434","author":{"steamid":"76561198220516079","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":56175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12209,"last_played":1656263750},"language":"russian","review":"Все, кто покупал игру менее 14 дней назад, играли менее 2 часов: забирайте деньги.

However, if you do not want to indulge into over-competitive, toxic, bugged yet addictive game this is not recommended. \n\nP.S.

Now, can you get all content for free? yes. Is it worth sinking hundreds of hours of your time to get enough shards for 1 killer? I'll let you be the judge of that. The only other problem with the game is that it, by design, will never feel fair. Its 4 against one, but each of the 4 have next to no power against the killer. While this isn't bad, I feel it may turn away new players simply because they may feel as though they have little power as survivor, and at the same time feel overwhelmed as killer. \n\nAs for the good stuff in this game, I think it is a celebration of horror as a genre, not just horror games, but horror in its entirety. Think of this game as the super smash bros. of horror. I think the gameplay is fun, but can get frustrating very quick, considering the balancing issue mentioned previously. I also like how the game doesn't require friends to play. If solo, play killer. If you have some friends, then play survivor. I also think the perk and add-on system add a very much needed level of depth to the gameplay, and if it didn't exist then I can't honestly say the game is as good as it is. \n\nIn summary, play this game. But if you don't like it for some of the reasons listed above, have some patience. I can assure you it gets better the more you play","timestamp_created":1600119588,"timestamp_updated":1624309064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75979480","author":{"steamid":"76561198013585428","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10057,"last_played":1600119468},"language":"brazilian","review":"comunidade extremamente tóxica, o balanceamento das partidas não existe, longas filas para achar uma partida, impossivel aprender a jogar com um balanceamento tão ruim e comunidade tão toxica, os servidores são uma porcaria, lagão, dão mini travadas que te puxam para trás e além disso o jogo não é fluido.

It's definitely much better if you have a team of survivors that you can communicate with. But on Killer, it can be either really good or really bad when you rank up a lot. Playing solo queue as a survivor can be an absolute nightmare with random teammates so I wouldn't recommend. Otherwise, while the game is heavily flawed in its design, it still can be fun at times when it works well.","timestamp_created":1600109772,"timestamp_updated":1600109772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75972982","author":{"steamid":"76561198383384517","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1634848611},"language":"polish","review":"fajna giereczka","timestamp_created":1600109762,"timestamp_updated":1600109762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75972868","author":{"steamid":"76561198272715900","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":1315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1626226355},"language":"english","review":"is gud","timestamp_created":1600109598,"timestamp_updated":1600109598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75972828","author":{"steamid":"76561198324663377","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3550,"last_played":1653300837},"language":"german","review":"dad","timestamp_created":1600109541,"timestamp_updated":1600109541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459363967180252075","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75972773","author":{"steamid":"76561198233675180","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":21115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13959,"last_played":1658430761},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1600109457,"timestamp_updated":1606592710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75972578","author":{"steamid":"76561199060584450","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1600458676},"language":"russian","review":"слуште но это прекол конечна ставлю класс","timestamp_created":1600109187,"timestamp_updated":1600109187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75972507","author":{"steamid":"76561198072521726","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1242,"last_played":1650426853},"language":"brazilian","review":"É ótimo, só é desbalanceado.","timestamp_created":1600109093,"timestamp_updated":1600109093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iOT7xvQCe/nnoQI="}
