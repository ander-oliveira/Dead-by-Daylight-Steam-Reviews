Don't get me wrong the game is fun, down right addictive, for a while. The premise of the game is a loose 4v1 survival game. I say loose because albeit there are four survivors and one killer the survivors may not actively work together and may even end up sand bagging each other. \n\nThe survivor's primary objective and win condition is to repair five of seven generators to power two exit gates, then open an exit gate to escape. The secondary win condition is limited (as of patch 5.3.0) to the last remaining survivor, in the form of a hatch that appears and opens providing an alternate means for the last survivor to escape.\n\nThe killer's objective and win condition is to utilize their chosen killer's power to injure, down, then hook the survivors and inevitably sacrificing them OR killing them outright (only under certain circumstances can this be done). \n\nThe survivors have to actively evade or waste the killer's time by being chased, in the hopes that other survivors are working on generators. Being chased by the killer is an inevitability. And being chased has quite a steep learning curve to it. Likewise, utilizing each killer's power to minimize the time you spend chasing survivors has the same learning curve to it. Again, the whole interaction and gameplay is actually quite fun.\n\nNow. The not so fun about this game. \n\nThe grind, is atrocious. You can unlock a majority of the characters and killers with in game currency (Iridescent Shards) that are earned by completing countless tome challenges, leveling up, or as various rewards for various reasons as deemed by the devs. Each character comes with three perks that can be unlocked for other characters to use, by progressing that particular character's levels to 30, 35, and 40, by buying out their bloodweb with blood points that are earned every trial. As of patch 5.4.1 there are 29 survivors, and 26 killers that you can unlock. Once the character's perks have been unlocked at the proper level, they are now teachable to any other character. You must find it in that particular character's blood web and unlock it for them to be able to learn it and use it.\n\nThe gameplay. The amount of fun you'll have in any given trial is wholly dependent upon how the other team plays. In regards to the killer, you can be bullied by groups of survivors equipped with various means and items to make your time in that trial a living hell. Likewise with the survivors, you can encounter killer players who will utilize rather scummy tactics to get their win, such as tunneling (going after a survivor that was just unhooked), slugging (leaving a downed survivor on the ground), and camping (lingering around a hooked survivor). These are legitimate killer tactics don't get me wrong. However, there is a limited number of situations to utilize them. Using them outside of those situations just makes the game unfun for the unfortunate victim who is subjected to it.\n\nThe bugs. At this point in the game's life there are countless bugs that crop up some of them are minor and not even noticed. Others have the potential to make the trial unwinnable by one side or the other. And with every new change to the game, a new bug or bugs crop up.\n\nThe community. The community itself is moderately toxic. It's a pvp game, the odds of there being trash talk in post game chat is high. Also, there are streamers/content creators that are partnered with the devs under their \"Fog Whisperer\" program for the most part many of them are genuinely wholesome people. However, some of them are down right apathetic to the next point, which in turn influences their followers to be equally apathetic to it.\n\nThe cheaters. The amount of script kiddies that play this game is note worthy. And there isn't really anything you can do to combat it as a player, despite there being an in game report feature. The general consensus is that it actually doesn't really do anything in the first place.\n\nThe devs. There is absolutely no transparency in regards to what they do to reports of cheaters. It is widely believed that any in game reports of are just ignored entirely. Their website does have a report feature and in order for them to do something they pretty much require video proof of it. Any actions taken or not, is not divulged to the community in any way. Any sort of issues caused in game by any sort of changes to the game? Expect some free blood points in game as hush money until they can figure out how to fix it and patch it out. In stead of actually working to balance out particularly powerful play styles (tunneling, camping, and slugging) they will just release perks that soft counter them.\n\nAfter dumping nearly 1k hours into the game. It is a frustratingly fun game, but I would not recommend it to any new players.","timestamp_created":1640157649,"timestamp_updated":1640157649,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540653407573699951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106276064","author":{"steamid":"76561198380039873","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1599039947},"language":"koreana","review":"도망가~","timestamp_created":1640156923,"timestamp_updated":1640156923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106276026","author":{"steamid":"76561198057589958","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":14513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":2387,"last_played":1659571634},"language":"english","review":"This

Online multiplayer is dead because a few yuppies wanna make money off playing games and resort to calling shit \"competitive\" and streaming their awful content, and so the incompetent developers bow down to them and start to chip away at what is a very fun game at its core. So those of us whose job isn't \"professional gaming\" are stuck with games that constantly cater to the one percent. (Gamerz rize up!) \n\nFun with friends or solo.

Some periods I played with full group of friends, some period I have played alone, some period just played survivor, some period just played killer. \nBHVR has been changing this game a lot since it's release, I saw perks being changed, game mechanics changing as well, good content being added, and so several bugs appearing and never going away too. BHVR has a HUGE team of devs, i 100% expected the game to be more balanced, to have the community happier about the way the game has been changing, but it is not exactly how we feel about DBD.\n\nWhat to expect by playing this game:\n\n- non balanced gameplay experience;\n- very slow fixes for what the community mostly complaint about;\n- Bugs that remains for years;\n- Horn3 community that sometimes acts very toxic;\n- Some horror related content is added often and for what I consider fair price those days, you also can get it with in-game currency;\n\nAll that said, I do still enjoy playing DBD, it is a way better when you have 4 other friends who play it as well so you can play the custom matches. \nIf you are a solo player, I advise you to make friendship with people who you often see playing matches on your region, even if you do not want to use discord,  playing with someone you know will co-op with you, makes you feel a LOT better and enjoying a lot more.  \n\nThe game and it's content quite often get discounts on steam.
