If you want to debate my half ass argument feel free. I'll be happy to shit on your opinion in more detail down in the comments.\n\nThis game is literal garbage. As someone who has 1,600 hundred hours in the game I can tell you that this game is bad and it isn't going to get better any time soon. At first the game is a fun because it is so different from other games, but fades out in a couple hundred hours if that. The first and main issue I have with the game is that it is incredibly unbalanced. It is almost as if the devs are doing it on purpose. Maps are way too big and killers with low mobility don't stand a chance in lower ranks. The maps are not only big but incredibly saturated with completely safe pallets that aren't even able to be played around. On average it takes at least 30-60 seconds for a decent killer to down a survivor assuming they aren't at any strong loops. This isn't enough time to do anything. Survivors can complete multiple gens in this time and killers can't do shit about it. This problem gets even worse when you take into consideration the survivor perks. Some of the perks are down right stupid. Basically you can expect 4 perks on every survivor which include deadhard, ds, bt, and iron will. Unbreakable used to be on this list but survivors hardly even need it now. These perks are basically the only perks used when there are over 100 available to choose from. It makes the game dull, predictable, and not fun to play. The only killers who can actually play decent under harsh conditions are nurse, blight, and spirit. Spirit and nurse are so broken that it actually makes the game fair. Nurse alone makes the whole game change as loops no longer work. Her abilities also force the devs to nerf most of the killer perks because on her they would be too op. This sucks for both survivors and killers because if you want to win you have to play these op killers. The other way you can do well is by just tunneling and/or camping. People hate this but the game encourages and rewards these kind of play styles. It simply works too well. Camping and tunneling provides an easy way to apply pressure that slows the game. The other balance issue is with items and addons. Addons for killers make no sense. They are either completely busted like on blight or straight dogshit like on freddy. Some killers get little to no value from their addons, some depend on them, and some of them are game breaking. On the survivor side they have keys, bnp, syringes, septic agents, and rainbow maps to make the game even more \"fun\" for the killer. These tools and addons need to be changed or removed but the devs do nothing. Even tough its been an issue for years. This is just the end game features. DBD is also incredibly buggy. It features glitches and massive fps drops. It also currently has a huge cheater issue. There must be no anti-cheat because I get hackers at least 2-3 times a day now. It feels so good to hop in a game and have a survivor prevent you from doing anything because of cheats. Really awesome stuff. If your going to buy this game make sure you have no weapons within your vicinity.","timestamp_created":1591408563,"timestamp_updated":1632456004,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498836040496826172","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70362460","author":{"steamid":"76561198823483117","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2374,"last_played":1644698892},"language":"english","review":"No fun.

Es muy difícil que te encuentres a alguien que no sea toxico, que no te haga teabag o el tipico click de la linterna una y otra vez. Se creen buenos cuando en realidad no loopearon al killer sino que le tiraron los 120 pallets del mapa. En el caso de que los mates o te vaya bien en partida, prepárate para que te puteen en todos los idiomas o incluso te deseen la muerte...\n\nA eso si, si jugas de survi es un embole, tenes muchas ventajas ya que el killer no sabe que habilidades podes llevar.

Я ждал новые обновления, новых выживших, убийц, карты и перки. С большим восторгом я брал роль выжившего и старался выживать и прятаться на карте с друзьями и киллером. Были крутые времена. Но зайдя сегодня, а прошло достаточно много времени, я решил поиграть в игру еще раз. И так сказать игру просто отправили на ДНО. Баланса между командой сурвов и келлером нет. Т.е. все шансы на выживания просто урезаны. Доктор без остановки лупит тебя током, у Анны не метательные тапорики, а такое чувство что это гигантское бревно. Деревенщина стал делать резкие повороты на 90 градусов в броске с пилой, скорость у убийц увеличена, догнать они смогут тебя на изи (если бегать по прямой то за секунды 4, а ведь бывают места, где тупо ничего нет, просто лысое поле), радиус броска убийцы при замахе тоже увеличен (я стоял от мана на расоянии вытянутой его руки, заюзал \"крепкий орешек\", игра даже показала, что я его использовал, отбежал от него чуть дальше, убийца сделал удар, и он каким то чудом повалил меня, даже не смотря на то, что я был вне зоны поражения его удара и при этом я был полностью защищен от удара). Лутбоксы кончаются за 10 секунд, не давая завести генератор даже на 1/4. Крюков очень много на карте, и при этом маньяк их видит даже сквозь стены (кстати их ломать теперь не надо, они восстанавливаются за 1мин., это тупо бесполезно). И самое противное, ПЕРКИ УБИЙЦ ДЛЯ ПОДСВЕТКИ ГЕНЕРАТОРОВ, чинишь генератор 1 все нормально, пришел помочь друг, оповещение и местонахождение маньяк получил, генератор заведен на 75%, то же самое. Еще немного и сделают перк для оповещении убийцы того, что ты прикоснулся или прошел мимо генератора. Играть сейчас просто НЕВОЗМОЖНО, шансов на выживание ни каких, даже фуллпати со связью не поможет. Убийц очень сильно бафнули, выживших наоборот. Если решите поиграть за мана и у вас вдруг будет все получаться на отлично (ну ловить выживших) готовьтесь получать много злых комментариев в ваш адрес.","timestamp_created":1591380957,"timestamp_updated":1591380957,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54991382360458374","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70343421","author":{"steamid":"76561198333262851","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":17614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":76,"playtime_at_review":13687,"last_played":1660328402},"language":"french","review":"Malgré quelques bugs qui cassent un peu l'ambiance horrifique du jeu (mais qui vont aussi vous offrir de bons rires), Dead By Daylight est un très bon jeu !
