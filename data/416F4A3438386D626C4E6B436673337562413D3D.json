Or, you can be a killer. There are around six killers to choose from; Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, The Nurse, Michael Myers (DLC) and The hag (DLC)\n\nAll of the killers have different weapons that you can use. Such as with the Hillbilly, you can charge up your chainsaw and sprint towards a survivor, wounding them with your chainsaw. As you play the killer, the way you need to get rid of the survivors is to hang them on meat hooks and sacrafice them so you can win the game.\n\nThere are many maps (locations, as they call it) to play in the game. The maps are:\n\n*The Macmillan Estate\n   *Coal Tower\n   *Ironworks of Misery\n   *Shelter Woods\n   *Suffocation Pit\n\n*Coldwind Farm\n   *Thompson House\n   *Rancid Abattoir\n   *Rotten Fields\n   *Torment Creek\n   *Fractured Cowshed\n\n*Autohaven Wreckers\n   *Azarov's Resting Place\n   *Blood Lodge\n   *Wreckers' Yard\n   *Wretched Shop\n\n*Crotus Prenn Asylum\n   *Disturbed Ward\n\n*Haddonfield\n   *Lampkin Lane\n\n*Backwater Swamp\n   *The Pale Rose\n\nI am not sure if all of these maps/locations are in the game, but they maybe part of the lore. \n\nThere is also a skill tree in Dead by Daylight, best known as 'The Bloodweb'. 'The Bloodweb' is where you can unlock nodes and when you unlock those nodes, you can unlock items, get more perks, add-ons and more content. To unlock these nodes, you need Bloodpoints.\n\nSummary of the Bloodweb:\n\n*There is one bloodweb for each character.\n\n*The Bloodweb is procedurally generated.\n\n*Player spends Bloodpoints to progress through the Bloodweb.\n\n*If the Bloodweb is filled entirely, anoither Bloodweb will be created.\n\n*The higher the level the more of a chance to get rare items.\n\n*The player can unlock permanent perks in the Bloodweb.\n\n*The player can collect add-ons, perks and objects on the Bloodweb.\n\n*The player can collect permanent buffs from the Bloodweb.\n\n*The player can unlock permanent loudout slots from the Bloodweb.\n\nNow for the gameplay.\n\nIf you play as a survivor, you will be in a third-person perspective, whereas if you are the killer, you will be in the first-person perspective. This is so you can see whats around you as you are repairing a generator. If it was first person, it wouldn't really be fair as you cannot see if the killer is near you. Also, there is a heart beat sound to tell you if the killer is near you. If the heart beat is slow/moderate, the killer isn't really close, but if the heart beat is fast, the killer could be real close to you. So I recommend to pay attention to what sounds are playing so you can tell if its a heart beat or not.\n\nIf you get caught by the killer, as the killer is carrying you, you can button-mash A + D to get out of his hold and run. Same goes for when you get hung. Just as you get hung you can hold down the left mouse button to try and get off the hook yourself, without anyone else's help. But there is only a small chance of getting off of it without noone else's help.\n\nIf you are about to be sacraficed, you will need to smash the spacebar and just hope someone is going to come and help you off that hook before you get sacraficed. I don't know if by smashing spacebar can get you off the hook.\n\nIf you are playing as a survivor, you will need to get all of the generators repaired so you can get to one of two escape gates and open them. \n\nNow for the soundtrack/music.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is just great, I have been listening to the theme over and over again, because I really like the combination of the menu theme, survivor theme and the killer theme. The thing about these themes, is that all of them sound the same, but a different instrument is used on each of them, with a twist. My favourite theme out of all of them is the killer theme. I recommend listening to it yourself as I don't really want to spoil it for you.\n\nWe are getting close to the end of this review, but just one thing;\n\nThis game has terrible optimization. If your PC is really good, don't expect to get 60 FPS on ultra settings. I recommend looking up a tutorial on YouTube for how to lower lag on Dead by Daylight. But then again, the developer team was made up of ten people. I think they did a pretty good job of making this game.\n\nI really enjoyed playing this game, I would play it over and over again, but the optimization was just terrible. If they fixed the optimization of this game i will make my score 8.5/10. But for now my score will be 8/10.\n\nAs it is a 8/10 i recommend this game.\n\nEDIT: Its great to see more chapters getting added - more survivors and killers to play as, also the game is now playable on XBONE and PS4. Again, good job Behaviour

I mostly played killer. I got distracted, and didn't play this for 7-8months... I came back and find that all my BP (Progression points) have been wiped. The balancing is worse than ever... I'm not very far in the game and have very few perks, and the survivors can get away WAY too easily. The community has learned to exploit the game: Loop-dee-loop around structures, camping at pallets, meanwhile they can run as fast as the killer, sabotage hooks, the trapper traps use to take a while to escape from,  but now they can escape just about as fast as they get caught depending on tools/abilities, and the matchmaking keeps putting low level players gainst high one... The devs solution? they don't seem to show the player levels before beginning a match. I used to really like that game despite it's flaws, but the balance is way too tipped in the favor of survivors right now... makes half of the game unenjoyable. The community is toxic too, they expect you to catch and hung up survivors, but they whine if you dare camp the hook (or not, you'll be called a camper whatever you do) meanwhile you just need to step away slightly, and the survivors can rescue their friends in a matter of what? 2 seconds?... Also,tThis game reminds me of DUST514 for the PS3 by CCP games...The devs are led by the nose by this stupid toxic community and keep trying to \"balance the game\" to try to please the community, but since they can't please everyone they just make it worse and eventually the game will die.

I gotta say it's an addiction to me.\nThe option \"Survive with Friends\", simply mean premade team for Survivor up to 4 survivors. While in \"Kill Your Friends\" you can invite your friends as survivor and you kill em. You can see reviews from other I ain't gonna say much but do search for gameplay video(not beta version)\n\nThis game is great what's making it imperfect is the glitches while you're in queue for a match(applied on killer or survivor), you'll be automatically quit to main menu or worst blop into a screen where your background wallpaper is the DBD icon pulsing animation while the main menu interface is still there but not functioning although clickable. This forces you to restart the whole game just to start a new queue again.\nAnother turn down for this game is the server, though if theres' enough amount of player I  personally believe dev team will start their dedicated server for this game.\n\nThe reason I don't complain about gameplay is because we doesn't even have enough player and having problem getting in a god damn game.

It's not fun when the killer can SEE YOU when you spawn. You get a piss poor score, and no currency to spend on levelling up. Since there is ALWAYS a basement somewhere on the map with 4 hooks and a chest, surely the killer should always spawn there, so the killer can't see the survivers at the moment of spawn?\n2) Matchmaking can have you with a level 1 surviver, no perks or very very basic perks against a killer with a full load out of pink/purple [top tiers] perks. Again... why bother trying at this point. Surely you should be matched with killers and survivers that match your level with the character you're playing so the experience is fair?\nOther than that this is a really really fun game, but most of the fun is had with friends in a 5 man, because of the above reasons online can sometimes leave you feeling a bit... let down by the unbalanced nature of things.","timestamp_created":1482453515,"timestamp_updated":1482453515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28543129","author":{"steamid":"76561198351466125","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":60701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":112,"playtime_at_review":59876,"last_played":1660008251},"language":"brazilian","review":"De mal a pior","timestamp_created":1482453444,"timestamp_updated":1632968178,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28543091","author":{"steamid":"76561198323150152","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1542864518},"language":"schinese","review":"很刺激呢的一款游戏，不过进入的时候会卡房不知道是什么原因，不过还是很好玩的。比想要寻求刺激吗？那就来玩杀鸡吧","timestamp_created":1482453348,"timestamp_updated":1482453348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28542972","author":{"steamid":"76561198066238374","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1491189334},"language":"english","review":"Out of several hours of playing this game, I have \"successfully\" played as the Killer a few times.
