Things changed, the game did not get better. \n\nThere are several issues that players with many more hours than I have will address, and likely already have in videos on YouTube. The developer Q&A in late January left much to be desired from the developers. They have more of an attitude to ignore existing concerns they are well aware of, and instead seem to verbalize their lack the understanding of what makes their own game fun. \n\nRather than accept the criticism, internalize it, and make the game BETTER, they resort to petty retaliation at the players who voice their criticism. Revoking the cosmetic items from the account of one of these voices under the lie of \"harassing a member of the development team\" is nothing shy of blatant pettiness. Without criticism, these developers have no idea of what changes will keep this game alive, or push the rest of the dwindling playerbase to VHS and alternatives yet to come.\n\nFrankly, the developers' lack of understanding of their own game is a big concern for the future of this game. Notably, their attitude towards their latest MMR system and not knowing what is actually skillful in their own game, and thus deserving of an increase in ranking within the Skill-Based-Match-Making system. High rank means nothing. The high rank is full of sweaty competitive teams, cheaters, new players who manage to survive every game by avoiding the killer entirely but couldn't help the team to save their life, and the best players. But chances are you get matched with cheaters and/or new players against a killer with 6000 hours. There is no real incentive to climb the ranks, yet you do anyways because you never lose ranking, only gain. With enough games, everyone reaches high ranking, only to have more difficult games that absorb your entire focus yet provide less fun.\n\nA lot of changes need to happen, to the game and the developers' attitude. Sadly, it just feels like this game I once enjoyed has fallen due to some complacency and cockiness. Ignoring the repeated concerns voiced by the community and waving it away with lies or some goofy explanation that reflects a glaring misunderstanding of the game, is not the way for this game to evolve or even maintain the playerbase. \n\nI for one, am uninstalling. \nNot because I dislike the game, or don't enjoy it. Not because I side with one influencer or another. Not because I hate BHVR or any of the independent developers that staff it.\nSimply because I do not like the direction this game is heading. I played to have fun, and I'm not having fun with this game in its current state. Ignoring important changes that would make this game fun again is unfortunately a common occurrence. A massive concern for me is the developers' paper-thin skin, getting defensive and hostile towards its players rather than internalizing the criticisms that could make this game great. If I ever wanted to stream DbD on my own channel, the hostility against criticism has convinced me I'm better off steering clear, lest I attract their wrath and they delete all of my dlcs and cosmetics from my account.","timestamp_created":1643165515,"timestamp_updated":1643165515,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.671558082103729248","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108792779","author":{"steamid":"76561199226392891","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2212,"last_played":1658446653},"language":"spanish","review":"nashe\n\n","timestamp_created":1643165239,"timestamp_updated":1643165239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108792736","author":{"steamid":"76561198341050860","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":9217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2063,"playtime_at_review":1609,"last_played":1660466689},"language":"english","review":"Kill \n\n4 doo","timestamp_created":1643165190,"timestamp_updated":1643165190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108792654","author":{"steamid":"76561198067566080","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2578,"last_played":1643164971},"language":"brazilian","review":"\nJogo ruim","timestamp_created":1643165058,"timestamp_updated":1643165058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50199204683303833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108792599","author":{"steamid":"76561198029290596","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":71054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":850,"playtime_at_review":53367,"last_played":1660549066},"language":"english","review":"Good game, it has some issues with balance but any game with this many killers would have the same.

There's a lot of shit it has going for it, too. The gameplay is simple, easy to understand, but has a lot of ways to master neat tricks and skills. There's a ton of builds you're able to do, and many of them are real interesting and creative.\n\nHowever, I can't.\nAll those unique builds and awesome tricks are less useful than just doing what's best. No need to learn awesome techs as survivor when \"Shift - W\" works better against 90% of killers. The game isn't unbalanced, but the balance is made in an incredibly un-fun way, of the best strategies from either side being boring and lame at the highest tier.\n\nThis is not a new problem, but it's becoming increasingly clear they have no intention of addressing it. Recent FAQs have shown clearly that the lead devs don't have a strong grasp of skill; according to their vision, facecamping three survivors is better than getting 9 hooks and have three escape. I don't want to punish a killer for camping if they have to camp, but I don't think anyone in their right mind think that camping and shift-W is the intended state of a PvP horror game.\n\nThis, coupled with their incredibly toxic and immature response to criticism, means that I have absolutely no faith in things to get better. For a long time, they HAVE been getting better. Despite a lot of critiques, Dead by Daylight was a much better game than when I first joined it. However, it seems like it's peaked way too early, because it's just sliding back down. No broken unbalanced matches; only boring ones, where if you want to succeed you have to play as little as possible.\n\nI hope I have reason to delete this review soon, but.","timestamp_created":1643160681,"timestamp_updated":1643160681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108789735","author":{"steamid":"76561198262016595","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2882,"last_played":1649730842},"language":"portuguese","review":"ESTE JOGO É UMA GANDA MERDA MENINOS PSICOPATAS PELO MAPA A 80km HORA O JOGO VAI LITERALMENTE DO 8 AO 80.
