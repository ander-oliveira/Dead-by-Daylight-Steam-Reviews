find a match and the killer rage quits, the game will end even if you didnt get much points so you wasted 15-20 minutes for nothing.\nI'd love to give this game a thumbs up, its great to play these

Игра очень хорошо убивает время, очень короткие игры дают желание сыграть еще и еще. Есть ли интерес в нее играть.. хмм. В основном, вам будет интересней лутать опыт, получать новый уровень, прокачивать перки и другую дребедень, чем сам геймплей. Имхо. \n\nМожно выделить:\n\n- Игра хороша для веселой компании в пати. Иногда происходят весьма юморные моменты. Хоть игра считается хоррором, ничего подобного в ней не заметил. Только если маньяк тихо сзади подойдет, молча сунет и понесет :) \n- Интересная прокачка персонажа и дополнительные улучшения инвентаря. \n- Хорошая атмосфера (если играть одному с выключенным светом) \n\nМинусы:\n\n- Баги ( Застревал в текстурах )\n- ОФК маньяки кемперы :peka: \n- Не удобная система группы, каждый раз приходится приглашать по новой. \n- Частенько выкидывает из игры или в главное меню.\n\nЭтот отзыв построен на 8ч. игры. Так что он может оказаться не правдоподобным, лживым и слегка приукрашенным (но это не так) Это первый взгляд на игру\n\nЕсть друзья - играйте в кооп вместе.

Patch after patch, one after another. Fixing one issue creates several more. It should be called Buggy by daylight. The game now constantly gets stuck in a loading screen both in joining a lobby and when entering into a game.  When you finally get into a match the loading screen takes so long. That most people dump out. I have been loaded into a playing field with only 2 survivors and the killer so many times lately. It is sad!  It's no longer worth the time it takes to get into a match.

Out of the past 6 times I've tried to start the game, it's crashed or froze 6 times. Even for $20 this is unnaceptable. \n\nThe one thing they have nailed is the tension of hiding from a killer, but the gameplay and game itself are a mess. \n\nImagine playing a multiplayer game where every single action (fight/struggle, interact with object, use object, etc.) are all mapped to one button. Then, imagine your ultimate goal in the match is to stand in place 4-5 times for 60 second intervals watching a progress bar slowly fill and hope the killer doesn't find you. It's just as boring as it sounds. \n\nAs for the role of killer, your job is to chase four survivors around a jagged, unpolished map. The issue is that to complete your task, you need to keep eyes on the vitcim until they're entirely dead. This encourages camping and ruins the game for surviors, since the survivors are disadvantaged by losing a teammate and have no way to damage the killer. Even if your vision is briefly stunned by a flashlight, its easy to follow a wounded survivor and throw them back on the hook. It gets old fast for survivors, but it becomes frustrating and tedious to chase skilled survivors as the killer too. \n\nTL;DR: The gameplay is just incredibly shallow and is almost intentionally designed to cause infuriating situations and rage quits. \n\nI have no faith in the developers ability or desire to polish the game. They're more concerned with adding paid content than fixing the game breaking bugs that riddle the game. Every new content release only makes it worse, which shows a lack of internal testing or concern on the part of the developers-- even after they've decided to milk you for an extra six bucks to get new killers/survivors. \n\nIt's fun for parties or an occasional scare, but overall it's not worth your time. Wait for Friday the 13th instead.","timestamp_created":1483486872,"timestamp_updated":1489787196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28991002","author":{"steamid":"76561198259306014","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":15,"playtime_at_review":6533,"last_played":1659732558},"language":"spanish","review":"*Positivo:\n- Las partidas nunca son iguales (ya sea por las estrategias usadas por cada jugador, mapa que va cambiando de sitio los elementos y tus habilidades).\n- 4 amigos juntos es fiesta asegurada.\n- Realmente vives la tensión.\n\n*Negativo:\n- La comunidad es bastante toxica:camperos, jugadores egositas, vaciles, etc...\n\n\n¡ JUEGO RECOMENDADO !","timestamp_created":1483486089,"timestamp_updated":1516822632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49773755669593811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28990951","author":{"steamid":"76561198104358778","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25910,"last_played":1502012679},"language":"schinese","review":"this game very cool","timestamp_created":1483485977,"timestamp_updated":1483485977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28990936","author":{"steamid":"76561198290267411","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2651,"last_played":1597163820},"language":"italian","review":"l'idea del gioco è molto bella...il problema è che è pieno di bug mannaggia a zeb89 che mi ha fatto venire la voglia di comprare  sto cazzo di giocooo.\nComunque mi diverte giocarlo con gli amici","timestamp_created":1483485929,"timestamp_updated":1484172525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28990519","author":{"steamid":"76561197967770426","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4886,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3108,"last_played":1572256384},"language":"german","review":"Das Spielprinzip an sich überzeugt sehr.
