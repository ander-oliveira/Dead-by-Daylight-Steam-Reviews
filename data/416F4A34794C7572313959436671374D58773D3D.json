So I though it is time to re-do my review.\n\nThis game is an interesting concept, having the “horror film cliches” into one playfield and see what happens. 4 humans with different perks against a single but “OP” killer, rushing for survival, or killing them all (not talking about the killer).\n\nAs one reviewer said, this game suffers from the same problem as many multiplayer titles, a toxic community. But the approach of cutting communication in-game is sometimes a marvelous thing (no whining or insults while playing).  I come from a good group of players in L4D, but to get there had to play with an incredible amount of assholes for a long time. Even a good group has its up and downs (like any good family). To play this, you have to shut down your “Cooperative gameplay” chip down.\n\nIf you're survivor, you can play as a helpful companion, but as stated before, this is no regular coop, this is a horror movie! How many times the cool dude got wack because tried to play hero? Or the asshole used somebody injured to lure the bad guy away? Or it is new for you that a screaming victim may be a trap set by a sadistic killer to get 2 for the price of 1??? well, this is life baby, this is DEAD BY DAYLIGHT.\n\nOnce you get that into your head (I had to, believe me). The game is quite enjoyable (for both killers and survivors). Of course escaping as a group is rewarding, but so is killing everyone XD.\n\nThe game has been tweaked a lot since I bought it. That is sometimes good (like the new ping meter in lobby), but also introduces bugs, like the lost of all progress! Its quite bad. There is a post of how to backup your local save but most people (including me) read it AFTER you lost all :( does not happens often, but is a real risk.\n\nWith the ping indicator, is now easier to participate in a good game, most of the bugs come from sync problems between you and the game's host (no server model, unfortunately) so if you only stay in lobbies with a good connection, there is a great chance you will be fighting for survival, not framerates XD\n\nI think this game worth buying only on sale. There is still issues to look but its different, and I like it for that.

This game is atrocious, and no matter how much the community complains that killers are OP, you will always have those who defend, and the devs are only making the survivors worse with each update.  For example, they just released a new killer called the Nurse.  She can teleport, or blink forward.  Doesnt matter if you throw down a pallet or anything, she can avoid those.  When she hits you, she has an ability to see where you're at in a certain radius.  So lets say you're playing, and she swings and hits you, you will never be able to get away from her unless she is fucking stupid.

Das Spiel hat jedoch viele nachteile, das Lobby-Such system wurde gefixt, dennoch sind sehr viele andere Bugs im Spiel. W.z.b ist es viele male passiert das ich in manchen Maps an einer Wand oder einem Stein hängen geblieben bin. Sehr viele male ist es auch passiert das wenn man an einen Harken gehangen wird, der Spieler am Harken \"herum fliegt\". Sprich seine Animation verschiebt sich. Dies ist jedoch nicht so schlimm. Manchmal habe ich als Killer eine art hacking bug entdeckt. Wenn ein Opfer zwischen einen Generator und dem Killer läuft, kann der Killer die Harre von dem Opfer sehen wie diese den Generator teils verdecken. Somit wissen manche Killer auch wo man selbst ist. Gerade ist mir etwas ungewöhnliches passiert, ich war mit meinem Freund als überlebender am Spielen, da treten irgendwie 3 weitere Überlebende dem Spiel bei. Sie haben sich nicht bewegt, ich denke das es ein Verbindungs fehler war oder sowas. Das Spiel ist sehr unfair im moment, die Maps sind teils zu klein weil meistens der killer einfach vorbei kommt und dich down bekommt. Das Spiel ist im moment sehr unfair, es ist nicht sehr \"ballanced\".\n\nMeine Bewertung ist jedoch negativ aus einem gutem Grund. Das Spiel ist keine 20 Euro wert, es ist für den jetzigen stand des Spieles viel zu viel. Das neueste Update mit der Krankenschwester war kostenlos. Die Entwickler haben vor kostenpflichtige DLC's zu veröffentlichen. 20 Euro für ein verbugtes Spiel wo die Entwickler auch noch mehr für haben wollen. Eine Nachricht an die Entwickler: You are not EA if you think not fixing bugs rather than creating more buggy content that costs money is okay, then you are wrong! Listen to your Community or you will loose it! \nGanz klare kaufempfehlung, aber im moment ist das Spiel das Geld nicht wert.

Tons of DLC being brought out, Tons of new content, and tons of reworked content.\n\nTo be quite quick in this review, yes, this game is incredibly fun, in fact, I play it all the time. I don't see any reason to not have this. If you're wondering about the mixed reviews this game has now, there was recently a patch that brought more power to the killer's side, and took a lot of it away from the survivor. Being able to use really powerful perks twice in a row during a chase is not fun, which is what the patch fixes.\n\nAlso a very famous youtuber/streamer OchiDO got hardware banned because of his incredibly high amounts of toxicity and use of exploits.

Если совсем кратко, не вдаваясь в подробности - есть 4 замызганных, перепуганных человечка и один брутально-сумашедший мясничок ( которого есть аж 4 разновидности ). Задача маньяка - в идеале поймать и засадить на крючок ( да именно, большой железный крюк ) хотя бы одного студентика. В свою очередь, задача простых людишек - сбежать из этого шизанутого места ( желательно не ногами вперед). Есть два способа сбежать - активировать 4 генератора, таким образом подав питание к двум воротам ( которые, кстати тоже придется открывать, тратя драгоценное время)или же дождаться/оказаться в ситуации, когда все твои 3 товарища отправились в небытие. Тогда на карте открывается люк ( который, кстати, генерируется рандомно), с помощью которого вы можете попрощаться с дяюшкой палачом. Несмотря на то, что мужичок с тесаком имеет довольно много преимуществ, работая в команде ( Хотя бы попытайтесь, серьезно. Помогая товарищам, вы не только увеличиваете шансы на победу всей команды, но и получаете много очков. Отсидеться в будке толчка всегда успеете ) и включив собственную голову, обхитрить и победить становится вполне реально.\nГеймплей довольно интересный, хотя и порой до противности простой и шаблонный. Для полной остроты ощущений, советую играть раунд за жертву, а потом за маньячка. Скорее всего, после 20-го раза ваше сердце не будет биться в унисон с таковым персонажа, но чувство стелса имеет месть быть ( хоть и весьма примитивного ). Да, игра сейчас малость сыровата, туда можно бы добавить чего-нибудь более крипового ( фразочки маньяка и т.д) и реалистичного. Однако, я надеюсь, что этот продукт постепенно будут улучшать и обновлять, так что поживем-увидим.\nПокупать игру, отбирая последние деньги у мамки из кошелька не советую, но и кидать говном в эту игру ( пока что ) тоже не буду.\nP.S Но должен признать - это довольно приятно засадить на крюк чувака, который мансовал и доставал тебя на протяжении 20 минут :3","timestamp_created":1471810952,"timestamp_updated":1471810952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060590","author":{"steamid":"76561198044817122","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2748,"last_played":1578542675},"language":"english","review":"Don't buy this game.

I have won matches against level 20 and up players when i was level 1 because you have to be unpredicatble as both a human and a monster. another issue is the lobby and waiting area is shit. you might wait anywhere to seconds to upwards of 10 minutes to get into a game and those games range from 5 minutes to 40 minutes.\n\nThe developers are constantly working on and updating the game and for $20 give or take that beats out some AAA games. if you have the bill to spend i'd get it. the game can only get better and once you get the hang of your role and how it fits in with your gameplay the game itself becomes quite enjoyable.\n\n7/10 because of tech issues, meh graphics, balance issues that will most likely be addressed with upcoming patches (at which point i'd move it up to an 8/10)","timestamp_created":1471810837,"timestamp_updated":1543193299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060514","author":{"steamid":"76561197960667870","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1357,"last_played":1641892547},"language":"danish","review":"Must say im amazed, this game is awsome, and will surely buy it  :o)\n\nThx for the Dead by Daylight free weekend, made me change my mind about this game, had a blast  :o)\n","timestamp_created":1471810700,"timestamp_updated":1471810700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060485","author":{"steamid":"76561198045307872","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1625451402},"language":"english","review":"I really love this game, but there's some issues with matchmaking and some bugs.

I would seriously recommend using headphones to play well as a lot of the queus are audible and need paying attention to in order to be good at this and up your rank.  I also suggest playing a killer and survivor at different times so you can learn more about how to be good at both.  All-in-all, I think it is an ecxellent game with even greater potential for future DLC.","timestamp_created":1471810382,"timestamp_updated":1471810382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060375","author":{"steamid":"76561198013872098","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":9504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5678,"last_played":1636148283},"language":"english","review":"great fun, great direction, new content is good and the devs listen to the community","timestamp_created":1471810340,"timestamp_updated":1471810340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060371","author":{"steamid":"76561198074812078","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1091,"last_played":1523325155},"language":"brazilian","review":"-Matchmaking falho.\n-Jogo em completo desbalanceamento(principalmente com o monstro da DLC).\n-Muitos Hackers.\n-Sistema de lobby bugando.\n\nMas apesar disso o jogo é bem divertido, se resolverem os problemas citado acima ficaria um jogo incrivel.","timestamp_created":1471810327,"timestamp_updated":1471810327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060369","author":{"steamid":"76561198208655431","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":15367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1554831595},"language":"english","review":"Fun game ^^\nOne of the best game i ever seen :)\n9/10","timestamp_created":1471810326,"timestamp_updated":1471810326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060360","author":{"steamid":"76561198037834899","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2342,"last_played":1559257896},"language":"german","review":"Perfect game when you're a horrorfreak! fucking love this game <3","timestamp_created":1471810294,"timestamp_updated":1471810294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493381291627883911","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060355","author":{"steamid":"76561198153901908","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":13407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11905,"last_played":1583938040},"language":"thai","review":"กูลบเกมทิ้งละ เลิกๆ พอกันที กะนิสัยคนไทย(ส่วนน้อยมากกูไม่รู้) \nเเต่กูเจอเเต่ไอ้พวกเฝ้า เล่นเเบบกากๆ ยืนเฝ้าเป็นหมาหวงก้าง \nไอ้คนพัฒนาเเม้ง ทำเกมออกมาดีขึ้นนะ เเต่นิสัยเด็กหัวเกรียนเล่นเกมของไทย เเย่สุดๆ กูรับไม่ได้\n\nถ้ากูเจอเกมสองเกมไม่มีปัญหา เเต่กูเจอทุกเกมที่เล่น พอๆ วันไหนเกมมันคิดถึงเรื่องนี้เเล้วเเก้ไขกูจะลองกลับมาเล่น \nเเต่ตอนนี้กูลาละ FUCK","timestamp_created":1471810284,"timestamp_updated":1493483285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25060337","author":{"steamid":"76561198052270309","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1472994104},"language":"czech","review":"Zajímavý nápad.
