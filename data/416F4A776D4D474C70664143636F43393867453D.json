My whole life I've been a fan or horror movies, so I was so excited to find a game that made those movies a reality. I love the idea of having a team of 4 survivors working together to overcome the killer. I do think there are some ways the game could be improved thought. In my opinion, I believe the killer is overpowered in the beginning, and the survivors are overpowered at the end of the game. I do believe the quirks could be improved as well. And of course, I would love to see new content for the game. Possibly more modern killers, like Jason, Chucky, the Grudge, etc. I also think there should be an option to create your own survivor character so you can feel more a part of the game. Dead by Daylight does host events frequently with the seasons, and they do come out with new stuff frequently and keeps you hooked. So at the end of the day, I recommend this game to all of my friends. This game definitely catches me off-guard sometimes and makes me scream, but I love the adrenaline this game gives the survivors. This game could use some improvement, like anything else. But I will always come back to play this game, and beg my friends to join me.","timestamp_created":1581835201,"timestamp_updated":1581835201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518471300601959229","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63591215","author":{"steamid":"76561198003723216","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1658489809},"language":"russian","review":"не страааашнооо","timestamp_created":1581834970,"timestamp_updated":1581834970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63590973","author":{"steamid":"76561198129471543","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15573,"last_played":1601311599},"language":"russian","review":"Иногда можно сесть поиграть, расслабиться.

Simply because too many players use that perk so much other than other perks.

The bugs and glitches of this game is what also plays apart of making this game fun. I played friday the 13th before this game. My friend told me about dbd. After have played 10 hours of the game I was instantly hooked. I honestly prefer dbd then ft13 (friday the 13th) If you are wondering about purchasing this game I recommend you to buy it.\n\nEdit: Okay I decided to get more in detail about this game considering that a review like I made is honestly probably not going to help. Okay so i am going to describe this game best I can. This game can sometimes make you rage and never want to play this game. But then eventually you'll come back. For me I would recommend playing survivor first then killer only because survivor is less challenging in my opinion. Oh by the way I used to play on Xbox and I'm now transitioning to PC. Once you have learned how to play survivor then you should probably go start killer. Oh yeah I'm really making this game sound great but! There are downsides to this game. If you are playing as killer and lets say you run agitation NOED (No one escapes death) Hex ruin andddd umm Nurse's calling you will probably get called alot of welll bad things. Why you may ask? Well usally if you run these perks you're considered a try hard. I've been called this may times even on Xbox. I don't care what poeple say but I really do find it sad. This rarely ever happens on the survivor side though. Okay now lets get back to the good side of this game. This game has many characters to chose from. Even for free. wether on the killer or survivor side. But you should probably main a certain type of killer only reason why is because each killer has their own unique ability. And you could find that ability usefull or useless. I personally really like Nurse because her blinking ability is really fun to use and for me adds that bit of intensity. My second favorite is Huntress. I like her because you could hit people close or from a far. My favorite survivor is Nea karlsson, Why? Well because of a youtuber named No0b3 My least favorite killer and survivor is Ash and then legion. ANywyas now I'm going to talk about load in times. Now for survivor you could easily get in a game in less then 30 seconds. For killer though it could maybe even take a hour. My longest wait time is 35 minutes. Now for my ratings\n\n\nGraphics:7.5/10\nKillers and Survivors:8.3/10 (A good mix of both)\n\nAnyways thats it for my review hopefully you found this helpfull!","timestamp_created":1581823540,"timestamp_updated":1581824710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63583866","author":{"steamid":"76561198965523728","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5454,"last_played":1655967234},"language":"spanish","review":"es bastante entretenido","timestamp_created":1581823226,"timestamp_updated":1581823226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63583238","author":{"steamid":"76561198207364287","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":8192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3485,"last_played":1615149299},"language":"turkish","review":"efsane efsane efsane","timestamp_created":1581822128,"timestamp_updated":1581822128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63582930","author":{"steamid":"76561198434025679","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4282,"last_played":1638084707},"language":"koreana","review":"ｽﾐｲｽﾐｲ","timestamp_created":1581821605,"timestamp_updated":1581821605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63582641","author":{"steamid":"76561198809975194","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6364,"last_played":1639297120},"language":"schinese","review":"挺棒的，就是网不好","timestamp_created":1581821142,"timestamp_updated":1581821142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63582629","author":{"steamid":"76561197979192884","num_games_owned":1076,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4297,"last_played":1524528830},"language":"english","review":"Everyone but the killer is lagging: The Game.","timestamp_created":1581821120,"timestamp_updated":1581821120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.41611441969871521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63582440","author":{"steamid":"76561198805967042","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4737,"last_played":1656830359},"language":"english","review":"I hate this game\n\nBut i like it because its like nothing else, its like a drug.

You will die a lot from killers with bullshit perks and you having none. People memorize the maps and know where you are. They come straight to you and it almost looks like hacking, but it tends to be memorization. So be ready for rage, hate, and annoyance with players hiding and doing nothing then magically getting more points than you. Long time players might say \"Oh this guy is just full of it with only 18hrs. Don't listen to him!\" These are people with hundreds or thousands of hours and also memorize the maps and have all the really good perks. Starting out and for countless hours you will despise this game. The only reason I'd even say give it a chance is if you have a FULL GROUP of people and like to mess around and NOT win the game. Do that and its tolerable. Play solo or duo and you WILL rage. \n\nThey have so many server side lag issues and bugs. Jump through a window to escape? Doesn't matter, the killer can time the hit to still get you 4ft from the window. Drop a pallet or jump over it to escape? Same thing, killer still gets a hit. \"Meg can outrun most killers\" Totally wrong. You can outrun the killers nobody plays, so I guess then you can correctly say that. But don't count on getting away on actual played killers. \n\nTo end this. If you're a long time player with multiple accounts then you will love this game.

Go figure.\n\nThe things that need fixed:\n\n- [Maps] Map size: Maps are too big, gens get done on certain maps before the killer can even reach them (especially after the removal of the Perk Hex: Ruin)\n- [Offering] Mori's: They need to be removed or need to be changed so that a killer can only mori after the second hook, not the first. This way survivors won't feel cheated out of a win.\n- [Item] Purple/Pink Keys: Need to be removed, early hatch escapes are ridiculous and steal away games from the killer. \n- [Perk] Decisive Strike: Needs to be severely changed so that the killer won't be cheated out of a win when they have the chance to pick up a survivor that was unhooked far away from them and happens to be downed again in a short span of being unhooked.\n- [Servers]: Dedicated servers are a blight and obviously don't work as intended due to hitbox glitching and being hit as survivor / hitting as killer when you're really not supposed to.\n\nIf the bulletpoints above are fixed, I would unironically play this game every single day. As of currently, I can barely stand to play either sides without dying of boredom or frustration for longer than a few matches.","timestamp_created":1581808327,"timestamp_updated":1581808327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484607100486755371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63575160","author":{"steamid":"76561198065254559","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1648350097},"language":"english","review":"good gam","timestamp_created":1581807800,"timestamp_updated":1581807800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63575155","author":{"steamid":"76561198425691552","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":136641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84751,"last_played":1639485794},"language":"russian","review":"помойка","timestamp_created":1581807789,"timestamp_updated":1581807789,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557018041610717773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63574627","author":{"steamid":"76561198268375201","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":125124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1839,"last_played":1658838047},"language":"german","review":"eh gut","timestamp_created":1581806922,"timestamp_updated":1581806922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63573971","author":{"steamid":"76561198087864281","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":73633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61472,"last_played":1630414861},"language":"german","review":"I have a hate/love relationship with this game.
