Most fun with friends but I have spent most of my hours as killer.\n\nThere is a big learning curve when you first start\n- You get rolled often\n- You will most likely struggle on either side\n\nHowever, this is a game that opens up as you spend more hours.  You began to understand perk synergies and the ways you handle playing against/as the different killers.  I would recommend to play both sides as you are learning the game is it will give you great tips on what killers are capable of and on the other side understanding what survivors do that makes you frustrated as a killer.  \n\nTransaction System:\n-  The great thing about DBD is that you can earn every perk in the game w/o spending any $$$ through the shrine.  You can also buy any non-licences character using points earned from playing (Licensed characters are those from other franchises, i.e Ghostface, Leatherface, Michael Myers).  If you want the licensed characters you will have to pay for the DLC. Steams sales are a great way to pick up the DLC as you will find many to be 50% off.\n\nI am not going to say there are not issues with the game:\n- Some play styles are just incredibly boring/frustrating to play against (Camping/Tunneling/Gen Rush)\n- When you play solo survivor, your team can hurt you more than the killer\n- Some people are just toxic\n\nI am excited for the next mid chapter release that will include a major perk overhaul as well as reduce the grind to earning stuff for your characters.  I think this game is very much worth the $20 full price but if you can pick it up for $8 on sale its a steal!\n","timestamp_created":1658082288,"timestamp_updated":1658082288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118970637","author":{"steamid":"76561199106476919","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":334,"playtime_at_review":2879,"last_played":1660593875},"language":"russian","review":"имба

game has an insane amount of people playing it, on pc its 50k+ all the time and that doesnt count crossplay at all, but the q times are fucking horrible. for both sides its bad.game should be free if youre going to make everybody pay for new killers and survivors. if they changed that the game would invite a lot more people into. survivor items create an insane amount of rng though, and the only thing justifying it is killer addons. which are both unknowns based on bloodtree rng and if the player just has guap sitting there. the grind is quite dookie fart and doesnt feel satisfying when you do get new perks for survivor, i feel like the best perks use exhaust and the other ones are so situational and make you useless to use them. boon of healing is insane and the perk given to counter it is so bad, it should reveal the every survivor on the map for 6 seconds instead of just in the area. instadowns in most forms are just horrible for the game imo and kill all momentum for the survivors instantly unless person getting instadowned has looped killer for 2+ minutes. also the new ranking system is dogpoo, why if a teammate loops a horrible killer for 4+ minutes and i do 3+ gens i dont gain a pip for escaping. why must i be chased for a long ass time save 8 teammates safely and heal everybody 22 times while doing all 5 gens to receive 2 pips on survivor but while i play killer i run at people and smack them and i get 2 pips every game. the players between the ranks makes no difference, why am i ranking up to still play with the most worthless shitcan teammates who are playing in the dirt and standing around 90% of the game. i still think the game is good and fun but some shit is

Я просто наиграл в эту игру мало часов и заходил в неё чисто отдохнуть. \n\nЕсли вы желаете плотно засесть в эту игру, то забудьте, просто сразу забудьте, бросьте клавиатуру в окно и сходите в парк погулять. Самое злостное и токсичное комьюнити во всем мире, даже любвеобильные дети в Дотке нервно курят в сторонке после очередной слитой катки, но тем не менее есть и положительные люди т.к от скуки запускаю стримы на Твиче, то частенько заходят очень доброжелательные люди, примерно 1 из 3-х токсиков.  Бывают моменты, когда люди после игры заходят в Стим и в комментариях благодарят за игру, похоже я очень везучий. \n\nСама игра достаточно интересная, большой выбор из персонажей, но многие только за донат, ну это и понятно ибо платить за персов из разных вселенных тоже нужно. Выжившие как и Маньяки на любой вкус и цвет, для любого игрового стиля найдется свой любимчик, но увы, если любимчиков у Вас оказалось больше 1, то часов на 100 вы обречены фармить осколки для прокачки персонажа. На непрокачанном персонаже играть скучновато, но это и так понятно, но пары часов хватит чтоб начать играть уже на средне прокачанном персонаже, возможно набивать очки помогут доброжелательные маньяки, демоны, кровопийцы,  которые захотят пофармить. \n\nЕсли Вы желаете достичь высот в этой игре - будьте готовы потратить сотни часов на гринд, оттачивание навыков и бесчисленное количество пыток и унижений и превращение в токсика, корящего на багованные механики.\nВ игре за выжившего Вам поможет хорошая команда из знакомых и голосовая связь по Discord; в игре за маньяка - стальные нервы и грамотные билды из перков, которые ещё нужно суметь получить. А на высоких уровнях рейтинга будьте готовы внезапно встретиться с читерами.\nНу и куда без любимых стримнайперов, которым в кайф играть не своими руками, а подсматривая за вами. Игровых куколдов тут тоже много.\n\nХороший хоррор выживастик для отдыха, который ещё живой C:\n\n\n\nТак же это хороший симулятор коммуниста, где вы можете спокойно и без зазрений совести прийти с серой вещью, а украсть редкую, а то и ивентовую \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2836415720\n\n\nЕщё в этой игре полно графического ха-ха\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2836415643\n\nКуда без ленивых тиммейтов, которые не хотят чинить гены, а просто лежат!

I really enjoyed the game however I ran into an issue. My steam account had been hacked and as a result all the perks, survivors and killers were given to me, taking the fun out of the game. I emailed support asking them to reset my progress but they said they provided no such services. I stopped playing the game for months until recently when I returned.I opened the game and was ready to play once again but I was met with an error. I took to YouTube, forums and everything that I could find on the issue but nevertheless I couldn’t solve my issue. I emailed support and they took days to reply. They presented me with a list of questions, all of which I answered and sent to them. They got back to me saying that I had already appealed towards a ban which I had never done before. I wrote an angry email asking if they could fix my issue stating that my emails had nothing to do with a ban. They responded saying that they had explained that my issue was because I was banned, which they didn’t, and I couldn’t fix the issue. I have just written them an email explaining that the game has been a horrible experience on both my devices as they have neglected me on pc and the servers have been horrible for everyone.

Dafür dass manche Leute unfair spielen, kann ja das Spiel nichts und ist halt bei Online Games so. Vielleicht sollte es schärfere Konsequenzen geben, wenn ein Spieler wegen unfairen Spielverhalten gemeldet wird. Da weiß ich allerdings nicht, was es für Möglichkeiten gibt. Ansonsten einfach damit leben. Es gibt auch wieder bessere Runden!
