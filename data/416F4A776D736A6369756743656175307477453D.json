You can take a role as survivor to escape from ruthless killer by helping each other or become selfish one (and you may killed anyway) and escape the place by entering the exit gate, or you can take killer role and hunt down all your prey (this is seriously fun). Both role have completely different gameplay mechanic, so it's like buy two games actually.\n\nPROS :\n+Multiple perk for both killer and survivor you can choose, this make the gameplay more variable depending on your playstyle\n+Offering system that also can change the gameplay like map or mori (for killer) that make you can control your strategy to the fullest\n+Regular update like new map, killer and survivor from developer that still continue and make the game fresh\n+Unique skill (that you can modify with add on) for every killer you can choose to suit your playstyle (not all the killer is free tough) and many different items for survivor to help you survive the game, make the game more balance\n\nCons :\n-Optimization... when my laptop can run resident evil 7 on highest set and get 40-60 fps, this game force my laptop to run on low set with 20-50 fps (mostly 30), kinda bad actually\n-No dedicated server (for now, because the developer will make it soon), this make the killer become host, and when the killer have bad internet, survivor will suffer lag and often teleport anywhere\n-Loading screen bug on survivor, which is happen when joining the lobby (this happen to me like more than 10 times), all you can do to fix this is exit the game and start it again\n\nWell, i can say much about this game yet, because i just play it for 180 hours. Remember that as multiplayer game which is 1 vs 4 this game can be kinda toxic, or even more, the survivor mad to another survivor, but still, not all people like that, so it's depend on it's people. If you want to buy this game and play alone, you may better play as killer and hunt survivor, playing as survivor with random people is kinda hard, that you can't communicate each other, but survive with friend is seriously fun, even if you dead anyway. The game itself is worth the price. And if you want to help the developer, you may buy the DLC that allow you to use another killer or survivor.","timestamp_created":1546622026,"timestamp_updated":1546622026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483641535043716431","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099963","author":{"steamid":"76561198304333886","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6444,"last_played":1625544844},"language":"english","review":"Bit glitchly but a good bit of fun with a little skill curve to keep you playing","timestamp_created":1546620017,"timestamp_updated":1546620017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099761","author":{"steamid":"76561198043284587","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":12560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5075,"last_played":1643325728},"language":"english","review":"ttld; I've been a rank one killer for 4 seasons consecutivly, I've played from the beta and upwards. And there is rarely ever a 'fun' match where it's balanced for both sides if you want to play killer, and survivers have to roll a dice on their specilized builds depending on what killer is played. This makes it so games are rarely even out, and for the killer are generally furstrating unless you're face stomping, and then that gets boring very shortly.\n\n Survivers have problems with facecamping (in lower ranks) and tunneling because of newer game mechanics (looking at you leigon) and gamebreaking killers that ignore certain core rules of the game. But they counter this with meta builds that counter certain meta killers, but this now comes down to a roll of the dice where in \"will my build/surviver I play work with my team of three other random survivers, and will it work against the killer if I overspecilize. Making some games where certain builds have almost no chance of working, or others will pubstomp 5 gen before the killer can get a decent hook (depending on the killer)\n\nNow onto the killers side. The side that has major issues, half the killers in the game are worse than trash tier and struggle to get played because their kit is very weak without certain rare addons that would buff them. Once you have these ultra rare addons, it becomes a much easier game with these underpowered killers and you can start to develop specilized biulds similar to the survivers...but now unlikes the survivers, win or loose the game, your addons will always be consumed making keeping a specilized build impossible. I can hook and murder 4 survivers before they even repair a single gen, and loose all my items, or have 3 out of 4 people fail to load into the game, and the last person DC's and also loose the addons I used without actually gaining any points. Now pulling away from this terrible addon system, some killers are made competly irrelivent and extreamly frustrating to play on both a.) certian maps, and b.) against certain surviver builds as I talked about ealier. Not to go into major detail, in the shorter explination alot of killers have a glaring weakness in their kit if they're not meta picks that make them impossible to play, and the top killers like pig, nurse, huntress, and legion, and hillbilly (the newest killer, who only has one specific build that works, but it breaks the game making it impossible for anyone to escape if you know how to play it correctly) have specific builds that shut them down thats all part of a roll of a dice before the game begins.\n\nBecause of these 3 points, this game that has alot of fun if played with friends, becomes a hellscape for a killer to play alone, or individual survivers to play in a random stack. (Oh and a 4 stack of players can just use voice coms to make a killers life a living hell making it a fun game for survivers but a horrible game for the killer) But has so many situations where you'll just end up feeling frustrated, with really nothing you can do about it drives me to post a negitive review of the game.\n\nEdit: With the current nerfs to the Nurse, the literal hardest to play killer in the game, making her worse than mid tier even in the hands of a great player, but still requiring a 20+ hour learning curve to even begin to play decently, has lead me to completly uninstall this game and reccommend that literally no one buy this game. The Nurse was DBD first DLC killer and was concidered both the strongest, but hardest to play in the game, and now is just a walking trashbag even in the hands of a skilled player. The Devs of this game have no clue how to gradually nerf or how to properly change a character and just gut killers kits on a whim. Do not pick up this game, do not support these developers, do not give them your money. If I could refund the game at this point I honestly would.","timestamp_created":1546619512,"timestamp_updated":1570658315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537309885025024414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099747","author":{"steamid":"76561198854146217","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":37119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32113,"last_played":1657614818},"language":"russian","review":"фейскемп","timestamp_created":1546619480,"timestamp_updated":1599584687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099720","author":{"steamid":"76561198827465736","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1628271283},"language":"brazilian","review":"recomendo pra krl essa bagaça bom pra krl","timestamp_created":1546619407,"timestamp_updated":1546619407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099705","author":{"steamid":"76561198258126902","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9207,"last_played":1550702695},"language":"spanish","review":"sinceramente el juego tiene una idea buena y todo pero por el resto me parece la peor basura que vi.\n\nme parece una gran falta de respeto ande tan mal. unos problemas gigantes de optimizacion, con una comunidad horrible y nadie hace nada, ya me harte y me lo anduve manduviendo bastante tiempo ya. con esta reseña desinstalo el juego para no jugarlo mas. buenas tardes y vayanse bien a la mierda","timestamp_created":1546619373,"timestamp_updated":1546619373,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539964795112609863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099654","author":{"steamid":"76561198173679725","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2695,"last_played":1603366452},"language":"russian","review":"геймплей интересный, захватывающий и интенсивный за обе стороны, асортимент маньяков широкий, выживших тоже. практически весь контент можно приобрести бесплатно за внутриигровую валюту, персонажей в частности. несомненно интересная игра как для одиночного геймплея так и для компании","timestamp_created":1546619228,"timestamp_updated":1546619228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099523","author":{"steamid":"76561198798494011","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1624093417},"language":"russian","review":"[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1][i]⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀♫ ЛСП - Номера ♫⠀⠀⠀⠀[/i][/h1]\n[h1]───────────────────⚪───────────────────────[/h1]\n⠀▐▐ ⠀►▏ ⠀⠀──○─ 🔊 ⠀₁:₂₅ / ₃:₅₀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ᴴᴰ⚙ ❐ ⊏⊐[/td]\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaFp9lsRzDU&list=PLiyTQBdxULqEB85agfnkPQ7orqIon8Vy2&index=21&t=0s","timestamp_created":1546618794,"timestamp_updated":1546618794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48099440","author":{"steamid":"76561198215332549","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":6908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1579283114},"language":"latam","review":"De no ser por sus problemas en el matchmaking DBD sería [b]el[/b] juego que no puede faltar en tu biblioteca.

Jeszcze ani razu nie zdarzyło mi się znaleść zabójcę z mniej niż 60 pingu. Często trafiam na poprostu ludzi z laggami i przez to zacina się cała rozgrywka (ponieważ zabójca jest zawsze hostem gry).

In its current state, game is playable, its pretty fun either on survivor or killer, have played this game a long time, and have changed my review from Not recommend to, recommend solo or with friends, can be great solo playing killer, will be frustrating at first, but its a lot harder to play killer then it is to play survivor, overall the game is in a decently playable state there is some obvious balancing issues but for the most part the game overall is fun! I even was harsh for years about their clunky animations for their Mori's which is a way the killer can finish you off by their own hands instead of sacrificing you on the hook, most of them are pretty damn polished and look really clean!\nCons: All the DLC for this game is going to run a hefty price tag if you plan to play as killer and survivor, keep this in mind before committing to it, other cons are trolls, ragequitters, afks, and sometimes you get an absolutely toxic killer IE, Facecamping (puts you on the hook and sits in front of it not allowing anyone near)  Tunneling (chases somone right after they are taken off hook) these behaivours are considered strategies and aren't directly bannable these are frowned upon by most of the community there is other strategies such as Snowballing, or Slugging that work much better for killers however you will still run into the occasional dickbag that wants to sit with a chainsaw in front of the hook after downing someone, not much you can do about it.\n10/10 Toxic\n10/10 Horror\n10/10 Skins\n10/10 Trash\n10/10 Unbalanced\n*Updated 2022* Game is in its worst state its been in for playing killer if your buying this game to play as a killer forget about it, the current meta on survivors makes it really difficult to have a good game, you get toxic flashlight teams that all run the wiggle builds and with the new wiggle mechanic, if they aren't flashlight saving they are wiggling free, and everytime you kick a pallet or try to do any action infront of the survivor expect to be blinded over and over causing you to waste more time on a chase and it buys them more then enough time to get to a pallet and stun you or loop you around it again, personally i stopped respecting pallets entirely because of this and it does nothing regardless whether i respect them or dont, i cant really win chases as much as i use to, And I don't want sacrifice 2 perk slots across the board just to counter the current meta, I.E lightborn and Iron will/grasp could counter these meta perks survivors are using along with the flashlights, but in reality getting these perks on my killers is a lottery with the current teachable system, its honestly disgusting in its current state. RIP killer games, ill be on survivor until they either do something to where we can disable certain teachables on killers because honestly some perks are just downright fucking trash now compared to the the meta perks, but we have to dump MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of blood into our killers after max level just to get the perks we should be running, and i understand its like this for survivors as well, but its much easier to play on an already maxxed out survivor while you max another one, and this is the same for the killers, but GL farming blood once your out of addons at high rank. oh did i mention How fucking trash the matchmaking is  im a Bronze 4 killer right now but my last 4 matches had 1-3 rank 1 iridescent survivors (highest rank attainable)\nConclusion being The game is heavily favoring the survivors, also the queue in survivor is fucking disgusting at times, mostly due to the fact no one wants to play killer anymore, and this is coming from a guy that has every killer max level and a few prestiged.\n\n*BEWARE KILLERS ARE ALL STARTING TO FACECAMP AS THAT IS THE META FOR KILLERS NOW! JUST PLAYED 4 SURVIVOR MATCHES IN A ROW AND WE HAD A FACECAMPER ALL 4 GAMES, BEHAVIOUR, Your going to be the downfall to your own game you encourage the toxic hateful gameplay that makes me want to smash my pc into oblivion *im not normally one to rage* but wow this game really makes me angry, do you guys even play your game? do you see the problems that are sticking out like a sore fucking thumb? GOODLUCK Having new players come play your game in its current state. you either have a facecamper for a killer or you play with a low level killer with no perks against rank 1s that can make you feel like the fat kid in dodgeball lmfao this game is going to die this year mostly due to the fact it doesn't matter how much skill you have on a killer its entirely based on your perks and addons, survivor takes skill to play but is incredibly easy when everyone runs a flashlight with wiggle build. Enjoy getting facecamped as a new survivor and enjoy being the fat kid in dodgeball if your trying to buy this game just don't its not worth your money, its not worth your stress, its not worth your time. updated 2022-06-19","timestamp_created":1546568052,"timestamp_updated":1655670591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48253333568572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48085235","author":{"steamid":"76561198013706429","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":26382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18424,"last_played":1634878668},"language":"koreana","review":"종구야 종치면서 오지말랬잖아!!!","timestamp_created":1546567261,"timestamp_updated":1546567261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48084973","author":{"steamid":"76561198043476845","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":93920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90448,"last_played":1631444567},"language":"english","review":"Single handedly the most infuriating game i have ever had the misfortune of playing.
