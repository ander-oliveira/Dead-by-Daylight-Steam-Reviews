ideia do jogo em si é ótima, mas só vale a pena se você for jogar com +3 amigos pra passar o tempo. Tem muitos aspectos pay 2 win, desde habilidades roubadas a outros itens sem nexo. O Assassino (a maioria, mas principalmente os pagos) são MUITO desbalanceados, se qualquer assassino te ver, é quase ctz que tu morre, a velocidade base deles é maior que a de TODOS os sobreviventes, não tem como fugir uma vez que ele te vê, a não ser que tu tenha sorte de ter algum pallet na frente ou algo do tipo pra jogar em cima do cara, além disso, alguns assassinos tem habilidades exageradamente roubadas, o Fred consegue literalmente se teletransportar para os geradores que você tá fazendo, como diabos countera isso? enquanto a sua habilidade é se curar dps de 30 anos passando bandeide no cu, além de outras coisas inúteis (e se vc errar a sequência de cura o assassino pode ouvir e comer seu cu com a força de 1000 africanos com fome). A maioria das habilidades ajudam mais os assassinos do que os sobreviventes, e quase nenhuma habilidade dos sobreviventes afeta diretamente o assassino, só \"ajudam\" a sobreviver por mais tempo, o que deixa muito repetitivo, tu basicamente só corre e conserta gerador, pqp. Entendo que a missão do jogo é vc ser bem stealth, mas porra, não tem absolutamente nada q da pra vc fazer contra ele, só corre e reza pra ele ser uma ameba em perseguir ou seu cuzinho será destruído, tem uma hr que fica cansativo só correr e não ter nenhuma interação legal como em Friday The 13, que da pra matar o Jason dps de uma sequência, que é meio difícil de fazer mas vale super a pena, e não torna o jogo tão repetitivo onde tu só morre.

Jedes Early-Access-Game ist ausgereifter als dieses Spiel, was schade ist. Das Matchmaking ist unausgeglichen, es gibt einige Bugs, und neue (wirklich gamebreaking) Bugs sind mit neuen Erweiterungen inzwischen nicht nur befürchtet, sondern erwartet... das Spiel hat schon Potenzial, und war auch schon mal besser. Der heutige Zustand ist hingegen bemitleidenswert.\n\n[h1] Balancing[/h1]\n\nDas aktuelle Matchmaking (MM) ist unausgegoren und verhindert Spaß am Spiel weit mehr als es für interessante Spiele sorgt.\n\nDie aktuelle Meta bei den Perks verhindern das Spielen von bestimmten Killern automatisch - den langsameren unter diesen ist es vorher schon schwer ergangen. Ein paar haben schon interessante Konzepte, allerdings muss man schon masochistische Tendenzen besitzen, um diese öfter zu spielen. Zudem ist mit dem aktuellen MM (als Killer) die nächste Runde wahrscheinlich gegen \nBabys 25 %\ninteressante Gegner 15%\nzu starke Gegner, man bekommt mit Händen und Füßen kämpfend einen getötet 25%\noverpowered-Troll-Gruppen 35%\n\nUnd wer ein wenig Wissen über die menschliche Psyche besitzt weiß, wie viel länger eine Runde, in der man chancenlos unterlegen ist, einen beschäftigt - besonders im Vergleich zu einer extrem einfachen Runde. Besonders das Survivors in der Lage sind den Killer in seinem Weg zu blockieren ist unangenehm, um es nett auszudrücken. Rennt man einem über x Paletten hinterher, benutzt sein Dead-hard für noch weitere Runden, und dann wird man von einem anderen im Laufweg blockiert und die gesamte Jagd war für die Katz, wenn man nicht drei Generatoren aufploppen sehen will? Meiner Meinung nach sollte dies entfernt werden (gegen Camping braucht es was anderes). Auf Dauer geht der Spielspaß recht häufig in Frust über. Aber auch dann als Reaktion die nächste Gruppe möglichst hart zerstören zu wollen ist nicht genugtuend, wenn es dann eine Babygruppe ist.\n\nAber auch auf der Survivorseite ist nicht alles in Butter. Früher war es zumindest ein 4 vs. 1 Spiel, heutzutage ist es mehr ein 1 vs. 1 vs. 1 vs. 1 VS. 1 Spiel, solange man nicht in einer Gruppe spielt. Diese sogenannte 'Solo-Queue-Experience' zerstört das Spiel nach kurzer Zeit. Es wird immer öfter der Killer zu anderen Survivors geführt, um die eigene Haut zu retten, nachdem die heute obligatorischen Perks die Jagd lange genug verlängert haben. Zudem ist es auch nicht angenehm, in einer Trollgruppe zu landen, die die gesamte Zeit den Killer nerven, während man versucht das Spiel zu spielen. Gerät man an einen fähigen Killer, ist das Spiel oftmals schnell verloren (ich zähle mich nicht als fähig in diesem Zusammenhang). Und einen Babykiller an der Nase herumzuführen ist auf Dauer auch langweilig. \nEbenso langweilig ist aber auch die Unsitte des Face-Campings und Tunnelns, die wieder mehr um sich greift und von den Entwicklern nicht hart genug bestraft wird (wenn überhaupt). Üblicherweise sollten die übrigen, sofern der Killer campt, schnellstmöglich die Generatoren durchprügeln und abhauen. Leider sind aber gerade dann deine Mitspieler sozial und wollen unbedingt die Rettung versuchen, statt eine Flucht zu ermöglichen. Oft genug wird der Killer damit sogar fürs Campen belohnt (wie wäre ein Gen-Geschwindigkeitsbonus, wenn ein Killer campt?).\nAuch dass Killer, wenn sie ins Hintertreffen geraten plötzlich aufs Tunneln des schwächsten Glieds ausweichen ist eine um sich greifende Unart. Dies sollte nicht derart möglich sein - aber der Killer sollte (wenn es halt gescheites MM gäbe) auch gar nicht erst in diese Situation geraten können. Wenn er tunneln MUSS, um zu gewinnen, sind die Gegner einfach zu stark (bzw. die Gens zu schnell oder oder). Und wenn er es mit Absicht macht, sollte das Spiel das besser verhindern - was es ja nicht tut.\n\nUnd was ist mit SWFs, wenn solo nicht so viel Spaß bereitet? Naja, als Gruppe kann man sich weitaus besser koordinieren, Camping direkt so benennen und hat höhere Chancen zu gewinnen. Das Matchmaking ist aber hier (anderes als bei Killern, wo alle einen eigenen Wert haben) nicht unterteilt, sprich man kann in der Gruppe einige Runden spielen, und wenn man dann alleine spielt hat man keine Chance. Und dann wieder in Gruppe es viel zu einfach. Naja...bis man weit genug aufsteigt und das Spiel pendelt zwischen \"der Killer hat ja keine Schnitte gegen uns\" und \"Man ey, der cheatet doch hundert pro\". Es ist dasselbe Prinzip wie in Solo-q, nur ohne Verräter in den eigenen Reihen und mit (noch) fähigeren Killern. Also wegen der fehlenden Verräter besser zu spielen, aber noch lange nicht gut.\n\nWas könnte man ändern? Naja, ein Spiel im Nachhinein zu balancieren ist nicht einfach, aber die Versuche hier was zu verbessern haben oft genug zu einer Verschlechterung des ganzen geführt. Wenn man als Killer nicht innerhalb von 20 Sekunden jemanden findet, ist das Spiel fast verloren. Wenn aus Sicht des Survivors deine Mitspieler fallen wie Fliegen aber auch. Vielmehr sollte es so sein, dass der Killer und die Überlebenden je genug Zeit haben, ihr Spiel zu schaffen, ohne dass man einem bestimmten der Spieler das Spiel von Anfang an zerstören muss.\n\n[h1] Bugs[/h1]\n\nHehe. Fragt jemanden über Dbd. Nach ein paar Sätzen über den Rundenverlauf oder ähnliches wird man dir sicher haufenweise Geschichten erzählen können über Bugs. Wie man plötzlich in einer Ecke festhing und nichts ging. Manche Totems nicht erreichbar waren und damit übermächtig. Killer aus dem Spiel geworfen wurden, weil der Spieler einen bestimmten Perk besitzt, und dieser das Ausgangstor berührte (alles Beispiele der letzten Monate). Dieses Spiel hat keine Bugs mehr...es hat (geheime) Features. Alles ist kaputt, und wenn ein Bugfix oder eine Erweiterung rauskommt ist immer die Frage, was genau nun plötzlich zerstört wurde beim Versuch, etwas komplett anderes zu reparieren. Die Community nimmt es inzwischen mit Humor, aber für ein derart altes Spiel ist eine derartige Bugdurchseuchung ein Armutszeugnis. Vor allem da Bugs oftmals so lange im Spiel bleiben, dass sich die Spieler damit arrangieren und drumherumagieren - und bestimmte Killer oder Spielweisen damit auf ein halbes Jahr oder länger unmöglich werden. Wie bereits gesagt...DbD-Spieler brauchen was Masochistisches.\n\n[h1] Grind[/h1]\n\nDer Grind in diesem Spiel ist auch hart. Es gibt zwar die Möglichkeit, außer den lizensierten Charakteren alle mit Ingamewährungen freizuschalten - inklusive Weihnachts-wir-verschenken-Ingamewährung und anderer Aktionen habe ich dafür allerdings 1450 Stunden gebraucht. Alle FREIZUSCHALTEN wohlgemerkt, viele Killer benötigen viele hunderte Stunden um diesen halbwegs zu beherrschen, und auch mit tausend Stunden reiner Survivorspielzeit hat man noch sehr viel zu lernen über Kleinigkeiten. Dann schon etwas frustrierend, wenn man den Killer, welcher vom Spielstil zu einem passen würde, erst nach sagen wir 700 Stunden freischalten würde, man das Spiel aber vorher längst aufgegeben hat, da halt 'bisher nichts passendes dabei war'.\n\n[h1] Positives[/h1]\n\nEs gibt nicht nur negatives am Spiel, wie gesagt, es hat Potenzial. Die Community (abseits der Camper, Tunneler und clickyclicky-T-bag-Survivors) kann nett sein. KANN. Baut nicht drauf, und hofft wie ich, dass der Endchat irgendwann verschwindet. Aber man kann auch echt nette Spiele haben, in denen man Spaß hat.\n\nUnd (die älteren werden sich erinnern): für eine LAN-Party ist das Spiel eine echt witzige und spaßige Ergänzung.Man nimmt das Spiel nicht zu 100% ernst, sondern hat plötzlich andere, wichtige Ziele, und allzu toxisch kann niemand werden, sonst steht man halt kurz vom Stuhl auf und geht rüber...\n\n[h1] Ende[/h1]\n\nJoah, tldr war schon oben. Wer es trotzdem kauft, auf euer eigenes Risiko, aber ich drücke euch die Daumen, dass das Spiel wieder besser wird. Und an alle: viel Spaß bei was auch immer ihr spielt, sei es DbD oder doch ein gescheit programmiertes Spiel^^","timestamp_created":1618961336,"timestamp_updated":1647541053,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90653336","author":{"steamid":"76561199020423903","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":12569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3146,"last_played":1658953265},"language":"english","review":"I never thought that I'd be obsessed with this game (okay maybe not obsessed but I do love it) I have been trying to max out my players.

There are a large variety of killers, each with their own play style and skillset, which allows for each game to be played in a different way.\n\nBoth survivors and killers have perks, which give them special skills/perks which can also vastly change the way the game can be played. \n\nEach map is different, has a different feel to it, and can also change the way the game is played, adding to the variety the game already has.\n\nThe developers have improved on the game since it's launch and now have a pretty polished game which is very fun to play, especially with friends in a private custom lobby! \n\nThe game can definitely be scary, and irritating, as the hit-boxes aren't always perfect and are larger than expected to be. The ranking system works, but does have its downsides. If someone plays the game enough, they can easily get to the highest rank (the lower the number is, the higher the rank, bit confusing but once you play it makes sense!)\n\nI would say the game is fairly balanced, in terms of survivor vs killer. Some killers require a lot of skill to play, while some are easier and are better suited towards newer players. \n\nThe game does have a high-skill ceiling, as the layout allows for mind-games between the survivor and the killers, along with movement, time management and ability usage for the killer and tool usage for the survivor, along with how the perks are used and the synergy between the perks.\n\nAll in all, it's a really fun game to play and I recommend anyone to give it a try.\n","timestamp_created":1618958259,"timestamp_updated":1618958259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90651668","author":{"steamid":"76561198251182664","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":6078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5115,"last_played":1632158674},"language":"brazilian","review":"-

немного рассказать вам об этой игре. Dead be Daylight имеет очень много достоинств своего жанра, но всегда есть плюсы и минусы. \nПлюсы:\n1. Атмосфера. Неотъемлемая часть этой игры. Маньяки выглядят жутко, что говорит о качественной разработки образа. Карты тоже вызывают жуть происходящего во время игры(особенно, когда рядом нет других игроков). Отмечу персонажа Охотница, у которой очень жуткая колыбель, которую пела ее мать.\n2. Гемплей. Интересная идея. Само развитие персонажей, которые имеют каждые свои индивидуальные навыки, единственное, очень долго надо прокачивать( про маньяка тоже самое). С генераторами, крюками, воротами и люком, интересная задумка. Но здесь есть небольшие минусы, которые я озвучу позже. \n3. Обновления. Не так редко добавляют новых маньяков, персонажей и карты, которые вызывают интерес снова играть после обновления( но не надолго). \nТеперь, я хотел бы поговорить о минусах игры:\n1. Сервера. Наверное, самый главный минус игры. Частые неизвестные ошибки, не подключиться к серверу, вылеты из серверов и частые повешения пинга. Я надеюсь, что разработчики наконец-то задумаются об решений этих проблем, потому что из-за этого просто начинаешь ненавидеть игру и перестаешь в нее играть.\n2. Дисбаланс. Я бы отнес это больше к плюсу и минусу, объясню почему. Минус, т.к. если маньяк тебя увидел, 75% того, что он тебя догонит или швырнет в тебя какое-то свое оружие и тебе конец(если только команда не спасет). Маньяки очень сильные по сравнению с выжившими, что иногда раздражает. Почему плюс, т.к. если бы маньяки были бы на ровне с выжившими, то пропала как раз та атмосфера игры и ее фишка. Поэтому, разработчики, придумайте что-нибудь дополнительное к гемплею, чтобы игра не вызывал такого мнения.\n3. Цена. Извините конечно, но цены для этой игры я просто не понимаю. Сама игра стоит не так уж и дешево, так еще сколько дополнений, за которые еще нужно заплатить за немаленькие деньги. Особенно, что платные маньяки намного жестче, чем остальные, что тоже усложняет гемплей игры, кстати. \nВ заключение скажу, что игра хороша, но все таки у любой игры есть недостатки. Разработчики придумали интересную игру, но нужно еще доработать. \nМоя оценка: 8/10.\nСпасибо, что прочитали мой обзор, удачных Вам покупок и игр!)))","timestamp_created":1618945185,"timestamp_updated":1618945308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606240034103393555","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90643402","author":{"steamid":"76561198068897496","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":87,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1618880476},"language":"english","review":"trash","timestamp_created":1618944945,"timestamp_updated":1618944945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481675416231155396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90643361","author":{"steamid":"76561198807319862","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":93,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1660497899},"language":"schinese","review":"玩得我脑淤血","timestamp_created":1618944887,"timestamp_updated":1618944887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90643337","author":{"steamid":"76561198078899496","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":33325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24674,"last_played":1659127816},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo falido e muito mal otimizado mas nao consigo para de joga essa bosta","timestamp_created":1618944846,"timestamp_updated":1618944846,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90642839","author":{"steamid":"76561199163044412","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":20785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":176,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1659976070},"language":"schinese","review":"我是sb，你妈的十几个小时就能遇到挂壁，玩你妈","timestamp_created":1618944146,"timestamp_updated":1618944146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90642460","author":{"steamid":"76561198452033353","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1619808590},"language":"spanish","review":"ta re cheto este game","timestamp_created":1618943586,"timestamp_updated":1618943586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530916869640350342","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90642228","author":{"steamid":"76561198863114884","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":21649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1134,"playtime_at_review":7651,"last_played":1660332889},"language":"turkish","review":"Toxic oyuncuları dışında gayet güzel","timestamp_created":1618943257,"timestamp_updated":1618943257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90642039","author":{"steamid":"76561198916355513","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":734,"playtime_at_review":33916,"last_played":1660597339},"language":"french","review":"Interessant si vous voulez un jeu pour try hard mais sinon c'est juste de la frustration en permanence, il y a tellement de bug dans ce jeu c'est incroyable, vous tomberez toujours contre des gens soit trop fort soit trop nuls, et votre expérience de jeu sera gachée.
