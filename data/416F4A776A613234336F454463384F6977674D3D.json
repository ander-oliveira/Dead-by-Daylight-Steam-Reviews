It is clear that the game is one-sided towards survivors, which is why Killer mains are quitting the game. As a survivor you can expect long waiting times, because there's just not enough Killers anymore. The matchmaking after six years is still a hot mess, so as a beginner you could end up playing against someone way above your skill level. Balancing menas for the devs to look at the top1% of killers and if they get more than 2 kills on average they either nerf the killers or buff the survivors.They literally say that in interviews unironically, because they think thats balancing the game, even though as stated before the matchmaking is a hot mess, and the top1% of killers won't often go against a lobby full of top1% survivors. The endgame collapse was supposed to keep the survivors from holding the game hostage, but since it only triggers once an exit game is open, it just gives the Survivors the chance to 99% both gates and heal up before they rescue someone on the hook. And you can't counter that as a killer, because if you open a gate to put time pressure on the survivors you only leave the hooked survivor unprotected and create an escape route. low rank killers get literally bullied if they are matched with better survivors and if you ignore the survivors selfmade rules they will insult you. if you still want to play the game as killer, throw the survivor's rulebook out of the window.

The Devs only care about killers and have been nerfing survivors for the past year and buffing killer at the same time. If you are a killer main that complains about survivors being better than you, you are honest to God bad at the game. The amount of times I have been camped to death and tunneled is countless. Yet killer is probs the easiest role to play. I have countless memories of toxic killers with my friends, which is why we are equally toxic in the survivor community.\nThe Devs are a whole different story. I 100% believe that the DBD Devs are one of the top 10 worst Dev teams in the history of gaming. It is abundantly clear that all the Dev have no friends and therefore main killers. Then proceed to suck at their own game and try and buff the killers they enjoy playing. Stop dick riding all these killer mains and get some friends to play survivor with and you will see how mind numbingly stupid and blind you all are. The audacity you all have to consider yourselves \"qualified\" for your position is absolutely baffling.\nThe constant struggle of playing with randoms is tiring. The \"skill based matchmaking\" is, at best, trash. Simple as that. I have dealt with too many incompetent teammates when running duos and trios.\nLastly, Behaviour Interactive team are a bunch of money loving scammer. Over the years players have been waiting for cross progression. There is no reason for this game to not have cross progression. Cross progression is a basic need in todays age. I don't want to hear any excuses about platforms needing to confirm whether they will allow it or any B.S. like that. That is the most sorry excuse I have heard from the team. I can name plenty of games that have access to cross progression. I refuse to switch a platform and spend money on things I have elsewhere just because your lazy team wants money the easy way.\nI have never had this much frustration with a game and its Dev team in all my years of gaming. If you want to play this game go right ahead, but don't expect to get much out of it.

This game can be scary but it is more competitive once you get used to the mechanics and how to play. I also like that they bring in actual horror movie characters. Very tasteful. I wish they allowed you to transfer over your progress from your system to your PC like other games did because I had to buy this game twice and buy characters all over again.","timestamp_created":1656732819,"timestamp_updated":1656732819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118036186","author":{"steamid":"76561198363844548","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6667,"last_played":1656729863},"language":"spanish","review":"ALGUIEN MAS LE PASA Q CUANDO ABRIS EL JUEGO TE TIRA ERROR Y SE REINICIA LA PC???
