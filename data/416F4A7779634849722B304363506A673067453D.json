You are literally punished for not bringing in the best items / perks in the game. This game is not made for mmr, so implementing such system just to keep the \"newer players\" happy while not thinking about the veterans is an awful idea. I have been monitoring the player base since the mmr patch, and the players on steam alone dropped to approximately 60% of the previous patch prior to mmr's release. I do not want to see this game go down in flame this soon. Although I understand that \"fresh blood\" is needed for every game, but implemented mmr in a unbalanced game where so many different factor could affect the fairness of a game, is not a good idea. I sincerely hope that mmr will be removed and revert the game somewhat of a more casual style. It is not fun having to bring the same four perks and items in every game just to \"win.\" At this point in time, dbd esports is more fun than the gameplay in pub matches since they have rules to somewhat balance the game for both killer and survivor, providing a variety of play style (Although the builds for survivors are mostly the same across different team since most perks have to be \"unique\" on each survivor, at least it is not the same 4 perks or items on every survivors).

데바데가 처음 나왔을 무렵에 이 게임을 구매했지만, 데바데는 게임이 아니라는 사실을 깨닫고 빠르게 손절하여 마음의 안식을 찾은 살인마 유저입니다. \n\n최근, 데바데 없는 평온한 삶을 살고 있던 저에게 친구놈이 영업을 하더군요. 신규 살인마도 많이 나오고 밸런스 패치도 많이 이루어졌다고요. 그 말에 혹한 저는 데바데에 들어가 보았습니다. 오랜 시간 하지 않아서인지, 제 랭크는 가장 낮은 랭크인 20랭크에 위치해 있었습니다. 어차피 잃을 랭크도 없으니 매치나 돌려보기로 한 저는 여전히 매칭시간이 더럽게 길다는 점과 생각보다 저같은 데린이들이 많다는 사실을 알게 되었습니다. 느린 속도지만 올라가는 등급에 저는 묘한 성취감을 느끼며 슬슬 재미를 붙이기 시작했습니다.\n하지만 문제는 그 이후에 일어났습니다. 제가 17랭크로 처음 들어온 판에서 저는 세명에게 티배깅을 당하면서 나머지 한명을 겨우 잡아낼 수 있었습니다. 게임이 끝나고 확인해 보니 두 사람이 초록색 랭크(10랭크 이하)더군요.굉장히 억울해진 저는 정상적인 게임을 하겠다는 일념으로 생존자의 프로필과 코스튬을 꼼꼼히 확인하고 고수들인 것 같으면 닷지를 하는 방법을 사용하여 매치를 잡았습니다. 매칭에만 40분이 걸린 이 판을 마치고 상대방의 랭크를 확인한 저는 분노를 참을 수 없었습니다. 네 사람 중 두 사람이나 빨간 랭크(5랭크 이하)였기 때문입니다. 그나마 남은 두 사람도 초록랭크더군요. \n그렇게 진정할 수 없어 몇분동안 방방 뛰다가 갑자기 현자타임이 온 저는 \"그래, 다음 매치는 괜찮을 거야. 개발자들이 생각이 있으면 두 번이나 그러겠어?\"라고 중얼거리며 매치를 잡았습니다. \n그리고, 저는 그 판에 4명 전원에게 티배깅을 당하며 굴욕적으로 게임을 마무리했습니다. 아무도 잡지 못하고 터덜터덜 걸어가는 불쌍한 제 살인마를 보며 \"잘하는 15급들이었겠지..\"하고 행복 회로를 돌리고 있었습니다. 곧, 제 눈앞에 점수판이 뜨더군요. 2랭크 세 명, 7랭크 한 명. \n\n저는 그만 정신을 잃고 말았습니다.\n\n혹시 게임 개발진이 일을 너무 열심히 한 나머지 숫자를 16까지밖에 인지하지 못하는 병에 걸려버린 건 아닐까요. 아니면 제가 색깔과 숫자를 다르게 인지하는 병에 걸려버린 건 아닐까요. 어느 쪽이 맞던간에 저는 신경안정제를 처방받으러 정신과에 가야할 것 같으니, 개발진 분들도 정신과에 가서 검사를 꼭 받아보셨으면 좋겠습니다.","timestamp_created":1569316041,"timestamp_updated":1569316041,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55256941","author":{"steamid":"76561198861063322","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":58683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30327,"last_played":1649444920},"language":"russian","review":"#fixNurse","timestamp_created":1569315644,"timestamp_updated":1569315644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55256810","author":{"steamid":"76561198410940361","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1003,"last_played":1619253265},"language":"schinese","review":"萌新一局要一个小时

When it's fun it's fun but that's such a rare time in this game. 90% of it is just playing against the most toxic humans you'll ever encounter. I only play this game because I'm very fond of a few characters in it but I heavily suggest avoiding this game if toxic people being as rude and abusive of a game as possible is a turn off for you because that's all this game is: Who can abuse the others harder. It's fucking garbage.\n\nSome days you'll wonder why you still have it. It's because it offers something unique, but sadly it can't be balanced and people can't help but be toxic pieces of garbage and those 2 things combined is a very unpleasant experience that I recommend you avoid before becoming interested because that's the point it's too late, it's become an ulcer on your brain, a toxin in you that itches itself out into your computer every so often.\n\nEvery so often I like to come back to the game and see what it's like. It's like an abusive relationship you just can't leave. They somehow manage to make the killer experience less and less enjoyable because of the absolutely toxic survivor groups who bully every killer they can and also the solo survivor experience is shit too because you're so uncoordinated that even a noob killer can stomp you because your teammates have a combined IQ of 5. I cannot give this game a negative enough review. It has SO much potential but it squanders it every chance it gets and somehow alienates the playerbase with every patch.\n\nSave yourself the frustration and cash; This game is NOT worth the price of free.

I can't rank up without using trash tactics/ perks myself, and I hate doing it because you just get called a try hard or a bastard in the end game chat.\nDON'T buy this game unless you want to become part of the problem!\nI am a normal casual player, I don't want to go hard in this game, I don't care about the ranks at all. Yet I get to put up with try hard Survivors that INSTANTLY DC their first knock down. (DC'ing is still not being punished at all from what I can tell. And if it is, they need to up the punishment)\n\nUpdate: Absolutely hate the new archive system. Making you play as Killer to get everything. (Don't get me wrong, I understand why. But the absolute toxicity I got from my first few games back since the update with Rank 20 Reset was incredibly bad)\nStill hate how they are adding more and more cancerous Perks to the game, making it forever unbalanced.\n\nUpdate #2: FINALLY GETTING PUNISHMENTS FOR DC'ING PRICKS?! HELL YES!\nAnd apparently the ranks resetting will be a bit more mellow, keeping higher ranks up top and casuals like me in about mid tier should hopefully keep toxicity a bit lower.\n(This is DbD's last chance for me... Please... Please just work\nyou can thank HybridPanda on YT for me giving this wreck another chance. If everyone was like him/ played like him, I would have literally no issues)\n\nUpdate #3: Oni is fun but kind of hard to control... Something you need to know about my play style as Killer I have had since the start of this game. If the Survivors are absolute toxic bastards, I will be just as toxic/ cancerous to them. Yet in the end game chat after I get DS'd 4 times, flashlight blinded by every survivor, get t-bagged after ever single opportunity they have all in the same game; and All I do is camp a bit to maybe get A SINGLE FREAKING SACRIFICE AT THE END OF THE GAME, somehow I am the bad guy and get absolutely $#!t on at the end of the game by literally everyone in end game chat. Honestly, might just uninstall AGAIN since I can't even get a nice and fun game AT RANK 16 with normal human beings.\n(I don't want to rank up so I stay low, no need to get to Rank 1 when I know for a fact everyone will just BM every opportunity they get)\nOut of all the games I have ever played in my life across all platforms, DbD has the absolute worst community/ fanbase out of them all.\nIt is kind of sad and scummy of me to say but screw it, I hope the cancerous community will eventually be the downfall of this game so other developers can use it as an example of what NOT to do when making their own creations. I hope it dies like Death Garden.\n\nUpdate #4: The DC penalty is nice, however I will admit if I go against an absolute bastard of a killer, I usually DC. I DC'd because I feel like I shouldn't have to play against some trash bag since I am playing the game to have \"fun\" (This is referencing camping and tunneling pricks who are a non-stop thing in this worthless game). Now I can't do that and I have to just literally suicide on the first hook so I don't get a penalty. The DC penalty has fixed some issues and cause some others. I think if it is to be left in the game, the survivors can set a maximum of 2 Killers that they will not be matched against. I would instantly black list Leather Face and Freddy, and I would be happy. I have never played against a nice/ good Leather Face or Freddy in all my hours playing. (and doctor for that matter)\n\nUpdate #5: It's happening, I am finally uninstalling this game. The fan-base you have developed literally gets worse every single game I play. I was just a rank 12 Ghost Face going up a SWF ranks 2,4,4 6. I was just trying to do a daily since I already trashed one (there's another complaint, why limit it to just one? I hate being forced to play a certain way). I was blatantly just using shroud any time I got to mark them and if they saw me I just ran away. I got 2 hooks just because of weird body blocking they decided to do, and they all escaped at the end, which I was going to let them anyways. The game was filled with trash loops and flashlights, but I was just letting it happen since I just wanted daily, I was in no way toxic to them as they were to me this time.  However, as per usual even though I was going easy and didn't get  a single kill they all had a great time bashing me and everything I did in end game chat. I don't even have fun as survivor anymore not just because of killers but  due to the worthless teammates that just farm you, or just sit in the corner doing nothing and / or sandbag  from hooks or lead the killer straight to you with bond.\n\nCan not believe I wasted 400+ hrs of my life with this.\n\nHorrible \"Matchmaking\"\nToxic bastards for a community that will never get better it seems\nWorthless, unbalanced perks (Primarily on the survivors side)\nGood-for-nothing developers that haven't taken care of bugs, glitches, and matchmaking issues for a while.\n\nI can sincerely say that I hope this game dies JUST LIKE Blood Garden Death Harvest did.","timestamp_created":1569269473,"timestamp_updated":1590970420,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526852667331695557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55250805","author":{"steamid":"76561198862823627","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":128877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1010,"playtime_at_review":23305,"last_played":1659743461},"language":"german","review":"Just perf.","timestamp_created":1569268536,"timestamp_updated":1569268536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55250713","author":{"steamid":"76561198815796430","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1640361568},"language":"russian","review":"Классная.
