I know i don't have as much say as a lot of people who have been around since the very beginning. But... The fact is this game has to many issues, big and small, that caused me to go from enjoying playing the game everyday to now barely being able to stay on for more than a few games. From the infinite loading screens and infinite 3 or 4 man lobbies (which are being fixed hopefully right now) to the huge hitboxes that make it feel like every killer has a reach of 5 meters. I never played at the time but its sad to say that some of the people who have been playing this game since launch say that was probably the peak of this games balance. They've put more focus on new  content in the last 6 to 9 months than they've put into making sure the game stays healthy. The previous issues have been around for way to long now and while they are hopefully fixing it as i type this, dedicated servers should've come out a year or two ago, not in 2/3 months. I don't even know if that will even fix the game enough for me to enjoy the game as i previously did. Its not a game i would recommend, RIGHT NOW. I still feel by the devs taking steps in the right direction this game will be really good. But at the moment i cant say its good. I cant say its okay. The community is toxic and some of the endorsed tactics by the devs are scummy and frustrating. I watched my friend play at rank 20 (the lowest rank) and came across a rank 9 (about middle of the ranks) in a 4 stack just bullying new players. Also there is no punishment for disconnecting early other than deranking 2 pips (its like elo points). The amount of times you will have a team mate dc after being hit or kill themselves right away when put on the hook, its super frustrating because now the killer has an easier time getting the rest of the survivors, but also lose their chance to rank up. But people disconnect to derank because the higher rank you are, the less fun the game is. You are more likely to find only a few killers, running a lot of the same perks, using really toxic strategies to eliminate you from the game as quickly as possible. Also if you want to stream this game, prepare to get possibly sniped or targeted by the killer.  Also in patch 2.6.0, which came out about a month ago, they changed the ranking to make it so it was harder to rank up, which would've been a good thing if they did it right. But they didn't, instead the game stopped being team oriented and more became every man/women for the themselves. There is also the case of farming which is basically trying to get as many points as possible to either rank up or level up their characters with the currency that can only be acquired by playing the game. I personally have come across friends matching together as killer and survivor to farm for themselves and kill the other survivors, its reportable but the devs haven't even acknowledged it in their issues list. So as of now, if you are willing to deal with what i have listed above, im not saying the game cant be fun, go ahead and buy this game. But for right now, i wouldn't recommend it.","timestamp_created":1555220004,"timestamp_updated":1555220004,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501633942127227783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50122789","author":{"steamid":"76561198326151578","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1732,"last_played":1658852821},"language":"latam","review":"10/10 Gran juego, pasa el tiempo y esa esencia de matar sigue XD","timestamp_created":1555218579,"timestamp_updated":1555218579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50122644","author":{"steamid":"76561198003194304","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":247055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190644,"last_played":1658343660},"language":"russian","review":"Всем привет !

Seitdem hatte ich es nur ca 5 Stunden gezockt. Der Grund dafür war, es war noch nicht ausgereift, und man musste noch vieles an den Game machen.\nDBD ging etwas in die Vergessenheit.\n\nAber jetze wo ich mir mal wieder mit paar Kumpels die Zeit genommen habe um Dead by Daylight zu testen, kam ich zu einen entschluss.\n\nDas Game hatte sich weiter Entwickelt aber muss halt noch mit sehr vielen Problemen kämpfen.\n\nAber komme ich mal zu Dead by Daylight. \nEs gibt sehr viele verschiedene Karten, Überlebende aber auch Killers :).\nDie Karten sind echt gut gestalten. Die Steuerung versteht man sehr schnell. \nWas man beachten muss wie z.B.  mit dem Sprinten (als Überlebender) oder als Killer wie man gewisse Fähigkeiten einsetzt, bekommt man natürlich nach und nach mit. \nAus meiner sicht ist es ein super Spiel was man mal gerne alleine oder mit Freunden spielt.

Review:\nAfter having reviewed this product over the years 3 separate times, I am pleased to announce that I am redoubling my last take away on the state of the game.\n\nQuickcap-\n1st review: Nah I hate it. used to love it but it grates on you after a while | Negative\n2nd: it still grates you like mozzarella | Negative\n3rd: Not bad. Added a store and a way to unlock characters (non-licensed) from grinding. | Positive\n\nNow first I must start off with the fact that this game's nature has never changed. Some games I've played have changed by the 3 year mark so that its almost unrecognizable but that isn't the case with Dead by Daylight. As a one Froggy Fresh once recited, its the \"Same Old Kid\" on the block. And yet it continues to see new additions every few months that shake up the meta in the form of new characters that bring some spice to the game. \n\nAt this moment we are a few days into a mid-patch update that sees the addition of what some may call a \"battlepass\" named 'the Rift' and 'The Archives.' Not only does it bring a slew of challenges to tackle to earn rewards such as bloodpoints and progress towards your rift which grants you rewards but it sees the addition of a cool new customization option called Charms. And if that doesn't whet your whistler then wait until you hear about the functional archive part of the deal. Certain challenges offer a third reward in the form of a new entry to your archive that features more lore for each character in the world of DbD. Never before did we see this level of transparency on the inner workings of this dreadful title. But that all changes now. Once you get all the entries for a specific story tidbit, you will unlock a video animation related to that entry that may shed some light on the topic.\n\nLastly, if you took some time out to count the premium currency you earn from the rift, you should have arrived to the same conclusion that I have, which is to say that buying the battlepass and completing the battlepass will earn you enough currency back to buy the next battlepass assuming its going to be the same price. \nThis game is only the second game I have ever seen so far in which its possible for that to happen outside of Fortnite.

In reality, the Killer chooses the tone of the game and has absolute power over how things go. Sometimes this means everyone has fun and the real objective of the game (score points) is chased by both cooperatively. Sometimes this means that the Killer decides the best method of winning is by making things incredibly unfun for one player or more. They can do this with various different methods:\nA \"Mori,\" a consumable offering that allows you to instantly kill a Survivor after they are hooked once. One lets you kill a single Survivor; one lets you kill several; one lets you kill all.\nAn add-on of high rarity, which (depending on the Killer) could let you instantly kill Survivors, or chase them without them being able to escape.\nA perk which allows you to maintain a huge information lead over the Survivors about where they are, what they're doing, and where they're going.\n\nThe Survivors can take the same and although they're not nearly capable of controlling the game in such a way, they can fight back against situations where the Killer takes these--but even the high tier Survivors agree that once these particular add-ons are brought into a game, the game is essentially lost from the start.\n\nBut all this would be manageable, could be fun even, if several base mechanics were fixed. What happens when a Killer hooks a single person and waits nearby them? If they let them get unhooked and chase them? If they knock a person down and stand on top of them? If they wait on a hatch, blocking the entry? If they patrol back and forth on the same hooked person until they die? There's nothing to be done. And even if the rest of the team goes about their game abandoning their friend, at least one person has had no fun, had no chance to play the game, and will de-rank. \n\nThis is not to mention the recent explosion of disconnects, since the recent patches have doubled or tripled the number of disconnects before and during the game, through no fault of the players'. And when they don't disconnect on accident, they often disconnect on purpose. Coming face to face with some universally hated Killers (Legion especially) can cause some players to ragequit since they simply don't want to play a game with the Killer in it--since after all, the players of these Killers often abuse their mechanics to make fighting them impossible.\n\nEven getting into a lobby can be difficult since the ranks often have little bearing on skill, the region matching is garbage, and ping is so vitally important since the game STILL does not have dedicated servers. If you're playing with a group you load into a separate lobby, and then if the lobby you find doesn't work due to ping or the Killer deciding he doesn't like the look of you, you have to go back through the entire process again. And no, you can't search for games below a certain ping, so sometimes you'll get 500+ and that's that.\n\nIn summary, you wait 10 minutes to get a good lobby as a Survivor (God help you if you play Killer, whose lobbies are so long some streamers won't play them) and one of every four games will have a disconnect--so already you have a game that's nearly impossible to win. One of every three games will have an unfun add-on, perk or offering burnt. One of every three will have an unfun Killer against you. One of every three will have a Survivor just up and leave the game or throw it somehow. One of every two will have a Killer who plays in a way that makes at least one person's game unpleasant.\nI'm no hand at math, but those are very low odds. And all of these won't be fixed by the devs because they don't want to, or they can't, or they don't realize these are issues.\n\nThis game is losing its old hands already, and the rest of the game will go with it unless the devs realize they need to act.","timestamp_created":1555155836,"timestamp_updated":1555155836,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50108770","author":{"steamid":"76561198185297918","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1655751882},"language":"english","review":"deci astia e periculosi ca umbla cu cutite si topoare","timestamp_created":1555155371,"timestamp_updated":1614538739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50108637","author":{"steamid":"76561198436827772","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4918,"last_played":1585489029},"language":"russian","review":"Почините ДБД","timestamp_created":1555154882,"timestamp_updated":1555155014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53952711820602417","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50108584","author":{"steamid":"76561198086869945","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17769,"last_played":1605440261},"language":"english","review":"I want to like this game, I really do, but I would not recommend putting time into this game.\n\nThe concept behind this game is really awesome, but I get the feeling that the devs don't really care about their product. Toxicity is a rampant issue in Dead by Daylight. There are plenty of toxic survivors, but if you play as a survivor, you are going to run into toxic killers %80-%90 of the time. \n\nCamping, Tunneling, Slugging, Griefing, this game has it all, and it shows up in most of the games. Having a good killer, and a good game is so rare, which is incredibly sad to say.\n\nWhat makes it really bad though, is the devs do nothing to stop the toxicity. As far as I can tell, the report system does nothing. The rating system is irrelevant. The emblem and bloodpoint scoring system is stupid and heavily in favor of the killers. DCing is a constant issue, as about 1/4 of your games (if you are lucky) will result in a DC. When it comes to DCs the game isn't balanced, as 3v1s are pointless for survivors to play.\n\nBecause the Killer has so much power, if they are toxic, it will make it difficult to enjoy this game while playing. They can exploit the game, and there is nothing that you can do as a survivor to stop it, and the devs do nothing to punish them. Survivors have the hardest jobs, and make way less bloodpoints than the killers. The emblem system was pointless before, and now it's incredibly stupid, as you have to play amazing, but not perfectly, because you are punished if you are too good.\n\nAll in all, I would say stay away from this game. It has rampant issues with bugs, Toxicity, and just isn't worth the time, which really sucks, because if it was handled with care, it would be one of the best games ever.","timestamp_created":1555154629,"timestamp_updated":1555154629,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487013012170791626","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50108539","author":{"steamid":"76561198885174034","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":52911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31961,"last_played":1655217648},"language":"russian","review":"Задумка отличная, реализация так себе.\nЕдинственное что удерживает игру от краха это её уникальность: вы попросту не сможете найти похожей игры, с таким же уровнем исполнения как эта.\nНо за 400 рублей игра более чем хороша, вам точно понравится.
