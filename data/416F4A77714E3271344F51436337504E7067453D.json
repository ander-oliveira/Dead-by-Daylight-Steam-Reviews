The gameplay is just rewarding on both sides of the spectrum. Killer all four survivors as killer or escape with all four survivors, its completely up to you. But this game has many flaws such as unbalanced killers, survivors dont really have a difference once teachables are unlocked, bugs such as being stuck and unable to move, and so on. But once you look past that, the amount of great people I have found in this game and play with to this day is the reason I keep coming back. The streamers are entertaining and the gameplay has replay value. The so called \"toxicity\" in this game is taken way too seriously. You can't expect every person who loses to accept losing and go \"gg\" that doesnt happen in any videogame. Although strats such as camping and tunneling (Chasing the same survivor over and over) is an issue, its a playstyle that might help or hurt the killer depending on the teammates you are with. The mix of perks and addons make the game interesting but the same cant be said with survivor. With that said, this game has heaps to improve on but I think they can do it. Only time will tell.","timestamp_created":1532301388,"timestamp_updated":1532301388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":20,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43689194","author":{"steamid":"76561198348981322","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6723,"last_played":1633488676},"language":"english","review":"its good.","timestamp_created":1532301222,"timestamp_updated":1532301222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43689193","author":{"steamid":"76561198237403432","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":80939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24541,"last_played":1607254503},"language":"russian","review":"Игра определённо стоит своих денег ,интересный геймплей,местами реально может напугать или пробрать на дикий угар при игре с друзьями в пати","timestamp_created":1532301222,"timestamp_updated":1532301222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569801747798919678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43688644","author":{"steamid":"76561198829966981","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":133810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10451,"last_played":1640548806},"language":"spanish","review":"Súper recomendado para jugar con amigos/as no tiene desperdicio.

Les fans de slasher/survie vont adorer. Plusieurs tueurs avec des capacités bien différentes (plus ou moins utile) et de survivants.\n\nLe principe est tout bête, réparer 5 générateurs pour avoir accès à deux portes de sorties pour pouvoir enfin s'échapper. Les parties sont en général toutes différentes les une des autres, les générateurs ne spawn pas au même endroits, les tueurs ont en général des build assez différent et nos coéquipiers également.\n\nTueurs et survivants ont chacun des compétences uniques que l'on peut enseigner à d'autre personnage à condition d'arriver au niveau 40 avec le personage en question. (niveau 30 on peut débloquer la première compétence que l'on va pouvoir enseigner a un autre perso', 35 la deuxième, 40 la troisième)\nSi on ne veut pas level up un personnage pour avoir sa compétence enseignable qui nous intéresse on peut alors attendre qu'elle soit disponible dans le temple (toute les semaines, 4 compétences enseignables sont ajouté au hasard que l'on peut acheter avec des shards)\nOn peut donc avoir des builds assez différents et se régaler si on joue en team pour avoir des builds qui se complète. \n\nOn peut également utiliser ses shards pour débloquer des tenues pour différent survivant et tueur que l'on apprécie.\n\nLes musiques sont bonne et foutent la pression, rien à dire de ce côté là.\n\nLe jeu est mis à jour assez régulièrement avec des event (double exp, triple) ou avec des DLCs qui contienne une map, un survivant et un tueur.\n\nLes défauts du jeu pour moi sont le fait que certaines map se ressemblent trop (pas la structure en elle même mais les différents décors), il y a à peu près trois map par ambiance bien différente comme des champs ou l'on va avoir plusieurs map mais avec une structure différente. \nCertains membre de la communauté sont assez toxic mais bon au final on peut pas y faire grand chose, comme tout jeu ou presque on a notre lot de toxicité qui est là bel et bien présent. \nCertaines parties qui peuvent agacer quand on commence une nouvelle saison ou nos rang sont baissé et on doit donc se taper des personnes qui ne savent pas jouer, assez frustrant. \n\nAprès le fait qu'il y est du pallet loop ou body block, ça fait partie du jeu. Comment les survivants survivent-ils si ils ne peuvent pas utiliser les palettes? Ils ont que ça pour se défendre ou bien la flashlight donc moi ça ne me gène absolument pas. Il y a toujours moyen de brain le loop en question. \n\nBref, je recommande ce jeu absolument. Seul c'est un bon jeu en team pour le peu qu'on s'y investisse c'est un excellent jeu ou on passe de très bons moments. Qu'ils soient drôle ou angoissants, le plaisir est présent même après plus de 2 000 heures de jeu. J'ai 180 et quelques heures sur PC et 1700-1800 heures sur PS4 donc je sais de quoi je parle.\n\nJe comprend toujours pas comment on peut évaluer le jeu négativement avec plus de 1 000 heures de jeu. Si l'on joue autant, c'est que l'on a kiffer à part si une mis à jour bute le jeu. \n\nN'hésitez pas à vous le procurer si vous hésitez, si vous aimez le genre vous ne regretterais pas à condition de s'y investir un minimum. \n\n\n","timestamp_created":1532289527,"timestamp_updated":1532289527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473868131637573242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43686497","author":{"steamid":"76561197994859362","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17334,"last_played":1658169581},"language":"german","review":"Trash game, million buggs and they dont fix even one since beta.","timestamp_created":1532289359,"timestamp_updated":1532289359,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43685899","author":{"steamid":"76561198540443000","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":38154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5209,"last_played":1658713431},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo muito viciante","timestamp_created":1532287220,"timestamp_updated":1532287220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43685729","author":{"steamid":"76561198802749559","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1537505144},"language":"english","review":"Bought this game for it's unique gameplay.

I could tell you how fun it can be, or I could tell you what is most likely to happen. I'll go with the latter. If you queue survivor and the killer finds you and hooks you, they'll probably just wait nearby for someone to pick you up and put you back on the hook again. I think it's a horrible thing they've done where they don't separate Casual play and Ranked play unless you already have like 4 other friends who can play the game with you. I don't have 4 friends with this game. Additionally, I  think from the killer's perspective survive with friends is kind of unfair. There's literally perks in the game that let you know where people are. There's no voice chat or text chat, but if you're on Discord or Teamspeak you completely get around all of that. I think survivors can be really toxic, too. There's literally only about a minute of chat before and after the match and somehow survivors still manage to be toxic. It makes it kinda horrible inviting friends to play knowing they'll just get farmed and raged at in post game. Now, if you can get over all of that unbalanced gameplay, then this game is probably for you. It's supposed to be a team game, but I've found that if you're in a group on a call, it's unfair to the killer by a large margin. If you're a survivor and not in the group in the call, they'll probably be jerks to you and leave you to die and then talk shit at you in the postgame chat. It makes it pretty impossible to recommend this game to anyone. \n\n(EDIT: The new skill-based matchmaking is so broken that it can't even match you up at your proper rank, with rank 18 and 19 killers (ranked out of 20) often having to face survivors who are half their rank and therefore significantly more experienced or vice versa. At least before if you lost, you lost to someone who was your equal ranking or within 2 or 3 of you)\n\n\nEDIT 11/22/2021: Still wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy. This game sucks for killers. I say this as someone who has hit Rank 1 Survivor and Rank 1 Killer.\n\nEDIT 7/19/22: They added a prestige update which should have cut down grind, but has taken away teachable killer perks from me since I haven't prestiged every killer.
