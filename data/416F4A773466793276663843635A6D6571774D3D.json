The game is fun at the start but once you start to get very good at the game, you will start to hate it. MMR honestly has ruined this game for me to the point where I only have fun if I dont take it seriously. Then again the game was at it's best when it first released and no one took it seriously. Now the devs are trying to make it into an esports title when it really isn't. The MMR has also made the tribalism in this community worse. Toxic killers trash survivors, and toxic survivors trash killers. I'd recommend this game to anyone that just wants to dick around and have fun. Otherwise I'd say a hard pass to anyone who's naturally competitive. It's just frustrating as hell when you take it seriously, and makes you want to stick your dong in a toaster.","timestamp_created":1647088035,"timestamp_updated":1647088035,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112035396","author":{"steamid":"76561197993670528","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":11782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":11306,"last_played":1659663781},"language":"english","review":"very fun game","timestamp_created":1647087882,"timestamp_updated":1647087882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112035250","author":{"steamid":"76561199157854472","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7859,"last_played":1656344184},"language":"thai","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1647087705,"timestamp_updated":1647087705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112035116","author":{"steamid":"76561198027074448","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":23470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":903,"playtime_at_review":17230,"last_played":1660565334},"language":"english","review":"Shit devs who don't care, worse community than League and Rust combined.

I just wanted to leave a review here and now because I wanted to say a few things. \n\nOn console, I played this game for a long time. I really enjoyed playing as killer, specifically as Pig. But there were so many things taking away from the fun. \n\n1.) Toxic Players. This game is full of insecure players who like to put others down. It's a revolving cycle- toxic survivors breed toxic killers and vice versa. \n\n2.) Awful grind. Seriously, just terrible. \n\n3.) Boon Totems. This is the final (but obviously not only) reason why I quit. They take the unfun I have as killer and crank it up to maximum. \n\n4.) The Devs. I don't respect them. They keep the bar for this game so, so low. I mean, it took them 4 years to add colorblind settings, and they only did it after their public image was threatened. I do not respect them at all. \n\n5.) Large RNG. You can, as killer, get a map that favors you, or you can get a map that just completely sucks for whatever killer you're playing. \n\nThere's other reasons, but I really can't think of them right now. Those are the main ones though. This game has an interesting concept. The lore is interesting too.

drain.","timestamp_created":1647081761,"timestamp_updated":1647081761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112030016","author":{"steamid":"76561198322273071","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":35179,"last_played":1660209633},"language":"schinese","review":"XDM别玩，真的狗都不玩，外挂满天飞。这游戏圈内节奏比任何游戏都要多，各种定规矩，主播撕逼，赛后互骂。很多问题，明明官方下场，通过改变一些机制就能解决。比如说赛后聊天框，玩家之间友好交流的概率非常低，都在互相问候家人，明明可以像LOL一样直接删除。但人家就是不改，直接开摆。同时又对政治正确特别重视，什么歪风邪气，黑人主播被鞭尸立马就要删除巴布的所有面具，合着其他人就不是人了呗，不管面具是否解锁，统一赔偿一模一样的血点，肝面具花费的时间，在他们眼里不值一提。[spoiler]甚至到现在还有玩家赔偿的血点没有到账[/spoiler]\n

The game itself is painful to play most of the time. It's grind is disgustingly brutal and most times is pay to win. It's enjoyable when first starting out, as lower levels are not as toxic. But play too long and you'll suffer. As players play less for fun and more for the grind. Survivors have crutches and other perks that make it a breeze, especially ability to party up. That being said killers also have their fair share of crutches and overpowered perks/powers. If you really want this game, pleas buy it and have fun. I personally have grow a distaste to it over by 200+ hours. It can be fun in small bursts, but most times it leaves me feeling empty. Even if I \"win\" I gain no good feeling from it. It's always just \"oh look blood web time\". Until this game sees some kind of fixes, whether it be with maps, perks or something.
