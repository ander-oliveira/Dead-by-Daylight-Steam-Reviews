You will see characters from: Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Left 4 Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead, Stranger Things, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Hellraiser, and Ringu. There are cosmetics from Attack on Titan on the way.\n-If you're a person heavily invested in story, you can optionally read into the heavy lore.\n-Although the cosmetics cost money, a lot of them are incredibly well made.\n-The ranking system is not entirely dependent on whether you escape (as a survivor) or kill every survivor (as a killer). It is also dependent on your performance and contribution to the team in-game. This can help if you suffer from the faults of teammates.\n\nCons:\n-Steep learning curve, there A LOT of perks (special abilities you can equip), powers (exclusive abilities for each killer), and mechanics to memorize. The tutorial won't teach you everything but I definitely recommend doing it regardless (you also get a little reward for doing it).\n-Grinding is a big part of the game and sometimes a tedious process\n-There is a lot of DLC and frankly, purchasing all of that is really expensive. For any non-crossover characters, you can purchase with them with f2p currency, but it will definitely take a while to collect. Unfortunately, a lot of the best perks are locked behind DLC.\n-Community can be a bit toxic at times. It's best to ignore those people. Some will complain about the other side running meta perks while they themselves are running meta perks. \n-Hit registration is sometimes a bit weird but I don't think it's as bad as people say.\n-Unbalanced to a degree, some things can work heavily in the favor of one side","timestamp_created":1657234474,"timestamp_updated":1657234474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118416373","author":{"steamid":"76561199266408310","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1657222961},"language":"japanese","review":"起動しないウンコゲー\n金返せウンコ野郎ども","timestamp_created":1657233821,"timestamp_updated":1657233821,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516455113887786865","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118416210","author":{"steamid":"76561199022238799","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":739,"last_played":1657760037},"language":"english","review":"The game is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. \n","timestamp_created":1657233592,"timestamp_updated":1657233592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118416036","author":{"steamid":"76561198862613263","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":814,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1660519548},"language":"english","review":"fun fun fun fun fun","timestamp_created":1657233332,"timestamp_updated":1657233332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118415996","author":{"steamid":"76561197965482596","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":228061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6503,"playtime_at_review":194208,"last_played":1660062576},"language":"english","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1657233265,"timestamp_updated":1657233265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118415800","author":{"steamid":"76561199065497396","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":964,"last_played":1657997203},"language":"spanish","review":"Es una mecánica de juego preciosa, jugar tanto de superviviente como de asesino.

The killer has to kill the survivors by finding them and hit them down and hang them on a hook. A survivor can be hooked twice, beeing hooked a third time is deadly.\nThe killer plays in first person while the survivors play in third person.\nAs of writting there are currently 35 Maps, 22 Killers and 24 survivors.\nThere are famous Killers from movies in the list, like Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers. Same goes for the survivor side, there are survivors like Ash from Evil Dead Series or Laurie Strode.\nFrom playing games you will receive Bloodpoints. Those Bloodpoints can be used to level up your character and unlock items, offerings and perks in the Bloodweb.\nAfter reaching level 50 you can prestige, meaning you will reset everything you unlocked for your character and you will receive a bloody skin version for your character. You can prestige 3 times.\nFor people who like to customize their characters, Dead by Daylight has an ingame store for cosmetics and a battle pass.\nThe game also features crossplay with Playstation players since a while.\nDead by Daylight was released in 2016, so graphics has become a bit dated. However, the developers have started to update the graphics also in terms of the new console generation.\nThe playerbase is more or less stable around 40,000 concurrent players on Steam.\nI think Dead by Daylight is the only asymmetrical multiplayer which is good so far. Even so if the latest update changed the animations and HUD for the worst from my point of view. Other negative aspects of the game are the weird hitboxes and the toxic behavior of some people.\nOverall Dead by Daylight is an addictive game and delivers fun for many hours and still gets new content.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10","timestamp_created":1657230580,"timestamp_updated":1657230580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118413739","author":{"steamid":"76561198426275945","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16025,"last_played":1650703302},"language":"spanish","review":"Después de 200 horas siendo corrido por campers tuneleros y no ser salvado por tus compañeros porque o están dando vueltas agachados por el mapa o errando todos los skils checks en un generador puedo decir que es un juegazo, mas cuando te tilteas y entras de killer y te volves lo que juraste destruir.","timestamp_created":1657230166,"timestamp_updated":1657230350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118412405","author":{"steamid":"76561198058671957","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":318,"playtime_at_review":9478,"last_played":1660005662},"language":"english","review":"I am new to the game, I loop the killer for 6-10 minutes maybe 3 gens have popped if I'm lucky.

Personally, i believe the gamesmanship or lack there of from survivors can really set the tone of a match. Fortunately, smart as you lot think you are with ya flashlights and swfs, i found the appropriate counter to bring them back to earth.....
