While the devs are definitely not prone to mistakes, the Mid-Chapter Update 4.5.0 is the first time I've honestly been disappointed with the devs handling of their product. Typically I can see reasonable explanations for mistakes, and they use their platforms to smooth things out PR side, reminding everyone that the devs too are humans, make mistakes,  are limited on time, admit to their mistakes, listen and respond to feedback, and give a reasonable time frame in which they will be working to fix the issues. However, this Update is different.\n\nThis Mid-Chapter Update introduces new animations that remind me of the choppy movement in the Plastic Barbie Doll shows my younger sister used to watch, a new UI that was and is majority sided disliked and that is objectively a bad UI in design, a mediocre Clown Rework that doesn't really make him more fun to play or play against, a new Rift that doesn't have too much to offer, especially considering a good portion of what it consists of is from the Mobile version of DBD, some nice looking updated visuals for older maps that improved the game play a bit but also brought bugs that can be exploited than made it to the Live Update, and some alright perk changes.\n\nNow, to respond to the short minded responses of, \"None of these changes really harm the game, and the devs apparently are going to do more with it. Why are you complaining?\" I think it's safe to say DBD has its fair share of problems. From the fun balanced game play mechanics of Spirit, Iri Head, Keys, clear Meta Perks that don't get changed up much at all, Perks that are do more bad than good and are never used, hit boxes, lack of accessibility options like settings for those who are color blind, and don't even get me started on the bugs.\n\nSo, now that we're on the same page in seeing the fact that there's a plentiful amount of work the devs need to get through, we can see why the \"This stuff isn't even that bad\" point doesn't really do much. They spent Half a Quarter of Dev time, on changes that no one asked for, wanted, or needed, that also brought in a new collection of bugs, with fun things like the new hit box issues brought with this update. \n\nAnd to make matters even worse, they released this patch in a PTB, which are supposedly meant to get community feedback. Players spent their limited free time, playing a very buggy PTB version of their game, and a clear majority then took the time to share opinions of distaste in the animations and especially the UI, which objectively has flaws when considering the foundation basics of UI design. Yet despite a clear majority feedback, in a play test meant to get opinions on the patch, it was shipped to live as is. This lack of PTB to Live Update patch has REALLY solidified the take that the PTB is primarily a place to use the player base as a free QA Team instead of a place to get opinions from the community on changes. \n\nWith this, there has been little to no clear explanation of the reasoning behind these changes, which makes matters worse. Hopefully that will be published soon and there will be a very solid reason behind the community getting such a cold shoulder via the lack of the Live Update changes reflecting the community's feedback. Because otherwise, this will be a very disappointing happening that has been built up over time with the recent updates.\n\nThe 4.5.0 Mid-Chapter Update seems to be a Culmination of issues formed due to lack in proper dev time and management to produce a well polished product in time to meet the set schedule. We've seen it again and again, more than usual in the last months, where we are hit with the explanation that \"There are bugs because we really wanted to get this out for Halloween. There are bugs because we really wanted to get this out in time for Christmas.\" I really don't think this Mid-Chapter Update is the Product of a solid half a quarter of dev time from BHVR's team. It seems to me that the team is fairly flustered right now and scraping to get by, much more than usual. \n\nWe know nothing of the business side of BHVR, how hard investors are pushing them, how well production and development time is managed, etc., but I really think the community should push them to spend more time on polishing the end product. In my opinion, BHVR cannot realistically keep up with their current development schedule, and I think the recent updates can back this. I believe we should try to communicate with the devs, and show to their investors or whoever might be rushing them, that we will still financially support DBD as a product, maybe even more so than now, if they take more time to take community feedback and polish the end product.\n\nHopefully they'll take this wave of negative community feed as a turning point to halt this cycle of rushing a buggy mess of updates and hope the Bunny Feng Cosmetics are enough to keep them afloat. Jokes but,\n\nHere's to Hoping.","timestamp_created":1612992010,"timestamp_updated":1612992010,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524733245372772217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86360519","author":{"steamid":"76561198964706970","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":70672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":702,"playtime_at_review":18413,"last_played":1660452441},"language":"brazilian","review":"A cada atualização uma decepção diferente, mas as vezes é bom.

I have made a ton of friends and have a community of friends that came from this game. There was a point where I looked forward to playing this game every day, but now have no motivation to even load it anymore. How can I when the devs continually give their community a slap in the face every single time they ignore them or change something no one asked for? This most recent chapter, on top of every single one that has been released since Deathslinger, IMO, has just progressively gotten worse. Breakable walls was the first mistake that the players didn't want. It was a bandage to the issue of infinite loops. The community continually persisted their dislike to the changes, yet more breakable walls were added to all the different maps. Billy was nerfed, all the veterans asked for were addon changes. All the players that had more than a few hundred hours yelled about this change, and he still was partially gutted. The last four killers are anti-loop and not the least bit interactive for players that have any experience with LOOPING. This company releases player test builds and even if the whole community screams about a change being bad (that no one asked for, ex. HUD change), you would think they'd listen, right? No, it's something that will \"be no going back\" on. Don't even get me started on their accessibility issues and how it took some huge content creator that was new to the game for them to finally \"change\" things to be more accessible for those that are color blind. Why did it take someone that has a huge mainly non-dbd audience for you guys to listen to the same complaints longtime community members have been screaming about for years?\n\nI can't continue to put 30+ hours a week into a game that does not show any transparency on changes, listen to community feedback, and continually caters to only the new players who have little experience or understanding of the base mechanics of the game.","timestamp_created":1612991475,"timestamp_updated":1612991475,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668785154819488525","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86360056","author":{"steamid":"76561198115393466","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36403,"last_played":1658250187},"language":"spanish","review":"Llevo jugando a este juego desde casi que salió. Lo he disfrutado como un niño y sigo haciéndolo cuando puedo ya que no dispongo de demasiado tiempo desde hace un par de años. He ignorado las críticas al juego y me he dedicado simplemente a seguir disfrutándolo, pero esta última actualización del día 09/02/21 me ha parecido, con todos mis respetos, lamentable. Los asesinos golpean desde muchísima distancia, los movimientos de los supervivientes no son para nada fluidos y restringen la habilidad que hemos desarrollado los jugadores todos estos años. La interfaz del juego se ha vuelto bastante molesta a la vista ya que la posición en la que está ocupa bastante pantalla además de que estorbar. No quiero tocar temas como la toxicidad y derivados, ya que eso considero que es más trabajo de la comunidad que de los devs. Solo pido que escuchen a la comunidad y corrijan lo que esta actualización ha traído y no con ello me refiero a que obligatoriamente devuelvan el juego a como estaba antes, si no a que lo que han añadido esté más trabajado y ayude a mantener este juego como algo divertido y que motive a ser jugado, no algo a lo que odiar.

It's easier to lose points to putz's than it is to gain points. This is compounded by 2 things. A ranking system that requires months and months to increase rank instead of being fair to everyone and reseting to 20 each month. This allows those who play everyday and night to be the only ones with high rank. This is all made worse by Killers who are overpowered and generally played by the weakest players to gain rank. Bubba and Nightmare do not require mediocre players to use any tactics. Bubba's frenzy one hit down is almost impossible to avoid rendering 2 hits to down a moot point while he also removes the ability to hide in lockers effectively. Nightmare has a very small terror radius as well as fake pallets and can teleport instantly to the generator you are working on from across the map. These two killers along with a bad ranking system show the devs care more about addicts than tactics and fun gameplay.

Eu jogo desde 2018 e tenho aí boas horas de gameplay, mas essa última atualização não deu pra engolir. Conseguiram piorar o que já estava ruim e estragar o que tinha de bom.\n\nOs problemas do jogo são os seguintes:\n\n- hit box bugada: se você pula a janela quando em perseguição e dá dois passos pra longe, o assassino ainda consegue te acertar com o ataque básico porque a hit box é bem maior do que o aparente. Alguns assassinos em particular, como a Caçadora, o Pesadelo e a Enfermeira, conseguem acertar ainda mais longe sem ser nada aparente para o sobrevivente. Uma breve pesquisa no YouTube e você percebe esse problema. NUNCA consertaram, desde 2018, e nessa última atualização parece que está pior. Mesmo com a conexão totalmente estável, mesmo com sua máquina mega potente, ainda assim isso ocorre.\n\n- consertar gerador: a atividade em si é muito entediante, só manter o M1 clicado e acertar uns testes de perícia aqui e ali, que é difícil apenas nas primeiras 10 horas de jogo. Antes, você poderia apertar ESC com o M1 pressionado, soltar e apertar ESC de novo, o sobrevivente fica consertando sem precisar manter o dedo clicado. Com a nova atualização, tiraram isso, deixando ainda mais cansativo e entediante. \n\n- HUD: antes, o display do jogo era bastante dinâmico e simples, informava o que era necessário e ainda era interessante. Com a nova atualização, cagaram em tudo, trocaram tudo de lugar (sem motivo algum) e dificultaram visualizar as informações sem perder o foco no jogo em si. Parece que ficou completamente genérico, com uns efeitos bem toscos nos ícones de sobreviventes. \n\n- bugs genéricos: existem diversos problemas que vão e voltam no jogo, como árvores e morros que \"sugam\" e prendem o jogador no mesmo lugar, habilidades que muitas vezes falham (Ataque Decisivo, Duro na Queda, De Cabeça), quedas de partidas com punição (por vezes os jogadores são expulsos de um servidor que derruba a partida, mas ainda assim os jogadores tomam punição como se eles tivessem saído de propósito), e por aí vai.\n\nEnfim, joguei o suficiente pra amar e odiar o jogo, agora já perdeu o sentido.

It has great potential, but somehow, the developers find a way to further damage their games, with updates usually leading to glitches and bugs. They have a PTB to listen to feedback but they often don’t actually take the time to listen to input, with this recent update shattering the core gameplay.\n\nThe animations were meant to be cosmetic, but have made hitboxes a guessing game. “Will he hit me through the pallet again?” And “How did he hit me from 8 feet away?” are often thoughts going through my mind each time the killer swings. The UI is designed to be like an MMO, but that doesn’t work with this type of game as you rely on being able to quickly gather information, and having information in all 4 corners as well as in the middle makes paying attention difficult, and with the original layout having info in the bottom left and right being easy to read, it’s hard to wonder why the developers thought they should add it in. The rework for clown essentially buffs survivors as it gives survivors a speed buff for walking through the alternate gas cloud. It took 2 years to nerf Decisive Strike, and of course they made it a perk too strong to be considered balanced. Another 3 years and the perk is finally being fixed. Color blind mode is just now being added, and it’s only damage control from one of the developers insulting colorblind players.\n\nIn summary, the game itself is genius, but due to a lack of competition to force effort into updates combined with the incompetence of Behavior Interactive, I can’t recommend this game to beginners as they face killers that have 5000 hours and above.\n\n(P.S,the excuse that you deleted your UI is lackluster at best, please listen to what your community has to offer, before we suffer the game dying in the same fashion as Friday the 13th The Game. Acting like you know what’s best for your game after each update crumbling your reputation as a game developer isn’t the way to go about this.)","timestamp_created":1612988739,"timestamp_updated":1612989752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86357859","author":{"steamid":"76561198049798395","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":135288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1073,"playtime_at_review":108364,"last_played":1660596286},"language":"russian","review":"Вышло обновление - удалил игру... без комментариев...","timestamp_created":1612988584,"timestamp_updated":1612988584,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604872822761535645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86357782","author":{"steamid":"76561199102602071","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1658587996},"language":"japanese","review":"キラー専ですが本当にひどいアプデだと思います。画面に映る情報量を処理しきれないです。ただでさえ動き回る生存者を追いかけているのに、アプデで生存者の状態、発電機の数の表示場所がバラバラになってとてもやりづらいです。元に戻すか、配置場所をカスタマイズできるかしてください。","timestamp_created":1612988485,"timestamp_updated":1612988485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547169983386993408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86357745","author":{"steamid":"76561198369607286","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":100768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":575,"playtime_at_review":28215,"last_played":1660541044},"language":"english","review":"I hate that I love this game.","timestamp_created":1612988451,"timestamp_updated":1618606472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86357688","author":{"steamid":"76561198086858376","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":6875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6875,"last_played":1612988186},"language":"english","review":"After the the new update the new animations have messed with the hitboxes to where they don't match the player models, the shitty new UI ,which although it looks clean, why should I have to look all around my entire screen to get the same information that I got by just looking at the bottom left screen a week ago, and the now extremely shitty performance, I can't recommend this game.
