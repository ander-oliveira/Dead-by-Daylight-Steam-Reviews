By Daylight is pretty unique, it shows how an asymetrical game can be competitive and fun, however a majority of the time you play this game, you will be left annoyed and dissatisfied because in this game's current state, its really just a never-ending race to the bottom to see how much you can piss off others and vice versa. \n\nI have played this game about 200 or so hours on console and enough on PC, but they are virtually the exact same game with the same problems.\n\n\nWhat could be a very good game is held back constantly by its frustrating mechanics, poor balance, neglect from the developers, and just overall bullsh!t. \n\nFirst off I want to talk about this game's balancing issues. Now obviously some killers and survivors will be better than others, but this game takes killer differences to a new level. Why are some killers like wraith, the clown, and the cannibal so much faster than the other ones? It makes sense as to why they would be faster than someone such as the nurse who has the blink ability, but often times survivors get shafted because they either cant detect a killer in time before they find you and catch up to you too quickly, or leads to other moments of BS such as if you are playing ring around the rosie with pallets and other obstacles, and the killer can manuever too quickly. Wraith is already powerful enough, and (though it was fixed recently) he was even more broken because he could spam the bell and go significantly faster. Fast killers arent inherently a problem, for example hillbilly who takes a risk of gaining speed and potentially insta-downing a survivor but at the cost of turn radius, and if they miss they are slowed for a few seconds.  \n\nSome killers are just outright broken such as Michael Myers who can bring an add on in which he INSTANTLY GRABS AND KILLS YOU even at the beginning of the match, OR him being permanently in T3 which spells game over for everyone as its basically NOED but it lasts the entire time. Mori's do not have a place in this game at all, they benefit the killer too much for no trade off whatsoever.  \n\nSome killers have the opposite problem such as Freddie or the Pig, who has been shafted so bad by the developers that you dont even see him being played anymore. Their lunge distance and detection is laughable compared to the other killers, and they both require too many steps to effectively use their abilities. \n\nSurvivors don't have these problems to the same extent because all of their add ons are the same, and they don't have any unique abilities per character. Don't get me wrong there are some annoyingly broken survivor tactics and perks that are frustrating for killers and survivors alike (flashlight troll spam :P)\n\nKillers such as Michael Myers, The clown, Wraith, and the legion have way too many advantages for how little trade offs they have. They aren't even the most powerful killer, who is the nurse. What makes the nurse the best however is that she is skill intensive, and a good nurse will almost always win, but it takes skill to master her. Even though she is objectively the best killer in the whole game, she isn't nearly as frustrating because she is heavily skill intensive, and she can be countered by anyone, even if it takes some skill and experience to dodge her blink. Its just too frustrating to deal with the other killers because of their ludicrous speed and terror radius advantages, unfair overpowered add-ons, as well as lunge and hit detection, which leads me to the next topic.\n\n\n\nSome games tend to have problems with hit detection, registration, invisible walls, and obstacles, but Dead by Daylight cranks it up several hundred notches and makes it so that everything must be touching you at all times, whether you are a survivor or killer. There are several problems here such as unresponsive and undersensitive controls, poor melee hit detection, poor registration, and obstacles. \n\nSince you will be most likely playing on a WASD keyboard, it is very hard for survivors to make precise moves which can be a serious problem since a good chunk of the time you will need to move your camera around and not be looking directly in front of you. You have to sort of accelerate to full sprint speed (albeit it is not much) but a lot of the time its hard to start doing that because a lot of the time you will be hitting L-SHIFT and wont be sprinting, and you'll need to hit it again and again, and again. It isn't just limited to sprinting, this game has unresponsive controls on just about everything. I go to a generator and I have to click an hold several times just to start repairing it because it wont pick up the fact that i'm holding left click, and I was able to anyway because i'm right next to the generator and it says \"press M1 to start repairing\" and I start pressing it, and nothing happens. This sounds trivial but it can mean life or death if you are in a chase. I cant tell you how many damn times I have gotten killed because i hit SPACE to throw a pallet or vault a window, and my survivor just sits next to it awkwardly and gets hit. This game has some of the most unresponsive controls I have seen in any game, and i'm very surprised nobody is talking about it since I see it happen to not just other survivors, but other killers as well. \n\nI mentioned that it can be hard to make precise movements as a survivor because how often you need to look around you, this is cemented by the fact that you bump into pretty much everything when getting chased. Both survivors and killers often bump into object that they either cannot see, or just get stopped anyway even if you aren't even touching them. you can get caught into nooks and crannies that can spell certain doom for you as you are unable to do anything about it. Why anyone thought it was fine to add closed walls, and nooks where its impossible to get out of them once you are in them, leading to you getting downed, is beyond me. It just gets so frustrating when you combine the shoddy hit detection and the fact you sometimes have to be looking around you. \n\nSome killers have the most ridiculous lunges, and hit detection ever. Its BAD, like Call of Duty bad. If I had a nickel for every time I have been hit despite being more than 6 feet ahead of the killer when they swing, or when I was behind them, OR when I throw a pallet or am on the other side of a window, I would have enough money to buy my own dead by daylight eSports team. There is no excuse for a game like this to have such horrendous hit detection, especially since the game already favors killers in most situations anyway. \n\n\nFinally, this game has some of the most unfair perks that could ever be seen. A lot of the Hex perks in the game should not be hex's because having to rely on RNG for a good totem spawn is absolutely cancerous when you have perks such as devour hope, which is free mori's on everyone past 5 hooks, No one escapes death, which spells doom for anyone waiting to be rescued from a hook, or my personal favorite, RUIN. Having perks who's usage rely on how long they can stay on the map without getting destroyed ends up making the game way too luck based. All the while facecamping still goes unpunished, the community has been waiting for dedicated servers for 700 years, and quitters, saboteur survivors, trolls, lagswitchers and the like are not punished for any of their actions.\n\n I really want to like this game because it can be fun and unique but when I get sniped by a knife that's several meters behind me, im screwed over by my teammates, I get pallet vacuumed and flashlighted as killer, the matchmaking takes 10-20 minutes to find a game and the killer ends up leaving anyway, and my game crashes 3 times in 2 hours with the same stupid error, it makes me not ever want to play this game again. \n\nI will still enjoy this game from time to time, but I can not really recommend it to anyone, especially those who want to take it seriously.","timestamp_created":1582364228,"timestamp_updated":1593042139,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63921492","author":{"steamid":"76561198213416115","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12404,"last_played":1653261902},"language":"russian","review":"атмосферная игра))","timestamp_created":1582364164,"timestamp_updated":1582364164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63921468","author":{"steamid":"76561198395452954","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":20242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1043,"last_played":1651845949},"language":"russian","review":"dfghfdgh","timestamp_created":1582364132,"timestamp_updated":1582364132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513618648052215576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63920447","author":{"steamid":"76561198094767355","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":42,"playtime_at_review":4245,"last_played":1660228560},"language":"english","review":"Better experience playing with friends on microphones.\nMatchmaking is usually unfair but what makes this game fun is the frustation that comes with the gameplay lol","timestamp_created":1582362711,"timestamp_updated":1606478021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63920347","author":{"steamid":"76561199009958701","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":14462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14462,"last_played":1599901255},"language":"ukrainian","review":"хуйня эбаная для кончених лдаунав","timestamp_created":1582362596,"timestamp_updated":1642779249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63919978","author":{"steamid":"76561198957599775","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2809,"last_played":1590233820},"language":"english","review":"EPIC","timestamp_created":1582362125,"timestamp_updated":1582362125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63919289","author":{"steamid":"76561197965480485","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1637353861},"language":"swedish","review":"One of my favorite horror game!","timestamp_created":1582361058,"timestamp_updated":1582361058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63919098","author":{"steamid":"76561198840256627","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":996,"last_played":1626134215},"language":"russian","review":")","timestamp_created":1582360789,"timestamp_updated":1582360789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491869926452636719","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63918932","author":{"steamid":"76561198305331919","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2174,"last_played":1618874599},"language":"english","review":"Lovely game.

There is a good amount of fun killers to chose from each having their own unique power, perks and stories. The survivors are relatively the same and the game play is a simple and fun concept of completing 5 generators to open an exit gate and get out.

Often times leveling up seems pointless past the first prestige, as the skin it gives you is outclassed by anything bought in the store. The game gives you nothing to incentivize ranking up, no skins or extras for reaching rank 1, 5, or anything above. The community is beyond toxic and often times will resort to racial slurs after some games. The game also does nothing to stop camping, it is an aspect of the game that will never be fixed and survivors more often than not die trying to save. Lastly and more importantly, the game never changes, no new modes, no exciting temporary items in those modes, and no variation in the maps to keep me and many of my friends from becoming bored even by the new ones after a week or so. I commend the team for being active with the nerfs and not allowing certain perks to dominate for too long, but even the nerfs to overpowered perks leave much to be desired.","timestamp_created":1582341930,"timestamp_updated":1582341930,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63907636","author":{"steamid":"76561197991866947","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1290,"last_played":1640214513},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom dms","timestamp_created":1582341825,"timestamp_updated":1582341825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63907392","author":{"steamid":"76561198148052175","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":14589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8749,"last_played":1657097452},"language":"english","review":"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhelp","timestamp_created":1582341366,"timestamp_updated":1582341366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63907357","author":{"steamid":"76561198318559457","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5681,"last_played":1618171160},"language":"russian","review":"Run Вася, Run...\n[СЛОМАНО]\nF*cking Dungeon X(","timestamp_created":1582341318,"timestamp_updated":1615289400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63907228","author":{"steamid":"76561198925997018","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3768,"last_played":1654531785},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกมากกก ชอบๆ","timestamp_created":1582341133,"timestamp_updated":1582341133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63907046","author":{"steamid":"76561198045294127","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":10517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6621,"last_played":1655483385},"language":"turkish","review":"önceden bende sevmiyordum. saçma geliyordu.\nama şimdi seviyorum.\nİki kesim vardır seven ve sevmeyen ben sevenlerdenim.
