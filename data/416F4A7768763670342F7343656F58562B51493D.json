Recomendo muito para quem tenha alguns amigos para jogar, porém sugiro que quem tenha apenas curiosidade e vá jogar sozinho, em partidas com pessoas aleatórias, espere uma promoção, porque apesar do jogo ser muito divertido, pode enjoar rápido e ser muito repetitivo depois de um tempo, além de ter muitos momentos estressantes (como a maioria dos jogos multiplayer). Nota: 8/10\n\nAnálise completa: Bem-vindo a Dead by Daylight, ou DBD para os íntimos. Aqui, você irá presenciar situações hilárias com seus amigos e/ou pessoas aleatórias (o jogo é 100% online, não existe campanha ou \"modo solo\") ou momentos consideravelmente irritantes contra assassinos e estratégias \"roubados\", principalmente contra jogadores mais experientes. O jogo se baseia na disputa 4x1 entre dois times de jogadores: os sobreviventes, que devem consertar 5 geradores para conseguir escapar vivos, e o assassino, que deve perseguir e capturar esses sobreviventes. A premissa é simples, porém o jogo com certeza não é. Entre dezenas de personagens, atributos, habilidades, equipamentos, complementos e \"oferendas\", DBD consegue ser bastante complicado de se masterizar, principalmente se você decidir jogar sozinho e sem pesquisar ou ler as instruções (que são bem grandes por sinal); por isso, as primeiras partidas do jogo podem ser meio desconfortáveis pela falta de experiência do jogador, mas garanto que o jogo melhora muito com o tempo, a medida que você começa a entender suas mecânicas. Outro ponto que merece ser destacado é o balanceamento, que pode ser muito frustrante em algumas partidas: existem alguns personagens e atributos (\"perks\") muito mais fortes do que outros, o que torna algumas partidas muito desbalanceadas e gera momentos estressantes, comprometendo um pouco a experiência. DBD também é classificado como jogo de terror, mas é improvável que você sinta medo jogando ele, já que a verdadeira premissa do jogo é a diversão (de preferência entre amigos) e a competição (também de preferência entre amigos). O jogo vai exigir não só sua habilidade e prática, mas também criatividade para criar estratégias e manobras para escapar dos perigos ou perseguir os objetivos, então é interessante que você busque entender todos os aspectos do jogo enquanto o joga, para garantir uma experiência completa. No fim, Dead by Daylight é um jogo multiplayer extremamente divertido para se jogar com os amigos, e apenas divertido por um tempo para se jogar sozinho, pois a comunicação e interação entre pessoas conhecidas tornam as situações presenciadas muito mais engraçadas e memoráveis, e sem isso o jogo é apenas legal por um tempo (a menos que você realmente goste e se apegue muito das mecânicas, que são realmente bastante únicas e bem feitas). No final, merece um 8/10 pela sua criatividade, diversão e durabilidade (por mais que você jogue sozinho, se você não cansar, há muito conteúdo como personagens e habilidades para se desbloquear, o que deixa o jogo bastante longo, mesmo que repetitivo), e recomendo muito que esperem uma promoção para que se possa comprar o jogo junto com um grupo de amigos, garantindo dias e noites de risadas e situações tensas de perseguição e sobrevivência.","timestamp_created":1631143548,"timestamp_updated":1631143548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99023034","author":{"steamid":"76561198142601633","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":22107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":117,"playtime_at_review":15879,"last_played":1659516571},"language":"english","review":"They fixed the 10 minute queue time, thank you","timestamp_created":1631142766,"timestamp_updated":1631142766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99022983","author":{"steamid":"76561199082412710","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":77854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60008,"last_played":1657403737},"language":"english","review":"its shit but good shit\n","timestamp_created":1631142682,"timestamp_updated":1631142682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99022801","author":{"steamid":"76561198285294952","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25857,"last_played":1657506466},"language":"english","review":"its alright","timestamp_created":1631142384,"timestamp_updated":1631142384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99022788","author":{"steamid":"76561198381790725","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":13592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1658036667},"language":"english","review":"This game sucks","timestamp_created":1631142366,"timestamp_updated":1631142366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99022660","author":{"steamid":"76561198979953764","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4780,"last_played":1659169990},"language":"spanish","review":"Ingredientes\npara unas 20 galletas de avena\n115g. de copos de avena\n50g. de harina (puede ser harina integral)\n75g. de azúcar negra (puede ser blanca)\n50ml. de aceite (de maíz o girasol)\n1 huevo\n1 pizca de sal\n1 cdita. de esencia de vainilla\n \n\nReceta de galletas de avena fáciles\nasí se hacen\n-Batir el huevo y mezclarlo con el azúcar hasta que quede una preparación cremosa.\n-Agregar el aceite y la esencia de vainilla y unir bien.\n-Incorporar la harina, la pizca de sal y los copos de avena.

Man könnte es auch \"Seite mit useless Buttons\" nennen, da der Support dort 0 reagiert. Die einzige Chance, dass der Support mal in Erscheinung tritt, ist die extra Seite des Supports und auch dort wird man damit abgespeist, dass man das beschriebene Spiel doch aufnehmen muss. Ansonsten wird dem wieder 0 nachgegangen. Demnach viele Cheater gibts in dem Spiel leider auch (Deadhard mehrfach hintereinander, endlose Taschenlampe, 1 Sekundenheilung, Teleportierung und vieles mehr)\n\nAch ja; wäre vielleicht mal gut, wenn man endlich das idiotische autozielen bei Killern entfernen würde bzw zumindest in Optionen einen Button zum ein und ausschalten reinnehmen würde. Das behindert den Killer sowas von unnötig!!!\n\nund als letzter Punkt: Wenn man ingame auf ein Profil geht und dort Videos oder links zu Twitch hinterlegt sind und während die laufen die Runde beginnt, dass man die schließen könnte.

So how to begin (also know i dont word good sorry)(but comment below and we can have a discussion and can clear things up maybe)\n\nBloated Gameplay\nPoint number the first, the game is bloated as a killer. What i mean by this is that you always seem like you are at the edge of losing it, where if you make one mistake its over, which in turns puts you into a toxic mindset. Like i just want to fool around on an online game, not feel like im defusing a bomb. Sure it gives immense satisfaction when you win too, so on its own it isnt a problem however there are other issues. that just make me feel like shit after every game\n\nWeighted perks\nSo like i get it, some perks exist because tunneling isnt fun, i get it. But with the same 6 perks in rotation constantly, not to mention perks that directly fuck over the killer when they do what is optimal (cause remember the mindset is adrenaline fueled sweat). So this ends up creating the following situations, either A: There is one survivor that is misplaying against me, and they have been for the entire game so its been a bit of a tunnel. But would you look at that i cant punish him for making a mistake because he has 4 get out of jail free cards....fun. or B: i have momentum, let me focus this survivor so i can use him to draw other survivors to me and the down, thus ill get them off the gens! but wait, i cant because they are immune and now theres one gen left and its 99'ed...fun\n\n\nAlways expect Survive with Friends\nFor those that dont know what that meas, it means 2-4 survivors that are all in a call together, and why is this a problem? for 2 reasons Toxicity, and Overwhelming Info. Ill get into Toxicity later, but for now, know that when they are in a call, if one of them has info on you, they all do. Meaning that they can get info they normally wouldnt be able to get in game without running certain perks. This does another 2 things, they free up room for abusive perks, and they get even more info that should be possible from within the perks. They know your every move pattern and tendency 1 min in. It also allows them to communicate gens and progress without using perks, making it snowball heavily in survivors favor. Abusive perks i kinda talked about above\n\n\nToxicity\nOH MY GOD, i cannot count the number of times survivors carried by their overwhelming perks  or overwhelming communication and they take every chance to taunt you with flashies teabagging or pointing. Its so frustrating, again i just want to play a fatass clown who throws bottles and people, i dont wanna feel like shit for the next hour of gameplay. Then you get into the aftergame chat and its more taunts and insults. Its nauseating, im at a point where i can only play at most 3 games a day before i tap out.\n\nMaps\nMaps are minimal but for ranged killers a lot of the maps f over their 1 power, killers like trickster, gunslinger, huntress, and the new pinhead killer (who is bugged to all hell) but they are starting to fix this i think? maybe, getting rid of stranger things lab is a good start.\n\nFinally Match Making\nThis only applies to new killers coming into the game trying to level up killers, this game tells you to screw off every time.
