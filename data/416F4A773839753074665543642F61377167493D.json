- I find the game to be fun and unique to other games that I have personally played, though I know there are similar games out there. It has mostly lost its horror factor to me by now, but every once in awhile I get jumpscared or spooked. It's a multiplayer game with minimal social interaction (no voice chat and a very limited text chat), which appeals to me greatly because I have severe social anxiety. I sometimes play with friends, but I usually play by myself.\n\nStory (No Spoilers Here) - The gameplay itself doesn't really involve any story, but there is lore behind all of the characters and realm that the game takes place in, and there are challenges you can complete to unlock more lore. The lore elements tend to be very hit or miss in my opinion. Recently, the majority of the lore has felt like a miss to me to the point that I'm more put off of the game.\n\nAccessibility - The game has color blindness settings and has been gradually changing some of the key-smashing gameplay elements to be more ergonomic. As someone with joint issues in my hands, I have found the changes to be a lot more helpful. A lot of the game relies on audio cues and sound and so it's not very accessible for people who are hard of hearing, but there are some visual cues to accompany some of the audio cues. A lot of the gameplay relies on fast reaction times, so people with motor disabilities or delayed reactions may be at a significant disadvantage. The game has some instances of flashing/strobing/flickering lights and no way to disable it. Lastly, there's no way to disable any of the game content, so if you have a severe phobia or particular trigger, there's no way to prevent those things from coming up.\n\nDifficulty - I would say the game is difficult when you're first starting, but it could be argued that it never really gets easy for the average player. There are a lot of gameplay elements and strategies you'll have to learn to get remotely good at the game. Even then, there is a random element to the game and a strange matchmaking system that often makes winning a match more of a matter of luck. If you go into the game expecting to win and be good at it right off the bat, the learning curve will likely frustrate you and you might not have a good time. \n\nAudience - This game is meant for teens and adults. There is some content that is not appropriate for children. I believe the main target audience of this game is horror fans and people who want a game to play with friends, though it's not necessary to play with friends and I did not when I started out. I fall into the horror fans category. Besides their original characters, the game has a lot of characters from popular media, which is what pulls in a lot of new players.\n\nGraphics - From what I've seen in trailers, pictures, and others' gameplay, the graphics are really nice, but I can't personally play the game on anything but low graphics at the lowest resolution the game will enable or else the lag makes the game unplayable, but I'm playing on a laptop that's not meant for gaming. For the most part, the game is effective at creating a horror atmosphere regardless of your graphic settings.\n\nAudio - I really enjoy the music in Dead by Daylight. Other than music, the game utilizes audio a lot in gameplay, helping you locate survivors, avoid the killer, find generators to repair, etc. This is a game I would never recommend playing without headphones for two reasons. The first reason is that it's helpful for both survivors and killers to be able to listen closely to your surroundings. The second reasons is that the survivors grunt and moan when they're injured and it can sound very suggestive without context.\n\nGrind - The grind in this game is too much and has put me off the game completely at times. They add new chapters every few months, which requires you to learn new perks (which are essentially special abilities that characters have), new strategies, etc. There is also a leveling system that is a complete mess, requiring you to spend game currency (primarily earned by playing matches) to level your characters in order to unlock perks and items. I have over 2000 hours in the game and I still have lots of leveling to do. It's literally endless. There are also over a hundred achievements to unlock with more being added with each chapter.\n\nBugs - The game is buggy. It's not nearly the buggiest game I've ever played, but it can be frustrating at times when bugs give your opponents an unfair advantage. Some bugs take an insanely long time to fix or never get fixed. Other bugs get fixed immediately. The priority of which bugs they fix can feel somewhat questionable at times. I have been lucky not to personally experience most of the game-breaking bugs that have popped up, but they exist. The game is buggiest right after a chapter release.\n\nGame Time - The end of this game is whenever you decide you don't want to play anymore. Otherwise, it's an endless game.\n\nPrice - It embarrasses me to say that I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game. In my opinion, the game is overpriced considering how many DLCs and in-game content you can pay for. I would highly recommend getting the game on sale if you choose to buy it, and only buying DLC or cosmetics if you're enjoying the basic content of the game. They also have sales on DLC and cosmetics and such from time to time. Every time they release a chapter, I tell myself that I'm going to wait for it to go on sale, and then I end up getting impatient and buying it within that week. Don't be like me.\n\nOther Notes - The developers don't give off the vibe that they really care about their players and most of their decisions seem motivated by money. A lot of times, they only seem to listen to players when there's massive backlash or they did something publicly that could make their company look bad, though even then they don't usually listen to players. They have a huge habit of making promises and then going back on those promises, or refusing to be transparent about their game. Their apologies are usually very half-assed like \"I'm sorry that we ignored the fact that our game event was completely broken for most players and that we did nothing to fix it, here's a tiny useless amount of in-game currency that can only be used to level characters.\" More offenses include still not having any in-game LGBTQ+ representation two years after promising to add it, working with an NFT company while claiming not to be working with an NFT company, publicly reacting poorly to people with genuine complaints about their game, adding game features that most players agreed was a bad idea, adding lore that made a fan-favorite character into a eugenicist (I'm not joking), etc. I feel like I can't back out of playing now that I've spent so much money on this game, but things keep getting worse and worse and it feels like the people in charge only care about the money they're making at this point. It's a crappy feeling.","timestamp_created":1603861037,"timestamp_updated":1648005047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78271039","author":{"steamid":"76561198308650830","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":57153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":11299,"last_played":1660149135},"language":"english","review":"its vere good game but if you do something apout the ping he will be better","timestamp_created":1603860796,"timestamp_updated":1603860796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78270443","author":{"steamid":"76561198108185789","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":10239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3663,"last_played":1648931796},"language":"spanish","review":"♥♥♥♥♥","timestamp_created":1603859410,"timestamp_updated":1603859410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78270331","author":{"steamid":"76561198327317686","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9163,"last_played":1646316888},"language":"koreana","review":"암걸려도 해보셈 니들이 못하는거임","timestamp_created":1603859182,"timestamp_updated":1603859182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78270095","author":{"steamid":"76561198333385510","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":251,"playtime_at_review":1711,"last_played":1660357764},"language":"spanish","review":"una locura baby\n","timestamp_created":1603858653,"timestamp_updated":1603858653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78269695","author":{"steamid":"76561198161464381","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19215,"last_played":1658071804},"language":"schinese","review":"人技能下次可以有用一點=.=\n\\","timestamp_created":1603857780,"timestamp_updated":1603857780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78269467","author":{"steamid":"76561198339704241","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3120,"last_played":1657262642},"language":"english","review":"Literally just one of my favourite games.

Also if you like only getting 1/3 of the game after already paying for it and needing to pay another 20+ dollars just to get everything else(also they add 4 DLC's that cost money every year) and a game so buggy that you will  notice bugs within the first 30 minutes of playing then you can be my guest.

absolutely love this game. It is really fun to play. However, the community is really toxic. Killers are campy and don't really let you play the game. Survivors are toxic as well with some of the builds they make, but I haven't played killer much so I don't know specific examples of such instances. There is a report system but it doesn't feel like the developers are on top of taking care of toxic players. I have been in many instances where I have not even gotten to play the game because the killers were tunneling and camping each survivor until they 'won' the game. I feel like this problem has gotten somewhat better, but the developers have a lot to work on to discourage camping and tunneling killers. There should be more of a penalty for camping hooks than just loosing a few hundred points. A killer should not get nearly 20K bloodpoints for not letting survivors play the game. I still recommend this game because it is a lot of fun with friends and sometimes the campy killer is a rare occurrence, but it still needs to be fixed.","timestamp_created":1603819098,"timestamp_updated":1603819098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78244680","author":{"steamid":"76561198987243838","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":50366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40109,"last_played":1656790577},"language":"russian","review":"[table] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPVs1heWJGY\n[tr]\n[td][h1]        💀Trust Nobody - Hippie Sabotage💀[/h1]\n[h1]───────⚪───────────────────[/h1]\n⠀         ▐▐ ⠀►▏ ⠀⠀──○─ 🔊 ⠀1:23 / 3:45⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀       ᴴᴰ⚙ ❐ ⊏⊐[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n[/table]","timestamp_created":1603819021,"timestamp_updated":1650570826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78244620","author":{"steamid":"76561198060451501","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1603828753},"language":"german","review":"Gutes spiel","timestamp_created":1603818929,"timestamp_updated":1603818929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.209329560399055481","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78244592","author":{"steamid":"76561198083252564","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":40169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23525,"last_played":1657488330},"language":"russian","review":"10багов/10","timestamp_created":1603818877,"timestamp_updated":1603818877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78243847","author":{"steamid":"76561198966442564","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":37739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12939,"last_played":1651256133},"language":"russian","review":"ОТДАЙТЕ ДЕНЬГИ НАХУЙЙЙЙЙЙЙЙЙ","timestamp_created":1603817894,"timestamp_updated":1612191740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78243585","author":{"steamid":"76561198285834054","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1639783399},"language":"polish","review":"Po dotychczas 11 godzinach rozegranych DBD wydaje sie naprawde spoko.
