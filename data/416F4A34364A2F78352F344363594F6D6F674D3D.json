Also, map design is very iffy. A single map can absolutely destroy a single killer especially the ones that don't have mobility. \n\nIN 2022, A SEMI COMPETITIVE GAME STILL HAS NO PRACTICE MODES!!! After 5 YEARS, there is still not a single mode for you to practice. No bot matches and you cannot even load up a map to test things alone. You do the tutorials and they expect you to jump right into an online match. This is inexcusable especially for a game with a ton of perks and mechanics built in. \n\nMy main issue with this game when it comes to balance is the survivor perks. They're so unfair and makes playing a survivor as oppressive, if not more, than being the actual killer is. All of the god perks can be stacked without much trade off meaning you can equip up to 4 of them. Barrowed Time, Dead hard, Lithe, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, etc etc. My issue with most of these perks is they're basically \"get out of jail free\" cards. Survivors can play in the stupidest way possible without much risk because some of these perks are simple button presses, or happen after the killer does something like hooking or striking someone. AKA passive abilities. The thing is you as the killer are required to hook a survivor 3 times in order to secure a kill, this goes up with these perks because those perks either avoid a hook or stall a ton of time.\n\nSeparating Boons for it's own section. I could go on for hours about how broken this survivor perk is. Blessing a totem gives an area to which you can heal in WITHOUT any medkits or the Self Care perk. On paper, this doesn't seem to problematic. The issues arise with how you deal with them as a killer. You stomp these totems to deactivate them, seems easy enough and only takes a couple of seconds. The problem is, a survivor can be hiding near the totem, and begin cleansing the totem seconds after you have stomped it out. These are NOT consistent with how killer hexes work. Once you bless a killer's hex, the perk associated with it is gone for the REST OF THE GAME. This is why boons are busted, there is no cooldown on them/penalty for a killer stomping them, and they cannot be removed from the field of play because the killer's stomp does not remove the totem unlike how survivors can remove killer hexes with one blessing. THIS NEEDS TO BE PATCHED.\n\nAs a newer player, you're not avoiding these perks either. I saw them probably my 3rd game since I started and it has continued. No way around it, these \"RARE\" perks are everywhere and as someone who doesn't have a lot of things in their inventory, it can be tough to play against. My point is that as a killer, you need to play very well and a lot of things require skill shots (actually needing to aim) or heavy setup such as stalking (watching survivors) or setting traps. All while survivor perks don't require this at all, the most a survivor has to do is simply hit a button for a couple of them. This isn't great balance imo. There should be a restriction/trade off for these instead of allowing a single survivor to equip all of them. Like for example, you should NOT be able to run boons while having a medkit AND self care. There is no variety in what survivors use. You'll have one that heals, and the other 3 usually all stack these annoying and toxic perks. The healer will also have a couple of these as well. Rinse and repeat every game, the meta is so unhealthy because of this.\n\nIt forces killers to tunnel and camp to simply secure kills at times because survivors are all running around on crack. Survivors hate this, but what are you gonna do? It's either that, or you use meta killers with broken perks and add-ons right back at them. This is not healthy balance. It forces you to deal with broken, with using broken and that's not something I'm particularly a fan of. There could be a lot better ways in dealing with some of these things. This is made worse in being a new player as you're constantly fighting an uphill battle because you start with the bare minimum and need to grind a character out to unlock their teachable perks, which then can be unlocked for use on other characters.\n\nSurvivor on a hook? Oh, there's the perk that allows them to soak a hit just because they were saved. Swing at the person who saved them? Oh, you missed them because the savior had sprint burst. Won a loop battle? Oh, you swung and missed because they hit a button to dash away. Have mutliple survivors injured? Oh well, they all W keyed to their totem and now all of them are fully healed. Again, keep in mind a single player can have all of these equipped as a survivor. It leads to an overall lack of variety and just a toxic experience at times especially being a new player, you feel helpless all the while being taunted the whole game by the other players.\n\nMap design is an issue, not all of them, but the big maps are a pain for some slower killers or ones that have a slower playstyle like Michael, Ghostface, Trapper, etc. The end game is another thing, there's two gates and when they end up on opposite sides of the map, GG. That last survivor is escaping and there is nothing you can do about it on the bigger maps, depending on what killer you're using. Hatch awareness is another thing, people have played so much they know exactly where the hatch will spawn, creating yet another GG scenario. The map design in this game makes gen rushing so easy. Survivor spawn logic, well, it's completely one sided. Most times you spawn right on top of a generator with multiple teammates. Some times two teammates spawn on one, and the other two on another. This is without using any spawn offerings. The killer quite literally has the deck stacked against them before the game even starts. This is why meta perks for killer are ALL GEN STALLERS. Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Tinkerer, etc etc. You must run these perks at higher ranks, otherwise it will be a rough time. This is the main reason most people run only the strongest killers because they all have great mobility to deal with gen rushing. Slower characters are screwed here.\n\nAs for the community, it's common knowledge how toxic this community is and the devs aren't helping this cause by what they've been doing lately. Pretty much a guarantee at the end of the game the survivors will stand at the gate entrance and teabag you even if there is one survivor remaining. Advice: if you know the survivors are sitting in the gate, DO NOT FOLLOW THEM. Go break pallets or walls. Get the points and do not give them the satisfaction.\n\nGame is fun, but expect a lot of failure early on as this game heavily penalizes you for being new. I generally like this game but its issues are glaringly obvious and it's crazy to me reading that these things have been problems for years. For example, there are forum discussions that were had up to 4 years ago asking for practice modes. The devs need to really start listening to the community.\n\nRecently, they've implemented an MMR system, which is great on paper. This lacks very badly in execution. I was a bronze last season and was consistently getting paired with red ranked players/players with thousands of hours. MMR does not protect new players and seemingly has a very wide range to it. I consistently have been playing people 3 entire ranks above me, which is not normal in a vs. game like this. Imo, that is way too wide of a gap, this should be shrunk down quite a bit. As a bronze player, the second lowest rank in the game, I should not be seeing 4 stacks that are 3 ranks above me. And I've seen this on more than one occasion. This makes sense at the highest levels, to reach a bit below, but at bronze and ash ranks, this shouldn't happen\n\nWill leave this as a \"yes\", but the devs really need to pick up the slack. There is still work to be done here. Gameplay is there, the finer things need to be tuned to make the experience a bit less frustrating.","timestamp_created":1644193034,"timestamp_updated":1646981315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109684160","author":{"steamid":"76561198393860323","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":61172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":260,"playtime_at_review":50167,"last_played":1660521472},"language":"spanish","review":"Divertido

Могу сказать, что, на момент покупки игры, баланс был ещё +/- адекватным. \n\nВ общем, пока не решится проблема с балансом игры между выжившими и маньяком (например, забрать у маньяка навыки, отслеживающие ауры выживших, уменьшение количества крюков на карте или уменьшить время, чтобы вырваться из рук маньяка и т.д.), то [b]играть даже не стоит[/b] (за исключением, когда есть стабильное пати из 5 человек и можно играть между собой ради фана, в таком случае, есть в этом смысл, но со временем это надоест).","timestamp_created":1644183574,"timestamp_updated":1644184537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109676580","author":{"steamid":"76561198939245424","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":33096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30884,"last_played":1658350539},"language":"english","review":"Would
