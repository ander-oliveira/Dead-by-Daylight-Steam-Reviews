It's tense, but not too scary for the average player. There are a few bugs in the game, but the devs fix bugs and glitches on a weekly basis. Survivor versus Killer is generally speaking well balanced. Overall, the game requires skill, but for each survivor/killer it's mostly Easy To Learn, Hard To Master. When you win trophies in this game, it really feels like you earned them. 10/10, I play it on a daily basis.","timestamp_created":1572484145,"timestamp_updated":1572484145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55928857","author":{"steamid":"76561198981538350","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":72,"playtime_at_review":2320,"last_played":1660277535},"language":"english","review":"Very good game","timestamp_created":1572484120,"timestamp_updated":1572484120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55928821","author":{"steamid":"76561198082237657","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2716,"last_played":1645394330},"language":"english","review":"very fun with friends, steady learning curve yet requires some skills.\nunfortunately, killer wait times when you're a low killer level are much longer since the update.\nall n all great game doe","timestamp_created":1572484092,"timestamp_updated":1572643434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55928808","author":{"steamid":"76561198256632640","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":96405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78404,"last_played":1656525603},"language":"english","review":"this shit smacks","timestamp_created":1572484084,"timestamp_updated":1572484084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55928770","author":{"steamid":"76561198331173426","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":355,"last_played":1654472939},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fun, The first few hours of the game are very tough but after about 2-3 hours you get better and the game gets way more fun.

dei miei giochi preferiti, pian piano reso totalmente ingiocabile da programmatori INCOMPETENTi\n\nCi troviamo davanti ad uno dei concept di gioco meglio riusciti degli ultimi tempi, purtroppo martoriato da \"DEVS\" che non sanno nemmeno lontanamente cosa sia il bilanciamento.\n\nEntrambi i lati hanno terribili falle che non si riescono ad arginare perchè il potenzimento di una significherebbe la perdita di utenza dall'altra, ecco alcuni esempi.\n\nKiller: \n\nGiocare killer è divertente, non lo nascondo, ma ormai è diventata una lotta al non incazzarsi ogni partita, dove se perdi ti incazzi e se vinci ti incazzi.\n@I generatori che saranno impossibili da pattugliare poichè tempo due secondi che finite il chase con il primo malcapitato che troverete ne salteranno due o tre, pigliandovi a pesci in faccia.\n@Survivor pressochè infallibili che dio sa solo come non sbaglieranno un mindgame o un pallet, imprendibili anche grazie ai 75 perk che gli permettono sempre di avere una seconda possibilità in caso di errore.\n@Gruppi di 4 survivor perfettamente organizzati e con comunicazione infinita (discord, teamspeak) che vi faranno un culo a capanna perchè ogni qualvolta vi avvicinerete ad un generatore basterà che lo dicano agli amichetti e loro  magicamente scompariranno.\n@Tossicità estrema,come quella in game dove non appena un sopravvissuto vi colpirà con un pallet susseguirà con un miliardo di tbag senza motivazione, seguito da un fiume di insulti post chat (che è fatta solo per quello) o addirittura sul profilo (guardare per credere).\n@Cheater senza controllo che se va bene avranno solo il cheat per curarsi all'istante (oggi estremamente frequente), se va male avranno le torce che vi accecano per 20 secondi e se quitterete riceverete un ban di 80 giorni per la disconnessione.\n\nIl peggio di tutto questo saranno sicuramente i survivor che negheranno fino alla morte ognuna di queste cose, negheranno anche solo di giocare con gli amici, solo per cercare di renderti la sconfitta in qualche modo \"più amara\"(?) non so nemmeno io perchè lo facciano.\n\n Survivor:\n\n Anche la parte survivor è divertente, purtroppo però anche qui è pieno di ingiustizie e roba fatta male\n@Se giochi in solo i teammates faranno sempre cagare, ho visto gente con 5000 e passa ore cadere dopo 5 secondi di inseguimento, ho visto rank 16 giocare insieme a me (rank 4) matchati assieme ad un killer rank 1, tutto grazie ad un matchmaking fatto con il culo\n@Tossicità imbarazzante dei killer che si sentiranno sempre in dovere di colpirti mentre sei appeso al gancio, tunnelare senza motivazione e insultare in post game chat qualsivoglia cosa tu scriva (pure fossero complimenti)\n@Il dead hard che non funziona dio cane\n@L'estrema facilità di giocare con altri 2/3 amici, renderà la vita del killer un inferno e ogni vostra partita vinta, siccome basterà rushare i gen e la partita sarà bella che finita in pochi minuti dato che per il killer risulterà impossibile pattugliare tutti i generatori (come detto prima).\n\nFinite le 35 righe di lamentele, ecco un estratto, il gioco di per se è davvero divertente, ciò che lo rende ingestibile per la psiche di chi lo gioca sono la community estremamente tossica, i continui bug che si susseguiranno ad ogni aggiornamento con un dlc da pagare per avere i perk forti e i vari programmatori che se ne fottono e lasciano il gioco a marcire in uno stato pietoso, mal bilanciato e senza nessuna ripercussione, nemmeno per il cheating palese, rendendo inutile ogni sforzo di ogni persona a cui piaccia giocare a questa melma di videogame.","timestamp_created":1572480929,"timestamp_updated":1611338434,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55924304","author":{"steamid":"76561198208509957","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":14356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12284,"last_played":1603911242},"language":"english","review":"its
