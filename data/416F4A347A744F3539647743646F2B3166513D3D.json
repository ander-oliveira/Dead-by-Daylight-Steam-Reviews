oh man dead by daylight...\n\ni didnt think id have as much fun with this as i currently am\n\nThe suspense of just repairing a generator only to be murdered by mike myers or leatherface (latest dlc)\n\nif your not getting camped by the killer on a hook or having the nurse teleport on top of you, the game itself is quite solid, its all p2p, hosting off the killer but its better than the for honor fiasco and for the most part you wont ever experience warping or rubber banding etc\n\nEach of the killers is unique and has great lore behind them, they all have their on abilties and perks but all have the same goal, to murder you to please the entity\n\nThe killers victims, i believe there are 10+ now, each all having their own backstory and some even linked to a killer (laurie and mike myers)\n\nAs you play you earn the games currency called blood points which you use to develop killers/survivors skills, learning new perks giving your characters new abilities and earning offerings which can enhance ablilties and alter your next match played\n\nLeveling your character can stop at Level 50, where you can \"prestige\" and reset that character in exchange for having extremely blood covered clothes which do look nice, or you can continue to level just earning more and more addons and offerings\n\nEach match is never really the same, there are around 5-8 areas some areas having 2-4 maps within it, so there is good variety, you dont often play the same map twice, unless people burn a offering altering the chances ;)\n\nyou can choose to play with up to 3 friends, or play on your own as a survivor, or choose to go the other way and butcher the victims who walk into your web~\n\nits fun alone or friends surviving or a custom game, would recommend especially on sale, the dlc for the most part, is just paying to have access to a killer and a survivor, plus the perks that are teachable from them, they are great at full price, but on sale are a steal","timestamp_created":1498634048,"timestamp_updated":1506508711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32916236","author":{"steamid":"76561198232840056","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":60317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55941,"last_played":1655883397},"language":"english","review":"good

If you're the killer, there's no problem for you, but if you're queue'ing as a survivor, be aware of endless bugs, glitches etc. I honestly wouldn't mind to wait a while if I knew the average amount of time I would be waiting for the game, but on most occasions you don't even know if you're being matchmade or bugged.\n-Those killers that look you right in the eye whilst you're hanging on the hook the entire time, not giving a chance for your teammate to try a save. Especially annoying if you accidentally get caught very early in the game.\n-If you're spotted and are not very good at juking, your fate is sealed, because the game does not provide you with any means of being able to fight back (the flashlight is a joke at the moment, even though they constantly keep trying to fix it).\n\nIn any case, I'm not really into games of this genre, but I find Dead By Daylight to be enjoyable for some reason. There are a lot of things to work on, but I think I'd still give it a solid 8/10, because it has a lot of room for replayability, provides new content and is overall

Цель в игре одна - починить 5 генераторов и открыть ворота, но все не так просто. При неудачной попытке ремонта к вам придет маньяк, который так и будет пытаться зарезать вас и повесить на крюк. Если уж это случилось - остается надеяться только на добродушие напарников. Еще интересно играть с друзьями в лобби, все слышат эмоции друг друга и это с одной стороны весело :D\nВ итоге игра мне очень-очень понравилась, и скорее всего я долго буду там поигрывать.

Т_Т\nP.S.не ною, а просто обидно, что раньше я справлялся с другим противоположным багом, а с этим я никак не могу управится.","timestamp_created":1498593381,"timestamp_updated":1575038045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501458585262298584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32881924","author":{"steamid":"76561198104784498","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":126916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":110,"playtime_at_review":74607,"last_played":1660322971},"language":"english","review":"Shut up and then repair the generators. 9.9/10 (-0.1 for a bug game)","timestamp_created":1498592738,"timestamp_updated":1606414452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32881540","author":{"steamid":"76561198148225041","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3417,"last_played":1560374775},"language":"german","review":"Nice","timestamp_created":1498592497,"timestamp_updated":1498592497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32881515","author":{"steamid":"76561198072935162","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":79242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":34772,"last_played":1660225445},"language":"english","review":"it's ok","timestamp_created":1498592484,"timestamp_updated":1637963930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32881352","author":{"steamid":"76561198169319329","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":22158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3585,"last_played":1642020053},"language":"spanish","review":"La comunidad más tóxica después del LoL","timestamp_created":1498592365,"timestamp_updated":1638098375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32880786","author":{"steamid":"76561198024253349","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5132,"last_played":1656247498},"language":"english","review":"NIce gaming but having bugs and some hackers pls fix it","timestamp_created":1498591985,"timestamp_updated":1498591985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32880591","author":{"steamid":"76561198102773722","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":206,"playtime_at_review":7665,"last_played":1660453318},"language":"english","review":"This game, being out for a year now has relatively poor optimization between players due to the current lack of dedicated servers. The objectives are straightforward and perhaps too much so creating a lack of interest. The gamwplay is enjoyable but repetative and becomes very peving when some perks and attributes are used so that the game feels unbalanced. More work needs ti be done and the game needs to be refined for it not to feel broken and cluncky. That being said i would reccomend it due to the satisfactory moments had as both killer and survivor.","timestamp_created":1498591862,"timestamp_updated":1498591862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32879982","author":{"steamid":"76561198139432284","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":47080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13173,"last_played":1658496645},"language":"russian","review":"Очень страшно, но пизда как интересно da","timestamp_created":1498591492,"timestamp_updated":1637847688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32879971","author":{"steamid":"76561198025717228","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":26501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1772,"last_played":1646924941},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlarla oynanılabilecek en iyi korku oyunlarından bir tanesi gerçi tek başına oynayıncada size o adrenalini ve zevki veriyor her türlü söylencek fazla bişey yok alın ve oynayın :D","timestamp_created":1498591486,"timestamp_updated":1498591486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571428596973419189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32879861","author":{"steamid":"76561198155594286","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2750,"last_played":1519596638},"language":"english","review":"11 Rounds playes, 11 times died as first player.\nEven with Level 48 you got no chance at anything.\n\nUninstalled.
