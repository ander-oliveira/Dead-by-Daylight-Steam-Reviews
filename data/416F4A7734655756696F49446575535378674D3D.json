There are good matches. There are bad matches. The bad matches perhaps make you feel like logging out, uninstalling and never heading into the Fog again. However, the good matches... they really hit different. When another survivor flashlight saves you from the killer, you may be in a good match. When another survivor heals you after unhooking you, you may be in a good match. It's the type of camaraderie that gets you a new Steam friend after the game. Those moments really make it all worth it. Is Dead by Daylight the greatest game of all time? No. Is it my favorite game of all time? Also no. Do I love suffering so much that I continue to play this game day in and day out despite it's many issues? 1000 hours later and here we are. Event times are the best of times and the worst of times. I wouldn't have it any other way.

Showing off how cool it is to outsmart people as a killer. I purchased the game and gave it a try. It seemed fun at first but the longer I played the more problems started to show.\n\nDead by daylight is a mixed bag of a game. On one hand it’s got a fantastic game loop and great sound and character design. On the other hand, the core content gets buried under massive grinding and pay to play barriers, toxic mechanics, and bad matchmaking.\n\nFirst thing bad to mention is the nonfunctioning matchmaking. When I had first bought and played the game within my first few games I was already getting matched up against players at top rank. It made it almost impossible to learn and very miserable to play. Now being somewhere middle in the ranks (rank 9) I get matched up with bottom tier players and top tier. Almost never with people around my rank. So much about this game would be forgivable if it was fun but matchmaking that does not work at all ensures it’s not. There is not causal mode only ranked.\n\nI’ve played a lot of both roles in the game and somehow both are miserable to play. As a killer you are always at a disadvantage. Survivors get a considerable number of perks and built in tools to stop you from achieving anything. Borderline infinite chase loops, bad objective spacing, overpowered perks, and keys are just some examples. While these may be necessary for balancing it’s just not fun. Imagine spending an entire game controlling and outplaying 4 survivors when one of them just pulls out a key and several of them just get away with almost no counterplay. Ranking is also a nightmare for killers, its easy to derank for performing average and hard to rank up without being perfect. The ranking systems also encourages killers to just make the game longer for up to 9 minutes. If survivors are playing together and have an outside voice chat it becomes almost impossible to win. There are additional perks that give less information than what can be gained from voice chat.\n\nSurvivor is another story. Its already not fun having to wait 10-20 minuets to queue up for a game compared to the instant killer queue time, but it gets worse. Killers often target 1-2 people in a game just to ensure they won’t derank. Killers depend on running the same perks to just keep up, making the games feel very similar. Bad matchmaking means new players can get into and just destroy the game. Its better than playing killer in my opinion but it’s not the same fun.\n\nThe biggest problem is the grind. Perks are transferable from one character to another for both survivors and killers. This means going through the process of purchasing the character, getting their level high enough, going back to relevel up the character you want the perk on. It takes about 8 hours to max level up character, even longer for survivor as you get less currency for playing them. You could also get lucky and wait for the special shop to have what perks you need. However, its fully random, only rotates once a week, still takes a considerable amount of time to grind for another in game currency and only has two perks at a time. Is about a 1/21 chance each week for a specific killer perk and a 1/30 chance for a specific survivor perk. I’m also not sure but I believe duplicates are possible within the store.\n\nBut the bigger problem here is having to purchase these characters with extra money. Some in game characters can be purchased without by grinding the same system needed for the perk store, but it’s a considerable amount of time to get this estimated around a month of gameplay for most people, and it’s not available for every character. 3rd party characters cannot be obtained for free and must be paid for with actually money on top of the price payed for the game. This all means that for a relevant set of perks on a character it can take around 16 - 40 hours and cost $5-$20. It only gets worse the more characters you have as it takes more levels to find the perks you want as they are randomly given to the player each character level and take 3 levels to fully get. I’m a patient gamer but I’m not that patient.\n\nWhile it could be argued you don’t need optimal perks, the poor matchmaking makes it feel as if you have to be optimized at any rank or risk losing to a team that will be running optimal perks. You can’t play casual if you are playing killer because of the asymmetrical nature of the game. And as a survivor certain perks are needed to prevent getting camped.\n\nSome other minor problems with the game are that the community and player base is very toxic as well as the game being glitchy. Players will regularly message you outside of the game to spew profanity and insults. Players will BM regularly in game. But this isn’t a major issue as you can just mute and ignore everyone.\n\nI’ve put about 60 hours into it and I could not recommend this game to others. Even as a fan of horror franchises and even the gameplay to an extent, there is just too much wrong with this game. Time to wait a year and see if it gets better.\n\n2.5/5","timestamp_created":1658213367,"timestamp_updated":1658213367,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502430498600006104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119059000","author":{"steamid":"76561199109073097","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":68282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":646,"playtime_at_review":66524,"last_played":1660591310},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo

reverenda mierda este juego, los killers estan rotisimos, en vez de que el juego mejore como otros lo empeoran, puras ropas de mierdas agregan para ganar dinero, los rework de los mapas son un asco, los primeros estaban buenisimos, los killers te meten golpes a 2 metros de distancio despues de que hayas saltado un palet y tienen perks que hacen que el juego sea un asco dandoles muchisima ventaja como dejando a 0 los motores o bloqueandolos todos el tiempo, juego hace 2 años el juego y puedo decir que antes era mucho mas divertido y mejor","timestamp_created":1658212194,"timestamp_updated":1658212194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518201291561126709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119058579","author":{"steamid":"76561199094447965","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1659308852},"language":"english","review":"FUN
