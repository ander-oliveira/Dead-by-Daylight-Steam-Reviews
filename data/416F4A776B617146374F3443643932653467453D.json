Once you learned the game though, it can be lots of fun and more than well worth your time. I have enjoyed this game for (at the time of review) 438 hours on PC and 427 hours on Xbox. I heavily recommend playing it with a friend that has some expirence with the game already when trying to first get into it, they can show you a thing or two and the game is also much more enjoyable with others. Also try playing survivor first, then swap to some killer once you feel comfortable with the basics of the game.\nI hope you enjoy this game as much as I do, gl and hf!\n\nP.S: DON'T ATTEMPT ESCAPE ON HOOK!

And although i love (starting to have loved, rather than love it still) the game, in it's current state it's something i wouldn't recommend. At least three out of every 5 games i will have a game breaking bug, of which the devs are more focused on buffing killers instead of fixing the current game. Nearly every game is a frustrating experience, with animations not matching the actions (such as window vaults freezing for .3 of a second where the devs made it slower, instead of just changing the animation speed too), and killers getting buffed like theres no tomorrow (not specific killer buffs, just overall things like say nerfing survivor perks slightly while increasing a killers movement speed slightly). I'm not salty about a good killer, i'm salty about the game constantly crashing due to 'Rank could not be updated' or some dumb shit like that. \n\nLook the game is still a decent game, but it's quality IMO has gone down in the past few months\n\nhey a few hours after playing i came up with something else: can't go 4 games without some error kicking me out of a lobby/ loading/ the game in

La jugabilidad es igual de divertida, sin importar si estamos jugando al asesino o tratando de escapar de él.(Con amigos la diversión se quintuplica)\n\nA veces puede ser ''LAG'', principalmente debido a que no son servidores dedicados. Sin embargo, eso no me impide divertirme jugando a este juego. Aunque es el mismo objetivo en cada juego tanto para el sobreviviente como para el asesino, hay una gran cantidad de ''habilidades''(perks) que te dan infinitas opciones para jugar de manera diferente en cada partida.
