One player controls a horrible-looking killer and on the other team, 4 players control survivors. The goal is pretty obvious: Killer has to kill, Survivors have to escape.\n\nIn order to escape, the survivors have to start 5 generators to power up the exit. While doing so, they have to try to avoid the killer.\n\nThis isn't always easy, as the killer has some special abilities like invisibility, traps and teleports. Anyways,you get the gist of it.\n\nThe game is really fun, addicting and surprisingly well polished for an early access title. New content is periodically being added for free. You can level up survivors and killers, rank up to show you're the best and all that. Basically your typical competitive gameplay stuff.\n\nThe game is definitely worth the prize.

The game is hard for beginners, no doubt. In Fact, most people propably downvoted the game because it't \"unfair\", but all you need is practise. Playing the Killer is the easier alternative, as you can screw up without just dying instantly. I personally always ranked up as a killer without killing even 1 survivor 90% of the time. Also playing killer means more people will get into lobbies, because the main problem with the matchmaking/lobby joining system in this game is, in my experience, a lack of killers.\n\nTL;DR\nGood Game, Patience and Practise Necessary, Ongoing, Play Killer, Have Fun","timestamp_created":1474300388,"timestamp_updated":1514291536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522031605243682861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25589103","author":{"steamid":"76561198305191169","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2767,"last_played":1634567785},"language":"thai","review":"Goog","timestamp_created":1474299264,"timestamp_updated":1474299264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25589097","author":{"steamid":"76561198010972302","num_games_owned":1039,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9731,"last_played":1585331096},"language":"english","review":"The game is completely ruined with that new maniac that can see you literally everywhere.
