bought this on sale and still have remorse. \n\n-Too boring for 20$ there is likely another game out there that you'd enjoy more that costs less. Any number of things for $20 that you would enjoy more, even if a fan of the films \n\n-Too much DLC and some is poorly rated\n\n-Small community and no real teamwork or meta. \n\nyou are essentially alone together. left to assume what everyone else is doing. People may or may not help you to some degree. That will likely run away from you if you screw up at all. Regardless, there isn't a feeling of \"closeness\" or reward between the survivors outside of rescuing someone or being rescued. You sneak around looking for an opportunity to repair a generator. An overly simple and frustrating task. A simple \"skill check\" where you must tap your spacebar within a brief window of time. if you succeed you speed up the repair of the generator to help restore power, open a gate and escape. if you fail, a loud noise reveals your position and halts the repair process with there being 5-10 skill checks for generator and several generators to open a gate. an interesting and simple mechanic, but unfortunately the only thing there is to being a survivor and winning outside of stealth. there are a few characters you can play with slightly different attributes, and a few different ways of augmenting or equipping them at the start of the round. but there is little to no difference between them all. \n\nFor most people who enjoy spooky stuff, it might be fun to play casually for a couple weeks out of the year near Halloween, or periodically year round for big fans of the films, but, ultimately the game lacks complexity and options to be competitive. The mode is too simple and the maps are too flat and boring. And whatever unlockables there are that offer some amount of depth or different play styles must be meticulously obtained from excessive grinding. And if you want to play as the iconic killers you'll have to fork over more money. \n\nI don't like giving a negative review. I think its a great concept and has appeal but unfortunately it falls short. And it only becomes obvious after a few hours of play. I did have a few good rounds, even where i died just at the gate, but not before helping ensure two of my team mates survived in my sacrifice.

It will worth your money.","timestamp_created":1525482854,"timestamp_updated":1525482854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41857174","author":{"steamid":"76561198351192825","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":2707,"last_played":1659925776},"language":"schinese","review":"辣鸡游戏，赶紧凉凉","timestamp_created":1525481886,"timestamp_updated":1564698827,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41856181","author":{"steamid":"76561198389441130","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2386,"last_played":1566662947},"language":"schinese","review":"亚麻跌","timestamp_created":1525476317,"timestamp_updated":1525476317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41855454","author":{"steamid":"76561198279895908","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":44821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19518,"last_played":1647984683},"language":"russian","review":"pretty good job so far („ಡωಡ„)","timestamp_created":1525472779,"timestamp_updated":1547664298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510471165180206299","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41855098","author":{"steamid":"76561198192725838","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2200,"last_played":1525420539},"language":"schinese","review":"我刷血点？？？怎么了？？？睿智游戏都没人玩了还封号？？？还不把大爷供起来","timestamp_created":1525471056,"timestamp_updated":1525471056,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.243071600794792175","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41854790","author":{"steamid":"76561198814584739","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1632682495},"language":"russian","review":"Интересная хоррор-игра, затягивает, можешь играть за самого убицу или же быть обычным выжившим, и бегать от сверепого маньяка-убицы, который в тот час ждет тебя за углом, и жаждит поймать твою плоть, и повесить её на крюк))","timestamp_created":1525469605,"timestamp_updated":1525469605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481371611356735229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41854477","author":{"steamid":"76561198224485060","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7600,"last_played":1628114849},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good job so far.\nall i have to say.\n","timestamp_created":1525468217,"timestamp_updated":1525468217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41854336","author":{"steamid":"76561198163855717","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":123667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37462,"last_played":1646347328},"language":"english","review":"I've just finished the game and I only recommend it to those who seek to have a brain aneurism. The game is riddled with bugs and more inconsistent that politics in the middle east. Each patch and update introduces more bugs that they fix. The devs let the players playtest and then shit on many of the results. \nThere are these things called “totems”. A killer can equip abilities that rely on a specific totem to not be found by survivors. These totems can either spawn under a mountain of boxes, huddled into a corner or just in the plain open, slap dap in the middle of the field. The killer does not get to choose the totem! \nThe general movement is weird as well. Want to run up these stairs? Did you know that your left pinkie finger strayed the hand rail? Enjoy stopping mid sprint like you ran into a wall. : - ) \nMap design is also rather … unique. Each time a new map is released it orientates towards the killer that is released with it. Sounds swell. Except that all other killers are disregarded in these considerations. So when playing killer just know that there is a 50% chance that the map you get sucks and you’ll lose just because you were too bad of a gamer to have rng give you a good map.\nThe last thing is balancing. Over at bhvr time is scarce because they’re working on new monetisable content shove up their spaghetti code so game balance has to be broad and for everyone. So they balance around the average player, meaning that both low and high level balance is ignored for the medium level.\nSo in conclusion: If you’re up for a cocaine induced round of russian roulette via bad programming, balance and game design, get this. Otherwise just watch it on You Tube.

Typically each season I have been high tier survivor and mid to high killer.  I can't recomend this game to anyone.  There's obviously a love hate to the game but this final straw is this emblem system.  The community is unbearably toxic, the devs consistantly take the game in the wrong direction, people ruin your game, be it selfish/clueless teammates or cheap killers.  Watching the dev stream shows how out of touch they are, as there are serious issues with mechanics and balance and they ignore them constantly.  Insidous killers hiding in the basement, face camping and OP killers ruin it for survivors.  Trolling survivors who run 1 perk because they think they're great and consistant pallet looping and purple flashlights ruin it for average killers.  Honestly this game was much better shortly after launch than it is now.  High tier players are intentionally de ranking just to find games because it's impossible for casual players to rank up now.  These devs are clueless and the community just adds insult to injury.  The frustration just isn't worth the time.  Que the \"Thinks this is funny\" nerds\n\nEDIT: They've updated the emblem system, much more balanced and easier to rank up.\n\nEDIT 2: it's 2k19 and this game somehow got worse.  The new killer is actually broken. The perk reworking has made the game less enjoyable for both survivor and killer. The community is just as brain dead as ever.

Когда разработчиков попросили прокоментировать это все что они смогли сказать: \"Это слишком сложно!\".  Так же разработчики не способны сделать иггру балансной. Они постоянно кидаются из крайности в крайность, что плдохо отображается на гейм плее. И самое печальное в этой игре, то что разрабы слушают слабых играков и делают все чтоб всякие ракообразные могли хоть как-то играть.\nВ Заключении хочу сказать не стоит покупать данную игру, лучше купите подписку на твиче на какую-нибудь няшку.","timestamp_created":1525356683,"timestamp_updated":1525356683,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.442433178424835205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41828884","author":{"steamid":"76561198325173720","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":249,"playtime_at_review":11039,"last_played":1660564180},"language":"schinese","review":"砍就完事了，砍不到人偷电就完事了！","timestamp_created":1525354361,"timestamp_updated":1525354361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41828548","author":{"steamid":"76561198351962894","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":35796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8653,"last_played":1656496216},"language":"thai","review":"เกมนี้ดีมากครับ แต่ติดตรงที่บางทีเข้าเกมเล่นเป็นผู้รอดชีวิตรอดอยู่ๆก็ไม่เข้าล็อบบี้ ค้างที่เดิม แต่ระบบเกมเพลย์ดีมาก ดีทุกอย่าง บางทีเล่นเกมบัคมีน้อยครับ แต่พอเป็นทีเล่นยากหรือเล่นไม่ได้เลยครับ แต่ที่พูดมาไม่ต้องกลัวครับ มีโอกาสน้อยมากที่จะโดน แต่เท่าที่เล่นมากไม่เจอแฮกเลย สุดยอด!!! แต่ระบบแรงค์ของผู้รอดชีวิตนั้น ขึ้นยากมากครับแทบจะไม่ขึ้นเลยเต็ม10 ให้ 7/10 แต่เป็นเกมงบต่ำที่ค่อนข้างดีเลยครับ","timestamp_created":1525353249,"timestamp_updated":1525353249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41828332","author":{"steamid":"76561198245978690","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":19594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6744,"last_played":1631585266},"language":"english","review":"“===[ ❤ Audience: ]=== \n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n===[ ☼ Graphics: ]=== \n☐ Potato\n☐ Really bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Masterpiece\n\n===[ $ Price/quality: ]=== \n☑ Full price\n☑ Wait for sale\n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n===[ ☣ Requirments: ]=== \n☐ 90' PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium \n☑ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n===[ ☼ Difficulty: ]=== \n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Ez\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master \n☑ Hard (first few hours)\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ ۞ Game time/length ]=== \n☐ Really short ( 0 -
