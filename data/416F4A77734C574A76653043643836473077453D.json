Killers like tryhard spirit, unbalanced freddy, baby nurse that can still 4k with no issues whatsoever... all culminating in a frustrating experience for 4/5 players in any given match.

You shouldn't have to play 500 hours in this game to be able to survive half your matches, and yet.... In my first 20 hours alone my win ratio as survivor has been well below 20%.

老奶奶（如果只考虑玩幻神那么只需要买怨灵，老奶奶看情况，一般都是为了拿到三个强力技能的传承才买，麦扣的话2个角色实力都比较平均，麦扣脏套路很多，他妹妹有毁灭打击和魂牵梦绕这两个神技）。技能的话人类必备是钢筋铁骨或者平稳着陆（看玩法）屠夫必备是人肉烧烤（自带2倍血点和短时间透视）和厄咒毁灭或者厄咒摇篮曲（但是后者必须代币积满才有很大的效果）。新手人类建议先玩黑妹并且把自摸的传承点出来。其次建议玩劳丽＞尼亚＞大卫＞托马斯

not to make this too long but Dead by Daylight is definitely one of the most interactive games around. Playing as either \"Survivor\" or \"Killer\" role; you have the option of either working with 3 other Survivors to power the gate to escape or prevent that by killing Survivors off. \n\nThe game implements iconic characters from the horror genre such as Michael Myers, Freddie Kurger, Ghostface etc. \nThere's even the newest addition of characters from Stranger Things (Demogorgon serving as killer). Each character has uniquely designed perks that fit their personality and play style. There's a variety of play styles available; from being a stealthy survivor to being a survivor who knows the Killer's every move yet at the cost of being exposed to the Killer as well; you can also choose a more utility play style and offer support to other members by completing tasks faster etc. So put shortly the game accommodates a variety of personalities and styles and offers a unique experience to express yourself ... while facing death. \n\nKillers obviously want to kill people but what I especially love about the game is that while their goal is always the same (killing survivors) there's a bunch of ways to achieve that. For example there's a Killer named \"Plague\" and she has the ability to vomit all over survivors to infect them. The infected Survivor can cleanse the infection BUT by doing that he offers more power to the priestess Plague. So the Survivor has to decide to either pursue his own interest and potentially hurt the team by making the Plague stronger or being infected and exposed to death but not hurt the team as much. So as a Killer you can really play mind games with Survivors putting them in  a position where they have to make tough decisions depending on specific situation, almost like a Hobbesian dilemma. You will meet all sorts of people while playing (those very altruistic and ready to help or those who will leave you behind no matter what).
