I usually play in customs with friends, which is what I think is the most enjoyable feature. You can choose any perks, and the only thing you can't really access are killers and survivors which you have not unlocked. So if you know people who already have the game, or can convince people you know to get it, then I definitely recommend getting Dead by Daylight.\n2. Playing online is also enjoyable to me. While I used to mainly play survivor, it can get boring to repeat the same tasks with the same variety of killers over and over again. While I enjoy horror, once that initial feeling of being confused and trying to figure everything out is gone you get used to it. Now I play killer a lot (if my pfp didn't give it away) and I'm currently enjoying trying to master certain killers and their unique abilities. I haven't really had any significant bad lobbies, yet. I'll probably update this review in the future.\n3. The ranking in this game confuses me. I'm gone against multiple blood ranks when playing with random players online, or blood ranked killers when me and my low ranked friends play public. I'm sure there's a system set in place depending on maybe your stats or wins, etc, however it doesn't flow smoothly and sometimes you're placed with players way below or above your rank, giving advantages which make the game play less fun.\n\nOverall, 9/10. I enjoy this game and while there is definitely something I forgot to include, I enjoy my time playing.","timestamp_created":1638596692,"timestamp_updated":1638596692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105190070","author":{"steamid":"76561197971219144","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1638595899},"language":"english","review":"Govna kusok","timestamp_created":1638595989,"timestamp_updated":1638595989,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105189957","author":{"steamid":"76561198804341866","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":238,"playtime_at_review":23615,"last_played":1659568875},"language":"english","review":"Look if you're okay with unfair gameplay and sometimes being overpowered alongside disgusting glitches then this is the game for you.

Уникальная в своем жанре игра, с множествами вариациями навыков как за сторону маньяка, так и за выжившего, благотворя этому может меняться кардинально стиль игры. Она может подойти игрокам одиночкам которые могут играть на маньяках, так и веселой компании друзей. Dead by Daylight может вызвать множество эмоций начиная с банального испуга от нежданно скинутой выжившим паллеты и заканчивая смехом сквозь слезы (ну либо же испорченным в край настроением из-за большинства токсичных игроков, о чем стоит также упомянуть). \n\nДальше опишу более подробно следующие пункты убивающие весь интерес к игре и из-за которых я не рекомендую эту игру:\n- Техническое состояние игры. \nНа самом деле щекотливая тема, чего только стоят криво проработанные хитбоксы или регистрация удара/оглушения. Проблемы со звуком, в связи с которыми могут не оповещаться важные события, например не издающий звуков выживший поваленный с ног (замечу что нету дающего такое преимущество навыка) или отсутствие напрочь уведомления о заведенном генераторе, или некорректное воспроизведение звуков при взаимодействие которое дезориентирует. Проблема \"невидимой\" ранговой системы подбора отвечающей за поиск игроков вашего уровня но не справляющейся со своей задачей, ведь часто встречаются игроки которые и шанса на победу не оставят, либо группа новичков не наигравшие и 4 часов в игре. Также стоит заметить долгий поиск игры что также связано с подбором игроков. Проблемы с отображением анимаций. Баги с взаимодействиями с тотемами. \n\n- Геймплей.\nМною было сказано что в игре существует множество навыков/предметов/персонажей которые должны разнообразить каждую игру, и от части это правда если вы играете не на высоком ранге. Только стоит вам ступить на эту стезю так сразу столкнетесь с метой образовавшейся в этой игре. Однообразные шаблоны перков, слабые маны способности которых не представляют особой опасности на фоне других манов. Не сбалансированные карты и места на них в которые могут попасть игроки хотя в принципе такого не должно быть. Возвращаясь к проблеме системы подбору - в игре много опытных сурвов но испытывается сильный недостаток опытных манов (это и есть одна из причин долгого поиска игры). \n\n- Античит\nМогу отметить что за все время игры мне только единожды повстречался читер использовавший лагсвич, это наводит на мысль что Easy Anti-Cheat справляется со своей задачей. Правда глупо судить об этом приводя в пример только мою ситуацию.\n\n- Комьюнити игры.\nВ большинстве случаях мне встречались игроки которые так и норовят всеми возможными способами затоксичить, испортить игру. В конце обычной казалось бы катки вместо простого \"gg\" в чате ты наблюдаешь цирк актёров брызгающий во все стороны грязью. Они расскажут что и когда кто-то неправильно что-то сделал, с какими перками кому играть, почему все рукожопы а они проф с мнением которых все должны быть согласны и тп. \n\nP.s. А ведь на этом проблемы игры не заканчиваются, я привел лишь те которые сходу приходят в голову (так бы сказать накипевшее за все время), так бы обзор вышел в разы больше. Если вы и собираетесь играть в дбд то лучше позовите своих друзей в закрытое лобби.","timestamp_created":1638577235,"timestamp_updated":1638614754,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503086388111114502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105174932","author":{"steamid":"76561198131120797","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3955,"last_played":1658254319},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é divertido entre amigos mas atualizar o jogo é um lixo, é muito mais rápido desinstalar e instalar de novo do que esperar essa bosta atualizar pq ele pede pra baixar, verificar TODOS arquivos e depois instalar, o tempo de fazer tudo isso é o tempo de baixar o jogo 3x","timestamp_created":1638576955,"timestamp_updated":1638576955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105174773","author":{"steamid":"76561197999172207","num_games_owned":1210,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":94178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2212,"playtime_at_review":70303,"last_played":1660549983},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, while I love some parts of the game, it's impossible to recommend.\n\nCons:\n* SBMM [Skill Based Match Making] takes less than 10% of the total round into check when deciding if you \"Won\" or \"Lost\" a game into account. For reference, it only counts if you escaped or died for survivor and how many kills you got as killer into account, with 2 being a tie for the system and 3 being a positive net of MMR. What actually happens is that if you do well one or two games you get bodied the next five or six back down: For survivors this usually means just getting put up against the absolute most sweaty of killers and if you are solo, getting tunneled out late in the game. For killers, this means the same thing where you likely get placed up against 4 tryharding Survive With Friends players who will never let you get a hit in and will abuse known things in the map that make the game insanely unfun.\n* Solo survivor is one of the most commonly frustrating things I've ever experienced in gaming. For newer players it is super likely you'll face a killer you have zero choice but to die against, and for players who have played a lot, a single other survivor not doing something perfectly destroys your ability to survive as well. A good example being if you get unhooked near a camping killer who stays on top of hooks and they DON'T have Borrowed Time you both will likely go down, and if you don't have Decisive Strike you'll die pretty much immediately. What this means is that you end up running the same 3 perks every game minimum because NOT running them makes you an easy target to instantly kill off which makes the game unwinnable for the other 3 survivors. \n* Killer is less frustrating, but not by much. Against uncoordinated games you can usually get 2K's pretty consistently and easily, against coordinated groups it's entirely possible to never get a single down. Killers who have played the game for a long period of time are aware of perks that might make this easier but they can be fragile and gimmicky to run, while some killers can play the game entirely \"Nude\" with no perks and addons that improve their basekit and excell while others have to run rare and expensive perks and addons to even have a chance at solidifying A kill.\n* The grind is unforgivably bad. I can't recommend this game for anyone who hasn't already dumped several hundred hours into it. It keeps getting worse each patch and I almost regret spending any money and time on this game some days.\n* The core of the game is unbalanced. Some killers are so strong they basically automatically win, playing a survivor down is impossible, it can be absolutely maddening how easy it is to screw over other players even if you didn't mean too, it's incredibly maddening how if you aren't running Borrowed Time Decisive Strike Unbreakable [For survivor] or Gen regression perks [For killer] or else you immediately lose.\n* Some maps are entirely broken for one side or the other and can be incredibly unfun if the players in the match are aware of these issues. Haddonfield and The Game is insanely strong for survivors and can be impossible for killer as they can loop the same two houses for the entire game and never risk going down. For killer it's entirely possible to get a Corn map as a killer who relies heavily on line of sight to be good, and it's entirely possible to get a map so large such as Mother's Dwelling where you physically can't patrol more than 2 gens without burning over a minute walking between each one.\n* Playerbase is both one of the most toxic and whiniest I've ever seen in the entire internet. They make League players look like Saints.\n* Addictive cycle of gameplay.\n* Gameplay is never in a truthfully good state. Hatch right now is basically pointless as an addition to the game with tunneling, slugging and camping all being far too powerful. Similarly playing the game with no perks and addons is impossible which feels like garbage, with several killers quite literally only having one or two useful addons, or they are like Freddy where they have zero good addons. Overall SBMM has made the game miserable for everyone, where as prior the gameplay would only be miserable for set groups ala solo survivors, killers who play THESE killers, etc. SBMM flat out is a terrible addition for it's simplicity.\n\nNow time for some pros:\n* If you play with a group of 4 friends survivor is not frustrating.\n* If you have time invested some of the problems become drastically better. \n* If you only buy killers and survivors who have strong perks your grind will be manageable.\n* Distinctive style that's hard to forget and dislike.\n* Good music is in here.\n* Addictive cycle of gameplay.\n\nIf you like CBT, you'll like DBD. Everyone else should stay away, at least until they actually rework some of the systems they are going too.","timestamp_created":1638576770,"timestamp_updated":1638576770,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105174397","author":{"steamid":"76561198391194823","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":395,"last_played":1658682463},"language":"english","review":"pp","timestamp_created":1638576265,"timestamp_updated":1638576265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105174135","author":{"steamid":"76561198095318802","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":53745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51791,"last_played":1645407375},"language":"russian","review":"За реализацию Майкла Майерса моё почтение","timestamp_created":1638575921,"timestamp_updated":1638575921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105174128","author":{"steamid":"76561199092645246","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":89297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":992,"playtime_at_review":60107,"last_played":1660519505},"language":"english","review":"this game is trash dont install","timestamp_created":1638575913,"timestamp_updated":1638575913,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4goevwf0CcMeakQM="}
