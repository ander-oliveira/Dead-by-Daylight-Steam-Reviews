match is way to inconsistent, and littered with Not-As-Intended bugs, that can range from minor, to directly performance interfering issues. Playing as survivor is fun, as long as the killer isn't terribly better than you, which a fair portion of matches they will be, your experience is tied to their play style, meaning if a killer really doesn't want you to have fun... *You won't.* You can be rendered helpless from trivial things like latency from their 'dedicated servers' and will often be left screaming \"WTF *THAT* HIT!!?!?!\"\nPlaying killer is a game of time management-micromanaging, and overall a stress simulator, where you can often times feel entirely powerless thanks to barely coordinated Survive-With-Friends, or from survivors that massively outrank you, thanks to a laughable MMR/Balanced Matchmaking system that at times flat out hands you unwinnable games. \n\nThis game is marketed as a horror game, and could only be explained as such, if you jump at getting peaked in CS:GO. The game is littered with issues and minor things that add up incredibly high. And yet when everything does Work as Intended, the game is fantastically entertaining, with it's fine tuned tug-and-pull 1v4 battle for time. But the conditions for a match go on like a laundry list, and depending on pure dumb luck alone, could fill an entire night, or like me, evade you for weeks at a time. The game is wonderfully addictive and a grind that keeps the people with mindsets of \"Well that one sucked, but just maybe the next one might could possibly be better.\"\n\nIt's roster is reputable and commendable, but at times it feels like as though there are only 3-4 killers or even perks, thanks to a generally misbalanced pool of perks in which more than 60% of it's perks are Useless-Hindering, and a small set of 4-6 that are incredibly good. Perk variety at high rank is generally not seen, aside from the occasional meme build, or a god send of luck, of someone not running Decisive-Strike + Unbreakable + Iron-Will + Dead Hard. The game ushers a bite-back toxicity, that is near impossible to take advantage of when the game blesses you with an opposition beneath you, that nearly seems to allure you into bullying people who don't know how to play the game better. The rank system also feels incredibly unjustified, allowing scummy killers playing in ways that offer little bare-bones entertainment for the other side, or neanderthalic and mentally impaired beings into the Rank 1 spots, leaving you deathly insulted that someone so stupid could outrank you, *simply* cause you know they had a sweat squad of friends carry them there.\n\nThis game could be fantastic if the devs\n1: started taking community feedback to heart\n2: fixed things people actually want fixed, instead of 'fixing' things that were perfectly fine\n3: stop spending the budget on buying reputable IPs, and take an off-season to- as the community has left to be memed from hell and back \"Fix their Shit\"\n\nBehaviour Interactive, for being developers that appear to listen to their community, and seem to do enough to get people saying it, if you didn't follow forums you wouldn't believe it, given the games *objective* state of disrepair. there's a reason there are youtubers who've made unholy amounts of compilations teasing the game's state of 'minor disfunctions' \nI'm convinced that people the community isn't actually aware of just how unironically broken the game really is, because at the end of the day- yes it is Minor Disfunction here, or Tiny Issues there, with maybe one glaring irregularity in a match. But the fact that almost everytime it's a different issue for each- it is not consistant issues, because there are just too many to run into them every game. And not to make it sound like I don't understand that games will have issues-- I am aware that no game can be perfect- I am aware that in multiplayer- player verses player there will always be a meta, and there will always be something not working exactly as intended that is the nature of gaming and gamers. I simply make the argument that I believe, if people where to take away the memes, and take away the games reputation for it, people would find this game to be much more littered with issues that look so minor you feel as though a highschool programming student could fix- or make from scratch, a more functioning system given a few days.\n\n\nBut I also love this game. Because of the fandom that eats up the ill state of the game, and the Dev's commendable stride they take it all in. Because Dead by Daylight isn't just a 1v4, monster vs humans game. If anything the bugs are a bigger part of it's identity than any other part of it. And I think it's a very strange balance. Because when compared to games by it's side, the game is shockingly flawed, and at times hard to enjoy. It's competitive structure is somewhat undermined at times by it even, and if it approached markets again in this state, it would be laughed out of the stores. But Dead by Daylight is that game you play- because it makes it so easy to make fun of. Because it's so blatantly easy to blame those minor bugs, and glaring issues instead of a lack of skill/knowledge on your end. Because of it's nature it's so easy to exempt yourself of responsibility that you *do* at times feel entirely helpless in the bad way.\nSo know that when you buy this game- you aren't getting the lovingly crafted game, taken through the polisher a thousand times, and given a gloss up every look over before the devs put it out there. DBD is a Games as a Service- we'll fix it in post - Meme, that offers enough issues without being genuinely unplayable, that it quickly grows on you because of the joys you have poking fun at it.\n\nI feel that objetively- when judged outside of it's name and reputation, with games comparable and not, Dead by Daylight is not worth it's asking price- much less any DLC tied to it. But DBD hits the sweet spot where for most of it's community they look past it, with likely vain hope that one day it could be that lovingly crafted, fine polished game someday. And so I leave this here... think of my review what you will.","timestamp_created":1615432258,"timestamp_updated":1615432258,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88223018","author":{"steamid":"76561198096047892","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":5288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4624,"last_played":1657689156},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1615432180,"timestamp_updated":1615432180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88222730","author":{"steamid":"76561198316060549","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34894,"last_played":1623128771},"language":"english","review":"Don't play it if you're soft.","timestamp_created":1615431635,"timestamp_updated":1615431635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88222522","author":{"steamid":"76561198096242758","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1619673730},"language":"english","review":"its fun and suspensful! i love that you can customize heros and villans]","timestamp_created":1615431220,"timestamp_updated":1615431220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88222424","author":{"steamid":"76561198074929320","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":40267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3752,"last_played":1654562790},"language":"english","review":"Fix your freaking game.

Если вы хотите приятно провести время играя за превосходящего по силе игрока против других четырех, или поиграть в компании друзей и расслабиться - это не про ДБД. ДБД - еб***ая помойка. Каждый раз я возвращаюсь в игру и надеюсь на адекватную игру на расслабоне, в результате получаю психоз, \"так не играй\" подметите вы, и я с вами соглашусь. Но это как мыши которые плакали и кололись, но продолжали есть кактус, и так, по порядку о том, как просрать около двух с половиной тысяч, или сколько там, в никуда( если со всеми главами).\nЕсли вы решили поиграть с более опытными друзьями, но вам уже не 18 и даже не 20, то сначала покажется, что все нормально. Сурвы тупенькие, маны бестолковые, (как правило на 20тых рангах), тишь и благодать. П***ец начинается ночью (когда любой нормальный человек приходит с работы и попивая пивко решает расслабиться. Про ночь:\n1. Бехэйверы вертели вашу нервную систему на **ю как и оптимизацию игры. Будьте готовы что цацкаться матчмейкинг с вами не будет, ему просто по**ать. Вас, с двадцатым рангом и одним вкаченным перком на мане спокойно может кинуть к первому уровню. И что же в этом страшного? Быстрее научишься? Да н**уя вы не научитесь. Вас ждут игроки которые походу вообще из-за компа не выходят. Вам будут приседать в воротах, затягивать игру, когда вы уже проиграли всячески показывать \"ха-ха соси член тупой ман\". За сурвов же вас ждут очешуительные хитбоксы через все возможное, и если вы не готовы изучать как дипломную работу каждый кустик, пробитие каждого окошка, то и за сурвов и за манов вы будете сосать, потому что стримеры и первый ранг не дремлют.\n2.Редкое, но меткое. Казалось бы, вас закинуло в нормальный раунд, игроки вашего уровня, и тут уже кроме своей криворукости винить не кого, но, все нормально. А вот Х** ВАМ! Сурвы глючат, летают над землей, сурв на плече глючит и его нельзя ни положить, ни повесить, сурвы это видят, и что они делают? Верно, они вам приседают)))) Если же сурв вы, то вас тупо продадут, отсюда перетекаем в следующий пункт.\n3.Абсолютно невменяемое коммьюнити. Мне всегда казалось, что для того, чтобы выходить из игры, даже если ты плохо играешь не с подпаленным пердаком, достаточно лишить другую команду войса. Нихрена, наши руские, да и зарубежные друзья всегда найдут способ показать вам что вы \"х**йло\" и вам следует удалить игру. Причины я перечислил выше, из нового - в конце матча вам напишут что-то вроде \"Ман сосать\", или \"GG EASY\" в общем испортят вам день окончательно, ибо один-два раза еще можно это спустить на тормозах, но когда каждую катку такое - это звиздец. Ах да, если вы выиграли за мана, вам поспешат напомнить, что вы \"Х**ло* и вообще вы кэмперите и прочее, прочее, прочее.\n4.И снова про манов(да, за сегодня у меня знатно рвануло ниже спины). Хотите закономерность? Вы не фапаете на ДБД как манну небесную => вы не знаете наизусть все спавны и расположения люков и тотетом(карта редко помогает), а знаете самое смешное? Ваши враги знают)))) \nКогда вы в команде сурвов, вы хер найдете горящий тотем, разве что только по чистой случайности, но вот если вы играете за мана тотемы будут спавниться на открытой местности посреди прям еб**ного чистого с**а поля. Решили расслабиться? Сосать!\n5.Странный подход разрабов к попыткам баланса, нерфят все, по делу и без, последняя обнова вообще \n6. И да, забудьте о том, чтобы играть с рандомами, ман вас поимеет.\nстранная, у манов хитбоксы в \"пол-карты\" у сурвов навыки понерфили.\nВ общем не знаю, может кому-то и нравится днями напролет сидеть и учить все тонкости задрачивая игру до идеала, как за сурвов так и за манов, я же рассчитывал на расслабон и в результате слил бабки в никуда, лучше бы РДР купил, чес слово. Надеюсь я к этой помойке не притронусь еще с месяц, а то и вовсе созрею удалить ее и уйти в реальность, ах да. Для справедливости, единственный плюс.\n+++Если вам за двадцать пять и вам уже некогда залипать днями напролет, эта чудесная игра быстро отобьет у вас желание идти в какой бы то ни было онлайн.
