      玩了还是有100小时+了，多多少少还是多游戏测评有一些发言权，黎明杀机作为这种4v1对抗的前沿游戏，无论是画面还是操作都是顶尖水平，反正游玩体验绝对不会差的。游戏公司一直都在采取中国玩家的建议，经常在论坛上咨询中国玩家游戏开发建议，没想到吧，老杨还真是以杨永信为原型开发的。但是一款作品肯定是有优有劣的\n       新手一开始绝对拼心态玩游戏的，总之前30小时你玩起来都是怕的。段位越高越要勾心斗角，没时间害怕。但是国服环境就这样，人类不修机，选个三阶黑妹蹲蘑菇，2倒秒拔。屠夫假模假样拔插，出来给你说是网卡，真是有你的。首先是车队问题，我个人感觉不管在那个服务器高段都有强势车队，玩过韩服的兄弟应该知道，韩服高段的速修车队很恐怖的。国服车队基本上就是钥匙两齿轮。要不就是光明天使四手电，红处被削了，屠夫是越来越难玩了（还好我是双边玩家）。新手还要注意一点，这个游戏的匹配机制非常奇怪，经常出现我一个红段人排到3个紫段人加一个绿屠夫之类的。说到这里又想骂那些摸宝先锋，你m开局带双摸宝加猫和弹射，你是有多怕死？那个电机上是抹上了屎你不敢摸？队友拼死拼活LT加长板区加双窗区溜屠夫3分钟就亮了一台？出来之后美其名曰“拆图腾”，“我真的修了的”，“我真的按了的”，“哎呀，卡了卡了，我的我的”，“溜了5秒”。\n       还是希望游戏工作室能加强一下屠夫，现在屠夫的玩法越来越死板了，人类修机速度随着版本更新反而还加快了。屠夫基本上我遇到的，或者我自己玩都是带恶咒，不死，锁机，烧烤。为了拖机子速度就只能这么带，确实少了很多玩法和趣味性。传统走地流屠夫基本上没活路，像迈叔，兔妈等已经成为末流了。要么就是走极端直接玩针对。像我遇到的双红配迈尔斯，5台机让你修，吸到三阶逮到就是满处，还有各种守尸等就不说了。推荐大家玩生儿子那个屠夫吧，玩到1转了，确实强度不错。\n      反正说了这么多我还是推荐大家来购买这款游戏，确实你能在里面度过快乐的时光，无论是和好基友上分也好还是深夜独战车队或屠皇，都挺快乐的。b站有很多“下饭”up主，在这里给大家推荐一下，大鸽，离枯，白小夏，付导等。可以看视频学技术！！！","timestamp_created":1611051379,"timestamp_updated":1611051379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":103,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.810988366603851318","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84968142","author":{"steamid":"76561199107810870","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":1766,"last_played":1660423202},"language":"russian","review":"...","timestamp_created":1611050890,"timestamp_updated":1611050890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84968109","author":{"steamid":"76561198382256337","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":6186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1658842179},"language":"german","review":"G

this game for 300+hrs on xbox switched to pc last year, i went through a few ups and downs with the game but back then it was more of a worry about survivor vs killer and how they were balanced, and

incredibly lazy and greedy (Yes covid but they have around 500 employees and are allowed to \"work when they want\").

The amount of times I have been hit while the killer faced the opposite direction over 5 feet back is enough to put a hole through some drywall. On top of this, Several easy games have been lost by bs like getting teleported and stuck in the ground, and being unable to move due to objects that aren't actually there.(Thought this is very rare)\n-The devs absolutely refuse to acknowledge that 70-80% of their player base plays this game for FUN, so many games you'll run into killers that play like they're practicing for a world tournament, while half your teammates have as many brain cells as a fucking cabbage and spend most of their time drooling on the floor while you're being chased.\n-Dead by Daylight is not a particularly difficult game mechanically, but gaining a base understanding of how the game functions and learning how to loop the killer effectively is not an easy task and will take a decent amount of play time. I have 315 hours currently and half the time I make beginner mistakes that make me feel like a toddler.\n-A majority of perks on both the survivor and killer side are practically unusable when put up against players in the top 1% of the games skill level. At a competitive level not much is viable and only a few killers with specific builds have a fighting chance against 4 survivors playing optimally. (hence why I think the devs should move away from being a highly competitive game) but when playing casually all perks can be used effectively if used right.\n-Before you get a decent understanding of how perks and killers function, a lot of matches may be frustrating and leave you wondering how many killers are considered fair despite the game being fundamentally survivor sided.\n-If you are quickly upset and angered by videogames and easily turn to flaming your opponents because they play in a way you dislike I dont recommend this game to you. Mainly because many of the players in this game choose to play in ways that are fun to THEM, and you might get upset that they are enjoying themselves because you're an insufferable child. If this is the case, do the Dead by Daylight community a favor and play some other garbage game where you can lash out at other players for trying to have a good time like League of Legends or CSGO.\n-Ranked system is literally garbage, ranking up and reaching the highest rank in the game requires time instead of skill, and will result in you seeing rank 1(highest rank) players that have sub room temperature IQ's that single handedly throw the entire game for the other 3 players. Your rank doesn't equate your skill level and never will because the devs cannot figure out how to make a ranked system that works properly.\n-If you drew names out of a hat there is a higher likelihood you'd be placed in a lobby that is your skill level than BHVR's(Behavior) garbage matchmaking system. Time and time again I have absolutely destroyed both new survivors and new killers despite being the highest rank. The matchmaking does not care if you have 2000 hours on killer, they'll put you against some poor soul who just started 20 minutes ago and you'll ruin their day. This is less of a possibility and more of a warning since there is no real way to escape the fact that BHVR(Behavior) doesn't know how to make matchmaking work.\n\nPros:\n-If you play games to have fun, and enjoy learning how to break killers ankles or play effectively against a wide variety of killers and builds you'll probably enjoy this game very much. Getting a really lucky escape, outplaying your opponents, or sometimes even dying after doing your best can be very exciting and fun with the right mindset and group of friends to play with.\n-Speaking of friends, if you have a group to play with this game is very enjoyable, and teamwork can make the dream work, or get all of you killed since the balance in this game is equivalent to that of a fat clown walking around on paper mache stilts. Regardless, a group of friends can make both winning and losing an enjoyable experience.\n-If you don't have friends(dont worry me too) you can play as a killer and spend your time attempting to ruthlessly chase down and kill your opponents. Killer is much easier to learn when first introduced to the game and is generally the most fun to play. Survivor is also very fun to play, but playing solo a majority of the time stinks. The solo queue experience is kinda dogshit and may leave you wondering how on earth a chimpanzee escaped the zoo and made it onto a computer that had dead by daylight already running. (This is honestly only half a joke, sometimes you will run into players that make you realize graduating elementary school is an accomplishment)\n-Variety: Dead by Daylight currently has 22 killers and 24 survivors to play with 164 total perks that are available to use. Each killer has varying play styles based on their individual powers, perks and addons and makes it so you can create tons of different builds. It is very enjoyable using new perk builds and finding the play style that is most fun to you. Survivors play the same no matter which one you choose, its the perks and items you bring into the match that change how you play. Dead by Daylight has a ton of variety in how you can play and the types of perk combos you can use to outplay, dominate, or accidentally lose the game. All of which can be very fun or funny if you accidentally pull a 0 IQ stunt. With killers, many have unique and fun abilities to learn and use making it so you will likely find a killer that tailors to your play style.\n-Tons of maps to play on, almost every realm has several different variants and can generate in different ways, each map generally has its own aesthetic and is unique and fun to play on in its own way.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI am well aware that my cons section is noticeably larger than my pros section. I chose to rant much more about the downsides to this game so you have a good understanding of the kind of shit show you're getting yourself into. This isn't meant to deter you from the game(as I do recommend trying it), because Dead by Daylight is extremely fun in its own right and can easily become your new most played game. It most certainly has its problems, and more issues than just what I listed but I wanted to make sure my review gave Dead by Daylight a fair explanation and gave people who were intrigued by the game a good understanding of what they may experience. While you will always run into jack asses, a majority of players in Dead by Daylight are chill and awesome, and many of the content creators are not just incredible players but great people. Dead by Daylight can be hard to pick up at first, so I recommend if you are interested either jump in and learn through trial by fire, or watch some of the amazing educational content creators(Otzdarva is the first that comes to mind). Also Dead by Daylight goes on sale and has free weekends pretty often so if you dont want to spend the full 20, just wait a bit, it'll be 5 dollars before you know it.","timestamp_created":1611021986,"timestamp_updated":1611022172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84952190","author":{"steamid":"76561198151400512","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4578,"last_played":1632624506},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1611021873,"timestamp_updated":1611021873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84952012","author":{"steamid":"76561199130927529","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":47197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3776,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1660539161},"language":"spanish","review":"Super bueno","timestamp_created":1611021568,"timestamp_updated":1611021568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84951966","author":{"steamid":"76561198109166189","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":231680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":129,"playtime_at_review":11679,"last_played":1660558954},"language":"brazilian","review":"\nO game é bom,porem poderiam melhorar os gráficos e os bugs!!","timestamp_created":1611021496,"timestamp_updated":1611021496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456663578748703003","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84951952","author":{"steamid":"76561198451502374","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1656600105},"language":"schinese","review":"wssb","timestamp_created":1611021472,"timestamp_updated":1611021472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":73,"votes_funny":84,"weighted_vote_score":"0.772406935691833496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84951895","author":{"steamid":"76561199016150344","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1355,"last_played":1639270639},"language":"english","review":"Its an all around fun game.
