It's such a fantastic idea and on the border of being great but it has just too many problems to recommend. If you're a low level killer, you'll be paired up with undoubtedly several high level survivors and chances are they will win with little to no effort. If you're a survivor, it'll take forever to find a match (if you even do) and then it's hit or miss on how well the game will perform which depends on the host's internet and the host seems to be the killer. Pretty massively-unbalanced gameplay, latency issues due to the lack of dedicated servers, clunky mechanics (which I can overlook on their own but in combination with latency problems they become pretty unbearable), poor optimization, and the few exploits in the game such as window spams make this game not worth my time. Maybe it'll be patched in the future and polished out to be fantastic but it just didn't there yet. Save your money for now and wait for improvement or another asymmetrical serial killer game. \n\nUpdate: So it's been a full year or so since I wrote this recommendation and I have to say the game has improved a ton. You can still be paired against a person with significantly better perks than you which sucks but the lag issue has been somewhat handled, glitches and other problems have been worked on substantially and there is a ton more content now in new killers, maps, and survivors.

Sobald man aber mit Freunden spielen möchte, treten erste Probleme auf. Bis man eine passende Lobby gefunden hat, vergehen oftmals 5-10 Minuten. Kann recht nervig sein, wenn das nach jeder Spielrunde passiert, zumal die Runden meist 8-12 Minuten gehen, aber das hängt natürlich immer davon ab, wie gut man selber ist, wie gut das Team insgesamt ist und wie gut der Killer ist. Es kommt auch manchmal vor, dass der Killer nicht verlieren kann und frustriert das Spiel einfach verlässt und die Runde damit beendet. Die Balance zwischen Killer und Survivor ist auch nicht die beste, aber es ist nicht wirklich unfair. Wenn man weiß, wie man als Killer zu spielen hat, dann sollte man es auch schaffen, die Überlebenden hinters Licht zu führen und zu überwältigen.\nWas ich nicht wirklich verstehen kann, sind tatsächlich manche Spieler. Manche denken leider nur an sich. Es kam schon vermehrt dazu, dass ich Spieler gerettet habe, ich geschnappt worden bin und der gerettete Spieler macht sich einfach aus dem Staub und lässt mich sterben. Das frustriert oft und lässt einen tatsächlich darüber nachdenken, das gleiche ebenfalls mal zu tun. Dennoch gibt es genug Spieler, die als Team spielen und nicht Ihr eigenes Ding durchziehen.\n\nPersönlich finde ich das Spiel gut gelungen, aber man merkt deutlich, dass noch einiges an Arbeit getan werden muss. Das Spiel macht Spaß, selbst wenn einiges nicht so gut durchdacht ist.","timestamp_created":1473542719,"timestamp_updated":1473542719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529737234115600586","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25450907","author":{"steamid":"76561198110792025","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2499,"last_played":1514723111},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel an sich macht extrem Spaß.\nDas Jäger und Gejagter Thema ist sehr deutlich im Spiel vertreten und die Umsetzung des Horrors gefällt mir persönlich sehr.\neinziges Manko sind ein paar vorkommende Bugs die ab und an das Spielvergnügen etwas bremsen können und dass viele Killer wenn sie einen erwischt und aufgehangen haben einem einfach vorm Gesicht stehen bleiben ohne sich auch nur einen Millimeter von der Stelle zu rühren.\nAnsonsten wie gesagt ein echt spannendes und spaßiges Spiel das Potenzial hat viele viele Stunden zu belustigen.\n\nin Schulnoten würd ich dem Spiel ne glatte 2 geben.","timestamp_created":1473542445,"timestamp_updated":1473542445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25450784","author":{"steamid":"76561198071471563","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2304,"last_played":1642246877},"language":"english","review":"Игра, где застрявщие в лесу человечки пытаются выбраться оттуда.

Общее представление об игре уже сложилось у многих, даже у тех кто в неё уже играл. Сейчас же я попытаюсь изменить отношение к игре в лючшую сторону или же наоборот, ухудшить. Ну начнем.\n\n1. Что из себя представляет игра?\nЭто survival horror, маловато годноты такого жанра. В игре есть, если можно так сказать, противостояние маньяка и выживших. Цель выживших - завести все генераторы (количество которых зависит от количества игроков), после чего открыть ворота и убежать. А цель маньяка, как вы уже догадались, помешать выжившим это сделать, убив их всех. Есть несколько способов это сделать, а именно подвесить на крюк (после чего немного подождать, пока он умрет) или же оставить умирать на земле. В обоих случаях другие выжившие могут помочь бедняге, снять с крюка или поднять его. У каждого маньяка есть своя \"супер способность\", которая облегчает поимку жертв. В игре присутствует система прокачки персонажа. В общем задумка достаточно хорошая.\n\n2. Графическая составляющая.\nГрафика не плохая, но и не топовая. Глаза не режет, гамма отлично подходить под стиль игры. Картинка выходит очень и очень приятная, атмосфера передается. В общем 9 мз 10.\n\n3. Оптимизация.\nВ этом игра ещё не показала себя. Очень требовательная игра, от чего аудитория намного меньше, чем могла бы быть. При достаточно хорошом компуктере и на высоких настройках выдает 50-60 фпс. Достаточно хорошо, но не у всех такие ПК. В общем тянет только на 6-7 фпс из 10.\n\n4. Баги.\nБольная тема. То маньяк не может тебя поднять, когда ты лежишь (как и другие выжившие). То лобби не запускается. То персонажи растянуты за руки. То волосы не на своем месте. То заставка зависнет. Не так критично, не так сильно затрагивает баланс, иногда можно проорать. Только из-за смешных багов даю оценку повыше. 6-7 растянутых текстур из 10. \n\n5. Читы и анти-чит.\nЧиты, как я слышал есть, но их я не встречал. Может анти-чит не пускает, а может игроки очень порядочные. И это очень хорошо. 10 из 10.\n\n6. Обновления.\nОбновления есть, крутят там что то в балансе, добавляют маньяков. Разработка идет. Но игра сырая, нету чт ещё говорить.\n\n7. Геймплей.\nПонятный любому. Видишь генератор, нажал кнопку, чинишь, всё понятно и интересно. Однообразность есть, но думаю разрабы игру не закинут, так как задумка очень хорошая. 10 генераторов из 10.\n\nА вот конец. Спасибо, что дочитали обзор до конца. Игра очень хорошая, но сырая. Особенно она классная, когда играешь компанией, чем я практически не насладился. Желаю игре удачи, у игры есть будущее, надеюсь не пропадет. Игру советую, каефная.

Then spent those 200k BP you've earned until then to unlock a list of totaly broken perks like: [list]\n[*] Iron Grasp - that makes the wiggling-mecanic and the sabotage perk useless as you are able to go on a sightseeing tour around the map before you hang your victim in the basement\n[*] Noone escapes Death - that enables you to onehit everyone for 2 minutes after the exit gates are powered\n[*] Insidious - which is both the proof the the devs regard hookcamping as legit and a big fat \"fuck you!\" in the face of every survivor who wants to help\nor my favorite\n[*] Combine \"Deerstalker\", \"A Nurse's Calling\", \"Bloodhound\"/\"Stridor\" and \"Spies From The Shadows\" - To see downed Survivors through walls and obstacles, to see survivors that heal or get healed through walls and obstacles, \"to clearly see the bloodtracks of wounded people who are already on the other side of the map/clearly hear people breathing if you have soround sound and see survivours that startle the birds - or to make it short: Get a legal Wallhack in addition to the legal Noclip your nurse already has. Because you have no cheaters in a game that already offers players to cheat legaly. (Just kidding since this game is not VAC protected there is a quite big bunch of cheaters.)\n[/list]\nAnd if that is still not enough get some addons on your weapon to once and for all anihilate the last chunks of balance your class ability had or throw in a \"memento mori\" offering to instakill suvivors without even hooking them.\nThen go to the forums and create salty posts about t-bagging and \"infinite\" abuseing survivors because you managed to get to rank 1 without notecing that all you need to do to counter those 4 infinite that are still in the game is to place a stupid trap right below that window/channel your chainsaw at the right time or simply play nurse whilst survivors have no way to counter your dickhead-camping strategy you can pull off at any hook on the map.\n\nSo be ready to play\n\n\"Camped 'till Daylight\" - i mean \"Gen repair sim\" - i mean \"Fuck you for picking survivor\" i mean\n\nDead by Daylight.","timestamp_created":1473528265,"timestamp_updated":1473621808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25446658","author":{"steamid":"76561198144236836","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":10461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1810,"last_played":1653655949},"language":"russian","review":"Игра в принципе годная, но есть минусы:\n1: Баги.
