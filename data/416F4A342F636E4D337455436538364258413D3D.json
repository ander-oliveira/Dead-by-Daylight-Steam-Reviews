I recommend buying and playing this game. It's not done yet! That's what makes it so promising. \n\nHowever right now I'm just writing this review to get my one or two cons out there in hopes the developers read it: The killers are OP, or the survivors suck! And I say it's both. The Trapper just hangs someone on a meat hook and then places a bear trap in front of them. Then waits it out for another victim to attempt a rescue. It's so cheap. \n\nAnd the attack range of all the killers is a bit much. Even if you run to the side and behind them to try and avoid the swing, you get injured. At some point it's not realistic for the killer while the game is 100% realistic for the victims. AND if memory serves me right, the killers can still attack while carrying somebody! They should be using both hands to carry me if I'm wiggling around on their shoulders trying to escape their clutches.\n\nAnd that flashlight is useless af. All the killer has to do is face the opposite direction and run, and the flashlight is dead. Really? That's the only defensive item the victims have? Please add some more defensive items. Maybe a bat or something. I know victims in horror movies fight back from time to time; they ain't all helpless. \n\nThank you!","timestamp_created":1467785503,"timestamp_updated":1467785503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24127291","author":{"steamid":"76561198122218861","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1660,"last_played":1647205207},"language":"brazilian","review":"Só esse jogo para me tirar do lolzinho, serio muito bom, a ideia do jogo é genial e jogar com os amigos é perfeito\nInfelizmente tem alguns problemas, que creio eu serão resolvidos em atualizaçoes futuras como: correções de alguns bugs, equilibrar um dos assasinos (o que fica invisivel) e principalmente adicionarem a opção de chamar os amigos sem ter que fechar uma partida inteira. para jogar com um amigo só é preciso ficar entrando e saindo de salas até encontrar ele.\nFora esse problemas, não tenho nada a reclamar e amei o jogo","timestamp_created":1467785106,"timestamp_updated":1467785106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630371928215026855","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24127290","author":{"steamid":"76561198066471731","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":13554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8062,"last_played":1491902935},"language":"schinese","review":"NICE","timestamp_created":1467785105,"timestamp_updated":1467785105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24127280","author":{"steamid":"76561198040142637","num_games_owned":439,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2518,"last_played":1613216165},"language":"schinese","review":"我很喜欢这游戏，虽然我当屠夫的时候总是被人溜的跟狗一样。\n有种站住对肛啊！！！哈哈，简单，刺激的游戏。好评","timestamp_created":1467785040,"timestamp_updated":1483710164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24127269","author":{"steamid":"76561198161793300","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":36365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13000,"last_played":1646661042},"language":"english","review":"This game will soon become very popular.\nWell ...

Unfortunately it's not going to be a pleasant one.\n\nThis game was clearly released unfinished. It more than lacks in several areas that should have been polished before relase - here are the most glaring:\n\n1) The biggest glaring issue: No partying with friends unless it's a private unranked game. This wouldn;t be so bad if the game wasn't fun only when you had a full party of 5 playing unranked, otherwise it's a boring mess. In the ranked games you are paired with complete randoms all of whom play with a Call of Duty sense of mind that they can solo the world and not bother lifting a finger trying to save a teammate. I have died countless times sacrificing myself to save a teammate or throw myself in the way of a killer and blind him only to havve myself get in a pinch later and everyone scattering to the wind.\n2) No in-game chat. You might say this one was done on purpose, but when the game has a MAJOR cripple as stated in point #1 this is a necessity. They could have at least done it creatively - in-game walkie talkies that give off a noise range that the killer can here when he's close - easy to implement and effective until they fix the multiplayer partying.\n3) Completely broken lobbying. This is probably one of the most frustrating issues with this game. You will spend a good few minutes just trying to get the game to ALLOW YOU TO PLAY. You click on 'Find a lobby' and the game responds with 'Failed'. Rinse and repeat a few times and then the game starts to act like it's loading to a lobby and then... you're mysteriously backk at the 'Find a lobby' screen? Click on 'Find a lobby' again and you might finally get taken in to a game with players! Everyone clicks on ready... game countdown has begun... grip your seats for a fun ride... WAIT, LOBBY CRASHED! Yeah, do that three or four times in a row and your patience for this game will have been destroyed.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this game is plagued with so many issues. It seriously is a fun game and it shines when everything works the way it's supposed to and you don't get stuck with brain-dead teammates. Unfortunately though it seems like the Developers heard that the Friday the 13th game was fundraised and decided to make a mad dash to release this - bugs and all.\n\nFinal Verdict: 4/10 with the potential of a 7/10 game. Wait for it to be patched or go on a heavy sale before wasting your well earned money.\n\n(UPDATE: 7/24/2016)\nSo they released the new update to allow team survivor grouping. While it does make the game slightly better - the glitches this game has are simply too numerous.\n\nIf you have a group less than 4 prepare to maybe play 1 game every 20 tries, because apparently it's too hard for this game to find a working lobby.

I play mostly the killer, and it's fun chasing down the survivors and trying to herd them towards traps or predict which way they're running so you can cut them off.  It's a really fun game of cat and mouse; however, the ranking/point system ruins the game, or at least how the system currently works (ranking and leveling are two separate systems btw, but they are both dependent on points).  \n\nThe ranking system is currently based on points which you earn by completing certain actions in the game, such as finding a survivor, chasing them, attacking them, hooking them, etc.  However, if you're TOO GOOD at this game and kill all the survivors too quickly, that means you wouldn't have earned enough points to rank up.  Instead, you would rank down for being TOO GOOD. Same with being a survivor, if you escape too quickly, you'll rank down from not earning enough points.  Also, points are needed to level up and gain new skills.\n\nSo a work around that I've discovered, is as a killer, I can kill three of the survivors and then team up with the last remaining survivor, granted they're smart enough to figure out my intentions.  I will pick up a survivor, carry them to the generator and let them wiggle free.  Then they can start repairing the generator and I'll grab him while repairing to gain more points.  After I max my grab points, I'll play a game of hide and seek (suvivor found and chase points) where I'll run away from the suvivor while they're repairing and run back towards them.  After they're done with that generator, I'll then lay down traps (as the trapper) and they'll walk into it, get caught, I'll pick them up, and off to the next generator we go!\n\nAnd all the while the suvivor will get repair points, skill check points, and boldness points from me being their friend.  After we're done repairing all the generators, I'll carry them to the exit gate and let them repair it and escape through the gates.  And everytime, a tear drips from my deformed eyes as I wave my machete good bye to my new found friend.\n\nThis is how you can farm points.  Both the killer and suvivor can both get up to 20,000 points a game by doing this.\n\nSo instead of being a suvival horror game, it becomes a game about a boy/girl and his/her misunderstood monster friend.\n\nThe current ranking/point system defeats the concept of the game.  Instead of playing a game of cat and mouse, hunter and prey, killer and victim, it's much more efficient in terms of ranking/leveling up to work together to farm points.  This ruins the fun of the game.  Playing the game the way it was meant to be played is just too inefficient.  It would take forever to get enough points to level up, and you'll be stuck at the lowest rank forever.\n\nThe upside; however, is that you can still rank up/level up even if you lose the match provided you gained enough points.  But if you lost the match, you probably didn't get enough points to rank up/level up anyways.","timestamp_created":1467776128,"timestamp_updated":1467776302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24125155","author":{"steamid":"76561198188554718","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":37138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2361,"last_played":1652144732},"language":"english","review":"Nice game, i love it.
