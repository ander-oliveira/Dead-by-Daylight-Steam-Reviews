Most of the player community are great but of course every online multiplayer game has its campers (yes killers, i'm looking at you), annoying twats etc.. but overall this games style of play promotes teamwork and rewards it.

I made a group of friends through their communities, and we had fun -- for a time. The longer we played, the worse things got. Game-breaking bugs, server-side latency, the devs refusal to fix things in the game to make it playable and instead focus on making things more graphically appealing. Not to mention the toxic community on both sides of the fence.\n\nIn my experience, the game only keeps getting worse. The devs' response to all the hateful words in post-game chat was to slap a filter on it and call it a day. Reports don't get looked at or taken seriously. (They're supposedly adding an auto-ban function, but we'll see how long that lasts.) Intentionally DC'ing is a reportable action, yet they allowed it in their own tournament and called it \"strategy.\" The same \"strategy\" that now allows killers to tunnel and camp survivors, making it so they can't even play most games. And these sorts of behaviors only get worse during events, including the game's anniversary events.\n\nPlay survivor and get toxic killers. Windows and pallets never work.\nPlay killer and get toxic survivors. Windows and pallets work as intended and you get screwed over.\nGame still has latency and hit-detection problems. Getting hit by attacks around and sometimes even through walls.\nTry to update the game and have to verify files multiple times before it finally updates. Fresh install? Same thing.\n\nThis game has given me an insurmountable level of stress and anger. I'm glad for the friends that I made through it; but nothing brought me more joy than hitting that uninstall button for the last time, as we've all moved on to a new game.","timestamp_created":1603242603,"timestamp_updated":1625779474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522256255149841309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77897530","author":{"steamid":"76561199037069763","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":53499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1277,"playtime_at_review":6990,"last_played":1660531830},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game it may have taken over my life ahahaha","timestamp_created":1603242003,"timestamp_updated":1603242003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77897419","author":{"steamid":"76561198444000734","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4652,"last_played":1639288812},"language":"english","review":"this game is broken, unbalanced, full of toxic players, and rife with cheaters\n\n10/10 its a fucking blast","timestamp_created":1603241788,"timestamp_updated":1603241788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77897387","author":{"steamid":"76561198116775802","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":74831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16507,"last_played":1659316950},"language":"spanish","review":"Unas mecánicas impecables, mucho trabajo del equipo de Behaviour mejorando cosas todo el tiempo.
