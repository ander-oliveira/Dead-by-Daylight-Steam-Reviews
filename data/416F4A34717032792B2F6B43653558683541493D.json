I mainly play as Killer, and it really is a lot of fun tracking down pesky Survivors. Basically, Survivors try to fix generators, and Killers try to hunt them down and put them on meat hooks. 3 hooks and you're out (read: sacrificed to The Entity)! The game uses a \"states\" formula. A Survivor starts in a healthy state. They get hit once and they become wounded. Wounded Survivors leave blood you can follow and they moan in pain periodically so you can track them down if they give you the slip. If you hit them while they are wounded, they go into a dying state, which puts them on the ground. From the dying state, you can grab them off the ground and put them on the hook. Its worth noting that Survivors have some means of healing themselves from the wounded state, and further limited means of healing from the dying. When a Survivor is hooked, the killer usually wants to patrol around to make sure the other Survivors aren't fixing generators. If a Survivor is unhooked by another Survivor, they are returned to the wounded state. It is a simple and effective formula that has certainly kept me coming back.\n\nThere are a bunch of really cool maps that have some procedurally elements to keep things fresh. The Killers and Survivors all have special features that can suit a variety of different play styles.\n\nAbout the community:\n\nSometimes people talk about the community being toxic. It almost steered me away, but to be honest, my experience as a new player has been quite pleasant! Maybe get tea bagged at gate if they beat you... still every good killer knows that their boastfulness will be their downfall in a future game! I'd imagine the toxicity can ramp up as you achieve higher ranks, but at least by then you'll know what you're doing, so definitely don't be afraid to jump in!\n\nProgression:\n\nAnother thing people touch on is \"the grind\". Killers and Survivors have \"perks\" that can augment their gameplay. Naturally, some perks are better than others. Many highly sought after perks are exclusive to a specific Killer or Survivor...at first. Generally speaking, you can unlock other characters' perks for general use if you level the character up enough. It takes some time for sure, and its not the most elegant method of progression. Still, I often find myself looking into each Killers' perks trying to decide which ones I should focus on trying to get next. I think it gives you something to play for, even if it is a bit daunting. \n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game. There's enough meat there to get competitive about it if you're all about that. I don't personally take the 1v4 formula seriously on a competitive level, and thats exactly why I like this game so much. You can have fun playing in a semi-competitive format, and truthfully, there's enough meat there if you really do wanna get competitive.\n\nGive it a shot!!!\n","timestamp_created":1623366144,"timestamp_updated":1623852552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93537596","author":{"steamid":"76561199129704068","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":147,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1660448060},"language":"brazilian","review":"A","timestamp_created":1623365103,"timestamp_updated":1623365103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93537122","author":{"steamid":"76561198885942427","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":58,"playtime_at_review":5679,"last_played":1660580868},"language":"russian","review":"Классная игра!

Never boring, and so much to do. With new major content released bi-monthly. I do have to say that matchmaking times as well as rank pairing is bs sometimes. An SWF group may wait up to 10 minutes before getting a match, The worst rank 20 could be given a lobby with a rank 1, the best. This can be very frustrating for some seeing how if it is a rank 1 killer their almost asuredly going to die first due to lack of knowledge. Or a rank 20 killer gets a rank 1 survivor, the killer may never even land a hit on that survivor when the exit gates are open. Another problem is if a player in a match has poor ping your in for a world of hurt, the killer will either lag across the map or hit you from 5 feet away, or the survivors will lag around the map or rubberband everywhere. Some of the cosmetic item prices are outrages as well. However I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror, co-op, and online multiplayer. This game truly is fun despite the mentioned flaws. I do however have recommendations for the devs if they are reading, add more gamemodes. One i have always thought would be cool is 2 killers 8 survivors, 10 gens needing to be complete, and 4 gates. Or prop hunt, survivors disguise as map assets and the killer tries to find them. If the killer hits a non player asset they are stunned as if a pallet were dropped on them. The killer can wrongfully attack up to 50 items without losing. However, all players become a new random asset after 1 minute and must move at least 200 meters away from their current location or the killer will be notified.. After 10 minutes the props win. These are just ideas and I hope we get more than play survivor play killer and kill friends. This game does seem to improve as time progresses so I do think that the future for this game will be overall better than not. Thanks for reading.","timestamp_created":1623355014,"timestamp_updated":1623355014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93531036","author":{"steamid":"76561199069209155","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":96406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":454,"playtime_at_review":70314,"last_played":1659566525},"language":"italian","review":"A new wave of hackers and lagswitcher pratically every game for me in the last 2/3 days, without counting all the bullshit bugs this game has and how the company handles this game, I suggest you to stay THE FUCK AWAY from it.","timestamp_created":1623354931,"timestamp_updated":1630089652,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93530933","author":{"steamid":"76561199087618407","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5552,"last_played":1632797631},"language":"english","review":"Good game to just hop on and play","timestamp_created":1623354787,"timestamp_updated":1623354787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93530506","author":{"steamid":"76561198066516268","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":893,"last_played":1624898912},"language":"english","review":"game good","timestamp_created":1623354179,"timestamp_updated":1623354179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93530458","author":{"steamid":"76561198973890845","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":64308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48929,"last_played":1655495357},"language":"tchinese","review":"這是我最喜歡玩的垃圾遊戲 垃圾公司 垃圾伺服器 垃圾路人隊友 菁英中心不會收的好玩遊戲\n惡靈古堡合作真香","timestamp_created":1623354116,"timestamp_updated":1623420546,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607759296894073486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93529813","author":{"steamid":"76561198008340138","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":49664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3854,"last_played":1658569941},"language":"russian","review":"Комментарии на акке стакает на изи.
