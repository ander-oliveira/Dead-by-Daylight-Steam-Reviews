Grossen und Ganzen kann ich dieses Spiel nur weiterempfehlen. Es macht Spass und ist, auch wenn mir wahrscheinlich einige Leute widersprechen werden ziemlich abwechslungsreich. Die Versprechungen auf neue Spielmodi und Charaktere werden auch eingehalten und sind nicht nur ein laues Lüftchen, was man von anderen Herstellern leider nicht behaupten kann.\n\nDas einzig nervige sind die Instabilitäten im Spiel. Oft muss ich das Spiel mehrere Male neustarten, da ich nach dem Intro nur einen schwarzen Bildschirm für länger als 10 Minuten erhalte. Meistens hilft danach auch nur ein Neustart des PCs. Die Verbindungsprobleme scheinen meiner Hinsicht nach behoben zu sein. Es war schon recht nervig, dass man öfters auf \"Spiel suchen\" klicken musste, da man immer wieder ein \"Verbindung fehlgeschlagen\" bekam. Es wird also verbessert und das sieht man sehr gerne.\n\nIch hoffe, dass \"Überlebe mit Freunden\" und \"Töte deine Freunde\" etwas verbessert wird. Meistens sucht man im Überlebensmodus mit Freunden sehr lange nach Spiele, obwohl das Spiel doch eigentlich sehr belebt sein sollte. Man sollte eigene Runden spielen können, heisst alleine als Killer rumlaufen können um den ein bisschen auszuprobieren, statt sofort ins normale Spiel zu stürzen und seinen Rang sofort zu verlieren.","timestamp_created":1474966708,"timestamp_updated":1474966708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25721704","author":{"steamid":"76561198143593135","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":80799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7919,"last_played":1655309311},"language":"thai","review":"good

game itself is great the concept is decent the nurse just got a big nerf but since I don't tend to play the killer I'll let someone else do it.\n\nMatchmatching is by far the biggest problem with the game, if you a solo player getting into a game isnt to hard for killers matches are instant for solo survivor the time varies it can get instant or it can take up to 10 minutes or so\n\nSurvive with friends is currently the most broken match making I have ever seen the way it works is you invite your friend(s) everyone readys up it searches for a game and then you get kicked marjority of the time which means you have to go reinvite all your friends all over again I've noticed that player population and pip has alot to do with this since a game cant start without a killer say one of your friends is like under rank 10 and you just got the game maybe 15-20 rank  expect a huge wait time if your friend is closer to your rank its a little bit easier.\n\nThe process of inviting friends and searching before a kick averages around 30 seconds if everyone is paying attention\na few stats listed below for 4 games (i have played more then 4 games with more or less same problem.\n\n07:04 (14 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4\t-Match Found Sucessfully\n08:21 (12 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4 -Lobby found friend kicked\n04:30 (8 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4\t-Looby found Sucessfully\n14:23 (26 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4 -Lobby Found Friend kicked (Survived with friend button bugged twice forcing friend to invite instead)\n\nGetting the game to play on your own is more recommended then with friends but there is a learning curb to get over and without having someone to teach it the game can be very hard and make you not want to play much\n\nI highly recommend staying away from this game if you are getting it to play with other people until the match making is fixed\n","timestamp_created":1474947769,"timestamp_updated":1474947769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25719643","author":{"steamid":"76561198313174592","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":222669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3130,"playtime_at_review":3992,"last_played":1660582449},"language":"koreana","review":"오래해도

It is now at it's best state since release. The developers APPEAR to be realizing what they need to do to improve the game. However, they have made shockingly terrible decisions in the past.

I fell in love with the game right away, and now maybe month later I have over 200hours of gametime in this game. \n\nI´ve played equally both killer and survivor, and leveling them up pretty equally. I like the rng in bloodweb, and getting random items. The combinations of perks and add ons really makes the gameplay interesting, and adds a twist in every single game.\n\nThe game has many qualities, like the add ons and perk combination, the bloodweb and the selection of killers and survivors. My favorites so far as a killer are hillbilly and wraith (yes you read it right), and for the survivors maybe meg and claudette (obviously). Although the pizza dwight is op in every way.lol\n\nFor negative things about the game comes to mind a few things: there are few glitches and bugs that makes the game sometimes not so much fun (f.ex the pallet stun where the killer gets stuck in the pallet), the huge grind you have to go through to get some decent perks and possible prestige levels and the somewhat wierd performance issues in certain maps and overall in the game.\n\nThere is a lot of discussion about the balance between killers and survivors, what I have noticed is that as you climb up the ranking ladder, the harder the games are. But that´s the way it should be, the better you get the better opponents you should face. Maybe the only real issue is playing as a killers against a well organized survive with friends-team with mic communication. That makes the killing much more challenging, although not impossible. I have had multible fun games both high rank and low rank games.\n\nOverall I think this game is very enjoyable and exciting at times, and if you are looking for a survival game with some grind in to it, then this is your game for sure!
