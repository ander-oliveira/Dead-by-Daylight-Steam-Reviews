I really want to like the game, but I just find the developers really struggle with the balancing of the game, and oftentimes community complaints about grievous balance issues between survivors and killer are met with overcompensation, causing the scales to tip in the other direction, and any attempts to deal with griefing/exploiting/bad sportsmanship in the game are dealt with using very band-aid type practices rather than addressing the root of the problem.\n\nYou might have read about face-camping, pallet looping, body-blocking, lag switching, etc etc. Well yes, it all exists, but even worse is that a large portion of the gamebase has grown toxic from having to deal with these issues unresolved for so long. Distrust and resentment between killer and survivors players have grown to such a stage that now you will even be called a camper or pallet looper, etc when you do no such thing. But I don't put the blame on the community; I think the issues lie with the game's poor balancing.\n\nThe final disappointment for me was seeing all the expansions that DBD are pushing out, which just adds more unbalancing bugs to the game when they really haven't resolved all the original gripes. I also really hated the movie/game tie-ins, which feel to me very much like a cash grab. I would totally believe the influencing factor behind these decisions were the publisher, Starbreeze Studios, rather than the devs, as SS had a similar model with PayDay2 where they pimped there game out with every possible tie-in they could get their hands on.\n\nIn the end, I definitely had a lot of great, adrenaline pumping games in DBD, played with a lot of amazing killers and survivors, but more games than not, my experience was rage inducing, frustrating and unsatisfying.","timestamp_created":1495638348,"timestamp_updated":1495638348,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609603345394134521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31935712","author":{"steamid":"76561198312112190","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":40654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":20440,"last_played":1660583570},"language":"german","review":"Nach fast einem Jahr macht es immer noch Spaß zu spielen, ich glaube das spricht für sich.

Unfortunately it has been ruined by a man who, by his own admission, sniffs underwear, both used and unused, all day. His partner in crime for this gruesome debacle of which a likeness has never before been seen is another man who gets second dibs on said underwear. While engaging in perverse debauchery they dream up ideas that a Pre-School Nursery class tutored by dogs and graded by the UK Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills as \"Excessively Deficient\" would take one look at and produce the large red \"Denied\" stamp before applying said stamp to the skull of these clowns.\n\nTheir idea for creating \"a Killer who will be so OP\" could not have been further from the intended had it been designed by Ben Brode himself with the exception of an extremely overpowered bugged farming tool which was patched out a week later thus making said OP pick only slightly less shit and current bottom tiered Wraith. Meanwhile they allow other killers to go with balance akin to that of a fully armed Trident Nuclear Missile versus a Shepherd armed only with a handful of leaves and a bent twig.\n\nYou'd assume that with a rival around the corner that you would be doing everything in your power to ensure that your product was top of the line, the highest grade, the best around. Instead they seem to have heavily banked on the idea that because their game is so shit it will have scared away not only the competitors of such games but also the playerbase, thus creating a self-depricating monopoly whereby the only userbase they have left are those who have not yet perfected the art of pepperoni nipples for their Deviantart pornography page.\n\nAll in all the approach to bugfixing in this game appears to be \"HAHA WHAT BUGS?!\". There is no real Anti-Cheat making it a simple case of turning off the Steam Cloud to avoid Easy Anti Cheat bans and due to the lack of dedicated servers you can only be matched with someone on the surface of the moon. Therefore making it easily the best game I have ever played. My last stream of this game broke the all time viewer record with a peak of 2 when I checked the quality of the stream with my phone and it gave me another viewer.\n\nMy Rating for this game? 10/10 would catch the turd with my mouth again.","timestamp_created":1495636899,"timestamp_updated":1495636899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31935226","author":{"steamid":"76561198360509960","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1495635073},"language":"schinese","review":"真不觉得好玩","timestamp_created":1495636066,"timestamp_updated":1495636066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31935100","author":{"steamid":"76561198353608118","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1610047096},"language":"thai","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1495635573,"timestamp_updated":1495635573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31935091","author":{"steamid":"76561198295706908","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13265,"last_played":1558468544},"language":"russian","review":"игра хорошая 200 часов поиграл но потом забанили\n","timestamp_created":1495635552,"timestamp_updated":1495635552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31934609","author":{"steamid":"76561198354042886","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11883,"last_played":1533793083},"language":"schinese","review":"超好玩，就是屠夫绕EAC卡携手该解决了！[spoiler] 屠夫这版本太强了[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1495633659,"timestamp_updated":1495633659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31934051","author":{"steamid":"76561198067521334","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":15649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8138,"last_played":1650475129},"language":"russian","review":"Игра бомба!

There are various aspects that keep it spicy like items and offerings with effects reaching from oviously too strong to not noticeable. The variety of characters and perks/addons is also steady growing to make the game more confusing and the money you can spend on the game increases expotential with the shop. Basicly there are 3 gamemode, but the third one is only unlocked when you got some friend who like to torture themselfes with you.\n\nThe gamemode number one is to play killer. There you can deside wich kind of unfair experiece you want to have, for example you can play a basicly very weak killer without a remarkable ability to get rewarded very low in comparision to your reward when you are playing a killer who can use a slightly limited speedhack to hunt people down. The best thing is the variety of strong and weak abilities wich got also a steady loss of differences to each other the more killers release and arbitrary nerfes or buffs wich doesnt improve the balancing keep the playstyle optimization on specific caracters a never ending story. Additionaly to the choice of power you want your killer to have without addons you can of course still use addons and offerings wich can decide the game before it begins on almost every killer. Dont be afraid that you would need to read all of the textboxes popping up hovering over brown poop just click on the colours green, purple and red while choosing them. \n\nThe second class or better called the primate class is playing survivor by clicking on find a match while there are still 3 black guys with a plus standing next to them because they are friendless mobbing victims searching for another groub of bullies killing them.\n\nThe third one getting unlocked beeing socialized with people who like to tryhard without getting rewarded for it, is the one the game was balanced for, if you are good at lying to yourself. You can look forward to play against killers who decided to play a weak killer and collect rusian quality salt from kids, or offer some salt to people who like to play strong killers optimal by clicking on their red stuff in the offering or the addon selection. However the afterchat looks like, you are right because your friends will agree with anything you say, to show the killer that he isnt liked by the people he killed or tried to kill and even when the match was fun for everyone you can still make sure that the afterchat is salty enough to leave by writing ez and learn to play because this is the only right way to behave when you are anonym. Items addons and offerings are just things to fill the survivor bloodweb, so dont mind losing them because they worth as much as they do after all, wich isnt much even when they are surrounded by the beautifull colours green purple and red.\n\nIf you want to have all perks and caracters you just have to spend additionaly about 50€ now and 7€ every quarter year. Of course you can still spend the rest of your life farming shards to buy some caracters but this requires a lot of self hatred and there are still caracters you will need to pay for to play them because this game isnt pay to win and doesnt want to bait you into spending more money at all.\n\nSuming up I can say that the game is \"10/01\" if you read the actuall ratenumber backwards because this game is really facing a bright future with the very bright devs from behavior studios using the potential their game has as good as brasilia uses its rainforest and I totaly respect Cote Mathieu's big brain being the [strike]game director[/strike] [b]president[/b] of dbd.","timestamp_created":1495564611,"timestamp_updated":1586798176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502830326557159424","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31922134","author":{"steamid":"76561197996452207","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1968,"last_played":1538229795},"language":"italian","review":"Idea veramente bella, gioco MOLTO emozionante e per una grande percentuale dipendente dalla skill del player e della squadra, MA...:\n1. certi killer sono troppo OP rispetto ad altri;\n2.

Muy entretenido tanto jugando solo como con amigos...no se puede decir lo mismo de todos los juegos. Me encanta las mecánicas y la forma en la que esta hecho este juego. Es genial que tanto el asesino como los supervivientes sean personas y no llevamos por la maquina. Esto mete un componente de aleatoriedad y de sentir que todo puede cambiar en un segundo maravilloso. \n\nTiene sus fallos por supuesto. Uno de ellos son los bugs que aparecen y pueden arruinarte partidas. También que a veces el lobby se hace infinito y los desequilibrios que tienen algunos personajes. Pero el equipo desarrollador parece que se esta poniendo las pilas para arreglarlo todo.\n\nUn gran acierto incluir como asesino a Michael Myers, ya que trae recuerdos de sus películas y es genial. También me parece muy acertado el dlc gratuito del  Left 4 Dead, magnifico ese Bill y la ropa.\n\nEspero que continúen como hasta ahora y sigan sumando jugadores.\n\nOs dejo un enlace sobre mi análisis de este juego en youtube por si os interesa.

   玩了2月有余的黎明杀机，对我而言，是一个战胜自我恐惧的过程。\n    当我初次接触的时候，很恐惧屠夫和心跳，听到心跳就很害怕一直跑啊跑，尽量远离恐怖的屠夫，因为我知道我被屠夫追到的下场就是被挂到钩子上或是倒地流血而死甚至被处决。被挂起来的感觉就像是屠夫在炫耀自己的战利品一样。\n    我认为除了被处决的镜头之外，最恐怖的体验莫过于躲在衣柜胆战心惊的等待屠夫放弃寻找潜在的逃生者的时候，被屠夫从衣柜揪出来的绝望感觉了，直接上钩！\n    玩着玩着，这种恐惧感变得熟悉而麻木，通过自身的思考和队友的交流，应对屠夫的逃跑方法的也渐渐掌握。当然，修理发电机反应速度、技能检验的成功率也是处理的很好了。帮助队友逃生的一些方法和救人时机也掌握了一些技巧。对恐惧情绪的应对有了很大进步。\n    对这个游戏没有那么大的恐惧的时候，就是战胜了自己情绪的关键。知晓自己的目标和行为目的。通过积累的血点，得到一些有用的逃生者技能，对地图的熟悉以及一些关键地形，板子和窗户的记忆和逃跑路线的摸索看红光等等技巧，就能很从容地修理发电机，溜鬼，救人等等。为自己或者队友争取最大的逃生几率。从而“逃出生天”！哈哈！\n    个人不太擅长屠夫，因为听到惨叫个人感觉自己太残忍了...无冤无仇不忍心在游戏里杀死别人，大部分最后故意地道放走一个，（遇到人皇的时候也是会抓不到很烦恼233），我不太符合这个游戏屠夫该有的心理特点，也没有在全部献祭之后特别的成就感和快感。\n    PS:不得不说一些超近距离贴脸守尸的玩法（个人感觉很无耻，也暴露了屠夫的游戏能力不自信的特点），bug，各类外挂，脚本，刷血点，屠夫不充当屠夫角色为了个人意愿反而与逃生者PY交易影响恐怖游戏体验等等让人游戏体验超差的行为。官方打击力度应该加大。\n      总之，希望杀机越来越好！\n      如果你想体验像恐怖电影里那种的追逐与刺激，这款游戏是个不错的选择！（有多种屠夫供你“消遣”）\n","timestamp_created":1495504096,"timestamp_updated":1495504096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31910326","author":{"steamid":"76561198344378830","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8356,"last_played":1657458168},"language":"schinese","review":"少有的照顾中国玩家的游戏","timestamp_created":1495501181,"timestamp_updated":1495501181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31909285","author":{"steamid":"76561198292530250","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1068,"last_played":1627528847},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo
