Теперь ты заходишь в игру с рандомами и все сразу умирают... Механики игры сломаны... Явный перекос в сторону маньяков, которые еще и токсят...\n\nПомимо этого в игре много читеров и багаюзеров.\nКогда выжившие говорят разработчикам, что маньяки используют читы, то это жестко игнорится с единственным аргументом \"Вы не умеете играть\". Заходишь играть за мана, все сразу висят на крюках (За маньяка так тяжело играть, что идут победа за победой).\n\nМаньяки выходят из игры, когда понимают, что начинают проигрывать и за это их не наказывают.\n\nСправедливости ради подмечу, что в игру уже давно были добавлены собственные серверы, так что, если маньяк подрубит торрент/лагсвитчер, то лагать игра будет только у него (За это спасибо, это улучшило игру)\n\nКемперство - это спорный момент игры. С одной стороны ничего особо страшного нет. Но против некоторых маньяков играть в таких условиях невозможно (Кожаное лицо может всех положить возле крюка. Ведьма может телепортироваться и сразу начать преследовать раненного выжившего, снятого с крюка).\nС другой стороны, если взять \"Спринт\", то проблем не будет (Если вы не в подвале, конечно).\n\nИгру за маньяка найти тяжело, т.к. за выживших играет мало людей (За убийцу легко фармить очки). Уже этого достаточно, чтобы понять, что баланс сильно перекошен в сторону манов.\n\nВсе это началось, когда ввели \"Общие очки крови\" для выживших и маньяков (Теперь не нужно играть за выживших, чтобы их прокачивать. Достаточно играть за маньяка и тратить очки на сурвов. При условии, что все убийцы прокачаны, т.к. за них играть легче)\n\nКак уже говорил, покупать игру не советую, а если уже купили, то не надо донатить, даже если вам понравился какой-то скин.\n\nP.s То, что разрабы сделали отдельные серверы, не избавляет от читеров...\nВХ никто не отменял (Для этого никуда подключаться не надо, ведь персонажи подгружены в твою игру на твоем компьютере)\nС ударами сквозь стены не ясно, скорее всего очередной баг, но это не точно.\nВидел, как маньяки сквозь стены проходят (Такое, к счастью, стало редкостью)\n\nКороче в игре надо еще править баланс, а не слушать маньяков, которые уже поняли, что \"Можно пожаловаться и нам сделают игру легче\".\nРазработчики сказали, что это игра про \"Безжалостного убийцу, а значит его должны бояться\"... Я с этим не согласен... Эта игра \"Матч 4 против 1\", так значит она и должна быть сбалансирована как матч.\n\nВпрочем сейчас разработчики немного поумнели))\nЭто связано с игрой Deathgarden™: BLOODHARVEST))\nРазработчики построили ее, как DbD, но убийцу сделали имбой))\nВ результату люди бросили игру ;)\nПосле этого разрабы поняли, что также будет и с DbD, если они начнут мудить с нерфом сурвов ;)\nА теперь игра вообще не запускается из-за ошибок...","timestamp_created":1539561982,"timestamp_updated":1634157970,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529195249080657959","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45274412","author":{"steamid":"76561198360329923","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":46813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13859,"last_played":1658896151},"language":"english","review":"Yes.

For a few reasons. To keep things fair I will start with the positives of the game before going into the negatives of the game. Here was my brief list of things for both.\n\nPositives:\n\nConcept\nCharacters\nOverall Performance\n\nThe game's concept is actually really cool and I love the idea of survival horror genres with some flare. The developers did really well there. The characters both survivor and killer and actually reall fun too! Like they had something going here. The game mechanics make sense. Everything should be working out..but it's not.\n\nNegatives:\n\nBalance Of Killers Vs Survivors\nPerks\nCommunity\nPlayers\nGame Pyschology \nEtc.\n\n\nDBD is a really fun game!....if you can get past the toxic feeling you get as soon as you join a lobby. The games themselves can be pretty fun, but since recent updates and the new wave of players coming in it's gotten...rough. Killers have been overbalanced making the whole idea of survival through teamwork really not that likely. I see in about 90% of my games teammates leaving others to die so that they can leave, sad truth is you cannot really blame them half the time. Killers have perks now that make your death VERY likely. You can be seen from anywhere on the map, you can be one hit downed constantly, you can be sniped or teleport swiped, or the good old face campers and \"patrol\" campers that keep you from being saved ever. Basically what I'm saying is, if you play this game as survivor, you better be prepared to lose. I don't mean the game oh no...I mean lose a vital part of what makes you a decent human being. Or simply your will to live which ever one you lose first. I dont recommend this game to anyone who is as I said before, not a good loser, because that's about all you can be the way the game is. Buy the game if you'd like to, just don't be surprised if you feel awful while playing. Right now the killers or boosted.... then they'll probably boost survivors too much again.

I have spent so many hours with playing the game, leveling up my characters and having fun. No matter how hard or unfair a game was, it was still kind of fun.\n\nHowever, I do think that the game developers have made some crucial decisions when it comes to the characters' abilities and perks (survivors as well as killers). I truly can not enjoy this game without friends anymore, as making callouts is impossible when playing with randoms as a survivor. Crucial survivor's perks have been nerfed and have become totally useless. However, a lot of the killer's perks are still as powerful or even more than ever. This makes the game less fun. Being able to insta down someone or insta kill. Whereas, the ability to stab the killer in order to get down and run away was totally destroyed. The same goes for some toolbox add ons - totally useless.\nI do think that the balance between survivors and killers needs to be redone and the game is only palyable with a group of friends. \nAnother problem is the penalty for survivors leaving the game earlier. There are many reasons why people leave the game. Being harassed by the killer is one of them. I do feel that there are way too many penalties for the survivor (also when it comes to perks - because nerfs) and  it should not be punished when you are not in the mood to waste ur time with getting hit over and over again by the killer while you are on the hook.

Don't get me wrong, I think Dead by daylight has potential. It has the right materials and ideas to be a great piece of work. Its basic concept is a gruesome twist on the classic hide-and-seek mixed with pvp which, on paper, should be great! It's sad, however, that all these ingredients are in the hands of incompetents. Developers, keen on pushing their scrap-pile behemoth towards glorious disaster that will happen sooner or later. \n\nFirst of all, this game is past 4.0 yet interestingly it has nothing to back up the claim that has come this far. One could expect a game to be this volatile before 1.0 but no, these devs think that adding another thot t-shirt to the women and another twitch mustache to Dwight automatically proves the game is evolving. That it is improving. It is not, if you are too daft to read between the lines. But don’t worry, you can be sure the devs keep adding more and more dead-weight to this already suffocating whale, flaunting their inability to make something proper out of their child. \n\nMatchmaking is a mess they will, most likely, never solve. Playing as the killer starts off laughably easy. And then, just when you think you know how to play the game, you reach the rank where survivors bully you like schoolyard delinquents. If one has any PTSD from such matters, this game will take you right back down memory lane. Playing as a survivor is slightly better, but not a whole lot. You will go through the same experience but from the other end, until killers will literally plow your booty-short ridden arse to tartarus and back with a top-tir-manga-painted spirit with a sword.This is inevitable, because your skill is not judged based on how good you are but how long you have played. It will get incredibly hard very fast for you. Have fun.\n\nThere are so many perks and killers in this game, yet 70-80 percent of them are useless when you eventually cross the line between the trench and hell. You see, the devs might change them a little from time to time but they actually never try to change the game. The game is always the same. If you try to opt for a different playstyle, as in stealth, you will lose. It is all about speed and stress. Trust me. The devs apparently decided that they wanted the nature of the game to evolve itself so they did not have to do any work. Common biology folks, coevolution between the cheetah and the gazelle if you will, and the problem with that should be apparent. There is only one way to play if you want to win. Unless you never get past that line purposefully by playing like shit ever second game. Does that sound fun? Does that sound diverse and balanced? No. There is no real fun to be had if you are competitive here. \n\nHackers are not punished, playing toxic is the raw essence of this game and the devs constantly re-break the game with every update because their code is literally a heap of stitched-together garbage. One that, for some reason, will hog a third of your entire disk if you install it. And they keep adding more. Again, nothing new here. No real change in gameplay or different, fun modes to play if you are looking for a more casual experience. They give you belly-shorts. And hats.\n\nThe real killers are not those who roll in with NOED or devour hope. The creators are the real killers of their own creation.\n\nI have given this game time and hope it will improve, but it will not. I have been naive, but what else can you expect when you entrust an amazing concept to a bunch of chair-flinging monkeys.\n\nWould rate 1/10 again, will still rate it 1/10 until the end of time. And since this game will never change I see no reason to update this review in the future.

It's not 'horror', not by a long shot (unless you're like me and set off every single blasted Hag trap while being chased), but I personally find my heart rate increase whenever the Killer is nearby or chasing me. It's a fun casual game, too many people take it way too seriously and the community might as well should be comprised of spoiled middle-school brats but that's to be expected in almost every game nowadays (sadly).\n\nSecond: Though I do recommend this game, I do so with a stipulation: if you're like me and primarily enjoy playing as Killers you're going to be in for a world of hurt. Killers right now are pathetic, only a select few (Nurse and Hillbilly primarily) are strong while the rest are mediocre or absolutely terrible (Freddy). Survivors are ridiculously strong, though the latest patch (as of the time of typing this) may be a slight nerf to them. Decisive Strike is a great perk to piss off your Killer and force the match to end immediately, robbing everyone of potentially more Bloodpoints (it's a perk that allows you to stab the Killer once, if timed correctly, and escape his/her grasp). I could rant more about Survivors have far too many crutches, and Killers being bullied, but this isn't the place for that. Just know that if you intend to play Killers, have plenty of Advil nearby.\n\nThird: Don't expect long, drawn out matches. This could be a pro for some and a con to others, but with Gen Rushing being a long-standing issue (even with Hex: Ruin) if you're not playing a Killer with some form of mobility or map pressure you might as well should stand in a corner. This also limits the roster, sadly.\n\nFourth: Speaking of, the roster isn't entirely free. DLC will be required if you want to own everyone, but that's only true for licensed Killers/Survivors such as Freddy, Leatherface, Meyers, etc. The 'originals', such as the Clown, Spirit, Hag, (etc) can be unlocked for free in game with Shards (which are obtained by leveling up your account) alongside their Survivor counterparts. However, the Shard price for each is steep so the grind will be pretty steep. I personally just bought all the DLC since the base game is already so cheap and the DLC isn't much. $52.92 for every Killer/Survivor may seem like much but when you combine it with the base price it's only slightly higher than a typical $60 game you'd find elsewhere. Lets also not forget that Steam Sales are a thing and the devs do have Bloodpoint events where the game and all DLC is 30% off. If you intend to grind and only buy the licensed content the total is far cheaper at $24.96. Your call, just making this clear for all newcomers (and of course that $24.96 is even cheaper when the Steam sale/Bloodpoints event is active). I will end this section by pointing out the best Killer in game comes completely free with the base game and unlocked (Nurse) so you technically don't need to worry about having the 'best' money-gated though she is the hardest to play and master.\n\nFinally: All in all it's a solid game with typical balance issues you'll find in almost any other PvP-styled game. It's fun, I personally love running around with the Doctor and just shocking everyone, chasing and breaking things for Bloodpoint farming. Everyone usually walks away happy and with around 15-20k without any Offering boosts. Survive With Friends is broken and I sympathize with any and all Killers having to deal with that crap but if you're looking for a fun 1v4 'horror themed' game give it a shot. Worst case scenario you can refund (DLC cannot be refunded as far as I'm aware, just a heads up).","timestamp_created":1539496054,"timestamp_updated":1539496054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488372087478637695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45259931","author":{"steamid":"76561198041599961","num_games_owned":668,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1624,"last_played":1657165888},"language":"english","review":"sucks","timestamp_created":1539493927,"timestamp_updated":1539493927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45259790","author":{"steamid":"76561198006189771","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":53607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":118,"playtime_at_review":25019,"last_played":1660561913},"language":"english","review":"Bad Server.

Interactive之手，在此之前他们的游戏作品大多是一些不怎么出名的小游戏。他们在《黎明杀机》大火之后，对这款游戏也倾注了许多心血。说实在的，作为一家小厂，Behaviour Interactive是我见过的为数不多的良心厂商。\n最为国人津津乐道的，应该是在2016年承诺的“中国特点”屠夫一事。当初《黎明杀机》在国内热度极高，游戏在国区也获得了大好销量与优秀口碑，为了回馈中国玩家，制作组决定让中国玩家投票制作一个具有中国特点的屠夫，当时网友们半带戏谑的选择了某中心某杨姓教授，但是出于种种原因，这个承诺迟迟没有兑现。当大家都将其付之笑谈的时候，制作组却推出了《疯狂的电火花》这一DLC，新屠夫是一个使用电击疗法的医生，这一形象影射的是谁大家也都心知肚明。而新逃生者的上衣上有着一个“玖”字，以此来纪念在此过程中付出了大量心血的志愿者。\n《黎明杀机》在发行之后，得到了国内外许多主播的喜爱，其中技术过硬的主播更是得到了官方的认可，官方为其制作了其特制的皮肤外观。在去年8月，他们联系国内外多位主播，在征得他们的同意的情况下，推出了26件结合了主播造型的皮肤，这个皮肤合集DLC被命名为慈善包，因为所有慈善包的所得将会捐献给Brain & Behavior Research Foundation，一间致力于精神疾病的研究与治疗的非营利组织。\n最令恐怖游戏与恐怖片爱好者惊喜的，应当是《黎明杀机》与众多经典恐怖电影版权方取得了联系，将众多经典杀手角色添加进入了游戏里，在已有的DLC中，已经有了迈克尔麦尔斯、梦魇弗莱迪、门徒阿曼达、人皮脸电锯等多位版权角色，其特有的技能与能力也都与其电影有着千丝万缕的联系。在以后的游戏更新中，我们肯定也会遇到更多熟悉的面孔。我期待着相见，期待着惊喜。\n只要是PVP游戏，总会存在着平衡性问题，作为非对称性对抗游戏，平衡性更是游戏性的重要保障。在前一小段时间，由于制作组改动了疲劳状态的机制，导致逃生者重要技能“弹射起步”、“钢筋铁骨”、“平稳着陆”等等都遭到削弱。这一改动使得国内众多玩家对其不满。不过在下一版本中，制作组又削弱了屠夫的杀戮机制、改善逃生者脱钩动画等，使得人类在那一版本又有小幅增强。其实我相信，制作组在考虑平衡的时候会有自己的想法，某一版本总会是某一方略占优势，我们不必大动干戈，真正热爱这个游戏的玩家更不会因此退坑。而非对称性对抗游戏的平衡性问题，着实也还有很长的一条路要走。\n\n非对称性对抗游戏\n\n《黎明杀机》大概算是近几年来非对称性对抗游戏的典范之作了吧，前有《白噪2》（White noise 2），后有《灵魂筹码》（Soul at Stake）,还有隔壁《十三号星期五》（Friday the 13th），以及最近的《去年：梦魇》（Last Year: The Nightmare），非对称性对抗游戏的风潮，到现在仍被延续着。\n在《黎明杀机》刚发行的时候，由于这种游戏类型与游戏风格十分适合直播，当初在主播带动下，迅速在国内爆火，玩家数量激增。而由于其血腥暴力等元素，《黎明杀机》的直播不久便被叫停，这对于国内刚有苗头的“杀鸡”风无疑是一记当头棒喝。即使如此，《黎明杀机》的同时在线人数在前不久依然能够排到steam前十，这足以证明这类游戏有着它特有的吸引力，《黎明杀机》的热度或许会下降，但是非对称性对抗游戏依旧有着迷人之处。\n\n热爱\n\n我喜欢穿行在废弃车库、迈克米伦庄园、春木镇和哈登菲尔德，我喜欢遇见那几张让我害怕但让我喜爱的面孔。在《黎明杀机》中度过的这段时间，虽然有过被嘲讽的恼怒，有过被守尸的无奈，但是在农场度过的这两年，着实是我十分开心的两年。\n大家，雾中见。","timestamp_created":1539487075,"timestamp_updated":1638554287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":98,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.889333665370941162","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45258480","author":{"steamid":"76561198065932202","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1456,"last_played":1514854200},"language":"english","review":"You're
