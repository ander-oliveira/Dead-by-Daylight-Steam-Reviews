Unfortunately, it is managed by one of the worst and most incompetent game design and developer teams in the gaming industry. Every new update brings hundreds of bugs that take upwards of a year to fix. The game is horribly unbalanced and rather than spending some time to fix balancing and meta issues, they continue to release new killers and perks with hundreds of new bugs and band-aid fixes for fundamental problems. We continue to receive new paid content, delivered as killers, survivors, and skins, but have yet to receive clear answers from the team for how they will fix problems or any actual fixes. I clearly have a lot of hours in this game, and I truly want to enjoy it, but I have decided to quit following a recent developer Q&A. This session made it abundantly clear that the game design and development team either do not understand their own game or do not care enough to fix it. For example, one of the weakest killers in the game, The Twins, were shown to have a pickrate just above 1%, and yet when asked about a buff, it was stated that The Twins \"are a monster at high MMR and don't need a buff.\" I fail to understand how basing entire balancing decisions around high MMR is good for the health of the game, especially when, as exemplified during the Q&A, the MMR system does not actually work. Too many of their answers for fundamental gameplay and balancing issues is that the fix is too difficult or not needed, which is ridiculous. Their reasoning for not adding a search bar for perks is because it will \"ruin the flow of perk selecting.\" What does that even mean? This game either needs to be handed over to another development team that actually cares enough to fix it or just needs to be shut down.\n\nEDIT (1): There is currently a game-breaking bug in which running 2 perks together causes you to be able to see the killer's aura permanently throughout the match. The forum moderators deleted the forum post about it and now the subreddit moderators have prevented any posts about the exploit. While this exploit may not be an easy fix, neither of these perks have been disabled and the exploit is still present in the game a few days later. Furthermore, if you run one of these two perks with a third separate perk, it causes console players to crash. This is absolutely unacceptable in a multiplayer game.

I have over 3000 hours on this game and have been playing it since the very start and over the years, I have played a lot of survivor and killer alike - let's say that approximately 60% of my playtime was spent playing survivor (both soloQ and SWF) and the oher 40% was spent on playing the killer role. In other words, you can't just accuse me of being a \"salty\" survivor main, since it wouldn't be accurate. I have never thought that I would have to give the game I have loved for so long a  \"Not Recommended\" review, but unfortunately, here we are. This review is bound to be a little longer, so if you are interested in the shorter version/summary or just don't have time, please scroll to the end.\n\nIn its current state, I can't in good conscience recommend this game to you, unless you are certain from the very start that you are mainly going to play killer and not care about the survivor role at all OR if you plan to always play the game with a group of friends in SWF - Survive with Friends. \n\n\"Why?\" You must now be asking, well it is thanks to the new patch, I believe that it must be the biggest patch BVHR (devs) has done so far - patch 6.1.0. and it, first of all, brought a lot of very nice changes to the very stale perk meta and unfortunately, some very undesirable changes as well. \nSecondly, changes were made to change the core gameplay of the game, such as the main objective of the survivor side, repairing generators, now taking longer to complete and in general, the killer role was buffed significantly.\n\nTo explain why this buff isn't such an amazing thing, as one might think at first glance, let's have a little look at the historical \"power ranking\" of the roles of the game. The roles mentioned here will be SWF - Survive with Friends, Solo/Duo survivor role and the killer role. At the very start, the game was in general insanely survivor sided and there was a huge canyon between the strength of the survivor role, both SWF and Solo/Duo, and the killer side. Logically, devs have over the years tried to do a lot to help the killer side to overcome this vast difference and till patch 6.1.0, an obvious tendency, with which we could clearly determine the strength of each role, could be seen: SWF role still had the biggest advantage and the killer players had to try their best to even keep up with a somewhat capable SWF group. In the meanwhile, however, the Solo/Duo role has been weakened to such an extent, that the killer side, if played at least somewhat capably, got an upper hand and got into an advantageous position in comparison to the Solo/Duo survivor role.\n\nWhen we now finally move to the era of patch 6.1.0, where the killer role now probably got the biggest buff of the game's history, new, but still, quite obvious tendencies can be seen - the killer role is now able to compete with SWF groups more than ever before and while that by itself might not be a necessarily bad thing, the Solo/Duo survivor role now absolutely suffers from the new changes and is put at an all-time worst position, the killer role now has an even bigger advantage over the Solo/Duo survivor role. This isn't too hard to see as someone who has played and regularly plays all \"3\" roles. \n\nI have already mentioned how the changes of the core gameplay and perk changes buffed the killer role significantly and have made the Solo/Duo much weaker in comparison, but there is one more thing that seems off and strange in patch 6.1.0 and I have noticed it in basically every single game I have played on the patch 6.1.0 so far - the matchmaking and MMR seems to be currently broken somehow and it is the singular thing that makes me the most upset about this whole patch. Before I do so, please note that my Solo/Duo escape rate was around 80-85% before the release of patch 6.1.0 and therefore my MMR definitely wasn't low.\n\nIn my personal experience, in every match that I have played on the game version 6.1.0, it seemed like some kind of RNG machine decided who my survivor teammates are going to be, regardless of whether I escaped the match or not. My teammate could be a brand new player with 10 hours on the game or someone with 500 hours, which is a vast difference and the MMR would obviously be different, but the game, in my personal experience, doesn't seem to differentiate that at all. As is known, the longer you wait for a match after some amount of time, the MMR range of players you would be matched with changes to find you a match so you literally don't wait forever - but I am getting these lobbies with players who shouldn't even be in the same lobby after few seconds.  You can be almost sure, that when BVHR eventually decides to fix this issue (if they even fix it), they will not talk about it in the patch notes, since they are so proud of their \"magnificent\" matchmaking system. This issue also obviously doesn't help the Solo/Duo role at all.\n\nAll these things combined together make the current Solo/Duo experience genuinely unfun and frustrating not only for me, and I believe that I have grown quite the \"thick skin\" over all the years of playing this game, but also for many other people.\n\nThe short version/Summary:\nIf you want to start playing the game in its current state or if you just want to return to playing it after a while, I highly recommend you to play killer or play survivor with a group of friends, but I, once again, can't in good conscience recommend you this game in its current version if you wish to play survivor alone or with just one other friend - Solo/Duo. The current experience for this role is very stressful and frustrating (even more than before) and that is true even if you are able to play VERY well, the simple old \"git gut\" just isn't really possible anymore.  If you still wish to play this role and have fun, I can only recommend you to grow a thick skin. Note, however, that even if you do grow a thick skin, you may still get very frustrated by the current game state.\n\nThe current game state is currently overall not in a good spot and unless this game actually wants to lose a lot of players each month once again, more changes must be made. The patch 6.1.0 was a step in a good direction with good intentions since devs finally weren't afraid to change a lot of things, however,  it definitely wasn't a patch that would just \"fix\" the game and new problems have arisen, particularly the tragic state of the current Solo/Duo survivor experience. For a game to function, one of its roles, which is equally as important as the others, can't be left in a butchered state for too long.\n\nIt pains me a little that I have to give a game that I love and spent a lot of time on a \"Not Recommended\" review, but I don't wish to misdirect anyone and so here is the review of the current version of the game.\n\nThank you for reading my review and I wish you a wonderful day.","timestamp_created":1643217223,"timestamp_updated":1658591136,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108827921","author":{"steamid":"76561198253976378","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4870,"last_played":1643472666},"language":"russian","review":"–¢–æ–ø.

core game is very fun, especially if you're into asymmetrical type games or a big fan of horror pop culture.\nHowever, the developers of this game are highly incompetent, and paying attention to how they handle their game leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nSOME EXAMPLES ARE:\n\n-Completely ignoring or brushing off the critiques and suggestions of their playerbase in their Q&A's\n\n-Being so petty as to remove a streamer(Dowsey's) cosmetics because he dared criticize the state of the game and meme on the team)\n\n-An endless cycle of implementing either useless or broken perks, only to then adjust it to the opposite extreme. If not that, then allow it to stay easily abused for a while despite this situation being completely avoidable if they would just listen to the players who played the Public Test Beta.\n\n-A ridiculous lack of setting options that should be an industry standard, such as advanced audio/graphics settings that go beyond just basic low/med/high presets.\n\n-Being incredibly so out of touch with the playerbase that they continuously defend updates, despite being unanimously hated by the community, such as the SBMM update.\n\n-Ignoring long lasting bugs that have been well known for a while now (i.e. nurse blink bug)\n\n-The performance and optimization of the game seemingly getting worse and worse each patch.\n\n-The ridiculous grind of this game with the bloodweb and perk system, being more egregious than even gacha games (which are literally games designed to take your money and your time)\n\nOverall it's clear to me that the developers don't even bother playing or testing their game at all, and they possess this \"it's our game, we can do whatever we want\" mentality that really leaves the playerbase with an awful impression of them.","timestamp_created":1643214469,"timestamp_updated":1643214469,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108825196","author":{"steamid":"76561199031627942","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":81696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2072,"playtime_at_review":60007,"last_played":1660533035},"language":"english","review":"Great
