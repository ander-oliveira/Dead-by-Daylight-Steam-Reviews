Dead by daylight jest jednak dość nietypowe.\nrozgrywka jest przyjemna, zabójcy nie za bardzo, ale chyba o to chodzi co nie.\nGra posiada różnorodne postacie, wiele różnych umiejętności ułatwiających rozgrywkę jako ofiara jak i zabójca.\nMoże być dobrym sposobem na zabicie czasu ze znajomymi przy okazji :) jednak trzeba lubić to ciągle powtarzające się polowanie i naprawianie generatorów. Twórcy oferują także wiele wydarzeń podczas których można zdobyć przedmioty kosmetyczne dla postaci.

Plenty of varied ways to kit out your survivors and killers to give yourself the opportunity to play to your strengths and cover your weaknesses. Both sides of the isometric gameplay are very engaging and fun.\n\nCons: Difficulty curve for playing as a survivor can be pretty rough in the beginning, but flips on its head when playing as a killer. After all this time, Survive With Friends mode still makes the game a nightmare for killers who don't adopt cheesy and unfun strategies to combat survivors who will be far more coordinated than an ordinary group.\n\nOverall the game is very fun and relatively well-balanced, save for some issues with map layouts favoring one side over the other and some relatively useless perks that have yet to be reworked. If you're new, I strongly recommend playing as both roles to learn just how much they can see, how they move around, and how they play.","timestamp_created":1562119292,"timestamp_updated":1562119292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53275440","author":{"steamid":"76561198397978144","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14850,"last_played":1576898279},"language":"english","review":"really fun actually.","timestamp_created":1562119230,"timestamp_updated":1562119230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53275289","author":{"steamid":"76561198284455671","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":68540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1836,"playtime_at_review":45293,"last_played":1660463783},"language":"schinese","review":"人类技能职业的自由搭配，屠夫有各种buff，人类各种联攻协防。屠夫各种配件碾压。很有趣，开黑有意思。\n缺点：前期的高难度会劝退很多人。没有大佬带会痛苦。单一开电机简单而且可玩性低了。容易弃坑，没人一起的话，容易弃坑，当然也容易回坑！","timestamp_created":1562119129,"timestamp_updated":1562119129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529269754886627197","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53275192","author":{"steamid":"76561198818001332","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":221630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52856,"last_played":1658874530},"language":"english","review":"I honestly love this game. Besides ARK, this is my most played game across a couple different platforms. While there can always be that toxicity and not every killer will necessarily to be your favorite to go against--or survivor perk, either--that's in every game so don't let it scare you away. The Devs are constantly working and tweaking the game, which is more than most live, ever-evolving games can say. May seem like they don't, but they get feedback from so many people constantly that not everyone will be happy all the time; that's impossible. Along with an active Dev team, it has a solid community with so many more things coming up on the horizon.\n\nSome may not like the repetitive nature of the game, but if you're about the grind in a horror atmosphere, or if you're into asymmetical versus games, this game is for you. It's fun, with the option for meme, serious gameplay, and cool different builds (even if they aren't meta, as every game has one).\n\nBefore you give any critique or decide one way or the other how you feel, I'd say to just play both killer and survivor otherwise your view and perception will be

(often times I have played and been at rank 1 and matched with people at rank 20 and that is just a side problem) Because many games end up being so unbalanced, the toxicity between players also ends up to be a large problem.
