So many different builds and techniques you can use.

The trapdoor should be pretty easy to open realistically I would think. At least let the trapdoor become unlocked (maybe the door still closed but another player can lift it up if it is deemed too heavy to lift in a downed state) Because 1.) It is impressive to find and crawl to a trapdoor AND have a key equipped, and 2.) kinda saying that a paraplegics can't open a damn door.","timestamp_created":1512339573,"timestamp_updated":1512339573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38044590","author":{"steamid":"76561198089458555","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8689,"last_played":1577651194},"language":"russian","review":"Игра огонь,но поддержка игроков отвратительная,все друзья недовольны.","timestamp_created":1512339124,"timestamp_updated":1512339124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38044558","author":{"steamid":"76561198045326871","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":32395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2474,"last_played":1591123031},"language":"english","review":"I love this game! :D","timestamp_created":1512339002,"timestamp_updated":1512339002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38044125","author":{"steamid":"76561198095928571","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":3576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1652367885},"language":"brazilian","review":"Meio desbalanceado, e mais engraçado e extressante do que amedrontador.

The question is: is this statement true?\n\nWell,there are many things that contribute to the truth of this statement, so lets break them down by groups:\n\nMobility: Survivors and killers have different speeds from each other. Most killers, by default, have 115% running speed. This means that when running out in the open, killers can eventually gain a greater distance from where they started than a survivor could. Thing is, in most cases, survivors have a head start on killers. So lets lets say a survivor starts one meter ahead of a killer. 1/0, 2/1.15 ,3/2.3 ,4/3.35 ,5/4.5 ,6/5.65 ,7/6.8 ,8/7.95 , 9/9.10 \n\nIt would take nearly ten meters of running for a killer to catch up and pass a survivor, meaning this speed advantage isn't nearly as potent as it seems. Thing is, this is also ignoring any type of structures. This is where killer power tends to falter pretty heavily.\n\nSurvivors have three choices of speed when it comes to windows and pallets:Fast, medium,slow.\nThe first two being nearly instant and the third being the only one that doesn't make a noise. Now what do killers have? Well for windows, they only have the slow vault. They also cannot jump a pallet, as they instead have to preform an animation of destroying it and then have to walk through the debris.\n\nMaps are often full of windows and pallets, as well as general walls, lockers, rocks, ect to hide with often costing even more of the killers time by making them have to look for a survivor and allow a survivor to escape a chase, meaning more killer time wasted, which leads into the next factor.\n\nTime management: In dead by daylight, it's a race against the clock to get the objective done first in order to win. Killers is to kill the survivors, survivors is to escape. With this in mind, there is one object they both get to interact with: The generator. We all know the basic rules of dead by daylight, survivors need to complete generators in order to get closer to escape and killers need to stop those gens in order to have the time to hunt down survivors and kill them.\n\nNow a look at how the two interact with gens. When a survivor repairs a generator, they fill up a progress meter. After eighty seconds, just a lil bit over a minute, the generator is repaired and neither side can interact with it anymore. This progress is saved when a survivor stops repairing it. Killers can only interact with generators that have some repair progress, when they do,they do a damaging animation that starts the decline of the gens progress. This decline,however, is often a joke.\n\nA damaged gen only loses progress at the speed of one FOURTH of one survivor, and this regression can be easily stopped by repairing the gen for ANY amount of time. This means you can run up to a regressing gen, touch it, and it's progress will no longer go down. The only way a damaged gen can lose a lot of progression is if survivors forget about it or if the killer guards it. Problem with the latter however is that due to how slow the regression is, a survivor just about to complete a gen lets it get kicked and goes to work on another can finish that other gen and come back to the regressing one with still more than half of it's progress.\n\nSo killers have to go with another option to stop gen progress: By exerting pressure on the survivors. A survivor that's being chased can't do a gen after all, right? Well, there are several issues with that. The main issue is numbers. See, there's only one killer, which means he can only realistically chase one person at a time. Going after one person means the other three are pretty much free to do whatever so long as the person getting chased doesn't lead the killer back towards them, and even then this only stalls one/two/three people temporarily.\n\nAs a killer, you have to chase a survivor and down them in order to complete your objective. Since survivors need two hits to be downed however, this means a survivor at minimum has to make two mistakes in order to be downed, hooked, and sacrificed. This, however, is where numbers come in again. When I say a survivor has to make two mistakes at minimum, this is implying they die on their first hook. If survivors help them off the hook and don't heal them, this gives them at minimum two more mistakes, as the third hook will automatically kill them.\n\nIf survivors heal them each time they unhook them however, this gives another minimum of two more mistakes, and keep in mind, these are MINIMUMS meaning the survivors have to make a bad enough mistake that gets them hit. Thing is survivors can often make small mistakes and not really suffer too much from them, whereas because killers suffer from poor mobility and have difficulty catching up, every little mistake they make can easily end up costing them the chase, which costs them time, which can lead to them losing the game.\n\nNow to cover some common points I often get seen made when people try to defend the idea that killers are fine or overpowered.\n\n1.If gens are getting done during a chase, or a chase is going on too long, give up on it and instead exert map pressure.\n\nThis point is pretty weak for a few reasons, the main being that giving up a chase means you're wasting a lot of time. When the survivor notices that the killer has given up on going after them, that means they're free to go to a gen or something and start working on it. This also means you'll have to go through the process of finding a survivor, chasing them, and just hoping they can't avoid you as well as the last person did. Sure in some cases it could save you time, but it's a gamble and killers don't have the breathing room to do that.\n\n2. The idea of survivors doing chases and gens optimally to the degree you're describing is absurd, survivors often make enough mistakes for killers to get them, even at high ranks.\n\nWhile yes, I do often describe the worse case scenario, this is also keeping in mind that the killer against these survivors are also playing as optimally as them. Thing is, if a survivor simply doesn't make a mistake, then a killer playing just as good still won't win. The limitations a killer has prevents the impact skill has at a point. This is known as the skill ceiling, which varies killer to killer, but the only one that has a ceiling close to survivors is nurse. Nurse is the only killer with the ultimate mobility power, the mobility it gives her makes her the most powerful killer even though it doesn't give her instant-downs.\nSimply put, if survivors use their great mobility to it's limits, then killers can't get to them to knock them down.","timestamp_created":1512301004,"timestamp_updated":1577219635,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.427452564239501953","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38029748","author":{"steamid":"76561198439496911","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":98669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90912,"last_played":1615369388},"language":"koreana","review":"무서웡ㅠㅠ","timestamp_created":1512299190,"timestamp_updated":1527794784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38029627","author":{"steamid":"76561198077462136","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2319,"last_played":1541868139},"language":"polish","review":"Niezła

This is fine except for the fact that the other survivors will come unhook you because they don't give two ****s if you live or die, they just get 1500 blood points (exp) and can basically rank up after just 3 unhooks and a bit of other stuff. You on the other hand have no chance to escape and will just be hooked again, and three in a row means you're automatically dead, usually resulting in a de-rank. If the killer leaves after the game begins, you get a de-rank. If survivors leave mid game, you will most likely be slaughtered, and again, end up de-ranked. These are just some of the more apparent flaws.\n\nAs the killer, the survivors can constantly pallet stun you, run, then vault through a window numerous amounts of times because of how the map is laid out. They will sit in between a pallet and wait for you to walk in so they can stun you, and you honestly can't do anything about it. Then at the end of the game, you will most likely be called a camper for playing the game the way the mechanics allow you to play. Again, these are just some of the more apparent flaws.\n\nAnd gameplay wise, every play session is just more of the same, repairing generators by holding mouse 1 and pushing space every so often. Not much variety besides the strategies used against the different killers.\n\nIs dead by daylight a good, balanced game? No\nIs dead by daylight entertaining?

The survivors must power 5 generators which allows them to open a gate so they can escape the map and win the game. Survivors can work together, by healing each other, completing tasks faster, alerting other survivors to the killers location, getting players off hooks before they are sacrificed, and more . Survivors also can go it alone and do their own thing if they choose, however teamwork is rewarded. \n\nSurvivors play in a 3rd person perspective, making it easier to see the Killer. When the killer is close enough to you a noise (usually a heartbeat) will sound to alert you to their presence, which really adds to the tension and horror theme of the game. It takes two physical hits from a killer for a survivor to go down, meaning they can now be carried to a hook and sacrificed. If you are not taken down form the hook by a fellow survivor you are sacrificed and out of the game, you can attempt to free yourself from the hook but chances are lowIf you are the last survivor standing a hatch appears randonmly in the map (if 3 generators have been powered), which allows you to escape if you can find it before the killer finds you otherwise you can continue powering generators and aim for the gate.\n\nThe killer plays in a first person perspective, making it difficult to see the survivros however they are generally faster and can chase survivors down. The killer also has special powers, such as being able to see all the locations of the generators, being able to see tracks where survivors have sprinted and they also have individual powers, for example the \"Hillbilly\" killer, has a chainsaw that gives them a speed boost to chase enemies down and the \"Trapper\" Killer lays traps which deal physical damage to survivors and alerts you to their location.  As the Killer, sound is your best ally, listening for survivors opening item chests or walking past crows alerts you to their location and allows you to chase them down.\n\nPrevious reviews of the game say there is a lck of content however, since its release there has been many new killers added to the game. Where it could improve is the game does not feature any type of voice chat, which is a major downside. I feel that a proximity chat in which you have to be close to a fellow survivor to talk to them, but also poses the risk of the killer hearing you, would really add to the game.\n\nProgression and Unlocks:\nProgression and unlocks are split into four main categories, Perks, Items, Offerings and addons all of which are unlocked by spending Bloodpoints which are earned through playing the game. If you perform actions such as starting a generator, meeting up with another survivor and especially winning the game, you earn Bloodpoints.\n\nPerks can be unlocked for both Killers and Survivors and they add bonuses to your chosen character and can never be lost once unlocked. You can equip 4 per match based on your level.\n\nItems are only for Suriviors and they help you survive, such as medkits, which make you heal faster or toolboxes which make you repair generators quicker. These can also be found in chests that are placed around the map. If you survive a match the item does not get used and you can keep it for the next match.\n\nAddons, are accompanied with items and improve the effects or duration of an item. If you die, you lose your items and their addons. \n\nOfferings are used by both the survivors and the killer and they affect the map by changing different aspects of it such as the thickness of the fog or the amount of hooks and much more. Offerings are lost once used.\n\nTo level up in this game you must buy all of the available nodes in the characters Bloodweb using your Bloodpoints. Once you buy all the nodes available you level up. For example if there are 4 nodes on your level 1 Bloodweb and you buy all 4 you move that character onto level 2 and open a new bloodweb. The benefit of leveling up is you unlock perks and perk slots.\n\nBloodpoints are not specified to survivors or killers they are accumulated into one bank account and are used for both.\nWhen first starting the game this can be very daunting and confusing. The tutorials in this game are pages of information as opposed to a gamepay tutorial and if you are anything like me, reading how to play doesnt really stick so, to start off, this game can be pretty unfriendly to noobs,but once you understand it becomes pretty self explanatory and very fun.\n\nConnectivity:\nDead By DAylight uses a Peer to Peer hosting system which I usually have problems with However, Based in New Zealand I did not have any issues finding games as a Survivor, when I was the Killer there was some very long waits for other players to connect. Eventually I got into some games as a killer.\n\nReplayability:\nThere is around 10 different killers which provides some replayability, not only when playing as the killer but also as the survivors, as you must play differently according to the killer that has been chosen. Unfortunately I don't think there is enough variety in the maps to keep me playing the game for hours on end as each game does feel relatively similar to the one before it, regarless of if you pick a different killer or character. As the killer you do get a sense of \"ownage\" in which you completely outplayed your opposition however, as the survivor it feels more like, the killer was useless if you win. Personally I find the \"ownage\" emotion very addictive, annihilating other human players is addictive as hell and you do get this but only as the killer. The stealth element of the Survivor and outwitting a killer is very enjoyable but repetitive. Matches are usually relatively quick and the short waits for games make it easy to get into a match, so I therefore consider this game more of a casual, lets have a few games type.\nValue For Money (VFM):\nThis game is cheap and has a lot to it in terms of progression. The jump scares, tension and constant updates with new killers makes it definitely worth the money.\n\nConclusion:\nOther reviews stated that the peer to peer matchmaking system caused issues, as the Survivor I did not have any issues with this but as the killer there were a few long wait times for people to join the game. Reviewers said there was not enough content in the game, in terms of the killers, Behaviour Interactive have released many new ones however the maps dont really change, and the game does get repetitive. I consider this game a casual, lets play a few rounds type game and if you take it as that, it is a fun, scary game.\n8/10\n","timestamp_created":1512279442,"timestamp_updated":1512279442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38023738","author":{"steamid":"76561198056188215","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":24296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5459,"last_played":1637410110},"language":"russian","review":"Баланс говно","timestamp_created":1512279279,"timestamp_updated":1534862692,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519774019718170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38023360","author":{"steamid":"76561198327656912","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":19645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10766,"last_played":1657089796},"language":"schinese","review":"有车队开黑吗，实在是太无聊了！","timestamp_created":1512277738,"timestamp_updated":1580882501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536423861980438232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38023184","author":{"steamid":"76561198355095674","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":31787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":7530,"last_played":1660310951},"language":"koreana","review":"not so good","timestamp_created":1512277102,"timestamp_updated":1512277102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38023064","author":{"steamid":"76561198443078799","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1579963897},"language":"english","review":"Very good games, games that train konsetrasi when justifying the generator and when playing a killer","timestamp_created":1512276583,"timestamp_updated":1512276583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38023048","author":{"steamid":"76561198299974974","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14758,"last_played":1657450908},"language":"english","review":"this game is the best game in my life","timestamp_created":1512276500,"timestamp_updated":1512276500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38022181","author":{"steamid":"76561198045580150","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94,"last_played":1513487226},"language":"english","review":"Oh my god what an awful experience.
