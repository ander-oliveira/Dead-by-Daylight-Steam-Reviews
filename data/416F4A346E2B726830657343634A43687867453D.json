many people this is one of those games that you absolutely hate but still come back and play anyways for some reason. Not the case for me, and probably not the case for you, the reader, as you're most likely a newcomer to the game or why else would you be reading the review?\n\nTLDR: Bad community (toxicity and sweatyness), bad matchmaking, poor balancing, greedy developers who forgot what QA was, and a game bordering on pay 2 win (must pay for dlc to unlock the really good perks, although you can get by with the free ones sort of) despite the fact that the dlc (to me, you're more than welcome to disagree I'm only saying this because I'm a peasant) isn't worth the price (this only applies to people who don't have much money to spend, obviously). \n\n[h1]Gameplay & Balancing[/h1]\nPlay as either a Survivor with 3 other teammates or a Killer. Survivors must work together and repair 5 generators to escape the killer who's hunting them. Killers must sacrifice the four survivors they play against before they can escape to win. While all survivors are the same aside from looks, each killer also has a unique power(s) they use to give them the edge over the four survivors. Each killer has a unique ability, and some may have more than one. Both killers and survivors may also equip perks which are unlocked as they play the game to further give themselves an advantage.\n\nA simple concept, and a decent one, but why does it fail?\n\nMany of the perks that I mentioned range from completely useless to absolutely necessary if you want to win against skilled players. Like all competitive games, this has a meta, and it's a very stale meta too. Forget about fun builds, if you want to win you [b]need[/b] to use the top tier builds in order to have a chance once you start going up against players with higher skill (and trust me, even if you're bad at the game you WILL go up against them). While there's still a fair few options to choose from, many of those options are locked behind paid dlc. So if you're like me and don't have much money, or don't want to support a company that doesn't care about it's game, well, get f*cked! Now you only have about two or three viable builds you can use for survivor, but you can still make it work. As for killer, well... have fun when you have no options for generator regression which is absolutely necessary when playing against skilled survivors using the same meta perks.\n\nOn top of this, a fair portion of the killers seem useless as most of the other ones, especially the newer ones, have abilities that put the older ones to shame. Some of them to this day STILL have bugs/issues that the community has repeatedly complained about and yet nothing has been done to them. Again, if you're like me and weren't born to a well-off family, you're not going to be able to play them because you'd need to spend money on them, or grind for about 50 hours to unlock a non-licensed one for free. So you'd better hope that the one you really enjoy playing is also considered to be a \"good\" killer or else you'll have to dedicate a fairly decent portion of time to practicing with them in order for it to be viable once you're out of the low-skill matchmaking pool.\n\nIt's workable if you become a sweaty tryhard, but for those of you who just want to have fun I'd suggest finding a different multiplayer game or only playing this with your friends who happen to be sweaty tryhards.\n\nOn top of this, even with a rudimentary knowledge of the meta you begin to realize how stale the gameplay loop is, mainly for survivors. You simply hold W, and hold M1 on a generator, then use your crutch perks to get away from the killer when they arrive. You do this in every single game, with the only difference being that the map changes (although the majority of them feel samey) and that the killer changes. While the community will insist each killer and perk setup has a \"unique playstyle\" they don't. They're slightly different from each other, but 95% of their gameplay is the exact same. I don't think this is necessarily bad, but I would suggest that you treat this as a game you play every now and again rather than play it constantly or else you will wish you had refunded it with how dull it feels.\n\nIf there were more objectives or more things to do in the game I'd look at the gameplay loop more positively. As it stands, once you've played 3 games, you've seen all the game has to offer and will see little change after that.\n\n[h1]Matchmaking & Community[/h1]\nThis game has a ranking and a skill based matchmaking (SBMM) system. Your rank increases or decreases based on how many points you earn in a game, and you earn points by doing actions like healing others, repairing generators, killing survivors, etc.. Basically just by playing the game. With SBMM, the game will try to pair you with players similar to your skill. So you could be a rank 14 killer who's pretty good at the game, and paired with Rank 8 survivors who are also pretty good at the game.\n\nAt least, that's the idea. In practice it doesn't seem to work very well. While SBMM was in its testing phase, the developers foolishly decided to continue to implement it anyways despite many complaints by the playerbase. This has so far resulted in the community sweating their d*ck off more than they ever had before in a desperate attempt to have a high MMR which offers no reward other than you having a high MMR in a video game (your parents must be proud!) and causing low-skill players to be paired with high-skill players and vice-versa, completely ruining the experience for all parties involved. The matchmaking system basically says \"oh hey, you've got 10 hours as killer and have been doing pretty well so far, time to go up against sweaty tryhard Shadow Mercenary and his friends who are even more tryhard and have thousands of hours. To be nice, we'll throw in one survivor who has never played before. You got this!\" This ruins it for me and my friends, because now we have a teammate that has no idea what's going on, and we'll also steamroll the killer because we're sweaty cheeto fingered f*cktards playing against a killer who doesn't have that much experience compared to us. See how it's a problem now?\n\nWhile I've definitely seem worse communities out there, this one is still very bad. I'm used to it, but if you're someone who isn't used, well expect to see it in the majority of your games. Not only this, but with the recent update the playerbase has decided to turn their sweatometer to levels that I hadn't thought possible. Before you'd only occasionally see players who'd refuse to rescue you from the hook (as survivor) or camp you (as killer) while you were on the hook. Now with people so desperate to improve their MMR it's commonplace. Play with your frieneds if you actually want to be saved from the hook, but beware of the killer who will almost always camp you now.\n[i]I just want to note however, that this has been the experience of myself and several other players, but is [b]NOT[/b] the experience of the entire playerbase. It seems to be about half and half. Your mileage may vary.[/i]\n\nIt's made worse by the fact that the developers seem to only listen to the whinging new players' opinions, but still forgets to test their balance fixes for their f*cked up new content that they forgot to test as well. Why would they make the effort to do proper QA when they can just print money from the skins and DLC anyways? And the rest of the community who voices valid concerns and are ignored, decides to be f*cking stupid and continue to buy DLC and cosmetics, thereby supporting the company. Here, take my money for this bad DLC! With this money you'll make the next one bug-free! F*cking idiots.\n\nOverall a solid 3/10. Fun for the first 10 hours and with friends, but nothing more than that.
