=）：这个游戏背图很重要，玩人背了图才有资格去溜鬼，玩鬼背了图才能够套路人。在不熟悉地图的情况下，受挫是件十分正常的事。（团灭了怎么办？给屠皇蹲起蹲起转圈圈求放过就ok了23333）玩多了，熟悉了，这个游戏精彩的pvp乐趣才真正开始。\n最后，很佩服很喜欢老玩家们的聪明才智😂，黎明杀机的各种梗，各种外号真的很幽默。\n··································································\n服务器很烂！怎么说呢。无论你玩鬼还是人，排到的对手平均延迟都在150~200左右。而这也是等待游戏开始漫长的主要原因！许多玩家看到高ping会退房间。而有许多头铁娃，面对300的高ping连接进入游戏。则会碰到以下情况：瞬移（瞬移撞墙，瞬移吃刀），封快翻，屠夫20米大长刀，走地屠夫都会飞……\n如果你能接受这些，作为一个萌新，由于人鬼不平衡（玩鬼势必多，玩人少）会导致你的匹配时间异常的长。\n另外，这游戏还会回档！你用钱买的技能，用游戏币点的血网技能，都有几率被吞，俗称回档。我上个月买的厄咒：毁灭，被回档了。荧光碎片也没退，最近刚发现。客服开始高效率的回复了我的技能，但是讨论到附加赔偿的时候，问了句：你购买这个技能到现在玩了多久之后，持续一周音讯全无。（这游戏分技术性客服和后续客服，当你出了问题，他会及时帮你解决问题，但是后续的补偿客服进度很慢，并且不回消息，50w血点是他们自己决定的，并没有问过我的意见）\n最后，这个游戏的bug很多，第一，声音bug。这是官方声明未修复的bug，已经持续很久了，但是迟迟未修复。其次我还碰到过，扮演逃生者开启大门，跑到地图外的情况（有截图）。好友房，毁灭打击用不了。脚印痕迹迷的一匹。日常电机松手qte爆米花。另外更多bug等待各位的发掘。\n你以为这是一款恐怖游戏，不，你错了，这是一款换装游戏。服务器？这不重要！bug？随它去吧！重要的是我们的凤敏，我们的屠夫今天有新衣服穿了吗？？","timestamp_created":1544887234,"timestamp_updated":1546984827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47547631","author":{"steamid":"76561198290706794","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":66345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":54580,"last_played":1660164467},"language":"german","review":"Die

If group of 5 can get together and are all at same level, then experience is truly amazing.\n\nOn competetive/matchmaking note however, player is less likely to get very far in matchmaking unless he is willing to put atleast 250 hours minimum into it(purely assuming). Gameplay can become redundant and repetetive very easyly. Perk system is built with quantity of time in mind. It takes a lot of time to earn all the perks you need to be able to stay in meta. Low ranked matchmakers usually have better perks and items than new player himself. Skill and experience play vital role only if player and opponent have almost similiar perk sets and experinece.\n\nI can recommend this game for casual playing and having fun with friends, but not for matchmaking.\n\nI would say, game deserves 6/10\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n06.12.2021 review\n\nAs more killers and survivors have been introduced, the core of the game has stayed the same. Due to the stagnated playerbase, all survivors are pretty much running meta and \"second chance\" perks. Same goes for killers if they have them. Because Survivors are reskins of each other, killers remain unique, thus making it harder for killers to have proper perks to help kill all 4 survivors. Survivors themselves have all necessary perks when unlocking just 1 or 2 characters. Killers will need atleast 2-4 to have any sort of chance if player is new to the game. And grinding shards to unlock new characters take awful long time.\n\nAs a survivor, new players focus on generators while experienced old players fool around with flashlights and pallets around the map. It is not uncommon to see the games finish within 5 minutes or so.\nAs a killer, new players tend to follow same survivor while experienced killers use all sorts of anti-generator perks and survivor locating perks (perk based wallhacks).\n\nBecause of matchmaking changes, it is very easy to make it to rank 1 on either side if you got proper perks and some bit of experience. Thats why its hard to tell, if players are actually good and experienced or just new. Sometimes you see a 7k hour survivor as silver rank while 200 hour killer is Iridecent 1 rank. It is very inconsistent and you will never run across players of your own skill level. The games are either stomp or be stomped.\n\nAfter reaching Rank 1 as both Survivor and killer, you will realize, how limited you actually are without having unlocked all survivors and killers. Meaning that you are unable to experiment new builds to keep the game fresh for yourself, forcing you to burn out wayyy too quickly. Or if you are rich enough to buy all DLC for real money (Around 150€ or so) then good luck, as you still need to unlock the perks themselves AND hope that you get the best perks for your favourite killer after unlocking them. Same can be said for survivors (\"Decisive Strike\" most likely).\n\nIf you have friends to play and have fun with, playing Dead by Daylight is a blast! Solo it gets dull too quickly and makes you unmotivated, once you make it to Rank 1.\n\nExperience with friends: 8/10\nExperience alone: 5/10","timestamp_created":1544879650,"timestamp_updated":1638815014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47545036","author":{"steamid":"76561198013778408","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1988,"last_played":1599256543},"language":"english","review":"Good game until it isn't.

What's even better is those characters keep their classic movie chase themes (except Freddy, this one is from that crappy 2010 remake). Along with horror movie characters, this game also features Bill from Left 4 Dead, which is just awsome. The only bad part about this game is that some survivors from horror movies don't look anything like their actors, and when comparing it to the accuracy of Friday the 13th: The Game's characters and the winner is obvious.

(take this with a grain of salt). the game is fun and enjoyable during first six to seven killers, after many updates and \"tweaks\" to the game however, they have made it way to easy for killers to no matter what see you kill you and combine that with very rare bad team combanations, you are left with a 1/10 chance of getting out now. hopefully 2019 when they make actual dedicated servers there will be less lag and hacks, till then dont plan on good survivor rank for a while. play it if you dont care about rank at all like i do now and watch the bugs, glitches, bad updates/changes stack up worse then a fallout game. again still no dedicated servers and its end of 2018... sadly its a trap to get money like 6/10 games are lately.. also \"i think we did a good job\" is all i can think and laugh about when it comes to this game.     (2019 october) no its worse then when it came out and just gets more broken for killers if i had any reason to keep playing its gone since they nerfed last few things they could for survivors and now if you only play killer go ahead no issues, also 50/50 that it can take over 45 mins to play as killer or get one after only 5 mins.......... and they complain about 76....>_> like this is a 1 out of 10 versus 76 being a 6 out of 10 comparison. 2020 there still is piss pour report options even online website, go to send video of some one lag switching, working with killer and yet every time video on there site that's uploading stops at 90% saying \"took too long\".\n(April 11th 2020) this game is just getting worse as time goes on, there is a 5% chance anyone will get out at all, there is a lot of baby killers that run perks that makes them pretty much broken, they also have most of the killers set up to have to longest lunges,abilities that will 1 hit down you and not to mention there cool downs for those abilities are way to short for 1 hit ko's. miss the game back when it was 2018 it was full of laughs but now its just a dying game.\n(April 28 2020) most recent patch basically takes everything out for survivors to survive and or escape, there's no longer a loop mechanic nor is there a struggle mechanic that's gone, items are useless chest are useless. trying to play this game at this point is not worth it. go buy the other game thats just like this its better then the direction that this company has gone.","timestamp_created":1544844840,"timestamp_updated":1588118965,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47536182","author":{"steamid":"76561198416945358","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":37334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29662,"last_played":1586072480},"language":"schinese","review":"preety good job so far","timestamp_created":1544844059,"timestamp_updated":1544844059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47535959","author":{"steamid":"76561198105980268","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":34682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":89,"playtime_at_review":16316,"last_played":1659780141},"language":"english","review":"8/10 for Adrenaline Rush","timestamp_created":1544842983,"timestamp_updated":1544842983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47535674","author":{"steamid":"76561198120634749","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24978,"last_played":1644352422},"language":"schinese","review":"一款沉迷了很久的游戏，初期是恐怖游戏，上手以后，会忍不住开始皮，快乐偷电，绝对魔性。","timestamp_created":1544841605,"timestamp_updated":1544841605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47535277","author":{"steamid":"76561198064652805","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5358,"last_played":1585327610},"language":"french","review":"enorme","timestamp_created":1544839512,"timestamp_updated":1544839512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464998096227645874","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47535099","author":{"steamid":"76561198038133802","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":38764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38764,"last_played":1607049421},"language":"english","review":"P̶r̶e̶t̶t̶y̶ g̶o̶o̶d̶.\nN̶o̶t̶e̶ t̶h̶a̶t̶ i̶ d̶o̶n̶'t̶ o̶w̶n̶ a̶n̶y̶ o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ \"1̶ d̶o̶u̶c̶h̶e̶ v̶s̶ 4̶ p̶l̶e̶b̶s̶\" g̶a̶m̶e̶ t̶o̶ c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶e̶ i̶t̶ t̶o̶ t̶h̶o̶u̶g̶h̶.\n\nEDIT: After obtaining simultaneous Rank 1 Survivor and Killer i'm done.

For example if you play killer and kill everyone in the first 2 minutes of the game by slugging them or something, that should mean you are a good killer and award a pip but sadly it doesn't. Or another, if you are a survivor and you get tunneled off hook that shouldn't mean you are a bad survivor you just got unlucky and its by factors you rarely control.

Almost every game now I disconnect out of the blue due to some sort of lag when i wouldn't experience any leading up to it, or as killer constantly 2 people DC the exact same time due to lag when talking to the other people in the end of game chat they didn't even notice. Now i have been playing this game for a very long time and while yes my internet sometimes has a lag spike every once in a while but the game goes on with no DCs and it eventually reverts to normal but it seems to be that the game is just randomly kicking people and to be honest i cant tell anymore if it is lag at all. To put the icing on the cake DC greatly affects if you pip or not so with people DC left and right i am wrongly de pipped due to some game issue. The killer is great love the Plague and her map. Great addition to the game, but the changes that has come along with her greatly puts this DLC as among the worst in Dead by Daylight History.","timestamp_created":1544837415,"timestamp_updated":1553409196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47534461","author":{"steamid":"76561198282948988","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":81,"playtime_at_review":8801,"last_played":1660186822},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, recomendo.\nTambém recomendo não camperar, ia ser uma baita ajuda pra comunidade.","timestamp_created":1544835294,"timestamp_updated":1544835294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47534362","author":{"steamid":"76561198835654862","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":14927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7563,"last_played":1567678068},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, советую всем!","timestamp_created":1544834651,"timestamp_updated":1544834651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47534249","author":{"steamid":"76561198354629541","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":134432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4713,"playtime_at_review":40176,"last_played":1660605965},"language":"english","review":"So I used to love playing this game a while ago. I stopped playing for a little bit as I was getting to rank 1 pretty quickly and rank 1 is just no fun, its only full of try hards. I came back after I saw the new chapter come out. I liked the idea of this new killer and I wanted to learn this killer, playing this killer was okay I guess. I think I got 1 kill with them as I dont really know how to play them. I do like the mori tho, best one by far. So far the killer is pretty cool I like them yet the perks could of been better tho. Same with the survivor but breakdown seems pretty cool if you are gonna be tunnled off the hook. Now that brings me to the next point I'm going to make. Tunneling is a main thing with this game, also camping. I pretty much get tunneled all the time, its even worse in the higher ranks. Its the only way killers know how to play it seems. Camping well, you have ds on well most killers love to camp if you have that one perk. Now before many people comment on this and say what about toxic survivors dont worry I'm about to talk about them. Survivors yes they can be toxic. Survivors with flashlights, if they know how to use them you bet they will blind you when ever they can. Yes I use a flshlight a lot but I only use them on killers that like to tunnel or camp, but I mostly will use them to save people as thats what they are meant for. But dont get toxicness mixed up with good players. I know to some killers survivors that teabag or pointing can be seen as toxic, and I can see why it is annoying when they just sit there doing that stuff. Now onto this new update that we have, yes the killer and survivor are pretty cool and its nice to see this new change but a long with all this is so many bugs and I mean there is so many I have not seen this many bugs in one game this bad before like wtf happened to the game. Yes they have taken the new map down to fix it as people have been reporting that they have been crashing due to that one map and I'm glad to see they are trying to fix that but lets be honest now they won't fix it as they never fix things. They say they do but they never fix it right. Like the bug where you couldnt move at all, many killers took advantage of that bug. They said they fixed it but it was never fixed took them over a month to fix that bug. I thought that was bad but these bugs we are getting now are even worse. Killers not been seen at all and getting hit from out of no where by a killer you cant see. Putting a pallet down and slidding around the map. Oh there is many more I can list too. But this review is all ready getting long enough. Now the new map? well I cant say much about it as I havent got to play on it just yet as I never got the chance to get it and they have taken it down so who knows when we will get it back so I can see how the new map is. So now I have said all the bad what about the good? Well I guess the only good thing anout this game is I've met some really great people on this game. Really good friends. So I guess this game is only good for playing with your friends or meeting new friends. KYF (Kill Your Friends) Is pretty good fun to just mess about with and have all the perks so you dont have to grind all the perks. So if you want to get this game, make sure you have some friends to play with so you can play KYF. Now SWF is okay I guess if you want to play lobby simulator for an hour or until a killer isnt scared of a 4 or 3 man or even a 2 man yes killers will leave if there is even 2 SWF. So all around thoughts? Well I think I'm gonna be uninstalling until they can fix this game or do something with it. So go a head and buy this game if you want to try and find the game inside all these bugs. But what I would say is to not buy this game. I think it will only get worse then it already is. So \"pretty good job so far\" if I dont say so myself :)","timestamp_created":1544834066,"timestamp_updated":1544834288,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460526347160339355","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47534058","author":{"steamid":"76561198307845160","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1629984868},"language":"english","review":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz so boring","timestamp_created":1544833072,"timestamp_updated":1544833072,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47533365","author":{"steamid":"76561198269167586","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":38819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23211,"last_played":1652233378},"language":"russian","review":"игра где кровавая жеппа спасает в темной лачуге","timestamp_created":1544829885,"timestamp_updated":1544829885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47533263","author":{"steamid":"76561198800713518","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1821,"last_played":1630385999},"language":"english","review":"The game isn't very fun when alone.

Все вижившие теряют ранг.\n-игра превращается в Pay2Win, где купив очередного нового маньяка, ты стаешь ИМБОЙ. \n\nПлюсы:\n-игра имела хорошее начало, было действительно интересно играть\n-хорошая задумка\n-много маньяков и выживших, много вариантов сборки\n-регулярные ивенты и добавление контента\n","timestamp_created":1544814015,"timestamp_updated":1544814015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511748909950256348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47529025","author":{"steamid":"76561198867845546","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":63493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1053,"playtime_at_review":6582,"last_played":1660606357},"language":"spanish","review":"Oigan, no da miedo, da risa.","timestamp_created":1544813722,"timestamp_updated":1605278622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47528845","author":{"steamid":"76561198448749326","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2553,"last_played":1643226993},"language":"russian","review":"12/10","timestamp_created":1544813073,"timestamp_updated":1573125583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ppqC1+cCfbintQE="}
