It's not the best when it comes to balance or netcode but it somehow keeps you coming back for more. The game is certainly slanted in the favor of killers as I write this but that's shifted over time and I expect it to shift again with the future. As with any multiplayer pvp game balance is always going to be a complaint people have but it's more important to look at the fact that this game genuinely gives a sense of pride when you do well, at least in my opinion. The fact that the tutorial gives you blood points for completing it is honestly something most games should do more. A reason to do the tutorial is often needed for people playing games today. We all assume we can figure it out with some trial and error but sometimes that trial and error makes the game less fun. And instead of forcing a tutorial, make it a bonus that has a genuinely useful reward to get you started. Granted it doesn't teach you everything, but it's enough to get you started. And there are the notes to help you learn what all the little symbols and effects mean. At the end of the day this is just a solid game to play with friends, killer and survivor both have their moments of feeling super fun and super frustrating but that's just the nature of online gaming and asymmetric gameplay. Definitely worth buying, especially if it's on sale which it goes on regularly.","timestamp_created":1573164812,"timestamp_updated":1573164812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56721875","author":{"steamid":"76561198087900169","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":83991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":322,"playtime_at_review":58930,"last_played":1660514170},"language":"english","review":"This is the best game ever made, about 10 times better than destiny 2 could ever hope to be.

When I bought this game I had a blast. It was buggy and needed work but it was such a good concept and there truly is no other game like it. The longer I played however, the worse it got. Despite this I am very much addicted to it. If you like rage inducing games, you have found a good one.\n\nAs a survivor: if the game lags and you get hit because of it, you are the problem. If you lag and survive because of it, you're a hacker. If you do anything that allows you to not be immediately downed and killed, you are a toxic piece of shit and you should die. This includes (but not limited to): Healing, running away, pallet stunning, flashlight blinding, running out the gate, getting the hatch, having any item what so ever, running any kind of perk that could give you any advantage at all. If you leave to save yourself, you get reported. If you go back to save another teammate you are most likely going to die, and get reported.\n\nAs a killer: getting 4 kills in one match is either impossible because they ranked the lowest rank killer with the highest rank survivors, or it is super easy because of the reverse. If you kill any survivor, you're sweaty. If you farm, you're trash. If you use perks at all, survivors will jump down your throat, if you use no perks, doubly so.\n\nEven though I see both sides, the game is entirely killer sided. They say they want a survivor perk struck down, it gets struck down. They want a new killer? They get a new killer with extremely OP powers. Survivors get an occasional perk upgrade only to have things like instant med-kits take 8 seconds, completely ruining instant med-kits. \n\nI lose more matches than I win, and that's fair. I tend to slide right into the killer's arms by accident damn near ever match. But I see killers hit pro players from across the map. I have seen killers walk faster than survivors run with perks. It is completely ridiculous and frankly I just can't do it anymore, because I could deal with all that if I didn't get messages like \"Kill urself\" after EVERY SINGLE MATCH no matter if I win or lose.\n\nThe devs 100% don't listen to survivor mains, only killer mains.

The reason behind this was because I was horrified by the idea of playing Killer for the first time. The survivors can be toxic and gang up on you, which can make a game for a Killer less enjoyable (I have experienced this too many times).\n\nNow that I have grown past that fear, I have started practicing the Killers. They are much more fun (in my opinion) IF you get the hang of it. \n\nHowever, at Rank 15 you will already start to encounter Survivors that have 1.000+ hours on just this game. Still, everytime I play as a Killer, I just hope the Survivors play this game normally and not buttdance everytime they drop a pallet.\nI get matched with players who are clearly better than me (players that have 6 ranks higher than me with a full squad, for example) and this just ruins the experience for the Killers, since it will always be a 1v4.\n\nBut when I have fun... boy, do I have fun. \n\nDespite this, I have spent a lot of hours on this game and I really think these hours have not gone to waste.

Only after you climb out of the beginner ranks do you get matched against people you belong with. Why the devs chose to do this, I absolutely do not know.\n-The Teachable Perks system is starting to get out of hand. As the devs release more and more Killers, Dead by Daylight is starting to become more and more pay-to-win. The best perks for both sides (Decisive Strike / Barbecue and Chili) are for licensed characters, which can only be bought with real money. Most of the other decent perks need to be earned from characters you can grind for playtime, but that's still a solid investment of at least 30+ hours (Spirit Fury / Infectious Fright / Monitor and Abuse for instance). Something needs to be done about Teachable Perks.\n-This game has easily the single most toxic community in any game I have ever played. League of Legends? Overwatch? CS:GO? Apex? None of these games have a dime on the toxicity and salt this game bleeds. Imagine getting flamed for buying Control Wards in LoL, being revived by a Mercy in OW, or using Wraith's phase to dodge in Apex. That's the kind of convoluted bullshit mindgames Killers and Survivors will pull on you. \n\nThis game is amazing. I have at least 1.5k hours on console, and my PC hours are up at the top. I've played Dead by Daylight consistently for years, support the devs through (most of) their decisions, buy almost every chapter, and I'm going to buy the new Rift Pass as well.

The game is glitchy, the hit boxes unfair, and overall just not very well balanced. But it can be so fun. I only play with friends and love trying to survive with my besties or doing a kill your friends match and scaring them! I think the devs should realize that, while they want this to be a game people play alone to be scared, that isn't what the majority of their fan base wants anymore. I love that the only pay aspect of this game is cosmetic (I did pay for the current pass and I love all the lil cosmetics I get! It's easy to rank it up and I suck.)
