Doesn't feel balanced whatosever, and killer gameplay is extremely unsatisfactory. Not to mention, there are known exploits in the game that have been out for months. I only know this because one of my firends was using one of these, and recently got perma-banned for it. Fair enough, yes, but what's ridiculous is that the devs would rather just punish players for their own mistakes than fix the known issues and be accountable. If you have friends and are looking for an extremely easy game to just mess around in and get wins handed to you like you are in a bread line, this is the spot for you. However, if you are looking for a fun game to try and master and play as killers, PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. It will take you way too long to get to a successful point, and the journey along may cost you some of your gaming equipment. Player base is toxic, game is unbalanced and unrewarding, and the devs are more concerned with getting a dollar than the games' health. \n\nYou may have more fun dropping a 200 lb boat anchor on your big toe repeatedly.","timestamp_created":1642578560,"timestamp_updated":1642578560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108313468","author":{"steamid":"76561198319003426","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":49,"playtime_at_review":4392,"last_played":1659438713},"language":"english","review":"⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠋⠉⠁⠄⠄⠈⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠁⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠙⢿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠃⠄⠄⠄⢀⣀⣀⡀⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈⢿\n⣿⣿⣿⡟⠄⠄⠄⠄⠐⢻⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈\n⣿⣿⣿⠃⠄⠄⠄⢀⠴⠛⠙⣿⣿⡿⣿⣦⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄\n⣿⣿⠃⠄⢠⡖⠉⠄⠄⠄⣠⣿⡏⠄⢹⣿⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢠\n⣿⠃⠄⠄⢸⣧⣤⣤⣤⢾⣿⣿⡇⠄⠈⢻⡆⠄⠄⠄⠄⣾\n⠁⠄⠄⠄⠈⠉⠛⢿⡟⠉⠉⣿⣷⣀⠄⠄⣿⡆⠄⠄⢠⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢠⡿⠿⢿⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠃⠄⠄⣸⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢀⡞⠄⠄⠄⠈⣿⣿⣿⡟⠁⠄⠄⠄⠄⣿⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢸⠄⠄⠄⠄⢀⣿⣿⡟⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢠⣿⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠘⠄⠄⠄⢀⡼⠛⠉⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⣼⣿⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⡇⠄⠄⢀⠎⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠙⢿⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⢰⠃⠄⢀⠎⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠙","timestamp_created":1642578323,"timestamp_updated":1642578323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467810630798339844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108313422","author":{"steamid":"76561198323471592","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3368,"last_played":1653758927},"language":"latam","review":"Muy buen juego\nCreo que deberían tratar de equilibrar mejor el juego y sin duda la espera para jugar de asesino es muy larga, pero creo que es muy entretenido, tiene una gran variedad de personajes y los crossovers están muy buenos","timestamp_created":1642578219,"timestamp_updated":1642578219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108313188","author":{"steamid":"76561198374559470","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1801,"playtime_at_review":7876,"last_played":1660584229},"language":"russian","review":"Победа в игре сильно зависит от навыков и знаний противопоставленных сторон.

The devs don't want to do anything about this problem, let alone address this problem. This is the third time I have ran into hackers in the few weeks I've played recently. I've played this game on console since the first DLC with easily 1000+ hours and never ran into them until I switched to PC here recently. The only way to combat the hackers is to leave the match. However, once you leave you get a temp ban that increases in time with every leave. So the devs punish you for leaving, wont do anything if you report them and wont strengthen the integrity of the game.\n\nI love this game and didn't let the toxic community ruin it for me, but now I cant stand by it anymore after the devs have failed this game and only care about coming out with new killers and survivors just to make money.

Main reason being that after a while, you notice that the variety in the gameplay highly depends on perks and killer abilities. No new creative game modes are added, and every killer that comes out now is a paid DLC. After a while the game just gets stale and you end up playing killer only, which is miserable to play as the more you rank up due to survivor sweats with 4k hours who are the only ones still playing the game. Same thing vise versa when playing survivor. This leads to both sides constantly complaining about who is overpowered and who is not, because that is the only thing you can talk about in this game.\n","timestamp_created":1642536718,"timestamp_updated":1642536718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108286325","author":{"steamid":"76561198951127932","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2489,"playtime_at_review":2171,"last_played":1660601253},"language":"english","review":"protect yourself\n","timestamp_created":1642536445,"timestamp_updated":1642536445,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108286001","author":{"steamid":"76561198414967449","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1657555304},"language":"brazilian","review":"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW","timestamp_created":1642535998,"timestamp_updated":1642535998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108285973","author":{"steamid":"76561197970709269","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":863,"last_played":1649549747},"language":"english","review":"iTS FUN\n","timestamp_created":1642535950,"timestamp_updated":1642535950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108285890","author":{"steamid":"76561198017777261","num_games_owned":1247,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":1982,"last_played":1660593870},"language":"english","review":"Game is pretty good and when you get good matches in your skill rank its fun, but the ranking system is garbage, I as a new killer (and survivor) i get matched up against the highest ranks and just get instantly outplayed and played around with.\nWould have been a recommend if i got matched against my own rank, but the ranking system ruins the game for me.","timestamp_created":1642535853,"timestamp_updated":1642535853,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vIOxt/4CcvyJnQM="}
