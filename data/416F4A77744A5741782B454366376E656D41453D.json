Даже с тем учётом что у каждого персонажа есть свои \"Уникальные\" перки, их можно будет выучить на 30/35/40 уровне и без проблем обучить на других персонажах.\n[*] С маньяками почти такая же ситуация с перками, но в отличие от Выживших, у каждого из них есть свои способности и каждый маньяк \"Уникален\" в отличие от выживших.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Минусы[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Оптимизация - очень странное чувство когда играешь в GTA V на высоких 50-60 fps, а игра у которой матчи происходят на замкнутом пространстве выдаёт 45-60 fps на низких настройках.\n[*] Баги - залатали один, появилось два. И так постоянное, обновление за обновлением.\n[*] Баланс - именно баланс маньяков, некоторые маньяки бесполезны, по сравнению с новыми. \n[*] Компьнити чуть лучше, чем в дотке.

Iam also not a big fan of horror games overall.\n\nSo in December 2017 I got bored of all the games that I was then playing and I wanted something else for a change, I decided to give this game a try and uhh.. Yeah I like it, in matter of fact I like it so much I felt the need to write a small review about it.\n\nOverall feeling,\nIt has a nice \"Horror touch\" and the atmosphere is actually really solid when you are new to the game, the graphics is overall well done. The only downside is that the game is somewhat capped at 60 FPS.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is very straight forward, there are 4 survivors against 1 killer. You can play both alone and with friends as survivor while the killer obviously plays alone. \n\nThe main goal for survivors is to escape while the killer's goal is to (Obviously?) kill everyone.\n\nThere are alot of different elements to the game what you can do depending on how you want to approach every game depending on addons/perks. Let me tell you right now that no game is the same as the one before.\n\n1. There are alot of different killers with different weapons/abilities.\n2. There are alot of different survivors you can choose from.\n3. There are alot of different maps to play. (Some maps kinda look the same for a new player)\n\nSummary:\nI never thought that I would be playing this game for more than 20-30 hours because of me not being much into either horror or survival games but damn I was actually really wrong about this game. I've become pretty much addicted to it and I gotta say its not often that happens for me these days.\n\nSo I will end this with a classic quote: Dont judge the book by its cover!","timestamp_created":1518578727,"timestamp_updated":1562343433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57366335391998291","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40059549","author":{"steamid":"76561198287043215","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":66306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15903,"last_played":1658551331},"language":"english","review":"Once this game gets some real competition, it's screwed.

If you're looking experience the satisfaction of finally catching someone only to then have them decisive strike out of your grip, be saved with borrowed time immediately after, or just be bodyblocked into oblivion. If you're looking for a game where you yourself have no direct control over whether you win or lose, and insted have to rely on others to make a mistake first. \n[b] Then this is the game for you, and I salute you, for you can find enjoyment in something I can only find pure unbridled frustration in.

You can probably get through an entire game without even seeing the killer, escape, and then find out your other 3 teammates had a hell of a time juking the killer around pallets. Or you can be the survivor that jukes the killer around pallets, through windows, and accross the map, only to find the hatch or escape before he can down you.\n\nIf you play killer, you'll have a difficult game, where if you win, the survivors will call you names and make fun of you for one of the following reasons:\n[list]\n    [*]Camping (You stayed more than 5 seconds near a hooked survivor, sometimes less)\n    [*]Tunneling (You tried to attack someone you've already hooked)\n    [*]Running cheap perks (You used a perk that makes you stronger)\n    [*]Facecamping (You actually stayed close to the hooked survivor for a prolonged period of time)\n    [*]So bad (When the survivor can't figure out what excuse they can use to make you feel bad)\n    [*]Hacker (They'll find a way to say you're hacking, regardless if you are or not)\n    [*]Lag-Switch (You or they lagged at any point in the game, and it's your fault)\n    [*]Rude (You didn't spare the last survivor)\n    [*]Reported (You did any of the above to a Survive With Friends team that never read the rules)\n    [*]Tryhard (You tried to win)\n    [*]No-Life (If they check your profile and you have more than 100 hours)\n    [*]Cheater (You used in-game mechanics to try to win. Ex: Body blocking to prevent Borrowed Time)\n[/list]\nIf you don't win, and therefor, you don't kill ANY survivors, they'll usually end the game by saying \"gg\" or calling you bad.

Graphics are nice and gameplay is interesting. Variety of survivors, killers, perks, offerings, items and add-ons gives you other tactics and changes the whole gameplay. Thanks to that Dead by Daylight is still fun even after playing for 100+ hours. The one thing that might be irritating is people - some killers just camp near a hooked survivor making it impossible to save him.

over 100 hours on this game, i finally have something to say about it, i will go over the main and obvious problems first, but for now, lets look at this games pros and cons\n\nPros:\nOriginal game and system (this game has original designs and game mechanics to make it stand out)\nFun leveling system (its nice to explore the bloodwebs and explore what type of paths you go, till you make prestige)\nNever gets boring (theres always something fun about this game, the killers you face, the type of survivors youre with, etc.)\nSome of the bugs have been squashed (im not saying all bugs have been patched, as i still se quite alot, but most of the bigger ones have been patched as of 1.9.1, and hoping they make this game sort of bug free)\n\nokay, pros over, now to get to the part everyone loves, the cons\n\nCons:\nOp perks (alot of survivor perks are way too overpowered, borrowed time, prove thyself, dead hard, sprint burst, etc.)\nNo balance (theres always gonna be that 1 killer who overpowers another, for example, the hillbilly will outclass someone like the wraith any day of the week, another example of no balance is the way the survivors play, theres almost no certainty that youre gonna win a match, it all comes down to pure skill, which is fine for a while, but once you get to the 1000 hour mark, you will notice a huge difference in how survivors play)\n\nim only putting this out there, the amount of time you need to put into this game to be good is IMMENSE, and im not lying, im still pretty new since i have 100 hours, but i have plenty to say, and the balance issues a huge factor into rather or not you should buy it, now to the next step.\n\ndo i reccomend this game to you: Well, the simple answer is... no, and yes, it all depends on how you want to play the game, if youre not competitve, dont buy it, if youre competitive and want to try it out, go ahead, but since the vast majority doesnt like to try and go competitve, as of right now, and the games current state, i wouldnt reccoment this game at the moment, now not to say that i wont keep playing it, ill certainly keep playing this game myself because i myself are competitive, and love it, but for the rest, friday the 13th would be the game for you,","timestamp_created":1518512703,"timestamp_updated":1518512703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40040183","author":{"steamid":"76561198004313734","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6780,"last_played":1626535014},"language":"russian","review":"Я не особо много поиграл, но могу уже с легкостью сказать что игра не надоест.\nПостоянно есть ощущения турнира, мол мы 4 выживших против 1 маньяка, заводим генераторы, убегаем от него, мансим в моментах с досками, открываем ворота и оставляю маньяка  с носом.\nЗа маньяка: вид от 1 лица очень ухудшает маньяка ибо выжившие могут легко скрыться из поля зрения, но также маньяк находит не только глазами, но и по следам, остаткам крови, воронам, лишними громкими звуками от выживших (перепрыгнули через доску когда бежите или громко зашли спрятаться в шкафчик, открываете сундук, спасаете выжившего с крюка и т.д.), также у маньяка тоже как и у выживших, есть куча перков (которые можно прокачать в кровавой паутине) которые помогают поскорее убить всех выживших.\nТакже систему рангов подравняли и теперь будучи 20 ранг - вы не сможете встретить профессионала с 1 ранга!\n\n*спустя 8 месяцев знакомства с игрой*\n\nАзарт к игре остался дикий, даже увеличился когда узнал много полезного для себя. Как и за мана так и за сурва. Очень рад что разработчики добавляют много нового в игру, также добавили возможность покупки платных дополнений за вашу игру, т.е. чем больше играете - получаете больше осколков - покупаете манов и сурвов из дополнений за осколки.
