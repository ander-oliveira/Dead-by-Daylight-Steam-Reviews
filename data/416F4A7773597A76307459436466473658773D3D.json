Szóóóval.. Hol is kezdjem? Szeretnék egy igényes véleményt írni, hogy tudjak segíteni eldönteni nektek kell-e a játék vagy sem. Ehhez hasonló játékot még nem nagyon találtam. Van 4  játékos akik menekülnek és 1 gyilkos. A menekülők célja a generátorok megjavítása és azután a kijutás. Ezt lehet egyedül, de könnyebb együtt összetartva. Amikor belépsz az első meccsbe és majd összeszarod magad annyira félsz.. az nagyon vicces. Nem tudod mit kezdj magaddal aztán persze belejössz. Fontos a csapatjáték, de NEM kötelező. Ezt úgy értem, hogy mikor a kapu már nyitva és szabad az út a nyalókaföldre én még akkor is visszafutok a kampón nyaraló társamért. Ez nem mindig hasznos mert 50-50 hogy túléled. Nem akarok általánosítani, de 50-50 hogy neked segíteni fognak. Ez egy picit rossz. Vagy mikor megcsinálsz az 5-ből 4 generátort és azon gondolkozol ez most multi vagy single. Persze single nincs. Az előző pár napban párszor crash-el kidobált, de már javították is. Most komolyan. Melyik játékban nincs bug? Vagy bármi. Kicsivel több mint 2 hónapja jött ki és vannak hibái. Ez igaz, de Kifogják javítani és hibátlan lesz. Már beraktak egy új csúcsszuper és egyben nagyon félelmetes pályát, egy új gyilkost és még egy új karaktert is. Az első meccsen konkrétan remegtem és imádkoztam a játéknak, hogy ne kelljen gatyót cserélnem. Tényleg csúcs szuper. Olyan atmoszférája van.. jó pár horror game elbújhat. Összegezve, mert már sokat beszélek. Ajánlom ezt a játékot nagyon is! Vegyétek meg! Próbáljátok ki! Ne az első pár óra vagy a rossz élmény határozzon meg mindent. Ha beletanul az ember akár egyedül is hozhat egy meccset. Bár erre nagyon kicsi az esély, hogy ennyire hasznavehetetlen felebarátokat kap az ember. Nagyon izgalmas és egyben félelmetes. Szuper adrenalin bomba az unalmas napokon. Ha szeretnétek egy kis izgalmat, és megtapasztalni milyen rettegve az életetekért küzdeni akkor mindenképpen kötelező beszerezni és kerüljétek a kampókat! :)","timestamp_created":1471680322,"timestamp_updated":1507385902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.682193458080291748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25027868","author":{"steamid":"76561198315842870","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1472477151},"language":"schinese","review":"BUG，经常出现，、本来4个受害者，莫名其妙的多出了10-20个","timestamp_created":1471680179,"timestamp_updated":1471680179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25027860","author":{"steamid":"76561198088751939","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1169,"last_played":1501340794},"language":"russian","review":"Симулятор нажатия кнопки \"Готов\".

There's not communication, so most of the time well-meaning allies will walk in and get slaughtered. Ideally if the Killer does this the rest of the team should just rush around fixing generators, but since there's no communication it's easy to abuse this.

There should be more obstacles in the way between you and the killer in order to give yourself a fighting chance.\n\nFor the con, I think this can be easily patched in future updates as the devs get more feedback. I'm definitely getting this game after the demo period. Great work team! It is a sweet concept that they made to fruition. Very impressive.","timestamp_created":1471669090,"timestamp_updated":1471808500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25025998","author":{"steamid":"76561198094577180","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":92686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":26,"playtime_at_review":1076,"last_played":1660585723},"language":"russian","review":"добрая игра особенно мне нравятся выделенные сервера, баланс предметов и аддонов вовсе","timestamp_created":1471668815,"timestamp_updated":1606394754,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526803433895111084","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25025979","author":{"steamid":"76561198160833681","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":69438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15185,"last_played":1656392568},"language":"english","review":"meh","timestamp_created":1471668740,"timestamp_updated":1498619470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545273244380950928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25025977","author":{"steamid":"76561197980256518","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1528864110},"language":"english","review":"i die","timestamp_created":1471668733,"timestamp_updated":1471668733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5046653151512146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25025904","author":{"steamid":"76561198010898936","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4514,"last_played":1480786012},"language":"english","review":"Amazing Concept, Poor Implementation. \n\nFirst let me state that I absolutely love the concept and gameplay design behind this game. Creating a fun game with highly asymmetric design is quite an acomplishment and this game pulls off the concept quite well. Playing as both a survivor and killer, this game is one of the most fun and intense multiplayer experiences out there, when it works.\n\n\nSadly, this game is in what I would call a beta state, not full release. Despite being a PC exclusive its performance is extremely lackluster (forcing Vsync, borderless windowed mode, and a framerate cap of 60 even on 144HZ monitors). It's also incredibly unoptomized - I run an i7 3770K, GTX 770, 16GB RAM and my rig cannot play the new asylum map above 15fps. FIFTEEN, and the graphics aren't even half as impressive as games I can run on high/ultra at 120Hz. In short, it is clear that the Devs don't have the resources to make this game what it should be. \n\nIn addition to the performance issues, there are some incredibly broken gameplay mechanics that have continually gone unaddressed. If you face a team that all has sabotage as a killer, you're basically done. If you face a survivor that knows how to abuse so called \"infinites\" they're practically untouchable. If you get hooked by a killer that camps you and don't have teammates that are at a very high skill level, you're screwed. \n\nOn top of that, the matchmaking is non-existant. You have to continously \"ready up\" in the hopes the game might find a lobby to match you in as a survivor. Even then, you get the wonderful experience of facing a high level top ranked killer alongside a bunch of low level rank 20 survivors and get thoroughly rekt. Alternatively you can try killer on for size and have the same occur, at rank 17 you'll be facing lobbies regularly with rank 5 and under (lower is better) survivors. \n\nThe best thing I can say about this game is that it has incredible potential, however I fear the devs don't have the capacity or the will to bring this potential to fruition, as shown by their recent introduction of new content without addressing a fraction of the plague of bugs in the game.\n\nI'd reccomend this game only if you are ok with playing a glitchy game and can overlook the flaws I mention above. If you're the type of person to sign up for betas and alphas and still have fun inspite of obvious problems, you'll be able to love this game. If you need a smooth experience to have fun, you'll be frustrated and quickly burn out. \n\nPersonally, I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with this game, it's constantly beating me down with bugs and glitches but yet I can't help but keep coming back.","timestamp_created":1471668358,"timestamp_updated":1471668358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25025865","author":{"steamid":"76561197995133855","num_games_owned":693,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3729,"last_played":1529241544},"language":"english","review":"It's
