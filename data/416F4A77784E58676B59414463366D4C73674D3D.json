But it's very confusing and honestly every match is a gamble because there's so many perks it makes it incredibly difficult to do almost anything. The devs baby the killers and make them VERY overpowered in so many different ways, for example spend $5 to buy a killer like leatherface or grind roughly 4 days worth of playtime to unlock him and all you need to do is spam his alternative attack and it's a 1 shot. They give almost no punishment at all for missing attacks or getting stunned so spamming is very encouraged. Hooks are all over the place unless you have a high level survivor and role the dice on getting an offering to decrease the amount of hooks spawning. Killers may be very annoying, but survivors can play cheap as it's the only way to counter almost any killer at all. map design is ATROCIOUS, there's either too many pallets or almost none at all with it usually being either indoors and VERY close quarters or outside and 80% of the map is just grass and dirt with the edges of the map being random structures that make no sense being there at all. The Graphics and hitboxes are very outdated, I guess it's more of a personal opinion, but I think the 4/10 level graphics take away from the horror aspect of the game a little bit. The hitboxes make no sense, not really sure how a kitchen knife has a roughly 4 feet long reach it's kinda weird. As for the game overall it`s a 4/10 the devs as far as I know aren't very friendly to the community, and the community itself is very toxic and they have no shame in the way they play which is usually pretty scummy. This game has a few good qualities it's an interesting concept for sure but this dev team has no idea what they're doing and they have made it very clear they don't plan on improving it much or updating the way it looks or taking different approaches to make it fresh again. buy it if it's on sale, but you most likely won't keep it very

You can coordinate perk builds in your party with your friends and the whole aesthetic and vibe of dbd is very different from any game. Despite the gory features like slapping people with a machete and impaling people with a meat hook, there isn't a lot of blood and guts. Sure the screen gets a little bloody, but if you're into intense violence and gut-wrenching blood spewing this game isn't it. Killer is fun to play until you get into a certain skill level where survivors run the same perks that pretty much force you to chase a different survivor once you down and hook one. This doesn't sound that bad, but hooking each survivor one by one is the least effective way to win because 3 other survivors are constantly going to be repairing generators. If you follow this cute little nice guy play style, you will awlays get 0 kills. You'll be wondering 'But I hooked them so many times, didn't I??'. Yes, you did. But unfortunately the more experience you have of the game, the more times survivors will use the meta perks that force you to chase different survivors. The other side will just bring the strongest perks, items and killers. Fortunately, there are some people that like to use a lot of variety and have fun using exotic and underrated perks. It just sucks that barely anyone does this and people just constantly use the strongest shit. The game is really fun as long as you use unique killers, perks and items. I highly recommend taking breaks from dbd every so often because the game will start to feel rage inducing after a while. Aside from the abuse of meta, dbd has a lot of potential to be a fun game, more so if these meta things get nerfed.","timestamp_created":1649895768,"timestamp_updated":1649895768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113814811","author":{"steamid":"76561199082844114","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21524,"last_played":1658253650},"language":"brazilian","review":"bem divertido mas se prepare para passar raiva!","timestamp_created":1649895168,"timestamp_updated":1649895168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113814709","author":{"steamid":"76561198807580588","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2347,"last_played":1628036637},"language":"spanish","review":" pablo","timestamp_created":1649894990,"timestamp_updated":1649894990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113814544","author":{"steamid":"76561199016275902","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":33725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26484,"last_played":1656287747},"language":"english","review":"unfair and not balanced all killers do is camp and all survivers do is anything they can to aggravate the killed until they quit im starting to regret buying it","timestamp_created":1649894662,"timestamp_updated":1649894662,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113813511","author":{"steamid":"76561198105348668","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":35442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1489,"playtime_at_review":30404,"last_played":1660332013},"language":"english","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1649892739,"timestamp_updated":1649892739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113813428","author":{"steamid":"76561198096217013","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":5550,"last_played":1660007613},"language":"english","review":"I would say this game is fun, but really that is objective.

Una vez que alcanzás un rank relativamente alto, te vas a encontrar con que el 90% de los players usan una build meta que rompe el juego. De los 104 (CIENTOCUATRO) perks, son los ÚNICOS 5 o 6 perks que se usan.\n\n¿Qué logra esto? Que la partida se convierta para vos en una maratón eterna, estúpida y frustrante en donde le pegás a un survi y en segundos ya tenés a los otros survis (muy probablemente en comms) haciendote bodyblock, toxiqueandote, te flashean, te loopean infinitamente por loops increíblemente broken, se curan en segundos, y así eternamente. ¿Estuviste maso 1 minuto persiguiendo al mismo survi? Cagaste, ya te hicieron 2 o 3 gens y listo, la partida está perdida y no hay NADA que puedas hacer.\n\nSi jugás killer, creéme que 8 de 10 partidas te van a salir así. Altamente predecibles, repetitivas, nada original, repeat repeat repeat hasta que te des cuenta que no importa qué killer uses, solamente podés elegir entre los que pueden hacer poco y los que pueden hacer nada frente a este meta.

Eso si les interesa ayudarte, porque lo mismo te pueden dejar en pelotas y muriéndote desde el primer hook ya que les importa más boludear al killer y hacer sus pro-moves que aprendieron de algún streamer pre-homínido.\n¿Pero cuál es la gracia de que todos tus compas usen el mismo meta de perks, de que ya sabés lo que va a suceder?\n\nREPITO: este juego era muy divertido anteriormente.
