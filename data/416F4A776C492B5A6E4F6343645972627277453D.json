It is fairly frequently updated, you don't *need* to pay to access DLC content as you can unlock it through a somewhat sizeable grind.\n\nThis game does have its fair share of issues, however.\nFor one, it's P2P based, meaning one of the player will host the game.  That player will always be the Killer and, unfortunately, quite a few people playing killers have been abusing P2P through what is called Lag Switching.  The host is not affected by lag, everyone else is, it makes the game frustratingly unplayable for Survivors.\nAnother issue is rage-quitting, it is rampant.  Thankfully some Killers understand the hassle of having a rage-quitter on your team and end up farming points with the remaining Survivors rather than abuse their handicap.","timestamp_created":1542842089,"timestamp_updated":1542842089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46076237","author":{"steamid":"76561198299653070","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":84553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18977,"last_played":1655304345},"language":"russian","review":"повесили на крюк и че то приуныл(","timestamp_created":1542842072,"timestamp_updated":1542842072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46075987","author":{"steamid":"76561198115057880","num_games_owned":733,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":52331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":120,"playtime_at_review":10074,"last_played":1660584409},"language":"spanish","review":"I think we did a pretty good job so far","timestamp_created":1542842019,"timestamp_updated":1542842019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46075515","author":{"steamid":"76561198081970665","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":55273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40785,"last_played":1658743169},"language":"koreana","review":"내톱구~","timestamp_created":1542841930,"timestamp_updated":1631610178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46075429","author":{"steamid":"76561198350247303","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1639550734},"language":"russian","review":"10 из 10)))\n","timestamp_created":1542841914,"timestamp_updated":1542841914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46075227","author":{"steamid":"76561198038533547","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15300,"last_played":1630780268},"language":"english","review":"Even if you slow the video down just a little bit, you still won't know that you get the Cap, Emotes and Linkage","timestamp_created":1542841877,"timestamp_updated":1542841877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46075141","author":{"steamid":"76561197986887296","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":30089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4478,"last_played":1658626957},"language":"english","review":"fun and not actually scary","timestamp_created":1542841863,"timestamp_updated":1542841863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46074937","author":{"steamid":"76561198385401037","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":65417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1937,"playtime_at_review":62961,"last_played":1660586642},"language":"russian","review":"Игра фулл говно, ПРО БАЛАНС в этой игре можете даже не мечтать!!!

The choice is yours.\n\nThe killers play in first person and each have their own special abilities and playstyle. The survivors play in third person and behave more like skins, because their unique perks can be learnt by others once you leveled them up high enough.\n\nLeveling up your characters gives you new perks, addons (enhances abilities for the killers or the tools for the survivors) or tokens for more points in a round etc. You don't have to play a certain character to level her up. You can play whoever you like and use the points you get to level up a different character.\n\nYou can gain points by playing matches. As a survivor you get them for doing things like the objectives, helping others and by just surviving. As a killer you get it for doing things like hunting, chasing and killing survivors.\n\nSo in order to get certain perks you want, there will be a grind. But generally it won't feel that bad, since you're playing the game to do it anyway. The more you do during a match, the more points you receive. So you push yourself to do more than just camping a guy on the hook. Daily challenges also help to lessen the grind and there is often a double points weekend.\n\nYou don't have to worry about getting absolutely smashed either. The game uses a ranking system. This way you'll get matched with people of the same-ish ranking. This is fair, since you don't want to be matched with a killer or survivor that has all the knowledge(or good perks) to bully you when you're just new.\n\nYou don't really have to worry about all the dlc. All killers are different, but not one is 100% better than another. The main ones are generally regarded as the better ones anyway. But if you see a character you like, you can of course get that one. The non-licensed characters (such as kate denson, the spirit) can be purchased with in-game currency that you earn. The licensed ones (quentin, myers, leatherface) can only be bought with real money. You don't need the dlc to be facing them by the way. So you can be versus a myers and learn a bit about how he plays by watching him murder you.\n\nThe game is still being regulary updated and receiving events. The dev team definitely seems to listen to its community!\nOverall, it's a fun multiplayer game that you can invest quite some time in.","timestamp_created":1542841397,"timestamp_updated":1542841397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46072582","author":{"steamid":"76561198066603821","num_games_owned":1373,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":47862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1142,"playtime_at_review":1222,"last_played":1660588986},"language":"russian","review":"ну ладно, с друзьями весело","timestamp_created":1542841354,"timestamp_updated":1542841354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46072575","author":{"steamid":"76561198852389869","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":867,"last_played":1649508968},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que ja joguei xD","timestamp_created":1542841353,"timestamp_updated":1542841353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46072452","author":{"steamid":"76561197971807654","num_games_owned":748,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":862,"last_played":1622490029},"language":"english","review":"This is a fun game.

This game is a disaster. The playerbase is worse than ever before and the game itself barely functions. It it ripe with bugs, glitches, poor optimization and crashes. You will spend the majority of your time simply waiting in queues because the matchmaking is so incredibly poor. If you DO manage to get a lobby, you'll be matched with people far beyond or below your skill level, resulting in very unbalanced and unsatisfying gameplay. The devs have turned money-hungry in recent years and are avoiding addressing glaring issues with the core gameplay. The game is no longer fun to play because the playerbase is disgusting and the devs have been neglecting gameplay and optimization in favour of selling skins and other useless trinkets. (and don't give me some spiel about the art team being separate). Please don't play this game. It would be a huge waste of your time because of the state it's in at the moment.","timestamp_created":1542840496,"timestamp_updated":1583963654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46067696","author":{"steamid":"76561198064768016","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":74024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":37823,"last_played":1660072037},"language":"schinese","review":"还算耐玩的游戏，略有竞技性，不过高段位基本上玩配件。","timestamp_created":1542840432,"timestamp_updated":1542840432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46067467","author":{"steamid":"76561197978305460","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1531260409},"language":"portuguese","review":"Jogo muito bacana , inovador","timestamp_created":1542840391,"timestamp_updated":1542840391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46067429","author":{"steamid":"76561198166362675","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":32778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9610,"last_played":1585677905},"language":"russian","review":"НАЙС","timestamp_created":1542840384,"timestamp_updated":1542840384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511945366859436035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46066850","author":{"steamid":"76561198260996810","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":101626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65954,"last_played":1634343073},"language":"english","review":"Killers are awesome (Even the originals) and devs are trying to keep the game balanced.\n\nOnly con: A lot of crawling survivors, please don't\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1542840277,"timestamp_updated":1542840277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46066755","author":{"steamid":"76561198042074749","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":27366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15539,"last_played":1614489501},"language":"english","review":"Realmente viciante!
