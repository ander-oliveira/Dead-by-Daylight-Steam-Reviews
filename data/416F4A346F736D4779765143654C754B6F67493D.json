For some people, myself included, that's enough to keep playing. Killer is the more difficult side, not necessarily the weaker one (or stronger). Survivor is great if you have friends, and can be very strong when good communication is involved. The most fun you can have playing this game is from the occasional insane play and more often the insane memes from either side. The only killer that actually exists is definitely Nemesis, who killed people in his base game and their victims didn't repeatedly come back the same as before they died in order to haunt and vex the main protagonist who killed his wife.

Si estás aquí preguntándote si la comunidad es tan tóxica como todos dicen que es ... bueno, sí, lo es. No diría que es más o menos tóxico que las comunidades que encontrarás en CS: GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. ... pero el chat posterior al juego definitivamente puede asustar a un nuevo jugador.\nSi es nuevo en el juego, le recomiendo que lo juegue con uno o más amigos experimentados que puedan entrenarlo. Si no tienes la piel dura o mucha paciencia, jugar solo desde el principio probablemente hará que te enfurezcas. Dicho esto, muchas personas solo se divertirán con DbD si juegan con amigos. Y eso está bien y es completamente justo. La base del juego 4v1 es la cooperación, y no puedes garantizar que un juego aleatorio te respalde.\nHubo un período en el que me tomé este juego muy en serio y me lo arruinó por un tiempo. Después de tomarme un descanso, regresé y juré que solo lo jugaría por diversión, desconectándome en el segundo en que sentí que me estaba volviendo un poco salado o competitivo (EDITAR ~ Ni siquiera puedo creer que tenga que decir esto, pero Asumiré una culpa parcial por ello debido a mi redacción. Después de que alguien se tomó el tiempo de ir a mi perfil y llamarme por esta revisión en lugar de comentar justo debajo de donde realmente podría responder, sentí la necesidad de aclarar que no quise decir que desconecto en el juego. Terminaré un partido y dejaré de jugar. Admitiré que \"desconectar\" no era la palabra correcta, y debería haber dicho \"dejar de jugar\". Podrías haber dicho eso en lugar de simplemente criticarme por completo cuando nunca has jugado conmigo. En verdad, la toxicidad sobre la redacción que dejo aquí en mi reseña demuestra que tengo razón sobre la comunidad, ¿eh? Pero cualquiera que haya pasado tiempo jugando DbD sabe todo muy bien.)\nSoy un main survivor, pero disfruto jugar al asesino de vez en cuando. Creo que es extremadamente importante que todos los jugadores de DbD experimenten jugar al asesino. Tendrás toxicidad en el juego y después del juego cuando seas un sobreviviente, pero realmente no hay nada que pueda prepararte para el chat posterior al juego cuando eres el asesino. Tiendo a minimizar el chat para no verlo, o cambio mi nombre de usuario a algo amigable (lo que nadie debería tener que hacer, pero soy un amante, no un luchador). Si bien jugar al asesino puede ayudar a fortalecer tu piel contra la comunidad, es realmente útil para aprender a ser un mejor compañero de equipo mientras juegas como superviviente. También hay un asesino para todos. Si bien quiero ser el mejor con todos los asesinos en el juego, sucumbí al hecho de que simplemente no es una posibilidad para mí y probé todos los asesinos hasta que encontré uno que coincidía con mi estilo de juego.\n\nTengo muchas quejas sobre los desarrolladores, al igual que la mayoría de los jugadores. Cada actualización parece arreglar algo, pero romper algo más. El retraso del servidor es atroz y, últimamente, el emparejamiento es una completa broma (se supone que debes enfrentarte a jugadores de tu nivel de habilidad, pero no es raro que te empujen a un lobby con jugadores muy por debajo o por encima de tu nivel de habilidad nunca más). Ciertos beneficios están rotos, los hitboxes son BS y serás expulsado de los vestíbulos, menús y partidos, lo que requiere que tengas que reiniciar el juego por completo.\n\nHay jugadores amables y gentiles en este juego, y honestamente ellos son los que me mantuvieron cerca cuando comencé a jugar. Nunca olvidaré mi primera vez jugando al asesino en un partido público. Estaba nervioso y jugué terriblemente. En el chat posterior al juego, un jugador con más experiencia me animó: \"Eres un buen asesino, solo mira tú seguimiento\". Estuvieron dando vueltas y me dieron algunos consejos para practicar. Por supuesto, todos los juegos posteriores fueron tóxicos ... pero eso me dio suficiente energía para seguir intentándolo. Intento corresponder eso a los jugadores más nuevos cuando puedo.\n","timestamp_created":1600216450,"timestamp_updated":1618842894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76045390","author":{"steamid":"76561199010869197","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":38919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2972,"last_played":1655529338},"language":"english","review":"Lots of fun, especially with friends.","timestamp_created":1600216448,"timestamp_updated":1600216448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76045316","author":{"steamid":"76561198373492045","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1652219477},"language":"english","review":"like","timestamp_created":1600216326,"timestamp_updated":1600216326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76045243","author":{"steamid":"76561198060592526","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":17585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8456,"last_played":1653448310},"language":"english","review":"Servers have completely gone to **** since the last update.

I found it through watching youtubers like LordMinion777 and GarukuBluemoon years ago when I did not have a computer. I fell in love with the concept of the game, and avidly watched their uploads weekly until one day (like two years after a ps4 release) I found a physical copy in a local game store for the ps4! You bet I played that game constantly. Even better(?) it was in the free plus games that next month so my friends could all join me. I've never gotten past rank 12ish, but I do admit on ps4 I was really getting good I think?
