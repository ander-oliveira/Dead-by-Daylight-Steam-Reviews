Lots of survivors, killers and maps(need to use offering) to pick compared to their early access in 2016.\n\n2) New chapter every 3 months, means we're getting more surv, killer along with a map. \n\n3) Kinda fun experience if you got full 4-friends in a lobby.\n\n4) Easy to learn, pretty straight forward.\n-4a) Survivor basically just run, vault or dropping pallets to avoid being hit.\n-4b) Killer just run up and clap survivors ass, preventing them from escaping or doing gens.\n\n5) Fair price for base game and DLC, except for skins.\n\n\nCONs\n\n1) Hitbox is bigger than the models. In 2020 devs told us that its nothing wrong with hitboxes, its just internet latency between survivors and killer. BUT, sometimes we noticed that we got body blocked/stuck with other survivor/killer/objects eventhough looks like we can go pass them. I know everyone familiar with Huntress hatchet, Freddy's claw, Deathslinger's harpoon, etc.\n\n2) Balancing issue. They will nerfing Iron Will perk which is essential for Ash or any other loud survivors. Maybe they forgot Spirit with Stridor perk could easily find injured survivor. This game would never be balance since they keep adding overpowered/less effort perks for both sides. That is how meta perks are born. BUT, even based on current PTB 6.1.0, I think they're gonna have balancing in the future, they still doesn't look balance to me.\n\n3) False advertisement. Remembered when Legion, Ash Williams, Laurie and Mikaela were release? Yeah, these characters are broken specially Mettle of Man and Decisive Strike perks and how the old Legion's Frenzy work. They're paid DLC, I'm not complaining they nerfed the old Borrowed Time since its free. Don't get me wrong, they did good job on Freddy and Doctor.  \n\n4) Report and hacker issues. Report doesn't do anything, I submitted some complete report along with videos prove but they not even answering it and those hackers a still playing, not even have a banned record on their steam profile. 3 times my report with different hackers got ignored. So its safe to cheat, but don't use a cheap one.\n\n5) Survivor are helpless if they got facecamped, specially by Bubba or Trickster. \"JuSt dO tHe GeNs IdIoT\", \"BrInG BT nExT tImE\". Do you think its fun finding a match for like 7 minutes and got facecamped to death?\nSame goes for getting slugged by a high mobility killer like Nurse or Blight. If you think we should always equip meta perks like DS, BT, Unbreakable and Deliverance, what's the point of devs made other perks?\n\n6) New update along with new bugs and they take a really long time to fix them.\n\n7) Boring and repetitive interaction. Holding M1 to repair gens, heal, mend, opening exit gate. \nBeing chase? Just run around the obstacle and drop the pallet when killer can hit you.\n\n8) Despite all these issues, announcing David King as the first gay character and make a DBD Dating Simulator is far more important and the DBD Game Director, Mathieu Cote suggesting us to play something else instead of polishing their game. Pretty good job so far.\n\n9) This game could cause mental illness, please know when to stop. If you're killer main getting shamed by swf sweaty squad, please don't revenge on other survivors on your next match, they're innocent unless proven toxic behaviour.\nSame goes for survivor, don't teabag or clicky for no reasons, just escape when others teammates are safe/can't be save, don't bother waiting for killer to see you doing your $h1t. We're dealing with people here, and we're here to having fun, please have common sense.\n\nThis game got A LOT OF ISSUES. Keep in mind its just a video game, just go whatever perks build you want as long as you're having fun with or without friends. \n\n\nYours truly,\n- Survivor & killer main, former streamer, 4.5k+ hrs, not a legacy btw.","timestamp_created":1657066073,"timestamp_updated":1657066073,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":72,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.68619769811630249","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118291546","author":{"steamid":"76561199219567189","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4262,"playtime_at_review":40797,"last_played":1660597767},"language":"english","review":"the epitome of an unfun addicting game","timestamp_created":1657065858,"timestamp_updated":1657065858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479094088077545166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118290931","author":{"steamid":"76561198303796896","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":80017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1825,"playtime_at_review":72820,"last_played":1660599583},"language":"english","review":"Killer is unplayable.
