You may or may not [u]survive[/u] the last bit.\n\nThe graphics are alright, could probably use a bit more atmospheric fog here and there.\nThey do a good job of setting the tone for what you're in for...[i]most of the time.[/i]\nThe models and animations are pretty cool but some of them kind of feel dated.\n\nThat is understandable because the game came out in [b]2016.[/b]\nIn fact, I first heard of this because of a [b]PAYDAY 2[/b] Collaboration thing\nwhere they gave you Trapper™'s mask if you followed the game on steam. \n\nIt really didn't seem like my type of game at first. It took a few years and some friends\nto convince me it was worth a decent college try. \n\nSuffice it to say, [u]I'm glad I did![/u]\n\nThe character roster is pretty good and it is getting better. Licensed movie and game killers / survivors added to the mix make it feel like this game is like Smash Bros but for horror themed murder hide-n-seek.\n\nHave you ever wanted to see if [b]Ash™[/b] (Evil Dead) could survive an encounter with [b]Michael Myers™[/b] (Halloween)?\n\nHave you ever wanted to [b]Nemesis™[/b] (Resident Evil) in [b]Haddonfield™[/b] (Halloween) punching the lights out of peeps?\n\n[h1][b]WELL YOU CAN HAVE THAT HERE.[/b][/h1]\n\nThere are a lot of iconic horror movie characters the devs could put in the game and that idea alone excites me. Don't get me wrong, their original characters are great too. They have some very creative killers on the roster as well as survivors.\n\nBUT I LOVE PLAYING AS [u]ASH.[/u]\n\nAnyway, sound design is great too.\nGets the blood pumping as you try to hide and listen in.\n\nListen for the \"Terror Radius\" or that tell tale heartbeat sound.\nListen for the sound of footsteps.\nListen for the sounds of someone gasping in pain.\nListen for the sounds of someone bleeding out.\n[strike]Listen for the sounds of the killer getting really really close to where you were hiding just now.[/strike]\n\n[b]Too late, he found you.[/b]\n\nGame times can range from short quick sessions to pulse pounding but somewhat moderate. \nQueue times depend on region and time, so if you aren't picky about which one you wanna be (killer or survivor) you'll find a game fairly quickly. Though new DLC survivor/killers could influence that a little bit, so keep that in mind.\n\nAs with any online game, you'll see a fair amount of peeps disconnecting.\nThis is usually cause they get matched with a really good killer or a really good set of survivors. I've played with some peeps that flat out disconnect when they reach a specific map or get a specific killer when they play survivor.\n\nThere are a ton of cosmetics as well if you wanna really make a unique looking killer but they'll cost you some in-game currency but some of them are locked behind premium currency.\n\n[b]Hey drip don't come [i]cheap[/i], my dudes.[/b] \n\nbut if it makes you feel any better, you can use the same currency to unlock DLC survivors without getting their DLC on steam itself. I wouldn't do it personally but the option is there for people that want to.\n\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8/10\nPretty good for what it is. Do a few games, 20-30 min bursts and come back whenever.\nYou won't feel too bad even if you lose. Buy it on sale if you don't wanna pony up $10+\n\nAsh Williams was an automatic buy for me as far as DLC is concerned.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1009821/Dead_by_Daylight__Ash_vs_Evil_Dead/","timestamp_created":1624726027,"timestamp_updated":1624726353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94426870","author":{"steamid":"76561199064261900","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":80936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52474,"last_played":1656321672},"language":"japanese","review":"そんなことよりb4bやろうぜ","timestamp_created":1624725902,"timestamp_updated":1634318523,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459363967180252075","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94426864","author":{"steamid":"76561198137821814","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":5223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4706,"last_played":1657058551},"language":"french","review":"buggy

fun but sadly grindy, buggy and devs wont listen. \n\nYou will see that I have many hours in this game, and after writing this the hours will more likely than not go up more and more. So why I do not recommend this game?\n\nDbd is fun but the fun goes away as soon as you wish to play more often and level up to get the perks. The core of the game is perks, each killer and survivor has 3. You can level them up to unlock slots and later on, for other killers and survivors in a system called the blood web. This system was fine when the game rooster was small but now it way bigger and now dbd has a big grind problem. The bloodweb system has a lot of rng in it that make you waste blood points (you earn these from playing in matches) to the point that you can waste over 1 mil BPs that take hours and hours to gain only to waste them in less than few mins and hardly get perks you want/need yet alone all of them.\n\nThe next point. Someone in the subreddit posted daily about how the game has no color blind options but no updates about that until a journalist wrote about a dev talking about badly in a stream when asked about it.\n\nNow the content. DBD gets dlc every few months and the last few ones been broken and buggy. They also just add to the grind. \n\nSo if you wish to play this game all the power to you.

It's nothing new that the ranking system is trash, but for some reason when you reach purple ranks, and this goes for both killers and survivors, the toxicity skyrockets. Gray ranks and green ranks is where everyone is fine and nice but once you enter purple ranks, especially as a killer main, you'll notice a swift change in survivors behaviour, mainly that they'll be way more toxic in chat, teabag and flashlight spam. This is even more common with SWF (Survive With Friends) groups since they get cocky and think they're invincible. \n\nFor killers it doesn't change as much, they mostly just tunnel and facecamp (since they cant do much else). Of course this leaves an opportunity for other survivors do repair generators but it's not so fun to be the guy on the hook. \n\nIn summary, survivors are toxic and killers suffer more than them. If you're going to get DBD, make sure you have some friends who play it so you dont have to get flamed for nothing.
