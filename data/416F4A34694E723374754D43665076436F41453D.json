Mette ansia, devi completare obiettivi per scappare nel frattempo che un killer ti cerca per ucciderti. Il concept è un'idea con moltissimi pro ma in gioco non è iniettata bene. Inanzitutto il Killer è molto avvantaggiato rispetto ai sopravvisuti e inolte gli sviluppatori non risolvono bug ma pensano ad aggiungere contenuti e a creare eventi(che vanno a creare bug su altri bug[C'E' UN GIOCO IN QUESTO BUG]). La Grafica è ben sviluppata e gli altri meccanismi che fanno \"funzionare\" il gioco sono ben implementati ma del resto... Niente di bello. Inoltre dopo l'ultima patch (1.9.4), hanno aggiunto il sistema degli emblemi che ha reso ancora più difficile il compito di salire di rank... è quasi impossibile fare un pip e inoltre i giocatori che distraggono il killer e non si concentrano sui generatori però creando l'opportunità agli altri rimasti di finire gli obiettivi e scappare... invece di salire per il loro duro lavoro vengo penalizzati perchè non SEGUONO, le cose che gli sviluppatori dicono di fare... Io ci gioco da tantissimo tempo a questo gioco... sul mio profilo compaiono solo 30 ore e qualcosa ma su un altro profilo ne ho 400+ ore!

See bottom for that.\n\nThis review is SURVIVOR biased. My time on this game was 90% survivor and 10% killer\n\nI have invested a lot of time into this game. And a lot of it I've done on stream as display to others. Now i'll start with the good. This game is LOADS of fun with friends and coordinating with them gives you the sensation that you are truly in this game for survival. The dev's routinely adding DLC to diversify the game well enough to where it doesn't appear stale which is also good. And while playing alone the first few times you will get that horror feeling of feeling clueless and hopeless much like its intended to. \n\nNow the bad, the bad comes in when you've invested some decent time into this game (such as myself) and that's when the issue start coming through the cracks. First and foremost, this games connection issues are atrocious, killers with pings up in the 1,000s should not be allowed to play killer, its ridiculous because they control every aspect of the game and YOU as the survivor are to feel pain for it because he experiences no issues while you take 3 extra seconds to drop a pallete or jump over a window. Tunneling by killers is also a bad issues, if you as the survivor are doing well to stay away from the killer this is seen as a toxic action and the killer makes it their goal in life to make sure you don't get away and earn no points through the rest of the game, and if you add on an bad connection issue and possible puppy guarding or \"face camping\" you'll find yourself just wanting to put your head through a wall. \n\nAnother issue is no safety against a poor connection, if you connect to a game using a higher end offering or add on. And the killer DCs halfway through loading or right as the game starts. Those offering or add ons? Yea they're gone. You're not getting those back. Using them is a gamble before the game even starts\n\nWhich now segways into the next noticeable issue, the community. It's HORRIBLY toxic, to the point where even if you feel you play 100% correctly you'll upset someone regardless. But the issue is this, since everything is seen as toxic, the common reaction is for the killer or survivor to play toxic in response. Who has fun when that happens? No one. Not even the people who aren't in that situation. The other issue is unsportsmanlike conduct on survivors and how it severely ***** over their team. Imagine this, game starts right? Within 1 minute your teammate is down and in the process of being shouldered to be carried to a hook to start the sacrifice process. Well instead they DC, leaving the now 3 survivors to deal with 5 generators to repair and a now ****** off killer since he cant get more points now either. You ever repair 5 generators with 3 survivors? Yea no you're not, the odds are LARGELY stacked against you. Which will lead him to likely camp whoever he finds first because at that point securing kills is the smarter thing to do. And again post game it'll be nothing but toxicity being thrown back and forth which sucks all the fun away from it. Playing it at that point feels more like a chore than an enjoyable experience.\n\nAnother issue, coding. The game feels unpolished or basically unfinished at times. There are plenty of time a killer should NOT be able to hit you but since you haven't fully completed the animation of jumping out of a window or hoping a pallete you still get hit. While you probably matched with a guy with a MINIMUM 400+ ping so you took extra time to vault and he still rushed and smacked you. \n\nThe new ranking system is just awful much like everyone else says. The worst are people who purposely de rank themselves to play with casuals and inexperienced players for free points, so you'll get demolished by a rank \"20\" leatherface or trapper who's prestiged at least once or twice. If you have prestiged you should not be able to play with lower ranking folks, you CLEARLY know what you're doing with that character. And the medals make the game even more toxic at times, resulting in MORE fighting.\n\nThis was one of my favorite games, truly it was. But everything the dev's do with adding DLC but not fixing BASIC coding issues shows they just want to make more money and not fix their product which was arguably better when it first came out. \n\nEdit: Now with a few hundred more hours under my belt\n\nWell, they have done a lot of quality of life improvements, like the party system thank god. But on the whole my only issue largely comes with killers still being favored in perks and gameplay. They seem to be getting stronger and better with each update. The deck still seems largely stacked against survivors even still. Maybe that's what they are going for? Don't know but I wish the game wasn't largely so biased to the Killers. My favorite example is stacking no-ed on top of the new end game system? Yea you're not getting out if you're seen and the killer is remotely competent. Killers get crutches, Survivors are told to get better. That's just how I see it. The game is still fun with friends, and connection issues seem to be far less frequent. The new charm system is kinda cool? It's there? It's something. All aesthetics and adds some life and personalization to the game so that's noteworthy. But again this is all my opinion, granted a lot of it is based on how people play and not guaranteed factors that WILL happen. But hey that's what reviews are for. But I will recommend the game now for the fun factor if you're just looking for a good product worth $20.

Played most of my hours on Xbox One.  Tonight I've uninstalled the game and strongly suggest anyone else thinking of playing to do the same.\n\nI play killer exclusively.  The game is rigged against killers.  You'll have a good time at first but you'll finally reach the point where the following things will happen:\n\n1. As soon as you grab a survivior, they disconnect.  Other survivors follow.  You lose your add-ons and don't get compensated for them.\n\n2. Survivors are suffering from a warping bug... where they jump between 5 and 10 feet every few seconds.  Makes it impossible to hit them.\n\n3. Lunge attacks become untenable.  You can be right on top of a survivor, lunge attack them, and totally miss repeatedly in one match.  In another?  Hitting as expected.  Obvious bug.\n\n4. A coordinated group of survivors will trigger multiple generators within the first two minutes of the game.  You can do nothing to stop them.\n\n5. When chasing a survivor, they simply turn in a few circles and vanish.  Good luck finding them.  Extra problems if you're on the farm levels... the fucking corn is a mess.\n\n6. If you hook a survivor and don't face camp them then they'll be saved by others.  Yay.  If you do camp them then you're subject to ridicule and verbal attack.  Lose / lose.\n\n7. Numerous bugs when occur when you're attacking survivors in various situtaions.  One of my favorites being when attacking a survivor being unhooked by another, it's 75% guaranteed to hit the one being unhooked and causing no damage whatsoever.  Second favorite?  Getting stuck in a pallet and being unable to move until the next match.\n\nIs it worth $20?  Sure.  But is it worth your gaming time?  No way.  This game could be so much more.  But, instead, it's been coded by amateurs that don't give one iota about your time or money spent.\n\nGonna go spend my time playing games not plagued with bugs and ridiculous issues.","timestamp_created":1526700411,"timestamp_updated":1526700411,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543658673763275146","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42111071","author":{"steamid":"76561197999100725","num_games_owned":505,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":36834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":56,"playtime_at_review":5224,"last_played":1660436725},"language":"english","review":"They Made their Discord REQUIRE a Cell Phone Number.\nThus, I can not join others, talk, play or anything. \nSo This Game Is Not Fun Solo (Unless Killer).\noverall, just fun. hate how many things are bad with it but still fun overall.\n","timestamp_created":1526699955,"timestamp_updated":1607546855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42109196","author":{"steamid":"76561198292983881","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1636722876},"language":"schinese","review":"玩家素质极差，新人第一局打对面就遇到拔线的，之后真是什么狗东西都遇到了，欺负刚玩的萌新不熟悉地图？你遛我可以，你躲着不走地窖也不修电机，就一个人躲着是什么意思，逼着萌新屠夫退游戏？我找了20分钟，就是不走，躲猫猫？，素质真的差","timestamp_created":1526690055,"timestamp_updated":1526690055,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520924508571624756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42108463","author":{"steamid":"76561198285529018","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1518363776},"language":"swedish","review":"skitspel\n","timestamp_created":1526685856,"timestamp_updated":1526685856,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42108339","author":{"steamid":"76561198082514389","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":208205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":128,"playtime_at_review":85022,"last_played":1660384947},"language":"english","review":"Skillchecks are hard ;(","timestamp_created":1526685168,"timestamp_updated":1612162170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467289716005325317","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42107387","author":{"steamid":"76561198035984969","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":105596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":81,"playtime_at_review":5993,"last_played":1660439486},"language":"english","review":"Overall, I like DBD more than I dislike it.\n\nThe game is still working on balance but it is fun overall.\n\nPros:\n- Fun multiplayer options with your friends. You can play with friends as all survivors in survive with friends or play the sandbox mode in kill your friends. In kill your friends, everything is unlocked for you but you don't earn any blood points or shards in this mode. \n\n- There is a lot of variety in the survivors and the killers. You can pick and choose your playstyle which is nice. There are 3 \"teachable\" perks for every survivor and once you get to a high enough level with that survivor, if you obtain the teachable perk, it will start appearing in other survivors webs. This means you can match your playstyle with other characters with enough time.\n\n- You can also pick your aesthetic as well to a limited degree. As described above, each survivor has their own set of unique perks that can become teachable later on so you can get your favorite perks on your favorite survivor. The outfits are also kind of nice. You can purchase some but also get them through prestiging (when you hit level 50, you can keep unlocking new bloodwebs for new items/offerings/perks OR you can prestige and reset a survivor to level 1 and open up new outfits and also increase the chances of getting better items/offerings/perks on that prestiged survivor's bloodweb)\n\n- There is a thing called the shrine and with enough shards (a currency you earn by playing the game) you can buy perks before unlocking them on each survivor's web. This is just a time shortcut so that you don't have to play the game for ages before getting your ideal combination of perks and looks.\n\nCons:\n- Balance issues. Certain combinations of perks, items, and offerings are really overpowered.","timestamp_created":1526680311,"timestamp_updated":1526680431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499587148427963257","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42106732","author":{"steamid":"76561198425620797","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":115792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75884,"last_played":1631129557},"language":"english","review":"good shit","timestamp_created":1526677171,"timestamp_updated":1564698948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42106462","author":{"steamid":"76561198252998775","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":202646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3922,"playtime_at_review":21409,"last_played":1660585686},"language":"german","review":"A great Game, with a nice System.

It looks like it's that time again. \nEither the steam sale is upon us or you've found yourself looking for something new.\n\nYou're asking yourself that question yet again.\n\"Should I buy this game?\"\n\nUnfortunately, it's not as simple as yes or no, but I'll cut through the fancy talk and hit you with some questions of my own.\n\nAre you a competitive person?\nDo you typically play with friends but have times when you just want to play by yourself?\nDo you like bullying or getting bullied?\nAre you fond of abusing game design?\nDid you play Evolve before it [strike] died [/strike] became free to play?\n\nIf you answered 'yes' to one or more of these questions, then you might enjoy Dead by Daylight.\n\nThat said, here's my take: Like any game, Dead by Daylight isn't for everyone. If you rage or get stressed out easily, then consider not picking the game up. But, if you're a masochist or a sadist, then this might be the game for you. There's loads of room to bully or get bullied, on either side of the community.\n\nRegardless what anyone says, the game has plenty of depth and anything can work if you're skilled [spoiler] or your opponents are shit [/spoiler]. But, unfortunately, there's a pretty dominant meta when it comes to player loadouts. As with any competitive game, certain loadouts are just outright better than others. Also, being a competitive game, people can be toxic. Either intentionally (for laughs) or because they have brain damage. That's just the nature of the beast when it comes to this type of game.\n\nJokes aside, Dead by Daylight is a fun game once you understand the intricacies of how to play it and how to combat certain play styles. Additionally, it's a good party game for five to six people. There's a private lobby system that allows a group to test out features of the game or to just simply play against each other.\n\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to you.

It is 100% a strategy and could backfire if you choose to continue to do your objectives.
