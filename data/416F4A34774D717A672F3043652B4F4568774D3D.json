The main goal for survivors is to fix gens and open the door and escape and the killers goal is to kill all and win. Both killer and survivor have perks and the perks can be the deciding point of the game. The amount of original characters and licence killers are decent same with survivors but they all have their own unique set of perks and you have to level them up to get their perk to be on others blood web. The character you play as for survivor means nothing if you have all the perks but for the killers it means a lot. All the killers have their own unique set of abilities and they all have their special add ons that can change how they play by a huge amount. For DBD I would give it a 8/10 the music, characters, and maps are nice but there are some toxic players that will face camp and tunnel but not every match but it is still an issue that I run into but there are many fun matches that I go into. But there are the rifts as well that give out tons of bloodpoints for playing the game and doing special objectives if you are new and want to level up quick.","timestamp_created":1636514264,"timestamp_updated":1636514264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102517404","author":{"steamid":"76561199209976513","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":78,"playtime_at_review":3912,"last_played":1660515943},"language":"english","review":"if you wanna reason to live play another game","timestamp_created":1636513589,"timestamp_updated":1636513589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102517348","author":{"steamid":"76561198128661967","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":81386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":911,"playtime_at_review":66452,"last_played":1660602139},"language":"brazilian","review":"Recomendo muito!

someone who has played this game a ton on PS4 and now has a gaming computer to play it on PC, I do enjoy this game. I'm more of a survivor main then a killer and when I play killer, it's not seriously. \n\nThis game is special. It's the first of its kind, the father of many who try to follow in it's footsteps. It has a little something for everyone. Like being chased in a spooky world, check. Like creative killers with fun powers, check. Like facing off or being one of the many horror movie and game icons, check. Like challenges with xp rewards, check. Like backstories for both the killers and survivors, check!\n\nIt's not a perfect game. There are bugs that take some time to patch and sometimes you will run into hackers that will hold the game hostage (tho there are fun hackers who just entertain you). And the recently changed the old ranking system to a new MRR one that didn't fix any of the match making problems, the only good thing about it is now when your rank resets, you get xp based on your rank. And while cross-platform playing is great for short wait times, there is server troubles and no post game chat for anyone besides PC.\n\nThe ONE BIG PROBLEM I really dislike about this game is you basically have to pick a platform. You can't share your account from console to PC or vis versa. All that money I put into expansions and outfits from PS4 ARE JUST FOR PS4, along with the hours of gameplay to level up characters. That's a really big grind! I almost have all the expansions for PC now, but trying to play and get all the season challenges (the archives) for both platforms is a big time dump.\nI DON'T MIND buying the expansions for both platforms, it supports the developers as they worked hard on making this content, I just wish there was a way to link my accounts so they can have a shared progress and that I don't have to grind or buy outfits that I already put the time or money into getting. \n\nSo if you want this game, PICK YOUR FAVOURITE PLATFORM! I couldn't play this on my old gaming laptop (I learned that after buying and trying) which is why I played it on PS4. Now that I have all those hours on the PS4, it's hard to grind on my new gaming PC. So pick wisely~!","timestamp_created":1636501937,"timestamp_updated":1636502176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102510846","author":{"steamid":"76561198453418158","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":22671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2579,"last_played":1659049164},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego me salvó la vida.\n\nYo tengo 27.\n\nMi ex esposa y yo tenemos una hija juntos y adoptamos a nuestro hijo juntos. Ahora ambos tienen 4 años.\n\nCuando atravesamos nuestra separación, me sentí perdido y miserable. Yo era autodestructivo. Un día me enojé tanto por todo lo que estaba fuera de mi control que golpeé un poco de concreto en un momento de emoción abrumadora. Eso hizo que me rompiera mi quinto metacarpiano en mi mano derecha ... mi mano que trabaja ... mi mano de juegos ... la mano que sostuve y con la que llevé a mis hijos a la cama ... La mano que necesitaba desesperadamente para asegurarme de poder continuar proporcionando.\n\nDespués de enterarme de la gravedad de mi daño autoinfligido, estaba al borde del suicidio. Tenga en cuenta que solo unos meses antes de esto, era el hombre más feliz sin antecedentes de depresión o ansiedad. Nunca he tenido ataques de rabia, ni he sido de los que se derrumban y lloran, pero estaba en un punto bajo que realmente me enterró de poder ver la luz del otro lado.\n\nNo teniendo nada mejor que hacer, busqué un juego que pudiera jugar, CON UNA MANO mientras me recuperaba. De alguna manera me topé con este juego y leí algunas de las críticas. Decidí que tenía que valer la pena intentarlo ... Debo admitir que no gané el juego, ni jugué tanto como algunos de ustedes. De hecho, es posible que solo haya jugado este juego uno o dos días. Dicho esto, después de hacerlo, tuve una nueva alegría y esperanza de vida. Pude dejar atrás el dolor y el sufrimiento que se había apoderado de mí. Pude experimentar la alegría y la felicidad de otras personas. Pude ver los frutos de mi \"trabajo\". Me relajé durante 5 ♥♥♥♥ con esta música el tiempo suficiente para darme cuenta de que iba a estar bien.\n\nDespués de darme cuenta de eso, apagué el juego y volví a trabajar. Me dolía la mano como el infierno, pero estaba motivado. Dejé de sentir maldita lástima por mí mismo y me convertí en el padre que necesitaba ser en ese momento, no en el chico débil con el que me estaba comportando.\n\nHoy, soy un amigo cercano de la madre de mis hijos. No peleamos, discutimos ni decimos cosas hirientes entre nosotros. Somos padres y amigos.\n\nAhora tengo 3 hijos. Mi tercer hijo es, espéralo, TAMBIÉN 4 AÑOS. La mujer con la que estoy estaba pasando por una situación muy similar en el momento de mi propia separación, y nos topamos inesperadamente con la vida del otro. Hemos estado en una relación durante un año y estamos muy felices juntos.\n\nMoraleja de la historia, nunca sabes lo que te depara la vida, y si me hubiera rendido cuando todas las probabilidades estaban en mi contra, no estaría donde estoy hoy. Este pequeño juego tonto me ayudó a darme cuenta de eso.\n\nGracias","timestamp_created":1636501793,"timestamp_updated":1636501793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484673231840133667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102510606","author":{"steamid":"76561198202403283","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13884,"last_played":1653932601},"language":"english","review":"this
