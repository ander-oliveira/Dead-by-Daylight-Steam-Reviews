When moving up the ranks as a killer (you start at lvl20 and move your way to lvl1 depending on your performance) I started noticing a large increase of players taunting me by using the ever-classic t-bag motion any chance they had. By rank 12, and keep in mind I'm only playing as killer, the after match chat started getting impressive with the level of aggressive comments/statements; anywhere from wishing death to visit my mother to taking the option of killing myself in a swift way. Further down the ranks people seemed to have a problem with any killer I played. I had one gentleman state that he was toxic ONLY when playing against a Deathslinger because he's too powerful. A few games later I revisited Deathslinder to be later insulted for my poor choice of underpowered killer. The game is quite fun, but you will need to learn to ignore people, which is tragic because you will be playing with people every game. Hackers do exist, even with the anti-cheat system in place, but it's not very common. I do recommend the game, but don't take anything personally.","timestamp_created":1627091773,"timestamp_updated":1636808838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96267846","author":{"steamid":"76561198874436909","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":278,"playtime_at_review":1643,"last_played":1660599088},"language":"brazilian","review":"⡴⠑⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

of the problems that have been a thing since its conception. not to mention how political the dev team is and the censorship. and oh boy dont even get me started on the community. to put it lightly,

Most things that the algorithm censors aren't even swears. Example given \"Where are you from?\" Or even the killers names or mechanics that are in the game. Asking someone \"Why did you kill yourself on hook\" is censored. \nThe developers are slow (blind and rarely do) in nerfing OP things and find it more important to make new updates with new perks and killers instead of fixing old bugs and by doing so they bring in EVEN MORE GAME BREAKING BUGS.\n\nThe only reason why i have so many hours in this flaming hot LGBT dumpster fire is the fact that its addictive, adrenaline enducing, makes you think and react fast and from time to time you meet some really lovely people that you end up becoming friends.\n\nThe MMR system was the final nail to the coffin + all the LGBT propaganda. This is a horror game not a dating simulator. All the depressed worthless lgbt degenerates that are borderline suicidal just play this game to make normal people miserable by playing as toxic and unfair as possible. \n\n07 July 2022\nAfter deleting the game for 4 months i decided to install it again. In the span of less than a week i encountered 4 or more blatant cheaters. Every game is against a nurse with the most unfun OP broken build \"starstruck,agitation, pain resoinance, dead mans switch\" with purple range and green recharge add on. Even an autistic disabled dog that has drank beer from the toilet 3 months without stopping can get a 4k with this build. But hey atleast they made the manliest survivor in the game homosexual FOR NO REASON after 6 years of him being heterosexual. That will bring back all the rainbow rats back to this game right? In the end they only matter right? Its 2022 its forbidden to be heterosexual anymore. \n\nForshadowing:\nThe next update will fully change the meta to be killer sided. They are making tooo many changes most of which are horrible and will tip the scales drastically in one way, making it extremely unfun/impossible to solo queue with the typical brainless russian dogs with parents who are brother and sister. \n\nThey are making a dating simulator game to satisfy all the lgbt members who are borderline pedofiles and should never see the life of day. My disappointment is immeasurable.\n\nThey are making an an anime crossover too. I don't even want to comment on how much i hate anime loving weaboos.\n\nWhen the new update comes i will delete the game again  (hopefully forever).","timestamp_created":1627079903,"timestamp_updated":1657907833,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96261244","author":{"steamid":"76561198989568707","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4322,"last_played":1645133278},"language":"russian","review":"Игра классная. \nПлюсы:\n1) интересная система игры, примерно на 50 часов потом надоедает. \n2) лучше играть в пати, так что игра командая(рандом ужасный) \nМинусы:\n1) долго ищит за убийцу, но, главное но, ищит долго только на низких рангах, тобишь от 20 до 10,дальше быстрее, особенно на +- 8-1.\n2) плахой баланс убийц, прям очень, я купил убийц 5 и все разные, тоесть на некоторых я делаю минус 4 за 10 минут, ну так на чили, а иногда минус 1 и то за 20 , может и дольше. (Из маньеков советую - трюкач(у него казнь классная), дух (но нудны очень хорошие наушники), палач(прикольная система клеток и второй казни, типо казнь но без мори, палач сложный , хоть и херачит сквозь стену, попасть сложно, я на 9 ранге.) \nИ кстати даже сам разроботчик на своем стриме играя за нимезиса не видит его ужасный баланс, просто три удара щупальцем и все он нокнутый, ты даже можешь не старатся, потому что падетки он ламает быстро, а удар равен выпаду, тут и обычный удар то не нужен, только щупальце. \n3) галимый спавн палеток, играя за убийцу ты можешь словить их штук 5 , а играя за выжевшего, ты можешь вообще палеток не устретить и уйдешь сущности на ужин. \n4) ужасный подбор:\n1) я играю на 9 ранге, вроде не высокий, но блин как на первом, не даже на -1, потому что что вижу у ютуберов и у стримеров когда они играют за убийцу на 1 ранге у нах все так легко, у них нету таких мансеров как у меня, типо увидел я ролик сегодня, самая слажная игра за 8к часов, смотрю ну и что я вижу, всё тоже самое что и уменя, тоесть люди с 10 по 8 ранг играют как -1, сложна да, можно их убить да. Но не суть, типо смурфы и усе такое, все равно их весело убивать. \n5) додики, нет не токсики, которые посылают тебя, а додики, у которых по 300 часов. Типо, вот недавно, вешаю чела на крюк, ухожу, причем далеко, потом вижу слева бегут к крюку спасать, ну я на разворот, и нокаю двоих, того кого они сняли и того кто снимал,  после игры я замучался коменты чистить, я же не стою около крюка( и да так делвют многие на маленьких рангах, типо чтоб выше пробраться, но на высоких даже так снимут) \n6) перки, они вроде норм ,но нет, есть очень по ситуации которые тебе даже не понадобятся, есть нужные. \nИтоги:игра хорошая, но сложная, лучше играть в пати если выживший, если хочешь играть за убийцу то купи всех, поиграй на всех, и реши какой больше нравится, и играй только за него. \nВсего плохого!!","timestamp_created":1627079816,"timestamp_updated":1627079816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96261118","author":{"steamid":"76561198974253260","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":38020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":38,"playtime_at_review":4229,"last_played":1659504566},"language":"english","review":"The game is really fun and addicting but theres just a lot of toxic assholes in it.","timestamp_created":1627079596,"timestamp_updated":1641944348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96260776","author":{"steamid":"76561198084114081","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":8229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3096,"last_played":1658382944},"language":"english","review":"slugged :D","timestamp_created":1627078993,"timestamp_updated":1627078993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96260654","author":{"steamid":"76561198052336675","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":9857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3657,"last_played":1639778315},"language":"russian","review":"Минус исключительно из-за сломанного баланса манов, поднятых хитбоксов для охотницы, сверхбыстрого колокольчик и дух, эти топ 3 попадаются каждую катку, ведь их пропатчили так, чтобы нытики на манах перестали жаловаться на силу выживших.

Za każdym razem zastanawiam się grając zabójca, kiedy spróbują mnie wykiwać, albo kiedy wpadną w moje maniakalne sidła xD.\n Grając ocalałym jest trudniej skupiasz swą uwagę nie tylko na kilerze, który chcę cię siłą zaciągnąć na hak ale i na inne rzeczy, które są ci niezbędne do ucieczki np. skrzynie gdzie znajdziesz latarkę aby oślepić przeciwnika, apteczkę, czy skrzynkę z narzędziami; generatory, które trzeba naprawić aby wgl dało się otworzyć bramę: twoi sojusznicy wiszących na haku, których trzeba ściągnąć jak najszybciej.\n Dead by daylight moim zdaniem ma duży potencjał i jest grą na wiele godzin dobrej zabawy.","timestamp_created":1627077298,"timestamp_updated":1627077298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96259689","author":{"steamid":"76561198930190621","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1653267105},"language":"english","review":"i would tell you it is a good game but only if you play it consle because i have spent hours trying to get it to work on my pc but it lags so bad i can not play it","timestamp_created":1627077167,"timestamp_updated":1627077167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96259674","author":{"steamid":"76561198382453866","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4152,"last_played":1653514878},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1627077149,"timestamp_updated":1627077149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96259647","author":{"steamid":"76561199026198430","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2773,"last_played":1645802249},"language":"russian","review":"самом деле сойдет поиграть вместе с друзьями игра хорошая баланс я лучше буду молчать могу сказать - этой игре это кемпере ман как они надоели эти кемперы","timestamp_created":1627077104,"timestamp_updated":1627077104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96259009","author":{"steamid":"76561198238523916","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":106819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2631,"playtime_at_review":47557,"last_played":1660603489},"language":"brazilian","review":"Se quiser passar raiva por causa de um Dead Hard que o seu ''dash'' vá no chão, tamo ai!

Точнее, была бы такой, если бы не куча недостатков. Про комьюнити с их фейскемпингами, туннелингами, генрашами и так далее знают все. Генраш особенно ужкасен и с этим ничего не поделать. Ещё ужасный баланс, который почти постоянно наклоняется в сторону сурвов. Но это ладно, это мелочи жизни. Есть кое что пострашнее. \n\n[b] ЭКОНОМИКА [/b]\n\nВ чём здесь дело. Чтобы нормально играть и получать удовольствие, надо качать персонажа, будь то ман или сурв. Надо добывать для них новые перки и предметы. И вот тут-то и находится проблема игры. ЛЮТЫЙ ФАРМ. \nДопустим, мы играем за маньяка [i] (ибо, в отличие от сурвов, маньяк не зависит от командной работы и может получить куда больше очков крови (далее ОК)- местной XP-валюты) [/i] и нам надо получить крутой перк, чтобы наконец-то перестать мучиться с генрашерами. И вот тут-то и приходит фарм. [b] Ведь даже с тем фактом что ман получает больше всего ОК, без одноразовых предметов-баффов он получает их ничтожно малое количество, которым на высоких уровнях и трети сетки кровавой паутины не забить, а чтобы получить эти баффы, надо качать кровавую паутину. [/b] Проблемно, да? И я ещё не закончил. Чтобы получить нужный бафф, нужно, чтобы у тебя А) была удача, Б) куча ОК, потому что ты будешь продираться сквозь кучку гoвeных баффов, и В) скорость и своевременность, ведь нормальные баффы валюты вылезают в паутине только во время ивентов, а между ними тебе приходится играть без них. \n\nВ итоге мы имеем прогнившую систему фарма экспы, где тебе надо откатать в среднем 5-6 довольно долгих матчей, чтобы заполнить хотя бы пару уровней. И далеко не факт, что за всё это ты получишь то что хотел. \n\n[b] НО ЭТО ЕЩЁ НЕ ВСЁ! [/b] Знаете, как надо качать сурвов и манов, чтобы у них появлилсь более крутые способности?! НАДО КАЧАТЬ ДРУГИХ СУРВОВ И МАНОВ, У КОТОРЫХ ЭТА СПОСОБНОСТЬ ЕСТЬ ПО УМОЛЧАНИЮ, ЧУТЬ ЛИ НЕ ДО ПОТОЛКА, А В ТЕОРИИ ПРОКАЧАТЬ ИХ ВСЕХ! Господи, да от такого свихнуться можно. Чтобы просто получить пару крутых перков, я должен потратить где-то часов 70-80 на игру и до кучи своих нервов, ведь матчи здесь вытягивают из тебя всю энергию и нервы. \n\nДонатов на Очки Крови, самое удивительное, нет. Весь донат в этой игре останавливается на покупке Золотых Очков, за которые можно покупать новых сурвов с манами и одежду. Так что нетерпеливым богачам придётся сильно попотеть. \n\nВ теории все проблемы с экономикой можно было бы решить следующими путями: реворком Кровавой Паутины, чтобы тебе не пришлось на высоких левлах мучиться с кучей гoвнa и дичайшим рандомом, реворком самих одноразовых баффов и перков, чтобы 80% представляло из себя хоть что-то полезное, ребалансировкой цен за вещи в Кровавой Паутине или введением полноценных донатов. [b] И я знаю, что разрабы не сделают из этого списка ничего, потому что лютый фарм является двигателем прогресса в этой игре.
