Es kommen immer wieder Updates und neue Sachen, die alles noch spannender machen. Zudem sind eigentlich immer Spieler online, die abwechslungsreich spielen. \nNun zu den Sachen, die mich etwas stören: Ja, es gibt nicht selten Bugs, allerdings macht es umso mehr Spaß, wenn man dann normal spielen kann, was ausgiebig möglich ist, wenn man eine gute Internetverbindung und Geduld hat XD\nFür Neueinsteiger ist es wirklich manchmal schwer ins Spiel reinzukommen, das stimmt. Es wäre schön, wenn man bei den Einstellungen die Möglichkeit hätte auszuwählen, gegen welche Rang-klasse man spielt, damit man nicht so einen OP Killer hat, der die Neulinge sofort killt. Dennoch finde ich es auch nicht schlimm, wenn man gemischt spielt. Einige stört das vielleicht, aber wenn man in der Gruppe, also als Team gut zusammenarbeitet, dann kann man auch als Anfänger gut Spaß haben. Hängt natürlich immer von den Mitspielern ab.\nIch habe sowohl gute als auch negative Erfahrungen am Spiel gehabt und muss zusammenfassend sagen, dass es trotz der Bugs, die zwischendurch auftreten, ein sehr gutes und spaßiges Game ist.

However, it suffers A LOT from poor balancing that seems to be focused entirely on players that have all the unlocks in the game. \n\nIf you've ever played Dota or League of Legends you should already be accustomed to this, except in DBD it's actually worse - in Dota and League of Legends, other players do not get inherent advantages over you for having played longer, besides naturally having a better understanding of the game and more experience. In DBD, playtime = unlocking actual gameplay modifiers, meaning that people that have played more than you will ALWAYS have an advantage over you that may in some cases be impossible to outplay. \n\nIt's on the step below pay2winning - that is fortunately impossible in the game, as the only thing you can really buy is DLC characters (that DO however have their own unique abilities that are otherwise inaccessible.). If the game would've had pay2win elements, i would have had nothing but hate for it. As it is, i can respect the idea, despite the execution being extremely flawed.\n\nFor new players, Dead by Daylight is a good excuse to hang out with three friends (IF YOU VOICE CHAT), and very little else.\n\nIf you are willing to waste roughly 140 hours of your life to be given the opportunity to start playing Dead by Daylight FOR REAL, then you should give the game a try. If you are NOT willing to spend 140 empty hours of your life replaying the exact same maps with the exact same high rank max level killers that has all the unlocks available in the game when you're starting out at level 1 with literally NOTHING available, then steer clear.\n\nI understand that the game may at one time have been fun, but because of endless power creeping (constantly making characters stronger based on the average level and available unlocks of players) this is literally unplayable when you're just starting out. As a survivor, all the killers are designed to be able to handle survivors that has unlocked every single perk in the game, across all the characters available - including DLCs. So when you do NOT have all the unlocks in the game, you're unfortunately still allowed to start matches so you can ruin them for everybody else because unlike them, you haven't already logged over 700 hours in the game and been along for the ride since the closed beta.\n\nAs a killer, we're at a reverse dilemma - all the survivors have all the unlocks possible in the game, while you have nothing. So you're pit against 4 players with 700+ hours logged and expected to beat them without a single unlock.\n\nIf you play non-stop, you'll typically be able to get your first \"good\" unlock 5 hours into the game. This amounts to roughly 15-20 defeats / hatch escapes (when you are the last man standing because you couldnt help the other survivors, you can escape instantly if you find a secret hatch in every level.).\n\nRepeat this every single match, usually consisting of killers that can run roughly 30% faster than you and typically see you through walls thanks to their unlocked perks, for a week or so, and you'll unlock your first perk. Congratulations! Now you need to repeat this on AT LEAST 3 other characters one by one, and then you have to play a fifth character to a high enough level that you can use all the four perks from the four first characters you leveled up.\n\nThought you were good to go, huh?\n\nNah, you also need to depend on RNG giving you the essential skills and items you require to have even a slight chance against a killer, even if that killer is brand new to the game just like you. The survivors typically need something like 100 hours of experience for every 10 hours the killers have if they are to have so much as a sliver of hope that they can survive them without letting all their ally survivors die so they can bail through the hatch.\n\nDon't waste your money. Wait for AT LEAST a 70% sale before you even think about buying this, or better yet an 80%-90% sale. Lukewarm sewage is more fun to play with than this, and honestly it's a shock this is even out of it's early access stage - never mind multiple seasons in with several DLCs.","timestamp_created":1578082658,"timestamp_updated":1578102248,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440593093633651733","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61236371","author":{"steamid":"76561198169344289","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":663,"last_played":1639315335},"language":"russian","review":"Интересная игра из за своей механики","timestamp_created":1578082615,"timestamp_updated":1578082615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61236104","author":{"steamid":"76561198185478941","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":40501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1658109021},"language":"portuguese","review":"Jogabilidade dinâmica e muito divertida!","timestamp_created":1578082341,"timestamp_updated":1578082341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61235603","author":{"steamid":"76561198965832025","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":10051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1146,"last_played":1645405673},"language":"english","review":"lost the person i grew a large heart for from this game and now i cant look at this game","timestamp_created":1578081850,"timestamp_updated":1643858638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61235537","author":{"steamid":"76561198354522736","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":48166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1689,"playtime_at_review":10918,"last_played":1660605624},"language":"english","review":"fun most of the time","timestamp_created":1578081788,"timestamp_updated":1578081788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61235120","author":{"steamid":"76561198075811010","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":37761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2895,"last_played":1656946016},"language":"polish","review":"fajny coop w klimatach survival horroru, milion kombinacji taktycznych jak wykiwać zabójcę i jak wykiwać uciekinierów (jako zabójca).

They either get stuck in a pallet drop loop, Or they seem to disregard everything and Just run into your power or run in a straight line to the nearest open field. They seem to be unable to gauge their proximity to the killer and other survivors when preforming actions resulting in the death of their fellow survivors and free hooks from the killer. \n\nLastly the NPC's response in post game chat seems to be bugged, All they seem to do is spout slurs and insults. It seems the better you do and more kills you achieve the more they tell you how the killer should be played and the more vulgar the NPC's become.\n\n\nTLDR- Good game, NPC's pathing needs to be worked on, NPC's post game responses inverted on how well killer does in the round.","timestamp_created":1578080178,"timestamp_updated":1578080178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61233797","author":{"steamid":"76561198282273283","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1658088412},"language":"russian","review":"+","timestamp_created":1578080081,"timestamp_updated":1578080081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xuK5tu8CdajL6QE="}
