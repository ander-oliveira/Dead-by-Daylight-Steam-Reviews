Cause victims are more powerful than killer.\nMaybe first two weeks it'll be funny and precious interesting to play this game in processing asking me what I've found bad here. But it'll be a few weeks, after you want to play killer and understand everything. It's painful to be a rapist. \nYou chase one guy all the game crushing f...ing pallets, maybe finally catch him and understand that the gates are opened and your last actions you can do- it's just try to kill this bastard you catched before which now is suspended on the crook (hook). And just try to keep him there, cause it's impossible if you're playing by Nurse or Wraith. Understand this and you'll get that this game is not about avoid the killer and escape the trial, it's about how to catch them all the victims. \nI still keep silent and don't talk about the optimization and community. So if you want to play- then play, but it's maximum for one-two month.","timestamp_created":1528900372,"timestamp_updated":1528900372,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48461538553237915","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42699393","author":{"steamid":"76561198133973583","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2973,"last_played":1538166033},"language":"russian","review":"Ребята, вы все похерили.\nПокупала игру в декабре 2016 году. Да, на тот момент, игра была не идеальна, но она хотя бы нормально работала. Были небольшие лаги, но их хотя бы фиксили. Но постепенно с каждым играть становилось все сложнее и сложнее. Не в плане моего нубства. нет. ДбД начала конкретно лагать, зависать, постоянно выбрасывать из лобби, хотя с подключением к интернету все просто прекрасно. Но и это терпелось, ведь игра с друзьями все покрывает.\nСпустя полугодовой перерыв, решили с друзьями снова поиграть в эту замечательнушйю (нет) игру. И что вы думаете? После этого последнего обновления на почти 5(!!!) гигов, все пошло по конкретной п***е. Игра совершенно не оптимизирована, постоянно выбрасывает из лобби, постоянно лагает, но самое противное то, что игра ЗАВИСАЕТ во время матчей на несколько минут, а потом выкидывается вообще. ФПС вообще выше 6-10 не поднимался. При этом всем рекомендованные системные требвания соблюдены с лихвой.\nОчень жаль расставаться с игрой, котооая подавала большие надежды.

Right down to the gameplay, the perspectives of survivor and the killer and especially the thrill early on with playing the game that you get on both sides regardless of if you play killer or survivor. Despite the occasional bugs, exploits, balancing issues, toxicity and BM'ing that you might find in some parts of the DBD community, overall I love how this game is going and think it's truly got great potential and promise in store for it. \n\nFrom my point of view if I had to be critical of DBD I would only suggest that doing the same thing time and time again as a survivor and/or a killer tends to get a bit boring and I would suggest to have more variety in gameplay that players can choose with this game. I'm sure the devs are working on this even wayyyy before I'm writing this anyway.\n\nAnyway keep up the overall good work devs! :)","timestamp_created":1528898139,"timestamp_updated":1528898139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42698801","author":{"steamid":"76561198121911840","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1527331798},"language":"english","review":"Scary as hell!

At first it was a thrill renewed to hunt and be hunted. Due to exploits and poor response by the game developers, I no longer find \"fun\" in camping exploiters who abuse the pallets and window advantage excessively.\n\nIs this the sole reason to move on? Partially, But I have more games which developers who are more deserving and responsive to their communities needs.There is an absolute uproar;War amongst hunters and survivors in many Forums lashing back and forth and yet this hasn't been handled.\n\nIs this a bad game? By no means is it an outright bad game, But in hindsight what game can you no longer find matches because the majority of players are nearly the two lowest ranks? Game mechanics inwhich even the developer themselves were visibly,audibly and admittantly displeased with the match played live stream;With his hosts even laughing at him.\n\nDid you really give it a chance? Yes! I was very excited and foregoing despite the disadvantages presented playing a Main killer character, Even played survivor a bit to Level 15. I even purchased a DLC to show my support!\n\nSadly I have to recommend only getting this game if you have atleast four friends who are willing to play this game as if it were a \"gentleman's sport\". However I hate to refer to this game as that due to the fact, This type of game shouldn't be played like a \"gentleman's sport\", and I believe that is actually discouraged by the developer's barring communication with the killers and survivors until the end of the match. Speaking of the end of match communication, It is the only game you have no means to please any player regardless of your playstyle or behavior, Whether you play a hardened killer;Who cares not to be declared a camper or noob by doing the first and preventing the opportunity for their allies to rescue their teammates. Or you allow them to do so the latter and not be called a degrogative term. I don't believe I could see this game improving as I can only assume the developers have no intention to remake the maps to allow space between the obstacles Survivors have an advantage.\n\nNo particular match caused this response, I just don't see how it is fun, Even after giving it 26+ hours to really get a firm grasp, Which I believe is more then most would had they not found fun. \n\nMy personal experiences have really been subjective, As thousands of players are obviously happy enough to keep playing.

Good luck getting there, every match someone either disconnects or suicides the moment they are hooked.\n\nEdit: Suicides have been very slightly slowed down but are still an incredible problem. You can suicide within 10 seconds which leaves everyone else in the match at a massive disadvantage that pretty much guarantees a loss. \nBorrowed Time should be built into the game and not a perk. The amount of times a greedy survivor saves me and I got down literally instantly because the killer is right there. No one is punished but the person being saved. The savior gets points, the killer gets a down and a hook, the saved gets screwed and doesn't even get to try to get away.\nI still play this game because it's fun when you get a non-jerk killer, but with crossplay, most killers these days play very meanly.\nIt was hard not to cuss in this review.\n\nPortrait of a Murder update: The new killer is insanely overpowered. She can shoot through walls, block loops, snipe gens from across the map, and she moves at full speed. Devs just don't care about survivors anymore. Game isn't worth playing until she's deleted. Just to be clear, I understand survivors are OP. I can loop and survive most killers for several minutes, but The Artist is about 20-30 seconds tops if the player knows what they are doing. That's an insane difference. She needs to run at 4.4m/s or only be able to injure if you have crows on you. Not a free injure if they are close or full movement speed; you can't have both on the same killer.","timestamp_created":1528874529,"timestamp_updated":1639722904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49697035551071167","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42693010","author":{"steamid":"76561198290557449","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":16118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12672,"last_played":1645274578},"language":"schinese","review":"对于这次更新，我是非常满意的。DbD加油。","timestamp_created":1528874300,"timestamp_updated":1528874300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42692950","author":{"steamid":"76561198070347882","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":14,"playtime_at_review":1371,"last_played":1660072162},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight-игра,которая по праву, считается лучшей в жанре догонялок.Сравнивая ее с Friday 13th,можно сказать,что разработчики Пятницы взяли и кинули игру(Хотя потенциал был огромен).DBD,наоборот,ее развивают,делают лучше.Поэтому вывод один.Какая бы не была крутая задумка.Побеждает тот,кто умеет ее развивать и поддерживать на протяжении времени.Достаточно взглянуть на коммьюнити DBD и Friday 13th.\nDBD-30000-45000 в игре.\nFriday 13th- 1200-1800 в игре.\nЦена посл. выше на 30-40%\n\nТеперь перейдем к плюсам игры(DBD).\n1.Главный и самый крутой плюс,ради чего покупают такие игры.Это напугать вас.И это в игре происходит регулярно.\n2.Работа в команде,слаженная задумка сделает вас гораздо опаснее для маньяка,чем вы думаете.Он будет унижен вами и бомбить его задний проход будет настолько сильно,что он просто выйдет из матча)\n3.Система прокачки(Думаю ,купив,разберетесь)\n4.Атмосфера и музыка.\n5.Разнообразие по выбору персов(с разными способностями) и маньяков.\n\nМинусы :(\n1.Нестабильные сервера(Но терпеть можно,даже исправляют)\n2.Маньяки.Это даже не проблема игры.А самих людей.Которые любят кемп. и портить игру другим.\n3.Довольно скудные варианты прохождения(Хотелось бы немного больше,но ,возможно, исправят в буд.)\n\nТеперь,еще и обнова вышла на момент 13.06.2018.Все поменялось и чувствую,что после нее будет новое коммьюнити.\nТак,а оценка игрули 8/10.(Годный продукт)","timestamp_created":1528874029,"timestamp_updated":1528874029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42692926","author":{"steamid":"76561198800241664","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":53684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23467,"last_played":1551117114},"language":"french","review":"très bon jeu , on devient vite accros , le mode survie avec des amis est trop bien , permet de jouer en équipe , commandes facile a géré ,je recommande...","timestamp_created":1528873943,"timestamp_updated":1528873943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42692615","author":{"steamid":"76561198077919615","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1639149545},"language":"russian","review":"Всё бы ничего, но донат.

I started as a survivor, up against the Doctor for my very first match. Let me tell you, he terrifed the ever living sh*t outa me. I had the friend who introduced me to the game talking me through it though, which is both a pro and con.\n\n   Recently a basic tutorial was added, but there wasn't anything before that. New players were clueless. Having a friend feed me info meant I got the basics down faster... but I wasn't as scared as I could've been. That may sound wierd, but the beginning terror of seeing a red outline in the distance accompanied with a blood-curdling scream... it was superb.\n\n   Of course, I know what that that means now, so it's just a big indicator for me - but the point is that it was gloriously scary - except for that friend whispering sweet nothings into my ear.\n\n   For me, that is the start to the beauty of this game. As a cowering survivor, not knowing who's out there. As the smug killer, already licking my lips in anticipation of the hunt. I've had my heart beating over time, with pure adrenaline pumping through me. Fully tilting my body left - the killer swung but barely missed me! Leaning foward with an intense stare - that survivor will fall before me! Burying my face in my hands in despair - the Entity now has me.\n\n   Then there's the more subtle things. Working on a generator, it's noise slowly but surely encompassing everything around me, to the point that I compulsively swivel my camera back and forth to make sure I'm not being snuck up on by the killer. Playing mind games with a frantic survivor - oh you thought I was going right? Thanks for running straight into my weapon XOXO.\n\n   So, from an emotional standpoint I very much love Dead by Daylight. Logically, it has it's faults. The inevitable bugs, balance issues, one side feeling overlooked, so on and so on. That's just the usual for any mmo, far as I'm concerned.\n\n   I'm more interested by the fact that they show obvious care for their community (weekly streams/youtube vids). That they show passion towards what they've created. That they try. That's all I ask for.\n\n   Don't get me wrong, I've cursed up a storm because of this game. I've raged and thrown temper tantrums even a 4 year old would marvel at. At the same time, there's been so many instances of pure awesomness. Let me paint a picture of such one time:\n\n   There's a chainwielding cannibal prowling on the grounds. I've heard the purr of their weapon as it ruthlessely cuts down all before it. My fellow sufferers - they scream in intense pain, wordlessly begging for mercy. But none does it have. I frantically work on the generator in front of me, swallowing down the delirious burbles of dread that want to escape. Already one has been gathered by the Entity, lifted almost lovingly, it's spindly arms cruelly thrust through their body.\n\n   Finally, finally the contraption I've been on was completed! But then I hear a wail vibrate through the air. Swiveling around, I helplessly watch as the current victim lies cut in half on the ground, while that monster lifts it's weapon in the air and cheers. I'm almost numb at this point. Only two are still alive, with 3 of those infernal machines left to go. And as it turns and meets my eyes, I'm sure that there's no hope left.\n\n   Yet! I wasn't going to make it easy. So off I ran, dodging around a corner, throwing wooden pallets to slow it down. Leaping through windows, back-tracking in the hopes of shaking it off. Around and around, I took it's attention. My only thought being to buy time for my last companion to do... something. Anything really. I just wanted to give them that time.\n\n   In the end, it catches up. And I fall, withering onto the ground. Then lifted upon an uncaring shoulder and unceremoniously shoved on a hook. I hang limply, imploring the last one to make it out alive. But fate was nefarious, as the monster was granted momentary knowledge of their location... and went straight for them.\n\n   I was in true despair. Did everything I'd work for mean absolutely nothing? Was this to mean that no matter what I would always fail? No. NO. NO! And with a strength I thought gone from me I reach up to struggle off that blasted hook - and succeed. That moment left me momentarily speechless, immediately followed with almost uncontrollable giddiness.\n\n   The same could not be the same for my last ally, as their howl indicated that they had been caught and placed as an offering. Now with that momentary knowledge granted to the lunatic and the beat of a heart overwhelming the senses, I knew it was now or nothing. Every scrap of knowledge and dirty trick was employed, looking for that escape the Entity in its sadistic nature left for the last left alive.\n\n   When I dodged around a rock, then double backed, causing the creature to lose me for a few precious seconds, I heard it. That dark, almost chorus like noise. With explosive glee I dived straight into the hatch, the monster too far to do more than sneer at me as it closed above my head.\n\n   Then in the end chat, I wrote \"OMG that was too close, gg!\" Then the killer dude was like, \"Trash\" and left. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\n   10/10 I adore this game. And if you read this far... thanks?","timestamp_created":1528856449,"timestamp_updated":1528857951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42689293","author":{"steamid":"76561198441462969","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":61430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32246,"last_played":1655643699},"language":"schinese","review":"？昨晚发布的暗金250元6000个  今天就2000元6000个 故意坑钱吗","timestamp_created":1528856349,"timestamp_updated":1528856349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42689278","author":{"steamid":"76561198302926141","num_games_owned":501,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":41880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":32983,"last_played":1660391208},"language":"schinese","review":"跟朋友一起玩 蛮有意思的","timestamp_created":1528856238,"timestamp_updated":1542864428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42689260","author":{"steamid":"76561198416612211","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10396,"last_played":1648373014},"language":"schinese","review":"多的不说开黑简直开心农场xxx\n迈叔我的 不接受反驳x\n我永远喜欢黎明杀机x","timestamp_created":1528856152,"timestamp_updated":1528856152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53947371244430542","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42689251","author":{"steamid":"76561198200593883","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11460,"last_played":1598951818},"language":"schinese","review":"就是连不上服务器，开加速器都不行，玩几把啊","timestamp_created":1528856112,"timestamp_updated":1528856112,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":38,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.662188172340393066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42688739","author":{"steamid":"76561198049003347","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":50707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33957,"last_played":1655616329},"language":"english","review":"Still never got any bonus items for owning game pre launch.","timestamp_created":1528853636,"timestamp_updated":1572061613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.783675014972686768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42688731","author":{"steamid":"76561198406005855","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":372,"playtime_at_review":4222,"last_played":1660471348},"language":"schinese","review":"瞬移板改了真的难受，对新手来说真的很不友好，说是为了平衡，结果人类削弱，屠夫加强，我真的没看懂他哪里平衡了？支付机制平衡了？方便给钱了？","timestamp_created":1528853615,"timestamp_updated":1528853615,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42688592","author":{"steamid":"76561198088537069","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25907,"last_played":1656343759},"language":"koreana","review":"아놔 신규 DLC 까지 구입하고 업데이트 하니까 실행이 안되네요.이지안티치트 클라이언트를 시작할 수 없습니다","timestamp_created":1528853038,"timestamp_updated":1528853038,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42688497","author":{"steamid":"76561198097090247","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":88703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26674,"last_played":1654400794},"language":"english","review":"There's a reason why this game is classed as \"horror\".

Si les tueurs veulent stopper le jeu, ils leurs suffit de camper et de tuer tout ce qui ce rapproche autour du survivant accroché au crochet. \nEt cest plus facile pour le tueur, puisqu'on vient nous meme devant lui pour qu'il nous tue. \nDu suicide me direz-vous? On devrait pouvoir se suicider dans le jeu... ca irait parfaitement avec le gameplay de certaines parties... au lieu de devoir quitter le jeu en pleine partie quant on tombe sur un tueur qui campe ! :D \n\nLes memes dévelloppeurs ont mis un systeme d'anti-camp pour les survivants.. ah bah tient alors mais pourquoi ?\nEt oui, si on reste trop longtemps caché pour survivre, il y a des corbeaux qui apparaissent au dessus de nous, pour signaler notre presence au tueur ! \nNon mais cest vraiment du foutage de gueule ca !\nPourquoi on a pas le droit de camper en etant survivant ? alors que les tueurs peuvent camper ?! non mais cest plus logique de camper quant on est victime ...\n\nCe serait marrant de voir ce meme systeme de corbeaux sur les tueurs qui campent, je sais pas moi, genre si le tueur campe plus de 20 secs a coté de sa victime sur le crochet, bah les corbeaux lui font caca sur la tete et il ne voit plus rien pendant 30secs   XD\n\nBon revoyez votre copie, il n'est pas fini votre Jeu les gars !\n\n\"Dead By Daylight\", ou plutot \"Dead By Leave\"... a cause du nombre de fois qu'on a envie de quitter la partie completement deséquilibrée !\n\nJe rajoute une petite note, apres plusieurs mois de jeu.\n* Le jeu plante parfois sans aucune raison.. \n** Y a aussi des problemes, lorsque le jeu recherche un serveur... ca freeze parfois !","timestamp_created":1528838671,"timestamp_updated":1532073530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603159964084625244","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42685283","author":{"steamid":"76561198297743111","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":24884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5221,"last_played":1586476932},"language":"brazilian","review":"DBD é um jogo um tanto ambíguo. Com isso quero dizer que ele consegue ser ao mesmo tempo insanamente bom e um pedaço de lixo. \nPor que isso?\nVocê começa e é quase instantâneo: você vicia. É um jogo que apesar de não ter uma história em si e sobreviver de uma mesma premissa (sempre fazer os geradores pra fugir do mapa enquanto evita o killer ou matar todos os survivors), te diverte. No começo sempre bate um puta medo do killer aparecer e começar a te perseguir pelo mapa, já que você quase sempre não vai conseguir escapar. Sem contar a apreensão que, até mesmo agora depois de quase 100 h, existe no começo das partidas, de não saber quem é o killer.\nAlém disso, o sistema de perks e a variedade de personagens jogáveis - tanto no lado dos survivors quanto no dos killers - são aspectos muito positivos no game na minha opinião, já que abrem um leque de possibilidades pra você fazer sua build e ir pro game de um jeito que -pode- ser muito diferente dos demais.\nEntretanto, eu já te aviso que não é à toa que a maioria dos reviews negativos aqui giram em torno do problema da comunidade tóxica. Não é à toa mesmo. No começo achava meio exagerado, já que não parecia, pelas minhas partidas, que as pessoas eram tão baixas,  mas basta avançar um pouco no ranking e acompanhar alguns streamers/youtubers do game que esse \"lado obscuro\" (e gigantesco, diga-se de passagem) começa a se revelar pra você. É realmente, e infelizmente, uma das comunidades mais tóxicas que já vi, fica pau a pau com LoL. \nSer main killer virou sinônimo de sofrer quando nos rankings mais altos e até mesmo em algumas partidas nos rakings mais baixos. Alguns perks, a quantidade ridícula de pallets e a maturidade de certos (muitos) jogadores transformam as partidas em um amontoado de picos de estresse e frustração que acabam por sobrepôr o principal objetivo de qualquer jogo, divertir; se o oposto ocorre e o killer mete uns add-ons fodidos pra já declarar vitória antes de começar a partida, os survivors ou dão ragequit, ou se suicidam nos hooks e ficam chorando no chat depois. Lembrando que isso é uma generalização, o jogo não é 100% assim, até porque se fosse eu não o estaria recomendando. \nEnfim, DBD continua, e provavelmente vai continuar por muito tempo, sendo um jogo extremamente viciante e divertido pra mim, então eu acho que você deveria sim jogar e tirar suas próprias conclusões sobre o game.\n","timestamp_created":1528838168,"timestamp_updated":1528838168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.696662604808807373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42685260","author":{"steamid":"76561198258078340","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":10805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5434,"last_played":1608893493},"language":"russian","review":"Не рекомендую играть в неё людям со слабыми пк: раньше я играл с 30-35 фпс но после обновы и 20 не наберётся.","timestamp_created":1528838110,"timestamp_updated":1528838110,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505385816097259521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42685228","author":{"steamid":"76561198024125481","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":44131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5580,"last_played":1625707600},"language":"english","review":"This game is intense!
