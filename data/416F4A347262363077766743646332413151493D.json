in Dead by Daylight you can visit very interesting locations: like Ormond, or Haddonfield, ... , nothing else; this game will bring you very fun experiences and fond memories; you can play as the survivors who need to repair generators to escape, playing survivor is very easy considering this game is very balanced, the only thing you need to watch out for are random survivors that have the intellect of a Plants vs Zombies pea shooter; you can also play the killer who kills the survivors, don't worry out of every killer only like three are viable on high mmr, and you need to apply pressure to 4 people at the same time while you're playing padded jaws Trapper; thankfully after 6 years this game still feels like it's in alpha, it's not Dead by Daylight if the map doesn't have shi*t hitboxes and is full with bugs; this game also consists of very fun cosmetics, like a 15$ Trapper skin and pure cancer;
