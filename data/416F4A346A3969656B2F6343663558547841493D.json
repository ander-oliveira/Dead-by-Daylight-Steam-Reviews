boycotted this game for close to a year before I heard the developers were finally addressing some major community concerns with this game. In my time playing it before boycotting, the developers had made it very clear they did not care about their playerbase. Not only was the game constantly receiving bugged, half baked patches designed to simply continue the rigid update structure put forth by the devs, but the developers themselves could be caught in the majority of their public appearances speaking ignorantly about their own game, or directly attacking and insulting the playerbase. \n\nI am still not a fan of this developer. More so, after the absurd player outcry from the most recent update, I'm not a fan of the players of this game either. Here is a game that has invented a subgenre and has managed to keep a hold on it for over 6 years. And yet it's hard to imagine why. \n\nThis is a horror game for the first 10 hours, tops. Then it's a strategy game for another 1 or 2 hundred. After that, it becomes a new kind of horror game. A psychological horror that exists entirely separate from the gameplay. The horror of knowing the people you see playing this game all hate you, the developers who own this game all hate you, and you start to hate them too.\n\nThis game reinvented toxicity. This game breeds the psychotic and the misanthropic. And just when this game started to get better, the community began flailing its arms, kicking and screaming at the one truly great update this game has ever received.\n\nEvery opinion around this game is a series of extremes. The asymmetrical nature of this game not only leads to polarizing power dynamics in game, but wildly opposing viewpoints around the playing and management of this game. This game should not be played competitively, and by textbook definition, rarely is. But everyone in this game is playing like they are in the world finals, and any remote inconvenience or poor luck leads to someone throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe barrier to entry to this game is absurd, and growing significantly at a quarterly rate. The amount of knowledge of deeper workings of this game required to participate in normal gameplay to the degree expected of you is tremendous. And the toll this will take on your mental health is tremendous and borderline illegal.\n\nbut its kind of fun i guess","timestamp_created":1611294231,"timestamp_updated":1658367248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85125383","author":{"steamid":"76561198991612828","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1602200386},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая только у меня комп подкачал, когда был у друга был в восторге, графика топ да и сама игра не надоедает","timestamp_created":1611293376,"timestamp_updated":1611293376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85125159","author":{"steamid":"76561198140880382","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":70551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70548,"last_played":1611370556},"language":"english","review":"banned for no reason support wont release any evidence they \"gathered\"","timestamp_created":1611292928,"timestamp_updated":1611292928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85125076","author":{"steamid":"76561198013842608","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4086,"last_played":1643744974},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dead by Daylight is a game of patience. It's an excellent game, but it requires patience.

You have to like the game a lot to keep playing and learn how it works, the mechanics, the killers and the survivors along with every perk that make your life hell for both sides, but that's a competitive game for ya.\n\nIs it worth it? It depends. If you have friends that have purchased some dlcs and can family share them with you (yes, it works), it has a lot of variety and combinations of gameplay, but if not, you'll have to grind A LOT to get free killers. But if you really want to learn the game and overall have a really good experience after learning it, yes, it's worth every penny.

То есть в начале придется много потеть и страдать, прежде чем вы начнете веселиться в этой игре. \n2) Очень токсичное сообщество игры. И токсики встречаются как среди выживших (вечные приседания, щелканье фонариком), так и среди маньяков (фейскемп, кивание головой, как факт своего превосходства). \n\nНо бывают и нормальные люди попадаются против маньяков, как и сами маньяки.\nЕсли хотите играть в эту игру, то для старта рекомендую найти друзей для совместной игры и в первую очередь БЫТЬ СПОКОЙНЫМ и не уподобляться токсичным мразям. Но тем не менее, это веселая игра, в которую я рекомендую поиграть.\n\n---------------------------------------\nОбновление:\n\n300 часов и игра стала немного скучной. Я бы уже ушел из игры, если бы не очередной новый маньяк, который мне приглянулся и через 2 дня. По прошествии столького времени могу сказать одно - игра располагает к тому, чтобы быть токсичными мразями. Так что не удивительно, почему тут так много негатива.
