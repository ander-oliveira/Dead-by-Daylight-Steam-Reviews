you're looking for a game to get spooked and get a thrill out of, this is your game. Nothing beats getting chased by the killer and your adrenaline going up the roof. The game's main core is so simple. Finish the generators and get out through the exit before you die. But the game is advanced and brilliantly made with the perk system which allows both the killer and survivors to modify or gain new abilities or enhancements. It's especially fun to play with your friends but it's looked down upon by the killer player community. It seems as a disadvantage for them but nonetheless games are always fun playing with friends. The only downside I can give is that some of the perks are a little too overpowered but balancing is always a tricky concept in all games. The thing I hate most is the connection to host who can be all the way on the other side of the world from you.

game is a blast at first. But it gets old pretty fast when you get to the ranks where everyone knows what they are doing. It becomes a game about maximizing seconds and any mistake you make puts you further and further behind. Not to mention the chore that is acquiring blood points to get addons needed to hope to stand a chance. If you main killer I hope you are emotionally stable because your patience will be tested. If you saw a popular youtuber play this game and thought to yourself that it looks fun and you want to try it, i assure you that will wear off and it will be one of the most frustrating multiplayer games in your library. It is overall a horrible experience past the first 6 hours.","timestamp_created":1549337160,"timestamp_updated":1549337160,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523346304893493652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48765826","author":{"steamid":"76561198420415908","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":61744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10248,"last_played":1655197747},"language":"russian","review":"ПЛЮСЫ\n\n\n\n+Геймплей играется свежо , не в каждой игре тебе дадут почувствовать себя в роли маньяка .\n\n\n\n+Кооператив , все любят кооператив .\n\n\n\n\n+Атмосфера, с самого начала тебе и правда страшно , ищешь подвох в любой кочке .\n\n\n\n+Музыка: Действует на атмосферу сугубо положительно , нагнетает там где и когда надо .\n\n\n\nМинусы\n\n\n\n-Отсутствие ранговой системы , при присутствие прокачки .

The game is known as dbd is played worldwide on pc, playstation and nintendo but little did they know they made one major mistake.\n\nExhibit A:\nThe Camper Legacy\nFrom the start of the game there was at least one person to get the idea of staying close to the hooked survivor so no one can save him. But why did they called it camping? A century ago, popularization of the automobile, improving roads and America's passion for exploration gave rise to mass-produced, manufactured recreation vehicles, and the RV industry was born.\n\nIn 1910, there were few gas stations, few paved roads and no highway system. But there were RVs. 1910 is the year that America’s leading RV historians – David Woodworth, Al Hesselbart and Roger White – cite as the beginning of what has become the modern RV industry.\n\n1910\n\n“The first motorized campers were built in 1910,” says Woodworth, a preeminent collector of early RVs and RV camping memorabilia. “Before then, people camped in private rail cars that were pulled to sidings along train routes. The year 1910 brought a new freedom to people who didn’t want to be limited by the rail system. RVs allowed them to go where they wanted, when they wanted.”\n\nHesselbart, archivist for the RV/MH Heritage Museum in Elkhart, Indiana, also pinpoints 1910 as the birth of the RV industry. “Camping has been around for centuries, but 1910 is when the first auto-related camping vehicles were built for commercial sale.” Known as “auto campers” or “camping trailers” a century ago, these vehicles were a forerunner of today’s modern RVs.\n\n“There were one-offs [individual units] built prior to 1910,” says White, an associate curator for the Smithsonian Institution. “But 1910 is a good benchmark for the industry.”\n\nExhibit B:\nThe Tunnel\n\nMarch 25, 1843, the first tunnel constructed under a river was opened to the (paying) public. After eighteen years of work, the 1,300 feet long Thames Tunnel was finally finished.\n\nAt the time it was considered impossible to build under a river. In fact, in 1828 a water leakage into the tunnel caused the drowning of six workers. Work at the tunnel was stopped until two engineers came up with an ingenious solution. Marc Isambard Brunel and Thomas Cochrane got inspiration from a mollusk, revolutionizing tunneling thereafter. Teredo navalis, the naval shipworm, is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusk, with a strongly reduced shell. At the front end of the reddish, wormlike body of the animal there are two triangular, calcareous plates, used by the animal to rasp burrows into wood. Supposedly one day Brunel and Cochrane observed one of the burrows in a plank of a wooden ship, anchored in the harbor of London. The animal uses a secretion to cover the inner walls of its burrow with a thin layer of limestone, leaving only the front free, where it continues to dig, using the hard plates. Brunel and Cochrane used a similar method to finish the Thames Tunnel.  Miners would dig at the front of the tunnel, protected by a movable wooden framework. Immediately behind the miners, workers would secure the tunnel, covering the walls with bricks and concrete.\n\nExhibit C:\nBloodlusted Killers\n\nKillers also known as \"The -Enter Character Name Here-\". Every Single killer starts with the word \"the\". Most people dont know that most of the killers are not original and are stolen from movies without their permission.This could only mean that this is a pirate business about the internet restaurants and fast food illegal traveling. This game might be dangerous for most the players playing the playable game.\n\nThe Review:\n\nNot bad.","timestamp_created":1549289883,"timestamp_updated":1591798004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48753441","author":{"steamid":"76561198374375661","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21675,"last_played":1651496472},"language":"russian","review":"Покупайте, не пожалеете.","timestamp_created":1549286205,"timestamp_updated":1549286205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48752921","author":{"steamid":"76561198439559276","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1626702415},"language":"russian","review":"Немножко страшна.","timestamp_created":1549283928,"timestamp_updated":1549283928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48752384","author":{"steamid":"76561198081479469","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":43572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37717,"last_played":1612678743},"language":"english","review":"So the game itself look intriguing but the actual gameplay is trash!
