Игра очень сложная в части ознакомлению с игрой ну очень тяжело было разобраться что да как .\n3. Все в игре за донат это я считаю минусом т.к В моем понимании после покупки игры ты должен не докладывая денег играть нормально а не платить за имобвых персонажей.\nПлюсы: \nВсем привет плюсов нету т.к не нашел игра обсолютно неинтересная.\nВывод: Если  хотите попробывать поиграть можно попробывать но  отдавать за это 500 рублей не стоит. Т.к времени вы в этой игре много не проведете потомучто каждый раз один и тот же сюжет это починить генераторы и сбежать не умерев\nБывает  ее бесплатно раздают поиграть на день два и там можно попробывать и посмотреть стоит оно того или нет.","timestamp_created":1608219885,"timestamp_updated":1608219885,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484042584896087646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82566382","author":{"steamid":"76561198079991215","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":100934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1476,"playtime_at_review":41262,"last_played":1660584637},"language":"english","review":"It took me a while to decide on whether to recommend this game or not. I've spent a lot of hours into this game on both PS4 and PC and have had really good times and a lot of fun but also a lot of frustration and anger from the constant bugs and issues that the game has. Some bugs can be very game breaking from killers not being able to use their powers to not being able to rescue survivors from hooks. \n\nThe game has certainly had its ups and downs over the years and sometimes the downs can be really bad from the inaction/ slow reaction from the developers of the game, not just on bugs but also balancing issues. Overall i do recommend this game if your are a fan of horror and asymmetrical games but do not go in expecting it to be perfect, its far from it.","timestamp_created":1608219196,"timestamp_updated":1608219196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514018714427947998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82565566","author":{"steamid":"76561199031130311","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":10182,"last_played":1659606616},"language":"thai","review":"ถือว่าเล่นแล้วสนุกมากครับบ","timestamp_created":1608218313,"timestamp_updated":1608218313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82565344","author":{"steamid":"76561198113047829","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":17075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15390,"last_played":1622543019},"language":"thai","review":"ตอนแรกๆก็ตื่นเต้นดี ล่กๆหน่อย ต้องเล่นกับเพื่อน สนุกดี ต้องหนีผีให้เป็น ไล่ตีคนให้ถูก","timestamp_created":1608218053,"timestamp_updated":1608218053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82565251","author":{"steamid":"76561199030077940","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1631033154},"language":"english","review":"this game is really fun but the one issue is that there are alot of bugs and the matchmaking is horrible\nupdate never mind got banned for no reason and cant steam share my dlc to my new acc after recent update NICE","timestamp_created":1608217944,"timestamp_updated":1631045899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82565103","author":{"steamid":"76561198838450930","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1654217481},"language":"english","review":"Dead By Daylight is a horror game in which you play in a team to repair generators while being chased by a killer to escape and live another day.

İlk olarak camper ve tunellerlar var ve sayıları hiç azımsanacak gibi değil oyunu size zehir zıkkım ediyorlar. İkinci olarak karakter almak eğer para vermiyorsanız zor mobil platformunda 300 saatte bile tüm karakterleri açamadım çünkü kristaller zor kazanılıyor. Üçüncü olarak ise oyunda çok ping drop gibi hatalar var. Oyun katilden kaçma temalı yada kurbanları kovalama artık hangi tarafta yer alacaksanız.
