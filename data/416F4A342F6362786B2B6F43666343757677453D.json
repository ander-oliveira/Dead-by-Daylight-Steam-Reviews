Ever since then, it's been a mess in terms of presentation, functionality, and developer input in regards to the community. When the studio bought out the publisher to handle things personally, it felt like things got worse instead of better. They only became more clairvoyant about their questionable practices, such as failing to adjust the game to address the issues that the community has. Examples include: The community complained about specific killers being awful to play. Their response was to buff ALL killers across the board, turning the already good killers into absolute monsters (Nurse will always be a god, but now Billy has less pallets to worry about). The worst part about that change is that the intended playability of very low tier killers (Freddy/Trapper) wasn't helped that much at all. So good killers got better, and bad killers still need some desperate fixing, as evidenced that the devs are openly addressing Freddy in one of their latest developer updates (As per 4/17/2019).\n\nWhere this game truly gets the thumbs down from me, is where they began to practice something truly awful. Recently, they included an update to the game that acknowledged an issue with Legion, where he/she has the ability to exploit a bug with their mend mechanic to make it last forever. Their response to this exploit? They don't fix it, they don't make it NOT possible, and now they are ACTUALLY BANNING PEOPLE for using their exploit that they refuse to fix or address or remove in any way. There are people that don't read updates to this game like it's a religious text, which means that there is going to be a population of people who aren't aware that using a game's feature will get them permanently banned from it and all rights to their purchases revoked. \n\nThis is a foul practice, and is a showing of the company's poor management of their game to such a horrendous degree that I'd advise anyone seeking to purchase this game, or spend any more money on it, to go against the desire to give this game any money, as they are openly announcing to you right now, that you can be banned for any reason they deem fit, no matter how unfair, awful, or irresponsible they are. They are making the proclamation now that THEIR irresponsibility is YOUR responsibility as the player to ensure you are playing the game as THEY intend you to. Rather than designing their game intelligently, they are now showing that they are willing to raise their fist and plunge it down upon you for not paying strict attention to their updates and rules regarding the flaws in their game.\n\nIf it's too late, like me, and you've already bought this game, be careful about literally everything you do. You might get banned at any time if your methodology of playing this game doesn't agree with Dead by Daylight's views. I don't forsee them ever fixing their irresponsibility, so let the buyer beware: the developer disregards your feedback, or reads it poorly (I'm not sure which, at some times it looks like they're listening but their implementation and execution is awful), and is willing to punish you for their own mistakes in game design.\n\nI shouldn't be afraid to play Dead by Daylight.

Brush off the salt, and you will have a lot of fun, both as survivor and as killer. \nPlaying as survivor is pretty nerve racking at first, especially if you are solo but once you learn about the killers, their perks, and addons they could potentially have in the match, you will find yourself having a lot more fun. \nPlaying as a survivor with a group of friends? I have an absolute BLAST! Its quite rewarding, even if you all end up dying, at least you die together. \nPlaying as the killer is a fun change of pace. Its actually pretty fun hunting down the survivors and feeling like you're this god running around this map striking terror in the hearts of your prey...at least until you get a pallet to the face. Its still quite amusing and fun though.\nThe developers listen and interact with their players quite often on the forums, and they tend to really listen to issues that come up in the test builds and do their best to weigh the balance of their changes if they feel its something that needs changed. I think this is a really neat way to develop a game. Listening to us, the players, and making fair balancing decisions. \nI can definitely recommend this purchase and from my understanding, this game still has loads of exciting things planned that have yet to come so I can really see this game going far. Dedicated servers are coming out soon, which means its only going to get better from there. \nHope to see you all in the Fog :)","timestamp_created":1555538344,"timestamp_updated":1555538886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50180439","author":{"steamid":"76561198017651336","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":123,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1659823015},"language":"english","review":"I think we've done a pretty good job so far......","timestamp_created":1555537327,"timestamp_updated":1555537327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50180403","author":{"steamid":"76561198380185586","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1424,"last_played":1573971555},"language":"english","review":"This game is great, except for the fact that it crashes very often and glitches","timestamp_created":1555537081,"timestamp_updated":1555537081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50180049","author":{"steamid":"76561198230333144","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1590783639},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отстой , и с этим трудно поспорить.\n    -В игре нечего делать.

wrote a review for this game when I had about 700 hours stating I was no longer interested in what DBD had to offer, however jumping back in every so often to play survivor with friends and most recentely beginning to play killer a lot more has sucked me back in. The most recent update to DBD has done a lot of good for killers at the expense of the solo survivor experience. Playing solo queue survivor currently is hell, especially at red ranks. People seem to be dcing a lot more, and a bunch of very popular perks such as dead hard and iron will have been nerfed into oblivion. \n\nKillers on the other hand have gained increased amount of time it takes to do gens, and a 10% increase to the speed at which they do certain actions. This has made killers that are honestly not very good like Onryo and Pig quite a bit more viable, and the lack of dead hard for survivors has made certain loops less viable.\n\nI cant not recommend this game because it is a very fun game, but if you are planning to play this game as a solo survivor just don't, right now you will not have a pleasant experience. With the next chapter set to come out next month, hopefully it can bring some improvements to the survivor experience without just going back on all of the changes as most of the changes are for the better.","timestamp_created":1555494734,"timestamp_updated":1658810903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494897931814193726","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50171710","author":{"steamid":"76561198822709472","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":82,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1555494034},"language":"japanese","review":"新手上路全尼玛是一帮炸鱼塘的，很烦，完全没有游戏体验感。祝那帮炸鱼塘的今晚婊子妈的坟被掘了","timestamp_created":1555494198,"timestamp_updated":1555494198,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50170971","author":{"steamid":"76561198191623987","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13795,"last_played":1600503678},"language":"japanese","review":"キラーはボランティアだと、ここの運営はおもっているらしい。ろくな報酬もなければバフどころか、ナーフナーフナーフナーフ、負担だけで何も爽快感もないただの苦痛ゲー。サバイバー側は、楽かもしれないがそもそも相手してくれるキラーがいない。現状、どちらをプレイしようとしても、時間の無駄。今からキラーをやる方は、他のゲームが異様に面白く感じるぐらいに煽りに耐える苦痛ゲーでボランティアだと覚悟する必要がある。","timestamp_created":1555488972,"timestamp_updated":1555488972,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513155639171600342","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50170960","author":{"steamid":"76561198311848675","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1565327107},"language":"schinese","review":"吓人！！为什么玩这个游戏的妹子胆子比我还大","timestamp_created":1555488879,"timestamp_updated":1555488879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487804889678955078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50170876","author":{"steamid":"76561198049605987","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":832,"playtime_at_review":4771,"last_played":1660585641},"language":"russian","review":"симулятор очереди \nсимулятор крашей\n\nне за какие деньги не покупайте этот кусок дерьма","timestamp_created":1555488358,"timestamp_updated":1555488358,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483425408601760864","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50170541","author":{"steamid":"76561198364542652","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":112828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33311,"last_played":1644662232},"language":"tchinese","review":"我是先玩第五人格才輾轉知道黎明殺機(因為那個抄襲爭議... 你懂得ˊˇˋ \n個人非常喜歡鬼抓人(4vs1的不對稱競技) 據我所知, 同類型的遊戲應該還有:13號星期五(傑森單飛)、惡靈進化(獵人vs怪物超酷(淪為悲劇代名詞orz) 、終年夢魘(畫風最活潑 有種鬥陣特攻的感覺)  若還有其他的請務必告訴我!!

However, the incompetent developers keep making bad decision after bad decision. You will think it's a fun game and play alot of this game, then by the time you realize that it's a bad game, it's too late to refund.\n\nBefore we talk about the problems with the dev, let's get one thing out of the way first. This game is grind heavy. Very, very heavy. Each match you get around 10~30k \"blood points\" to buy/upgrade perks and add-ons. In this game, there is good perks and bad perks. Some perks are unique to each killers/survivors so you need to unlock the killers/survivors' perks by leveling them (which takes more than 1m blood points) before you can use said perks on every killers/survivors. Every survivors and killers has at least one useful perk so you need to grind for all characters in the game in order to have a decent gameplay (which requires millions upon millions of blood points and normally you get like 15k BP for a match). Also, you don't get to choose what perk/add-on you get, it's all RNG. Which means it takes much more BP after all the grind to unlock perks.\n\nNext, the developers. \nThey're bad bad people. When you stick around long enough, you realize how incompetent they are in making decisions. They nerf/buff what is not needed and refuse to listen people. When they do listen to people, they do it in the worst way possible. It's like they are holding a grudge against you:\nPlayers: \"Hey, dev, you're doing a bad job, fix this and this.\"\nDev: \"Oh yeah? You WANT me to fix my problems? HERE, I'm gonna f***** fix this for you *ssholes!\"\nand boom, a extremely bad balance patch will come your way. Then they will rebalance the balance patch after enough complaints. This kind of stuff happens from time to time not a rare occasion.\nThe dev lost sight of this game a long time ago. Their ego is too big to admit their incompetent and to accept changes, which reflects on their game, a messed up pile of ****. \nTheir CEO even recommends players to play different games if they're bored of DBD instead of making the game more fun to play.\nA chinese knock-off version of this game called \"Identity V\" is doing a better job than this game. More game modes, more fun to play, and it's free.\n\nFinally, the community.\nIt's toxic. The community is split in half, killers vs survivors. Both hate each other. They fight in almost every discussion post. Still, it's much more tolerable than the incompetent dev.\n\nAfter all that, I don't recommend you playing this game, for your own sake. It will leave a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nTL;DR\n+Pro\n.good concept\n.fun for a few hours\n.many people play it\n+Con\n.terrible dev, ego too big\n.very unbalanced gameplay\n.immense grind\n.toxic community\n.Laggy gameplay\nDon't waste your money on this game\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n","timestamp_created":1555481863,"timestamp_updated":1555481863,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169871","author":{"steamid":"76561198147186623","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13194,"last_played":1623445591},"language":"koreana","review":"야 매튜야~~ 이게 게임이냐~~~~","timestamp_created":1555480102,"timestamp_updated":1555480102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169836","author":{"steamid":"76561198426376826","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4600,"last_played":1596441617},"language":"russian","review":"сделайте нормальный подбор игр,а то чтобы не попадались ранги выше вашего","timestamp_created":1555479827,"timestamp_updated":1559668836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169769","author":{"steamid":"76561198338280680","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":139377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52076,"last_played":1657765294},"language":"japanese","review":"サバイバーとキラー両方やってるのですがゲームバランスがとても悪くキラー不遇です。\n","timestamp_created":1555479313,"timestamp_updated":1555479313,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502854466438293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169592","author":{"steamid":"76561198171301325","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":80003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50335,"last_played":1653188199},"language":"english","review":"The quality of this game continuously gets worse. New content is created with only small fixes to the existing game. 50% of the matches I play are met with at least one player who has disconnected, or their game has crashed. Waiting time is extremely long, especially for killer. One of my matches took 20 minutes to find due to broken lobbies (if four survivors are in a lobby and one leaves, sometimes the lobby breaks and will never find a fourth survivor). The community is constantly getting worse, many players are toxic and will harass you in game. After the game ends, some players will post disrespectful messages in chat (I recommend leaving the match immediately after it finishes). I used to enjoy this game as it was unique and fun, basically playing hide and seek with your favorite killers and survivors. Trying to fix generators and escape without being found or trying to catch your pray before they escape, but the game has become so broken and toxic that it mostly just makes me upset. There are very few matches I load into that I actually enjoy.","timestamp_created":1555477991,"timestamp_updated":1555477991,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590244770050048828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169577","author":{"steamid":"76561198828945695","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1651366649},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego es increible, pero la comunidad es asquerosa, cuando los atrapas se desconectan para no darte la kill, cuando pierden te empiezan a insultar por el chat y denunciar no sirve de nada, no hacen nada ya que sigue llena de esa gente el juego, eso el lo unico malo pero deverdad q se arruina el juego con los que se desconectan, comunidad asquerosa, la reseña la marco como biena porque no creo que el juego deba ser juzgado por la gente q lo juega...","timestamp_created":1555477894,"timestamp_updated":1557339564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169494","author":{"steamid":"76561198411733474","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":205778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1315,"playtime_at_review":43319,"last_played":1660604948},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego, :D","timestamp_created":1555477317,"timestamp_updated":1555477317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501461982727050781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169403","author":{"steamid":"76561198069046111","num_games_owned":471,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":109882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88824,"last_played":1644540036},"language":"japanese","review":"A horror game that nerf all killers.\n\nとても面白いシステムの非対称ゲームですが\n開発が初心者サバイバー・上級者キラーを見てバランス調整をするので\nサバはヘタクソでもどんどんランクが上がり\nキラーは全滅しててもランクが上がりにくくなっています。\n\nそして初心者帯のサバがいなくなるので初心者キラーのマッチングは30分程かかります。\n逆に高ランクキラーになるとサバが多すぎるのでマッチングが爆速になりますが発電機がつく速度も上がります。\n\nなのでキラープレイはあまりオススメしませんが\n紫ランクまでしかやらないサバ専ならオススメのゲームです。\n\nバイオハザードRESISTANCE楽しみです。","timestamp_created":1555476669,"timestamp_updated":1579270563,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50169384","author":{"steamid":"76561198284524224","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8438,"last_played":1657022845},"language":"japanese","review":"クソ運営。\nゲーム自体は良いので権利を手放してほしい。","timestamp_created":1555476524,"timestamp_updated":1555476524,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571531355381011963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50168299","author":{"steamid":"76561198328730456","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":174700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":140,"playtime_at_review":46825,"last_played":1659498240},"language":"english","review":"This is the most broken game I have ever played in my whole life.
