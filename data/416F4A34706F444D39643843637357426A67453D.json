I personally am not to big on the horror genre, but this game is alright. It keeps me on edge whenever I enter a match.\n\nThis game offers the chance of playing as both a survivor and a killer. There are many survivors to choose from, in which you can level up and dedicate what this game calls \"bloodpoints\" into their skill trees to get new perks and items to use in-game. The same can be said with the killers, there are good amount of killers to choose from and you can basically have the same freedom to customization with them as you do with survivors. Buying DLCs are a must if you want to gain access to specific survivors and/or killers. They also offer most customizable items for survivors/killers. \n\nThe gameplay as I said is great, it keeps me on edge whenever I play despite experiencing the same thing over and over again. There are different maps to play on, and there's a custom lobby so you can solely play with 5 of your friends alone. The different perks and items you can gain access to and use in-game make it a more fun experience for both killers and survivors that make it both more challenging and difficult for both sides in-game.\n\nOverall this a great horror/survival game that keeps you alert at all times. Lots of customization, characters, and abilities/items that help the game stay replayable with or without friends.\n\n[b]The community as people said is pretty garbage though.[/b]\n","timestamp_created":1511493224,"timestamp_updated":1529791586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37254176","author":{"steamid":"76561198308610206","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1536,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1660425051},"language":"spanish","review":"Me gusta mucho este juego, lo recomiendo mucho aquellas personas que les guste mucho tener los nervios de punta.","timestamp_created":1511493171,"timestamp_updated":1511493171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37253960","author":{"steamid":"76561198219261137","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":143359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1461,"playtime_at_review":54099,"last_played":1660520685},"language":"spanish","review":"hasta que no pongan un competitivo o algo que separe a los buenos jugadores con los malos no dare mi positivo no puede ser que alguien con rango 1 no sepa loopear y que ande como rata por todo el mapa que tu en una persecucion duras dos o tres motores y el asesino se va con otro y lo tumba a los 30 segundos... mucho equilibrio de mapa (que esta bien) pero poco equilibrio de jugadores.","timestamp_created":1511493062,"timestamp_updated":1590445726,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37253846","author":{"steamid":"76561198071215945","num_games_owned":745,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":10004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7311,"last_played":1640815061},"language":"english","review":"Lots of fun with mates, would definitely recommend.\n\nNominated for \"There's a game somewhere in that bug award\", I feel as though it deserves it.\n\nI think they did a pretty good job.","timestamp_created":1511493005,"timestamp_updated":1511493005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37253655","author":{"steamid":"76561198120109093","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":80379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37934,"last_played":1648605370},"language":"koreana","review":"당신이 아직 이 게임을 시작 하지 않았다면  늦지 않았으니 도망가라 이게임은 4명의 생존마가 1명의 순진한 살인자를 괴롭히는 게임이며 유일한 해결책은 기도하는 것 뿐이다.\n\n-------- 18. 11. 22 ----------\n\n오리지널 살인마를 잘 만들어주고 있다.","timestamp_created":1511492907,"timestamp_updated":1542858620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37253398","author":{"steamid":"76561198417296619","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1661,"last_played":1517570542},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра.Есть баги,но игра топ!","timestamp_created":1511492773,"timestamp_updated":1511492773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37253314","author":{"steamid":"76561198438986829","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1657376299},"language":"schinese","review":"最爱开心农场了","timestamp_created":1511492728,"timestamp_updated":1511492728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37251328","author":{"steamid":"76561198351367819","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":80455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73677,"last_played":1525632840},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo traz muitos momentos divertidos assim como traz momentos frustrantes, porém a diversão superou toda a toxidade desse jogo, o que explica o fato de eu e muitos jogadores terem tantas horas registradas.\n[list]\n    [*]Killer: Você vai perceber a necessidade de ter uma estratégia de jogo a medida que você sobe de rank, o que tornam as coisas muito mais interessantes.

There is a learning curve but after a few games you’ll get the hang of things.  The chances of meeting friends on this game to play with is extremely high if you’re a friendly person.\n\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetric, horror game which pits four survivors against one killer.  The survivor's objective is to repair five of the eight generators - which spawn randomly at the beginning of each round - and make their way to the two exits - which also spawn randomly at the beginning of each round - to activate the doors and escape.  The killer's objective is ostensibly to simply kill but the process is a bit more complicated than that.  For a survivor to be taken out of the game, a killer must hit them twice to knock them down to the ground and hook them; it takes a maximum of three hooks to “kill” a survivor.\n\nDue to the asymmetric nature of the game, the killer will be slightly faster, will have a weapon to damage survivors and use an ability specific to that killer to slay their victims.  Survivors, while they cannot use weapons themselves can take advantage of certain items, barricades/pallets and use the terrain to their advantage.  Both can use perks, add-ons (which augment an item or ability) and offerings which can dramatically alter the experience of the round for better or worse.\n\nWhile there are a few bugs that can appear during gameplay, Dead by Daylight is an ever-evolving game as the developers seem genuinely interested in the game and its community.  The love and attention that they put into everything they do as well as the amount of consideration they give to the gamers who play is astounding.\nAs stated in the beginning, if this is a genre that you’re interested in or are simply looking for a few friends to hang out with, this game is an excellent choice.  I hope you’ll pull the trigger and get it … and if you do, I’ll see you in the fog.\n\n\n~Ken Riven\n","timestamp_created":1511487752,"timestamp_updated":1511487752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37243513","author":{"steamid":"76561198328065379","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":124848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22419,"last_played":1658249108},"language":"english","review":"A fun and rather intense game to play/stream solo. PvP game, including blood, running, chasing, and a little jumpscare... There are 2 sides: you can play either Survivor or Killer (4v1).\n\nSurvivors in this game might be a little toxic, some will taunt killers or hide and do nothing to help teammates, and killers sometimes really go sweaty or tryhard in this game for the kills, just ignore that, play for fun and there is nothing to worry about. Of course, sometimes you escape sometimes not, sometimes you get 4 kills sometimes not, you win some you lose some, there's no true definition of winning or losing in this game but there's a desire to be the dominant one of each side.\n\nProbably not fit you well if you totally know nothing about this game, in that case, watch other streamers/youtubers play it for a while to understand the mechanic, perks, items...and then decide to buy later on, there's A LOT to learn as new contents keep coming out. (People with hundreds of hours in this game are nothing and considered inexperience)\n\nPlayerbase is consistent and tends to slowly grow over time. It usually goes on sale whenever a new content drops (every 3 months) I will say it's not a newbie-friendly game, especially for people that just want to come and go. \n\nIn the long run, this game requires HUGE amount of blood points (BP, a vital currency) grinding to get Perks (which give you different abilities to use during a match alongside Items and Offerings) for a better chance of surviving/killing. For example, if you want to be able to go against well-equipped players, I say you need to have at least 10 million BP. \nMeanwhile, the [i]average[/i] survivor game gives you around 15k per match, the killer's about 20k/match, each match is about 12 minutes, you might get less than that if not experienced. (More bloodpoints can be obtained through Archives challenges and community Store codes)\nBut at the same time, there are many people out there that are new to the game too, so keep playing and learning.\n\nThe game is very difficult at the beginning but nothing can stop you from exploring and playing DBD your own way, be chill and don't push too hard on killing/surviving then this game is worth it! \n(Not recommended for people easily rage or get offended, play this game at your own risk!)","timestamp_created":1511487430,"timestamp_updated":1606328308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550709366798400879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37243250","author":{"steamid":"76561198180864417","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1558,"last_played":1631041887},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom demais!","timestamp_created":1511487285,"timestamp_updated":1511487285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37242912","author":{"steamid":"76561198354741769","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":40940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24628,"last_played":1613044332},"language":"schinese","review":"农场主大战偷电贼","timestamp_created":1511487114,"timestamp_updated":1511487114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37242897","author":{"steamid":"76561197991755794","num_games_owned":965,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1536541193},"language":"spanish","review":"Esto es un viciote.
