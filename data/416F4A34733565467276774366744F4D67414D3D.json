I played this once on console and got quite frustrated due to the fact that I knew nothing of what the objectives were, how to stall the killer in order to get my teammates to finish their objectives or what perks and items to use. However once I bought DBD for PC my mindset was completely changed. I played along side friends and was able to get a real handle on it. For the first week I played nothing BUT this game it's so addicting.  Granted I'm still not a pro player, but making my way to a seasoned amateur. And the best part is that each game is completely different; there are countless play styles and strategies  that you and other players can use. Updated content is constantly releasing and cosmetic wise this game doesn't disappoint one bit. Now when I say I prefer this game over the Friday the 13th game I really mean it. Its much simpler objective wise making it more of a challenge, but the addition of perks, items, add on's, offerings, and outfits make this game just as complex. I used to play the Friday game constantly and regardless that it's servers were shut down this I would consider this game far superior. 10/10 would recommend to anyone that likes to use their head and make skill based decisions in video games.","timestamp_created":1633660300,"timestamp_updated":1633660300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100705778","author":{"steamid":"76561199206451539","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1637799181},"language":"english","review":"nuggets","timestamp_created":1633660164,"timestamp_updated":1633660164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100705702","author":{"steamid":"76561198255828063","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4879,"last_played":1647918181},"language":"english","review":"This game is so epic.

Play as the survivor, killer always wins, play as killer, survivors always win. Ranking system is completely broken. You're a brown rank? Get paired with gold and iridescent. Killers camp and tunnel and cheat, survivors gangbang and use infinite loops. Game isn't fun in any way whatsoever. You get 1 good game every 30 and that's your allowance for the week.
