Although I will continue to play with great probability, I have never had a thought of quitting before.\n说一下我个人资料:从发售开始到现在一直在玩，为了保持对游戏的兴趣，玩一段时间休息一段时间，玩到现在也有2000小时，算上朋友的号 总共也有2600小时了。\nLet me briefly talk about my information: I have been playing since the game was released. In the past, in order to maintain my interest in the game, I would play for a while and then take a break. I have been playing the game for 2,000 hours, and if I add the time to play with my friend's account, there are 2,600 hours in total.\n一、下面来谈一下这次更新改动:\nFirst, let's talk about the update of the game this time:\n具体该改动措施我就不谈了，既然官方这么改动，那我觉得 游戏也介绍也应该变成，1v4 绝境逃生，主要逃生 想尽办法死里逃生。\nI will not talk about the specific changes of the game. Since the official changes the game like that, I think the introduction of the game should also be changed into a 1v4 Steam. And what the player needs to do is to escape and try to escape in any ways.\n现在随便一个几十小时屠夫（屠夫翻译成杀手即可）都可以轻松砍上千小时玩家，官方觉得合理么?\n恐怖逃生游戏为什么还要给人类设计技能? 全取消好了\nAfter the game is revised, any killer who has played for dozens of hours in the game can easily slash players who have played thousands of hours of games. Does the game official think this is reasonable? Why is a horror escape game still design skills for human? It is better to cancel all.\n新手屠夫游戏体验极其好，新手人类被虐的怀疑人生。现在的版本我自己玩屠夫也是砍人类多数都是切白菜一样，很简单。这对新手玩家很不友好\nThe game experience of the novice killer is extremely good, but the novice human being is badly abused. In the current version of the game, I also play the role of killer to kill humans, which is very simple just like cutting cabbage for most of the time. But, it is very unfriendly to novice players.\n---------------------\n二丶然后说一下目前最主要也是我给这个差评的原因:\nNow, let me talk about the most important thing at the moment,which is also the reason why I gave this game a bad review:\n①改档，作弊（改档翻译成修改本地存存档）玩家占据游戏大壁江山。动动手几秒钟 获得的东西就堪比玩了起码5000小时的玩家，\nPlayers who modify local archives and cheats in the game account for a large portion of all players. They can catch up with players who have been playing for at least 5,000 hours with only a few seconds of what they can get.\n②举报形同虚设，游戏内举报完全没有用，游戏外举报很麻烦，steam个人资料私密的话就几乎没有办法，难道说我玩个游戏都必须要时刻开着录像么?更别提改存档 刷游戏币的，根本抓不到 也没有证据。\nThe reports in the game are in vain. Reporting in-game is completely useless, and reporting outside the game is very troublesome. If the steam player sets the profile to be private, we have almost no way to report them. Do I have to open the video at all times when playing a game? Not to mention the players who changed the file and brushed the game currency. We can’t catch them and there is no evidence that they cheat in the game yet.\n③太多的人技术不怎么样 作弊改档 局局顶配+红处，严重影响游戏体验，低分段太多素质差的屠夫 插拔高配 拔线\nThere are too many players who are not very good at technology, but they cheat and change their files, so that they have top configuration and Red execution each game, which seriously affects the game experience of the rest of the players. There are too many bad killers in the low-grade players, they plug in and unplug advanced configuration and unplug the network cable at random.\n④两年了还是没有服务器，架设服务器真的很难吗，哪怕月租加速器我也认了。目前的匹配方式问题太多了\nEven though the game has been released for two years now, there is still no server. Is it really difficult to set up a server? If there is a online game accelerator that needs to be paid monthly, it is o k for me. But the current matching method has too many problems.\n屠夫作为主机 肆意拔插网线（拔插网线就是拔掉网线，再插上去） 恶意玩游戏人类玩家毫无游戏体验。\n屠夫觉得不想玩了 直接拔网线，人类没有就没有分，五台电机一亮，屠夫拔网线，人类没有逃跑分，也不升段 甚至会掉。\nThe killers as the host, just unplug the network cable and plug it cozyly. They play the game maliciously, making the human player have no game experience. If the killers does not want to play, they will pull the cable directly, so that human players cannot score. When the five motors are on, if the killer pulls the cable again, the human players will not gain any escape points, nor will they rise to the grade, or even drop the grade.\n⑤中文文本问题:两年了中文文本都弄不好?每次更新都好多技能 附加品，描述都是错误的，半年不改都很正常，我知道这是翻译人员无偿翻译，但我并不觉得你是无偿 就可以这样不认真对待工作，严重的翻译错误半年都得不到修正，我实在找不到理由为翻译人员开脱。\nThe problem with Chinese text: Is it not long enough to modify Chinese text in two years? Every time the game is updated, there will be a lot of descriptions of skills and the additional products that are wrong. It is normal even the text is not changed for half a year. I know that these translators are free to translate, but I don't think they can be so sloppy at work even it’s free. I really can't find a reason to excuse the translator, because there are many serious translation errors that can't be corrected within half a year.\n⑥（no English）中国区微博微信负责人，也会翻译人员\n微博随便拉黑玩家 其他一些问题我就不说了。\n许多玩家都在微博骂制作组 ，这类人我觉得官博拉黑屏蔽都是可以的，但很多人只是客气提意见，都要被无情拉黑?光我认识的就好几个没有任何不妥言论就被拉黑屏蔽的。\n我自己的话，我向微博提供过bug， 也曾问过人皇战袍的一个小问题，（并没有过激言论 截图我也有）\n于是就给我拉黑了?我至今都没办法关注官博。\n您老人家已读消息 不愿意回答就算了 直接拉黑几个意思? \n我但凡有一个字 对您不敬 或者言论不雅 或者不合适，我都一个怨言没有。代表着官方，做些恶心人的事情 ，还没少干，我不能苟同。\n的确爆炸头为我们国区玩家带来了很多福利，也是无偿翻译，我很感谢，但我觉得这些都不是你为所欲为，一个技能翻译半年改不了的理由、借口，如此伤害玩家我也是无语。\n说完了 很失望我只能说2.0版本bug太多了 而且都是严重影响游戏平衡的bug，\n游戏会继续玩，玩了这么多年的游戏 第一次认认真真写个差评，\n致我最爱的黎明杀机\nThat’s all I want to talk.

Mainly because I play solo survivor the most and it's the shittiest mode to play lately as now, more than ever, your fellow teammates will proceed to farm you or leave you at the hook long enough so you would die or reach the second stage so their post-game ranking is not threatened as you will definitely have fewer opportunities to do anything after being unhooked. Or they will not do any gens at all, taunt the killer and then trash-talk in post-game chat at them because that's somehow the killer's fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the amount of camping has increased drastically in last three months and it's impossible to ignore. I'm mostly playing on rank 5-1 and yet the pattern of the games lately seems like those from rank 20-15. Why would anyone play a game where they get camped three games in a row? It's not fun for anyone involved but it's encouraged by the devs themselves as a strategy... no, I'm not joking.\n\nThe main issue in the game is that it's balanced around swf, which even with the latest patch is as strong as ever. A well-coordinated 4-man squad can easily trash the killer because they're using comms. However, the solo survivor suffers because of it, as the killers have grown tired of such treatment, so nearly every high-ranked game now has a mori and a tunneling killer, because they know that if they don't tunnel they will not get three or four kills, as the game is constructed that way. Developers support this with the aura perks, so even if you wanted to play smartly and stealthily, they are still pushing you into a merry-go-round chase around the pallets with the killers. And ever since the latest full patch, they will always hit you when you throw down the pallet but that's about the last thing they'll fix. Gotta fork some more cash from ten more sets of cosmetics first. \n\nRemove the aura perks, make it feel like an actual horror game by everyone not being able to see through the walls and while you’re at it, remove decisive, it's completely unnecessary.\n\nThe developers are so quick in spamming out cosmetics and not caring about serious improvements to the game such as introducing dedicated servers that would solve the issues of constant lobby dodging by both killers and survivors, +500 pings in every 2nd lobby, killers getting butthurt and lag-switching and getting no repercussions for it whatsoever, having to cycle through 10 lobbies because you get weird errors that kick you out of them or the killer thinks you're swf even though you clearly aren't or you have bloody clothes/carry an item so they dodge straight away.\n\nThey should also deal with known hackers that freely post content on youtube and call them out all the time. Four of my friends have logged in one day to see their entire savefile wiped clean, but guess what, this is an issue that's still not fixed, so go look up the fix in the guide section, as this happens to players all the time. \n\nAnother thing is the fact that majority of the playerbase is casual, yet with all beforementioned issues they are still forcibly trying to make the game competitive which would require a lot of rebalancing on their part, and I don't think a lot of people would wait around for that, everyone eventually gets tired of a game that panders to individuals rather than the whole community which in itself is incredibly toxic. Kudos to those players that were actually nice, the very few. \n\nPlay something else.","timestamp_created":1532691199,"timestamp_updated":1532691199,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541404426097869873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43775539","author":{"steamid":"76561198260105258","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18796,"last_played":1630531734},"language":"italian","review":"AGGIORNAMENTO: Grazie a mastro ferraio ora può accadere \"\"di tanto in tanto\"\" che il terror radius rimanga a 0 per tutta la partita.\nDa quando hanno aggiornato il gioco ormai il killer almeno 1/2 kill le fa sempre, non che sia una cosa negativa, ma se pure uno scimpanzè fa 2 kill due domande bisogna farsele. Pallet loop diventati impossibili, e fare il de pip ormai è pressochè impossibile. Se la cosa può sembrare una cosa positiva magari all'utente medio, non lo è per chi poi si trova in squadra gente senza mani che non sa prendere neanche uno skill check.  Oltre all'insensato nerf ad alcuni perk dei survivor si aggiunge un buff al killer mostruoso; non solo punto di vista perk, ma anche ad esempio al tempo di raccolta. Ora tocchiamo i tasti più dolenti di questo gioco: 1) il caricamento da killer: grazie a questo magnifico update, complice il fatto che molti survivor sono stati scoraggiati nel giocare per l'appunto in questo ruolo, caricare una partita impiega dai 5 ai 15 minuti, insomma, un bel metodo per fare alt+F4. 2) Server dedicati: lato killer è una delle manne dal cielo specie se abitate a poggibonsi in cima al greppo. Se già è un paese con una connessione a manovella, molti killer, per aumentare la simpatia del gioco, si mettono a vedere video su youtube in 4k o 8k o aprono utorrent, cosicchè il ping raggiungere il secondo o quasi, facendo pensare di essere al survivor in un luogo a, quando in realta è in un luogo b, o magari in braccio al killer, quando si cerca di tirare giù un pallet a volte si viene teletrasportati da un altro lato o si riceve il colpo anche se il killer è stato stunnato. Nonostante l'update rimangono bug di minore importanza, come rimanere incastrati in alberi, generatori, muri e qualsiasi cosa, de pip se il killer abbandona e tante altre cose. il concept del gioco sebbene ormai datato rimane interessato, non fosse per continui aggiornamenti a scapito dei survivor per colpa di killer bambini piagnuccolosi. sono un main survivor? No, gioco entrambi e da quando ho aggiornato da killer ho fatto solo 4/4. Sono forte o mi vanto di esserlo? No, riconosco che il gioco ha favorito il killer.","timestamp_created":1532690472,"timestamp_updated":1533393292,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50214087963104248","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43775514","author":{"steamid":"76561198366485102","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":21187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14003,"last_played":1626273319},"language":"schinese","review":"玩这个游戏心态是一定要好，玩人类毫无游戏体验，屠夫顶配一大堆，不知道制作组怎么想的，恐怖游戏做成了气人游戏，您当我是受虐狂吗？","timestamp_created":1532690360,"timestamp_updated":1532690360,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481582522392272949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43775347","author":{"steamid":"76561198381581713","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":28753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20281,"last_played":1587968777},"language":"schinese","review":"黎明杀机 卸载，等什么时候把BUG，平衡，进游戏直接退还TMD掉2颗豆的问题解决了在装回来，CNM的SD，虽然很喜欢这游戏但是游戏体验极差。","timestamp_created":1532689724,"timestamp_updated":1534172618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501216530799865723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43775270","author":{"steamid":"76561198247324464","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4560,"last_played":1531510803},"language":"schinese","review":"拔个网线就被永封，很好。","timestamp_created":1532689405,"timestamp_updated":1532689405,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517999589443206787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43775175","author":{"steamid":"76561198023928962","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":64602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3081,"last_played":1642811360},"language":"english","review":"Really fun.

This game gets review bombed every big patch or content release by players that are generally not very good at the game in the first place and refuse to change their already bad style of play to get better and would rather claim the game is terrible and going to die (It is actually growing). Right now everyone says that BHVR is killing survivors and that their way over buffing killers. However as someone that routinely hits rank 1 survivor I can tell you this simply isn't the case. Previously even an average survivor could straight up bully even a good killer. Now BHVR is finally working on balancing the game and I think they are making good movements in the right direction. I think they have closed the gap between survivor and killer by a fair amount but that survivors still have an edge over killers. I think that BHVR will continue to improve the game and I am excited to see their upcoming ideas since they are finally showing their willingness to work towards balance and ignore the mass amount of low rank players complaining that they can't survive 100% of the time against a monsterous killer with power from what seems to be some form of a god.","timestamp_created":1532683168,"timestamp_updated":1532683168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52312701940536499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43773734","author":{"steamid":"76561198153049038","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":121436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106003,"last_played":1643404588},"language":"english","review":"No. buying this game is wrong","timestamp_created":1532683149,"timestamp_updated":1619662975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43773696","author":{"steamid":"76561198815198439","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":14807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14794,"last_played":1619812985},"language":"russian","review":"в игру про маньяков добавили зализанного аниме персонажа","timestamp_created":1532682928,"timestamp_updated":1619809587,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43773432","author":{"steamid":"76561198386503103","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":49984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31697,"last_played":1592982301},"language":"english","review":"This game is almost not as a basic balance that should be a competitive game.

A weakening without a brain will only make the player lose day by day.\nI hope that the production team can understand that as long as the player has a time of 100-200 hours, it is impossible to play it as a horror game, and more to regard it as a competitive game. The horror game effect you want to do is impossible in the old player group. Don't let the novices not want to buy, the old players want to give up.

TOXIC COMMUNITY. Why can't we have one game, where people aren't people total fucktards because they are \"better\" then someone else. The amount of times i have come across someone telling me to kill myself and what not because i couldn't excape the killer. \n\n2. Killing Perks???? I thought the game was meant to be about stealth and being sneaky. I thought i was meant to try and actually repair the gens and only get off them when the killer is near. Well it goes out the door when the killer can just hook someone and see where everyone is hiding.. doesn't that take away the whole point of the game.. I don't have as much of a problem with the one hit down shit, but even that gets old when Adrenline goes off only to get knocked down in one hit anyway.. I may as well be running useless perks the whole time.. :/\n\n3. Gameplay? The whole game can feel real choppy at times.. from the peer to peer connection to just random bugs that happen unexpectedly.. I think ive seen the Killer stuck in a pallet to often to call this a working game.. \n\n4. Ranks? Now i have 20 or so hours in this game and i made it to rank 13 in that time and was against people who were far far better then me. Im not great at this but im not horrible. But i still feel the ranks are far to easy to get through. And the reset after a month or whatever it is? It reset me from 13 to 15. Why? What difference does that make in the long run? Ill just end up where i was before in maybe 3-4 games.. \n\nAll in all, it is a really fun game. My main suggestion would be to get 3 friends plus yourself and run around agaisnt random killers or even just a whole friends lobby. That is much more fun then the horrors of matchmaking and sitting in the queue waiting for a match only to be put in a lobby with 300+ ping.. \n\nI really wish i could recommend DBD, but after the small amount of time playing it, there are so many things that make me feel frustrated and annoyed at the end of the day. The little things that they could easily fix.

Don't get me wrong I actually love playing killer and am pretty good at it. I like playing survivor mainly with friends, but they nerfed the vaulting of windows, pallets, which are our main time killers.

The Art Team. The Art Team is phenomenal, the killers are visually appalling and yet oddly attractive, as any horror antagonist should be. The game, while the graphics aren't the greatest, still manages to be eye candy from the details and grim atmosphere alone. Someone please liberate Behaviour's Art Team, their work is amazing and it needs to be put to a better use than this game.\n\nThis game is not good. Repetitive gameplay that is extremely unbalanced towards one side. If the four Survivors are even semi-competent bullying the Killer is not an accomplishment, it's a given. Flashlights allow you to completely undo the effects of a chase, toolboxes blaze through Generators even faster (It's 90 seconds for a single Surv to finish a Gen, Great Skill Checks not factored in, so imagine that with 4 Survs all with a Toolbox), and Perk upon Perk allows for second chances that, honestly, you didn't earn. \nSprint Burst is a Perk that, when you start running, you start running at 1.5x your running speed for a short duration, and it has a cooldown that will regenerate while not running. While fine on paper, this Perk allows for you to instantly get away and start a long chase even if your positioning was bad and/or you failed your stealth attempts. The head start it gives is absurd. \nAdrenaline is a Perk that will heal you one health state and allow you to run at 1.5x speed for a short duration, same deal as Sprint Burst, once the Exit Gates are powered (5 of 7 Generators are completed). It's literally a Win More Perk. It rewards you for already doing well, as an extra shit on the other role's face. \n\nHowever, say that the Survivors aren't competent (which is surprisingly common) and/or are not in a Discord call. The Killer will slaughter with little to no competition. This of course will cause the less skilled Survivors to complain that the Killer is too good, despite obviously flaws. So then Behaviour will nerf the Killer. Allowing for the Survivors who are already doing beyond well to dominate even more. \n\nIt's not a fun or balanced system in the slightest.      \n\nFor Survivor, the gameplay sums down to holding M1 on a Generator, running in a circle when the Killer finds you. After, you either\nA. Escape and go back to holding M1 on a Generator or go save someone who got downed.\nB. Get downed and sit on a Hook and wait for someone to stop holding M1 on a Generator and come save you.\n\nFor Killer, the gameplay is a bit more interesting but is still only:\n1. Spawn into game.\n2. Wander around for a bit around generators praying you find a Survivor and they won't be trying to stealth you.\n3A. Didn't find a Survivor? Sounds to me like the first 1-2 Generators are now completed, go back to Step 2. \n3B. If you find a Survivor, congratulations! Follow them in a circle until they drop a pallet, in which case you break the pallet and repeat until the Survivor eventually messes up.\n4. After all of that running causing anywhere from a 1-5 minute chase (remember how a solo Survivor can finish a generator in 90 seconds?), you've finally downed someone!\n5A. You finally downed a Survivor, but as you pick them up another one of the buggers appears and either throws a pallet on your face if you're near one, or blinds you causing you to drop the Survivor.\n5B. Okay, you're finally carrying a Survivor, time to put them on a hook!\n6. Phew, that was hard work!\n7. 5th generator completes\n8. Aimlessly walk between two Exit Gates even though you know they get opened in 20 seconds and the time it takes you to get between the two as an average killer is enough for half of a gate, meaning that going back and forth twice will likely result in at least one gate being opened\n9. The Survivor you hooked is freed\n10. See all four Survivors in the gate spamming crouch because they're original and funny\n11. Get called Baby Killer in end game chat\n\nAlso there's Keys. But we don't talk about Keys.
