If you're just here wondering if the community is as toxic as everyone says it is ... well, yes, it is. I wouldn't say it's any more or less toxic than the communities you'd find in CS:GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. ... but post-game chat can definitely frighten off a new player.\n\nIf you're new to the game, I highly recommend playing it with one or more experienced friends who can coach you. If you don't have a thick skin or much patience, playing solo right off the bat will likely make you rage quit. That being said, a lot of people will only have fun with DbD if they're playing with friends. And that's okay and completely fair. The basis of 4v1 gameplay is cooperation, and you can't guarantee that a random is going to have your back.\n\nThere was a period where I took this game very seriously, and it ruined it for me for a while. After taking a break, I came back and swore I'd only play it for fun anymore, disconnecting the second I felt myself getting even slightly salty or competitive (EDIT ~ I can't even believe that I have to say this, but I'll take partial blame for it because of my wording. After someone took the time to go to my profile and flame me for this review instead of commenting right below where I could actually respond, I felt the need to clarify that I did not mean that I disconnect in-game. I'll finish a match and quit playing. I'll admit that \"disconnect\" wasn't the correct word, and I should've just said \"stop playing\". You could've said that instead of just criticizing me altogether when you've never played with me. Truly, the toxicity over the wording I'm leaving here in my review proves how right I am about the community, eh? But anyone who has spent time playing DbD knows it all-too-well.)\n\nI'm a survivor main, but I enjoy playing killer every once in a while. I think it's extremely important for every DbD player to experience playing killer. You'll have toxicity in-game and post-game when you're a survivor, but there's really nothing that can prepare you for post-game chat when you're the killer. I tend to minimize the chat so I don't see it, or I change my username to something friendly (which no one should have to do, but I'm a lover, not a fighter). While playing killer can help thicken your skin against the community, it's really helpful in learning to be a better teammate while playing survivor. There's also a killer for everyone. While I want to be the best with every killer in the game, I've succumbed to the fact that it's just not a possibility for me and tried every killer until I found one that matched my play style.\n\nI do have a lot of gripes about the developers, as do most players. Every update seems to fix something but break something else. Server lag is atrocious, and, lately, matchmaking is a complete joke (you're supposed to be matched with players on your skill level, but it's really not unusual to be shoved into a lobby with players way below or way above your skill level anymore). Certain perks are broken, hitboxes are BS, and you'll be kicked from lobbies, menus, and matches, requiring you to have to restart the game completely.\n\nThere are kind and gentle players in this game, and they're honestly the ones who kept me around when I first started playing. I'll never forget my first time playing killer in a public match. I was nervous and played terribly. Post-game chat, a more experienced player encouraged me: \"You're a good killer - just watch your tracking.\" They hung around and gave me some advice for practicing. Granted, every post-game after that was toxic ... but that energized me enough to keep trying. I try to reciprocate that to newer players when I can.","timestamp_created":1531763032,"timestamp_updated":1609447500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43568947","author":{"steamid":"76561198400617048","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5783,"last_played":1546182194},"language":"japanese","review":"100時間ほど遊んでみました。プレイするタイミングが悪いのか、鬼だとまったくマッチングしません。ゲームバランスも改善されているように思えません。唯一の救いは煽ってくるプレイヤーがほとんど居なくなりました。ゲームのコンセプトやグラフィックは好みで面白かったので、現状は残念な仕上がりです。","timestamp_created":1531761531,"timestamp_updated":1544223286,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509493708610534668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43568873","author":{"steamid":"76561198042056562","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3455,"last_played":1583026769},"language":"english","review":"Terrible Beginner experience.","timestamp_created":1531761234,"timestamp_updated":1531761234,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439560443162918091","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43568681","author":{"steamid":"76561198104668111","num_games_owned":627,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":36332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20235,"last_played":1655251136},"language":"russian","review":"Симулятор зажатия М1.

At first it was really fun to play with friends and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but the more I played the less I enjoyed. The game is not balanced at all, with some killers being pretty mediocre and others being absolutely broken *cough cough* doctor *cough*. It's too easy for a killer to camp the first person they put on the hook and make it nigh impossible to do generators because of multiple hexes. Pretty disappointed with how the game is balanced.\n\nReview Update: I came back to this game to play with friends again. There are still frustrating games where killers will camp and give you no chance of getting off the hook, but it seems that when the rank reset happened it created an upheaval for new players like me, with high ranking killers restarting at rank 20 and obliterating my poor soul. After a week or so it mellowed out and I actually have a fighting chance now. I've started climbing ranks a bit, and some killers are actually pretty cool and will make it a point to not camp and make it miserable for survivors. I've changed my review to recommending this game cause I've been enjoying it again.","timestamp_created":1531701727,"timestamp_updated":1532755667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43555887","author":{"steamid":"76561198055599096","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":136472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2863,"playtime_at_review":134006,"last_played":1660589250},"language":"english","review":"With the latest update to the game, this has been my experience:\n\nKiller role: If you dodge premade groups of survivors, 9 times out of 10 you'll win effortlessly.\n\nSurvivor role: No matter how good of a player you are, if you're playing alone you're quite literally asking to lose. No amount of skill you may or may not have will reflect on the game's outcome. 95 percent of the time, you're going in to give the killer player a sum of points, nothing more.\n\nSimply stated, DO NOT play this game alone unless you're planning on maining the killer role. You will become immensely frustrated. As the game currently sits, survivor players are either switching sides or quitting the game in droves, and I can't say that I blame them.\n\nThe developers of this game do not know how to balance anything, and any attempts they make to do so result in an even worse experience. Killer players routinely cheese the game's mechanics, providing a frustrating experience for everyone else involved. To make matters worse, they say you that if you were good at the game you'd have been able to play around it with an uncoordinated team of randoms.\n\nI don't see myself playing more than one to two matches a week with the game in this state.

Can't leave rank 20 on either because, survivours don't help one another. And killers just camp and tunnel non stop.... They are buffing killers continusly making survivors have no chance in hell.
