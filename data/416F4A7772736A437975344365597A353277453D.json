Its not like Friday the 13th like everyone says it is but its something different. Its one of those games you can put hundreds of hours into and not get bored, still have more to achieve, and still be confused at how bad survivors can be. The devs also really interact with the community on their streams and the addition of The Oni I feel has really brought in some weird variety that this game really needed. I mean a killer similar to another killer but is still really different, its great!(I am now realizing that you guys probably don't get this joke because you don't have the game......) My only problem I have with this game is the fact that you have to buy most of the characters, but they give you the most fun and the best characters for free! Anyway, I recommend this game and as you can see I have many hours on this game that I don't regret at all.

Many have tried, but few have succeeded in replication.  For those who are on the edge of buying, but don't want to read through to find all the nuances and caveats only for a tldr at the end, here is my take on the game, and how I feel most reviews should go:  If you want to murder people as strange, bizarre and horrid creatures that show the failings of humanity (plus a few licensed killers) than this game is for you.  If you want to desperately try and escape said monsters only to repeat the cycle endlessly, this game is for you. \n\nThis game is so creative in so many ways.  Its story; while patchy and sometimes bland, is amazing, weaving you into a world controlled by an elder god puppeteer who feeds off hope.  Its Game play is hit or miss, and the game does suffer from balancing issues, often making one perk too strong and focusing its effort on that, whilst terrible and unusable perks sit on the shelf.  However I believe that all deserve forgiveness and so as much as I get frustrated, I am willing to throw the Devs a bone.  On a more positive note, the games sound, visual, and lore department are stellar, and they continue to pump out unique and astonishing killers as well as introspective survivors.  Take the next chapter:  A Binding of Kin,  where in the killer is actually two conjoined twins from 17th century France.  If that alone does not sell you on this game, think of all the games that try to imitate the horror genre, and what they have?  Creepy white slasher number 14?  How about a mud witch that marks the ground with runes that cause fake versions of herself to explode from the ground.   Dead by daylight does have some bland killers, but the newest killers are really challenging the mold.\n\nIf you do want to buy this game, do so.  If you are wondering if you should wait for a sale, do not wait, buy it now.  It is an amazing game and you should very well spend your money.  While I sometimes disagree with the Devs, this game truly is one of a kind and I have no doubt it will go down as one of the best games ever made, I see it alongside games such as TF2, and titanfall 2.  Others and others recognized as the greatest games of the age\n","timestamp_created":1574460687,"timestamp_updated":1606751591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57658446","author":{"steamid":"76561198392607992","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":256,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1660061801},"language":"english","review":"nice gam","timestamp_created":1574459551,"timestamp_updated":1574459551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57658257","author":{"steamid":"76561198038519445","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":30355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7277,"last_played":1656255912},"language":"english","review":"This game has an addictive quality to it, IF you can get past your ego... I LOVE the updates and the way you can commit to getting better and proving how practice makes perfect. Comparatively if you think all of your friends will commit to this task of getting better and not quitting because of frustration you would be wrong. Get good at the game and play competitively with friends you meet in the game... want to have fun with your friends? be prepared to level your skill down to make sure they have fun. Overall I love the game, it has moments where you get SOOOO frustrated at someone who face-camped you or any of the other cheesy experience breaking moments, but you leave that game and start again! You'd be silly not to try the game though.","timestamp_created":1574459359,"timestamp_updated":1574459359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559647738933563232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57657975","author":{"steamid":"76561198408068949","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":20114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":88,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1659994806},"language":"polish","review":"Prima!","timestamp_created":1574459056,"timestamp_updated":1574459056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57657545","author":{"steamid":"76561198408471852","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":31832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20971,"last_played":1631827969},"language":"russian","review":"Топ!","timestamp_created":1574458508,"timestamp_updated":1574458508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrsjCyu4CeYz52wE="}
