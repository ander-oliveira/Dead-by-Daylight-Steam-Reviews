of the points of criticism that will follow in that review, I have had many hours of fun in this game.\nBut that basically is the case, because I played with friends most of the time.\nOf course, you're going to have fun when you sit in Teamspeak with friends, being afraid to get killed.\nPeople will shout, laugh their asses of and just enjoy the time.\nPlaying alone, with only strangers, though, is nearly always a pure disappointment.\nAnd even with friends, there were some things that have continuously sabotaged the overall experience with Dead by Daylight.\n\nLet's talk about bugs/problems now, that come along with the software.\n\n[b]Lobby problems[/b]\n\nRegardless of whether you queue up with friends or just solo, you will often get kicked out of lobby.\nSo after join a queue, joining a lobby then, you will often just find yourself in the main lobby again for no obvious reason.\nI have checked the boards already and this problem seems to be there for a serious amount of time already and it is annoying.\nI have to add, that I could easily deal with it, when only 1 of 10 games would be affected by this, me in solo games, and me when playing with friends (and also them) experienced it in nearly every round.\nSo for playing one round, you have to rejoin queue several times.\nWhen playing with friends, you also have to reinvite them, before attempt playing a game once again.\n\n[b]Loading screen problems[/b]\n\nAnd if you managed to reach the loading screen of the game, it does actually appear in some games (respectively loading screens), that people won't load the game properly for unknown reasons. Therefore, you will sit in the loading screen, waiting few minutes, until the game starts. At that moment your best situation possible will be a game with 3 survivors and 4 generators to go for, BUT in many situations like that, other players, besides the one affected, will also leave, because they're just as stuck in the loading screen. And since it can take 5 minutes or even more, until you'll enter the game in a situation like that, people will simply leave.\nYou will always face a worse situation then ingame, after waiting a really long time.\n\n[b]Leaving killers (early)[/b]\n\nAnother problematic topic are leaving killers.\nWhen the killer leaves the game, you will get 5000 Bloodpoints.\nOften, killers leave at the moment the loading screen has not finished.\nIn those cases, you have waited some time and then get awarded 5000 Bloodpoints, but none else.\nYou will then loose a pip of your rank and often you will lose your item, your offering, or both.\nAnd if that appears in a long-lasting loading screen, you will wait few minutes to lose a rank pip and items.\nWhat a joy, I can tell...\n\n[b]Balance of awarded Bloodpoints (Survivor)[/b]\n\nOne thing you can't really let go unchallenged, is the system behind awareded Bloodpoints for survivors.\nRepairing generators, or being chased by the killers, is simply awarded too little.\nYou will be awarded much more for unhooking other survivors, regardless of the use for the team in the specific situation.\nI had games in which the killer chased me more than two minutes, then I died and got very little points.\nSo I gave the opportunity to my teammates, to win the game straight away, but have been awarded hilariously low amounts of Bloodpoints in relation.\nAccording to the generators, one key part is the fact that you won't win games without repaired generators.\nYou can, of course, win games with people hanging on hooks.\nBut you see people cleansing 1 totem, then unhook players in the basement and just die (all two of them) but because they kept unhooking each other, they end up having a solid amount of points at the end, while you have repaired 3 generators and it doesn't pay off at all, although it was possibly the best for you to do, since your teammates just suicided.\nAnd the fourth player eventually would just escape through the hatch afterwards, although he did 0.\nI'm not saying it is complete trash, but it simply needs some adjustment.\n\n[u]Ingame bugs[/u]\n\nThere are a few ingame bugs too, that appear every now and then and can be quite frustrating, as it cost you the win e.g.\nOne of the big bugs, that I have witnessed more frequently lately, is the chest bug.\nYou would stand in front of a chest, which you have opened before and you want to pick up the item inside.\nVisually, it will just hover above the chest and it is not possible to pick it up, for unknown reasons.\nAnother problem according the chests, is the fact that if you want to swap items, you sometimes have to walk few steps away and then walk back again, before it becomes possible to pick the item in the chest.\nThis costs crucial time and doesn't seem to make any sense either.\n\nA third thing that can be hilarious, but also frustrating, is a bug, where the survivors hand is being bend in weird ways.\nWhen hold a flashlight, for example, it would not point forward, but sideways, for example.\nBasically that means, that you simply cannot use it properly anymore.\n\nOne last thing that I have experienced a few times yet, is this: You would get unhooked by another survivor, but the entity animation would just continue and after a while you would just die (and also sometimes drop into the ground or something) for no obvious reason.\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\n\nDead by Daylight possibly offers a lot of fun with friends, based on the simple system of horror behind it.\nThe mix of dark animation and scary sounds are pretty fun, when you share the experience with friends.\nConsidering that DLC makes up 50% of the killers, for example and considering all the problem the game comes along with, the price of 20€ seems too high for me. Sometimes the game comes along in early access quality, because basic things like joining games do not work. Ping is horribly bad very often.\nYou will often feel an imbalance, especially when there is a new killer, that you have to buy for real money (if you want to play it, obviously...), by the way.\nIf you get this for a discounted price and you can share it with friends - play it.\nOtherwise, don't. It will frustrate you.\n\nP.S. Despite the size of the update, it will take a long time to install and use update from Dead by Daylight. Even though you have an update of a size like 70MB, which is downloaded instantly, it takes like 20 minutes to install it and run the game. This may be caused by Steam or Dead by Daylight, though, but is frustrating in either way.","timestamp_created":1511104886,"timestamp_updated":1511105151,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36625712","author":{"steamid":"76561198388268470","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8586,"last_played":1620793731},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno!","timestamp_created":1511104688,"timestamp_updated":1511104688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503311276435852051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36625609","author":{"steamid":"76561198271568804","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":96127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81159,"last_played":1656117158},"language":"english","review":"good game.","timestamp_created":1511104420,"timestamp_updated":1561891194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36625517","author":{"steamid":"76561198032703904","num_games_owned":1068,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":16998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15882,"last_played":1586373901},"language":"russian","review":"ЕСЛИ БЫ ДБД БЫЛА ВПИСКОЙ\n\nТебя приглашают на вписку, говорят, что будешь ты и еще четыре тян, но чтобы их оприходовать надо сначала поймать и связать\n@\nНаходишь тян, она вместо того чтобы прятаться от тебя, тычет в тебя пальцем, зачем-то приседает несколько раз и светит тебе в рожу фонариком\n@\nДолго гоняешься за этой тян вокруг ящиков с паллетами, получаешь пару раз по голове досками\n@\nНаконец, ловишь ее, взваливаешь на плечо, тащишь на кровать\n@\nОткуда ни возьмись, появляются ее подружки и приседают у тебя под ногами, мешая пройти к кровати, светят в рожу фонариками, отгоняешь их\n@\nДотаскиваешь пойманную тян до кровати, привязываешь ее чтобы не сбежала\n@\nДостаешь аппарат, собираешься вдуть, но другие тян бегают вокруг тебя и приседают, тычут пальцем\n@\nТебя это выбешивает, бросаешь все, гонишься за другой тян\n@\nОна добегает до открытой входной двери приседает пару раз и сбегает\n@\nПока бегал за той, привязнную отвязали подружки и сбежали через балкон\n@\nКаждая из сбежавших тян тебе звонит и говорит какое ты чмо, все не так делаешь, советуют больше никогда не ходить на вписки, хвастаются тесным знакомством с твоей мамкой\n\nЧестно говоря, копипаста.

Pfff és arról még nem is beszéltem, hogy olyan perk is van ha megáll a gyilkos nem hallod a szívdobogását. Mit fog csinálni az ilyen??? Természetesen felakaszt valakit és lekemplei. Barátokkal nem 1x játszunk a játékkal és nagyon sokszor ezt csinálják. Főleg úgy hogy valakit levisz a pincébe a gyilkos és beáll a sarokba, természetesen azzal a perkkel amivel ha megáll nem halljuk Őt. Én úgy gondolom, hogy ilyen perkek nélkűl lenne igazán jó a játék.

Gecenin hüküm sürdüğü kasvetli bir ormanda, kana susamış bir katil ve hayatta kalmaya çalışan dört genç… Tam bir kedi – fare oyunu. Tabii roller her an değişebilir. Avcı, her an av konumuna düşebilir.Oyunun hikayesinden bahsedecek olursak; yeterli büyüklükte, kaçış yolları kapalı bir haritada bulunan dört genç ve onları öldürmek için peşlerine düşen bir katil, Dead by Daylight‘ın ana hikayesini oluşturuyorlar. Gençlerin kaçmak için bir tek şansları var. O da, haritanın belli bölgelerine konumlandırılmış olan jeneratörleri aktif hale getirmek. Katilin görevi ise oldukça basit, yakaladığı kurbanlarını kancaya asarak öldürmek!Oyunda, 4v1 olarak görünen sistem size adaletsizmiş gibi görünebilir veya aklınızda ”dört kişiler nasıl olsa, katili kolaylıkla yenebilirler” gibisinden düşünceler oluşabilir. Ancak durum hiç de öyle değil. Oyundaki denge çok güzel bir sisteme oturtulmuş. Her iki tarafın da birbirlerine karşı üstün gelebileceği noktalar var. Örneğin, gençler kaçarken çevrelerinde bulunan eşyaları devirebilir ve böylece katilin hızını kesmeye çalışabilirler. Yalnız, çevrenizde hiçbir şey yoksa ve düz bir arazide koşuyorsanız, bu noktada katilin hızı sizinkinde daha fazla olduğu için, yakalanma olasılığınız oldukça yüksek.\n\nDead by Daylight‘daki katillerin birbirlerinden farklı uzmanlık alanları mevcut. Örneğin, Trapper etrafa ayı tuzakları yerleştirebiliyor, Wraith görünmez olabiliyor ve Hillbilly ise son derece işlevsel şekilde elektrikli testere kullanabiliyor. Oyunun en güzel yanlarından biri de, oyunda geliştirebilir yetenek ağaçlarının bulunması. Yeteneklerinizi geliştirdikçe elinizde fener,ilk yardım çantası gibi ekipmanlarla oyuna girebiliyor ve bunlar sayesinde bir tık önde olabiliyorsunuz. Aynı durum katil için de geçerli, tuzaklarınızı geliştirip, baltanızı daha güçlü hale getirdikten sonra kurbanlarınızı elinizden kaçırmadan, daha kolay ve hızlı şekilde öldürebilirsiniz.Özetleyecek olursak; Dead by Daylight, adrenalin tutkunları ve korku temalı hayatta kalma oyunu fanatikleri için oldukça güzel bir alternatif oluşturuyor diyebiliriz. Oyunun, oynanış esnasında kişiler üzerinde yarattığı gerilim hissiyatı yapımın başarısını gösterir nitelikte. Oyunda çok oyuncu desteği de olduğundan, dilerseniz arkadaşlarınızla birlikte gerilim dolu güzel bir deneyim yaşayabilirsiniz. Dead by Daylight‘a Steam üzerinden 31 Tl ödeyerek sahip olabilirsiniz.","timestamp_created":1511082484,"timestamp_updated":1511082484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.75406038761138916","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36617955","author":{"steamid":"76561198105436377","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":2337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1791,"last_played":1642840655},"language":"schinese","review":"对于杀鸡这款游戏，写评测时候其实心情还是很复杂的。\n\n一方面是我想给它个好评推荐，另一方面是我AFK已久似乎也没什么资格了。\n游戏是很不错的，用心跳频率来表示危险距离，同时也增强了游戏代入感和氛围，这是个非常优秀的点子。不过可惜的是，盛于直播，衰于直播（虽然也有其他的因素，但主要还是被封杀了的问题，否则也不会热度下降的那么快）\n\n现在还是有不少的人在玩，本来我也不是随波逐流的那批人，我自己而言挺喜欢这游戏的。\n但是现在的确是没太多时间了，我的绝大多数在线游戏月均时长都在缩短，可惜我还是没能成为忠实玩家那一批人，抱歉。\n\n不过我还是祝愿它能走得更远。","timestamp_created":1511082372,"timestamp_updated":1511082410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36617824","author":{"steamid":"76561198406294393","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":69,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69,"last_played":1511081030},"language":"schinese","review":"是个好游戏，但是对新人真的不是很友好~","timestamp_created":1511081898,"timestamp_updated":1511081898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36617783","author":{"steamid":"76561198169936221","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25409,"last_played":1600824474},"language":"english","review":"Playing

Another player claimed to have a similar issue and contacted support after I did, and received a response before I have. This leads me to believe Behaviour's game is too unruly to provide the kind of consistent experience many consumers are hoping for and with this in mind I urge potential buyers that there is a chance you will be removed from the game without warning or explanation by people who are presumably careless, overworked, or both.\n\nWhile this policy is in effect I cordially invite Behaviour to prove they are not attempting to extort victims who are banned for coincidental assumptions which can't actually be evidenced in the hope people simply buy their way back into the game rather than protest, as I am. The easiest way Behaviour can do this is by investigating who is responsible for issuing these bans and recognizing they may need additional training in pairing evidence with supposition.\n\nI've also created a Steam feedback topic which discusses the effects of banning people and in it I highlight the importance of staff to strictly follow conclusive evidence to protect the integrity of their product, though it mostly deals with the information surrounding my case particularly. Go here if you're interested in doing Behaviour's job for them:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/5/3183345176711493001/\n\nLastly, at some point in the near future I will look into opening the necessary channels to Steam to voice my protest to someone in sales as I fear they would be interested in protecting the safety and integrity of their customers and Behaviour's actions may be indirectly damaging their brand. If Behaviour are responsible for my situation but are unable to explain it, that is an interesting situation.\n\nThis is probably my final attempt to gain some kind of closure on this matter and I urge the company to recognize there is a chance my case may be more common than is realized, but that those particular victims lack the skills to voice their protest effectively. The consequences of this, as I mentioned, hurt sales indirectly as dissatisfied customers detract from the product's potential, as I am doing here. Like my candid Steam review, I would be available to remove or modify these unflattering commentaries if Behaviour are willing to convince me they are serious about treating their customers fairly.\n\nAs a general supporter of underdog indie companies I wish Behaviour all the best in their future endeavors and again hope issues like mine are unusual. May I also add on a personal note that as a part-time game admin, our staff have a very strict banning procedure and it's embarrassing how at least one individual is allowed to inflict this degree of ineptitude on others, and although I worry how much harm this is causing, I am secretly grateful to their dedication in providing a flattering contrast to their more professional counterparts in other games.\n\nApologies for the unflattering tone and thanks for your time.\n\nEdit 1: Depressing replies as expected, but this is a cautionary tale, not an appeal. I at least hope the person who banned me knows who they are, and aside from this incident, I hope their colleagues are proud of their work.\n\nEdit 2: Correspondence for the curious: https://imgur.com/a/cMYNZ\n\nEdit 3: I should probably invite anyone who knows something similar to have happened to share their experience. For those who aren't lottery-banned, enjoy the game. I've tried to warn as many people as I care to.\n\nIn my profile you can negatively track when Behaviour bother to give me an explanation.\n\n[b]Do not buy this game, folks.
