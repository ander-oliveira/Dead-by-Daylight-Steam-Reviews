If you can get it on sale for C$9, then go for it because it's at least worth that much. \n\nHowever, other than the above reason this game is complete trash, and I can't stop playing it for God knows why. Let me list off what I hate about the game. \n\n1. It's buggy. This game is a buggy piece of sh*t, for both killers and survivors. I don't even want to fully delve into that because I could write a NOVEL about the amount of annoying bugs in this dogsh*t game that make it so damn annoying and unfun. \n\n2. Matchmaking times. It is ridiculous that you have to wait at LEAST 10 minutes to get into a game when there is more than 30k people playing this game constantly. I don't understand why it takes so long to find a game. \n\n3. The cheaters. You don't run into them often, but it does happen. If you know a thing or two about hacking it is SO DAMN easy to bypass the EAC that \"protects\" this game from the drooling babies that think they know how to use cheat engine. A lot of people have hacked their level, bloodpoints, rank, perks, etc. so they don't have to waste their time grinding out this dogsh*t game. I don't blame them, but it makes them rely on crutch perks that they don't even appreciate or know how to use properly, which brings me to my next point.\n\n4. The meta perks. Both killers and survivors have meta, crutch perks, that much is for certain. There are many perks that are so damn annoying to go against and some of them you even feel that you need to take them to win the game, which isn't fair. As a survivor, you will need to play against greasy perks like BBQ (tells the killer where you are for 4 seconds after they hook someone, if you're not too close to the hook or in a locker), Pop (allows the killer to regress 25% of a gen by kicking it within 60 seconds of hooking a survivor), Corrupt Intervention (blocks off the 3 furthest gens from the killer at the start of the match for 120 secs), and NOED (allows you to one-hit survivors and move faster after the exit gates are powered and while your hex totem still stands). There are many more but those will do for now.  Survivors also have really meta perks such as DS, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, Soul Guard, Prove Thyself, Self-Care, etc. These perks will drive a killer to madness after a few games because it makes you feel like you're f*cked in many situations. \n\n5. The toxicity. The community of DBD is by FAR the most toxic community I have ever seen in my whole life. Many players will go out of their way to make you feel like sh*t. Especially the greasy red ranks that think they're hot sh*t at the game but all they really do is abuse it. They will insult you and sh*t on you during the endgame chat no matter what you do, they will teabag you (if you're killer), spam flashlights in your face, etc. Survivors are far more toxic for the most part, but killers can be really toxic too (moris, facecamping, tunneling, etc.) and there is usually no punishment for being toxic. It's a sh*t show. \n\n6. The hitboxes. These things are so goddamn bad that sometimes I literally JUMP out of my chair because I am so surprised that I got hit. And no, I am not a rank 20 survivor that runs in a straight line without looking behind me. The huntress's hitboxes are particularly bad, you will get hit by hatchets through walls all of the time because her hatchet hitboxes are literally the size of a refrigerator. This brings me to my next point:\n\n7. Lag and latency issues. The game itself isn't very laggy for me, because there's a strong connection where I live. However, if the killer has a sh*tty connection, it's game over. Since the hit registration is killer sided, against a laggy killer you will lose. No matter what. They will hit you when you appear to be running into a wall for them, and since it's killer sided, you will be hit on your side even if you're on the other side of a loop. I do believe they are attempting to fix this issue, though.\n\n8. Gen rushing. Against sweaty survivors it can be soooo difficult to get kills and win because of filthy gen rushers. If you make one mistake (i.e. chase someone for too long) then it's all over. You will lose. There are killers who have amazing gen control (Hillbilly and Freddy for example), and ones that have terrible gen control (Trapper, Cannibal for example). There needs to be some sort of way to counter gen rushers without having to sweat your balls off trying to cycle gens and down survivors who loop the 20,000 pallets available to them. \n\n9. Balance issues. This brings me back to the perk thing. I don't know how they can have so many good perks but also so many terrible ones that nobody runs. The devs can't balance for sh*t. There are so many overpowered killers, add-ons, and perks. There are also many sh*tty killers, perks, and add-ons. Same goes for survivor perks. The game just is not even close to being balanced. \n\n10. Matchmaking. The new MMR system is terrible. It will put rank 20 survivors against a rank 1 killer, or vice versa. It was supposed to improve the matchups in the game, but it just made them 40x worse unless you're the one sh*tting on the noob(s) who just bought the game. They need to fix this or just revert it because it's ruining the experience for a lot of new players. \n\nTo sum up, this game has some great ideas and has potential, but it's just broken beyond belief. Yet, I am still going to play it because it can be fun SOMETIMES. To be honest, I doubt both sides will ever be satisfied, as there's always some bullsh*t that people will complain about. I just hope they make it feel more balanced, fair, and fun. It's really not that much to ask.","timestamp_created":1597356330,"timestamp_updated":1597356330,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74261845","author":{"steamid":"76561198170535223","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10662,"last_played":1614184244},"language":"english","review":"nizza but many bugs","timestamp_created":1597355936,"timestamp_updated":1597355936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74261760","author":{"steamid":"76561197962184327","num_games_owned":1184,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":19044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13762,"last_played":1658410597},"language":"english","review":"Game has and had flaws for sure, the matchmaking makes it unfun \n","timestamp_created":1597355767,"timestamp_updated":1657914395,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74261643","author":{"steamid":"76561199079111533","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1858,"last_played":1635848956},"language":"romanian","review":"slabbbbbbbbbbbbb","timestamp_created":1597355563,"timestamp_updated":1597355563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74261501","author":{"steamid":"76561198145334430","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":99,"playtime_at_review":11526,"last_played":1659574028},"language":"brazilian","review":"joguinho massa um bug aqui outro ali mas no geral ótima experiência a meta é fazer todos os amigos jogarem","timestamp_created":1597355361,"timestamp_updated":1597355361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74261021","author":{"steamid":"76561198977447445","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1658015755},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo é top pode compra q vc n vai se arrepende","timestamp_created":1597354565,"timestamp_updated":1597354565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74260696","author":{"steamid":"76561198274496647","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1599598927},"language":"english","review":"fun, exciting, feels like youre the last kid on your team in a 1v5 all the time","timestamp_created":1597353989,"timestamp_updated":1597353989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74260585","author":{"steamid":"76561198998529254","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":22975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":888,"last_played":1656456099},"language":"russian","review":"норма \n","timestamp_created":1597353815,"timestamp_updated":1597353815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74260579","author":{"steamid":"76561198123236919","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":49700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38030,"last_played":1656454432},"language":"russian","review":"Никому бы не посоветовал эту игру. После каждого обновления вылеты из игры, постоянные ошибки, баги, которые исправляются месяцами, а то и больше... Также, для того, чтобы иметь нормальный набор перков как на выживших, так и на убийц надо докупать кучу длс, либо долго играть, чтобы накопить внутреннюю валюту на НЕКОТОРЫХ персонажей (заметьте, все ваши любимые персонажи из фильмов только за рубли), но это не главная проблема, с которой я столкнулся. После выхода Сенобита у меня просто так отняли 4 персонажей, и сама игра предлагала мне купить их, мне не могли вернуть купленных мной персонажей ( как за деньги, так и за внутриигровую валюту) в течение 2 недель! Потом вернули, но после очередного \"клёвого\" обновления, у меня снова забрали тех же персонажей и разработчики идут на повышение, уже грebaный месяц не могут мне их вернуть и даже не отвечают на мои запросы! Это полное отсутствие контакта с поддержкой! И знаете, у меня ещё цветочки, некоторых людям повезло меньше и у них отбирали всех персонажей и вместо их возвращения с уже накопленным прогрессом, возвращали просто пустых персов с 240млн БП, т.е. помимо того неприятно, что игра сломанная и это явно не вина игрока, так они просто навалили БП и т.о. сказали \"разбирайся с этим сам, нам всё равно\".

The mechanics are simple, yet enjoying at the same time, and with a game like this, it's good to stay focused on basic function's without having to jump all over the controls whilst playing as the survivor or killer. That's right! you heard correctly, you can choose from a huge selection of charactors that are constantly being updated with new ideas, as well as new additions to either sides roster. If you choose to be the survivor you may have up to three other allies on your team, and as you might have already guessed if you choose to be the killer...(well looks like your going to be the lone wolf seeking out your next prey). \n\n  Now as you begin the match the first objective you will see is there are a bunch of broken down generators that need to be repaired. these repairs do takes some time, and in dead by daylight your in a race of time, so every move the player makes must be made with precision and purpose. once you get your first generator up and running it's time to high tail it out of there, because everyone then sees the lights attached to the generator flash on...including the killer. yeah that's right, don't forget there's one mean killer out there and every second spent, they get closer...and closer so be sure to always keep a close eye on your 6\"o\"clock. remembering that time spent well, is also ensured when watching your back.\n\n  Now a thought to always consider is that you have 3 allies...these allies can help tremendously on making progress throughout the game. Quote by C.S. Lewis: “Two heads are better than one, not because either...” “Two heads are better than one, not because either is infallible, but because they are unlikely to go wrong in the same direction.”. while there a many uses of this quote, it will definitely come in handy so be sure to keep that in mind. (Hint)- when surviving against the killer sticking together may not be the best idea, it could lead to being ambushed and once taken out your going to need to rely on one of your pals to get you off the sacrificial hook, which can happen after getting hit twice by the killer. once all 5 generators are up and running the door can be opened to make your escape. \n\n  This game has the tendency to hook a lot of  player's into by the first round, not only into playing the game, but i mean it's kinda hard not to be surprised the first time you see your character quite literally be placed on a hook. Eventually you will learn through playing the game which techniques work and which ones get you sacrificed to the.....creepy....satanic....spider entity? anyway as i was saying playtime will increase your level, as well as skills.\n\n   so if your not already playing Dead By Daylight i fully encourage you to join, it's become one of my favorite horror games and personally carries so much nostalgia for any horror icon lover. The games dlc includes tons of playable licensed movie film slashers as well as there victims all inside various packs of dlc, noted that characters may also be purchased through in game store.  One of the characters i would like to see i've posted below as an example of who i want to be in Dead By Daylight.\n\n(idea)- fatso a killer Klown from (killer klowns from outer space) is equiped with his signature ray gun, that shoots out blasts of popcorn. When the survivor falls down the gun shoots a ray turning the survivor into a caccoon of cotton candy, which he can then hang onto a nearby space hook. of course this is just fiction and is my own personal take on what i would like to see in the game of Dead by Daylight.\n\n(Power) ray gun shoots out beam twirling the survivor into a cacoon of cotton candy survivor must be inside beam for up to 4 consecutive seconds before effect activates\n\n(Perk 1) - Circus Tent Storage\nWhen hooking a survivor 1 perk is added to the store house (2 Max) each perk decreases the speed of repairs, and self healing. (\"What's the circus doing out here in the middle of nowhere?\".)\n\n(Perk 2)-  Say Good-Pie \nAll generators are booby trapped. At the time of a failed attempt to repair generator, the survivor has a pie thrown into their face causing there vision to be slightly hindered for 4 seconds\n\n(Perk 3)- Balloon Posse\nDuring obsession of a survivors the foot steps are revealed on ground for up to 8 ft. Duration lasts either until survivor steps outside of range, is stunned, or killer loses obsession.\n\n-There's no escape from the killer klowns!\n\n(survivor in dying state) when you choose to finish off the survivor as killer klown something interesting happens.

It's simultaniously a Multiplayer Co-op game and also a PVP game. There is definitely a lot to learn to get good at the game, but it is definitely a horror game when you start out and I've gotten more than a few scares even though I'm high ranked! \n\nPlaying as a killer is unique and challenging as you hunt down survivors, and playing as a survivor (be it solo or with friends) is engaging and requires fast decision making. \n\nLooking at the amount of DLC, Dead By Daylight looks like a pay-to-win game, but truthfully you don't need to purchase a single amount of DLC to enjoy the game. You can get DLC characters that are original to the game with free in-game currency, the abilities of ALL DLC characters through a weekly rotating random selection of purchasable abilities (with free in-game currency),  and many of the base characters that you can play as have good abilities that stand up well with the DLC abilities.\n\nEven the battle pass for Dead By Daylight feels fair and balanced. It's easy to acquire levels and you have missions that increase your levels faster (4 sets of missions are released over the course of the pass), some of which encourage you to play and try out abilities and characters that you might otherwise not want to play.\n\nBest played with friend but still extremely fun on your own, I would recommend Dead By Daylight to anyone who likes PVP, Co-op, horror games, and competition.","timestamp_created":1597332723,"timestamp_updated":1606594604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74245541","author":{"steamid":"76561198392646581","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":24904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1660440142},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo muito bom,recomendo!","timestamp_created":1597332457,"timestamp_updated":1597332457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74245424","author":{"steamid":"76561199076448095","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":57275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1640746133},"language":"english","review":"This game is a lot of fun and if you are a fan of horror games or horror movies this is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1597332310,"timestamp_updated":1597332310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74245347","author":{"steamid":"76561198342669061","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1759,"last_played":1653351028},"language":"brazilian","review":"foda\n","timestamp_created":1597332193,"timestamp_updated":1597332193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74245159","author":{"steamid":"76561198206795379","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":31641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":114,"playtime_at_review":13168,"last_played":1660512138},"language":"english","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1597331970,"timestamp_updated":1597331970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74245060","author":{"steamid":"76561198961832353","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":679,"playtime_at_review":4006,"last_played":1660348449},"language":"english","review":"This game is the BEST!","timestamp_created":1597331856,"timestamp_updated":1597331856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74245055","author":{"steamid":"76561198317926885","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":38082,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8622,"last_played":1659292635},"language":"russian","review":"Игрушка очень классная, только когда вы проводите время в ней с друзьями, так как с рандомными тиммейтами вы врятли получите удовольствие от игры из-за их тупости.
