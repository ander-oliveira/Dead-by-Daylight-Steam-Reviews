A clutch 4 person escape at the end feels like diving into a pool of coke. Sadly, the queue is only fast during the day and at night it's like 10 minutes long for survivors. Killer queue happens pretty quick. \nBy and large, it's the best asymmetrical horror co-op survival out there. The only thing that can hold a candle to this is probably Friday the 13th, which is no longer actively developed by devs because of a lawsuit. \nEnjoy this while you can, because there are a couple of really promising co-op survival horrors coming out and the player base here is only sticking around because there isn't anything much better. \nIf you are someone who wants to learn quick, go watch Not Otzdarva on Twitch or YouTube.

In terms of usability? I would say not so much.  There are many times I click something on the UI and it closes before it opens.. However that works? and it gets frustrating over time.  The user experience is the biggest setback here and needs around 3x more investment in terms of labor.  One thing that GRATES THE CHEESE with this game's UI is the store.  It works well, seems nice, but you can't actually access it unless you are in the main menu or a lobby, and NOT queued or ready.  This sucks.  I spend so much time waiting for a match and for game to start where I want to browse the shop, it annoys the whole party to have to stop the queue JUST TO LOOK AT THE SHOP!  What makes this worse, is the fact that weekly 4 random perks (2 survivor 2 killer) are released on the shop for in game points.  So it makes it pretty important to look at it.  oh and the \"season pass\" / \"challenges\" system in this game suffers from the same issue.  You can't be ready in a  lobby or in a match (even the waiting room) to view it.. But isn't that where player attention should be focused ?\nJust to continue about the UI, there are too many levels. There is 1) character level, 2) competitive rank/level, and 3) an account level.  As a new player, this was a punch straight to the privates to understand.  Simplify that down!!  A competitive rank and a progress rank is PLENTY and is simple enough to keep players around. \n The UI also has 2 different buttons to swap characters and/or view character info which is misleading and cluttered.  Finally, the support for UI customization/configuration is infuriatingly LOW.  I am colorblind, and I suffer in many video games on seeing things (will literally look right at the target and not notice a thing).  Modern games have provided color blind assistance directly in their UI and as a UE4 developer this is an easy addition..  The graphics settings are 1 dropdown: Low, Medium, High, Ultra.  No specifics, no tweaking, essentially go low settings for fps and ultra for quality no inbetween.  \n\n2) Balance. Oh boy.. Not even 5 hours in and it was obvious this game BLATANTLY favors survivors.  The developers are 100 % BIASED towards survivors too!  I get it, its an asymmetrical pvp game and that makes balance the hardest part right? Well for a game out this many years.. not quite.  There are many content creators (otz, truetalent) giving honest and EXTREMELY helpful feedback of how to make this game better pretty much everyday.  It honestly feels the devs do the opposite of what players say.  Survivors have crutch perk after crutch perk that honestly makes me want to quit playing the game when I am killer (Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, Soul Guard, Mettle of Man, the list goes on and on and on).  Killers however, do not get crutches and rely on making plays and good decisions.  Their perks are made up of gen speed slowdown, gathering information, speed ups when hitting specific survivors, etc. Not running a gen defense perk like Ruin or making a mistake as killer pretty much costs you the match. Oh and Gen speeds are INSANELY FAST (considering you can play with friends and also run toolboxes, new parts etc).  Not only this, but the worst part: the game has a hatch mechanic as a \"last resort\" for a survivor to escape. Sounds cool right? Too bad it is abused nearly every other game by keys, SWF, etc.  The mechanic needs a REWORK BADLY.   Having the hatch spawn in on last generator or last survivor is an okay mechanic (though rather crutch again when it happens everytime), but the fact that you can literally find keys in chests around the map and just bring them with you and open it at anytime is WRONG.  I've had multiple killer games already where I am feeling myself having a good time with good survivors only for 3 of them to escape through a hatch with a damn key.....\n\nOh and so this isn't killer biased or survivor \"hating\", there are killer related things that make no sense either.  First, the perk NOED (No one escapes death) is STUPID.  It makes all survivors a 1 hit down when gens are finished as long as the totem is up.  It's already hard enough to unhook the survivor being camped on the hook and decide on leaving them, rather than dealing with getting 1 shotted too.  Second, the game provides no true means of a \"win\" condition for killer.  Is it hooking survivors each 3 times? 10 total hooks? Just get 4 kills? No one knows! This causes slugging, tunneling, camping, and annoying mechanics to surface that make for some really boring gameplay.\n\n3) Mechanics and Polish:  The game mechanics are simple enough to understand and relatively straight forward.  Learning how to loop a killer and how to mind game is a really fun time.  Super high skill ceiling too.  Polish however, is.... unacceptable for a game out as long as this one has with its level of support.  There are constant bugs, lag advantages (laggy killers hit you through windows, pallets etc after you are past them). I've saw survivors float away while on the hook, chests open on their own, and even survivors vanish into thin air.  These bugs are 1) fixable, and 2) a worthy investment.  However, it seems they have been around for a long time according to content creators and just sit around.\n\n4) Community.  This is half the game's fault and half a player/people issue.  This community is toxic as SHIT.  There isn't even a form of voice chat in the matches and it is much worse to me than CSGO, etc which has these features.  After every single game, SOMEONE complains about something and says all the toxic shit they want to.  I've reported players and saw them again in matches a day or two later.  Just.. unacceptable.  It feels like reporting a player is completely useless as we have no way of tracking them and their punishment (or decision about said issue).  This honestly takes a HUGE hit on the game and its standing because of 1 reason: it could be moderated and stopped by developers but just isn't. \nTo continue about where I think the devs are wrong in the community area: The community is consistently giving feedback via youtube content, twitch, social media, forums, etc and even some great ideas to add to the game (what developers don't want to add new content and make money right?).  Ever since I started playing I have saw a HUGE popular opinion to add Slenderman as a killer. I support this fully, I mean that was THE horror game of my childhood.  The latest Update/DLC.. is completely KPOP themed with a random ass KPOP killer that not one person asked for.  His gameplay is underwhelming, and is already considered one of the worst killers in DBD.  Come on, the community is feeding you great ideas to add and you make something based on KPOP???? \n\nThe monetization is based on DLC and microtransaction store for costumes.  The issue is this: to unlock the majority of perks, you must level each character (survivor or killer) up to level 30+ (fair amount of gametime, around 2-3 days consistently playing) to unlock the \"teachable\" version of it.  Are you serious? There are characters I just don't want to play, therefore I just don't want to invest my bloodpoints in them either but I am forced to.  Why not make a non-RNG based method of acquiring perks so that players may choose what to unlock and where to invest their time? (obviously money and to keep players grinding).","timestamp_created":1616544847,"timestamp_updated":1616544847,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88973963","author":{"steamid":"76561199068367763","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":7505,"last_played":1660170655},"language":"russian","review":"гавно игра, не советую.","timestamp_created":1616544753,"timestamp_updated":1637784375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516891896724700928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88972603","author":{"steamid":"76561198874322993","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":581,"playtime_at_review":2686,"last_played":1660159191},"language":"english","review":"it's nice","timestamp_created":1616542656,"timestamp_updated":1616542656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487804889678955078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88972467","author":{"steamid":"76561198067679133","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1063,"last_played":1617138193},"language":"english","review":"As a new player the game isn't very kind, it will put you in matches against players above your skill level forcing you to become overwhelmed and not learn how to play properly.
