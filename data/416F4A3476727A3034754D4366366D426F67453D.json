[/b]\n\nEDIT: I decided to edit my review after getting to know the game a bit more. The original review was after 70 hours of playing and this one is after 300 hours. The comments below reflect the original review. \n\nDead by Daylight is a 4vs1 online multiplayer game. One player plays the killer and the other three or four players are the survivors. The survivors win by working together to repair the generators and then opening the door without being killed. The killer has to find the survivors and hook them all to please the Entity. \n\n    \n[u] PROS [/u]\n\n- [b] The Perks. [/b] Each survivor and each killer have unique perks. Perks are basically equippable abilities that help you in some way. Some examples are Claudette, who can heal herself and Meg, who can sprint away quickly.  Customizing your survivor or killer adds variety to your character and lets you create your own play style.  \n\n- [b] Items. [/b] The item system adds more tension to the game. You have to level up to get items, but you lose the one you brought into the game if you die. Thus, resulting in a risk if you bring a really great item into the trial. If you are a killer, you already have your main item, and you can then attach addons. There is a nice variety of items that all have different levels of quality. \n\n  - [b] Atmosphere. [/b] The atmosphere in this game is superb. There are several different sounds that add heavy ambiance, but also serve as audio cues for both survivor and killer. I recommend quality headphones to really get immersed. \n\n - [b] The horror. [/b] The sounds, the heartbeat, the rush to the generators while constantly watching your back. It's a survival horror game and it does a great job at making you feel like you are being stalked. Meanwhile if you are playing the killer, you have a feeling you keep seeing a survivor in the corner of your eye... \n\n - [b] Teamwork. [/b]  Other then working together on the generators, your team can help you in other ways. Other survivors can unhook you, heal you, and use flashlights to try to save you from the killers grasp. If you with the right people, working together can be a lot of fun.\n\n  - [b] Killers. [/b] I know I've mentioned this before, but there is a nice variety of killers that all feel and function differently. They each have a power that sets them apart, along with the unique perks. For example: The Wraith can turn invisible, The Hag can teleport to her traps, and the Trapper can lay out bear traps for survivors to get stuck in. They have different speeds, audio cues, etc.  It's a lot of fun to try them all. \n\n- [b] First person/third person perspective. [/b]  The killer can't be killed, but he does have a weakness. His vision. Survivors see in a third person perspective, meaning they can see all around them in a wider angle. Meanwhile the killer can only see in a first-person view which gives him tunnel like vision. This makes it easier for survivors to hide when they have nowhere to go. I think this was a really neat idea that really balances out that part of the game and let's you show off your stealth abilities. The killer is faster and deadlier, but the survivor can better scope out their surroundings.  \n\n\n[u] CONS [/u]\n\n - [b] Not Newbie Friendly. [/b] Originally when I wrote this, there was no tutorial. They just added a tutorial which is really great. The game still leaves out a lot of very important things  that they only tell you on the tip screens. I honestly think games like this should have a log in the options menu where they store their tips. Also the community isn't always welcoming to newbies and they can make it very hard to learn when you have no idea what you are doing. \n\n - [b] DLC/Microtransactions [/b] Most of the non liscensed killers used to be DLC along with a whole bunch of item packs. They finally added an in game store where you can buy the non liscensed killers for shards (currency earned by playing). Although a great improvement, they also added in some seriously expensive microtransactions. I'm talking, five dollars for a shirt expensive. Right now it's just ouftits but it feels like it could lead to worse things.\n\n - [b] Bugs. [/b] This game is not as buggy for me as the reviews say. I think they patched most of it. I do get some bugs here and there though. I think the servers are the worst part. I get kicked a lot and sometimes it doesn't let me join a game. It's not enough to ruin the experience but it does take patience on its bad days.  \n\n  \n- [b] Community. [/b] I think this IS the worst thing about Dead By Daylight. All PVP games have trolls but DbD has an especially toxic community. After most matches I'm surprised when I don't get insulted. Especially playing the killer, because people hate to lose and they make sure to blame it on any term they can such as \"camping,\" \"tunneling,\" even if it's not true. This usually happens when you go up in rank, so if you play casually you won't have as many issues. My friend suggested unranked lobbies and honestly that idea would fix a lot of issues with the game. I highly recommend playing with friends since you can guarantee more fun. I still play online with strangers and although it has it's share of trolls, It still doesn't ruin my love for the game. \n\n[u] VERDICT [/u] \nIf you are interested in the trailer or description then you should grab the game. It's exactly what it advertised and it delivers on most positive aspects. There are issues with bugs and a toxic community, which is why I recommend you buy it on discount. If you plan on playing it with friends instead of online, it would probably be even more fun.","timestamp_created":1528111399,"timestamp_updated":1532108451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":97,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.819517195224761963","comment_count":28,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42487744","author":{"steamid":"76561198351985203","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1594390394},"language":"russian","review":"Лагает, а так игра супер!","timestamp_created":1528110160,"timestamp_updated":1528110160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42487705","author":{"steamid":"76561198835051752","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1583,"last_played":1639255628},"language":"german","review":"Das spiel macht sehr viel spaß.\n","timestamp_created":1528109979,"timestamp_updated":1528109979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510607004165649414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42487651","author":{"steamid":"76561198262736009","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8525,"last_played":1658081145},"language":"polish","review":"Very nice game and nice comunity but sometimes there are a roxik players","timestamp_created":1528109722,"timestamp_updated":1528109722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42487398","author":{"steamid":"76561198054981813","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":5316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4077,"last_played":1531360852},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo e muito bom, embora exista alguns bugs recorrentes, vamos falar sobre pontos positivos e negativos.\n\nPOSITIVOS\n-Jogo survivor que nao tem CHAT o que e muito interessante pro genero do mesmo\n-Modo de jogo divertido onde pode ser assassino e sobrevivente\n-Bastante mapas e diversas missoes \n-Muitos players ONLINE\n-Configuraçoes faceis de aprender, e tambem e possivel jogar em controle (video game)\n-Graficos bons e nao muito pesados, fazendo com que um PC mais fraco voce possa jogar sem nenhum problema.\n\nNEGATIVOS\n-Lag, ja que nao possui um servidor \"privado\" você joga com russos, norte americanos e etc.\n-Grupo, o modo de seleção de grupo e ruim, por varias questoes, uma delas e que você tem que ficar convidando os amigos e nao e uma sala estilo LEFT 4 DEAD, a outra e que perde a diversao do jogo jogando em grupo e deixa muito mais dificil pro assassino.\n-Bugs, alguns bugs como subir montanhas,pular janelas, e passar por dentro de paredes acontecem bastante.\n-PLAYER IDIOTAS, isso mesmo . . . apos os portoes serem abertos sempre tem um imbecil que fica correndo e nao termina a partida, tinha que ter um tempo LIMITE ou algo assim, pessoas fazem uma partida de 10 minutos virar 30.\n\nE mais ou menos isso, o valor do jogo e cumpre o que promete.\nAvaliação final\n7/10","timestamp_created":1528108479,"timestamp_updated":1528108479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42486927","author":{"steamid":"76561198273135909","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":38123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21707,"last_played":1657835959},"language":"russian","review":"Если кто-то надумает играть в эту игру,то для начала вам нужно: \n1).

To brutalize and terrorize innocent survivors and watch them plead and flee for their lives?\n\nWell, I'm very sorry for your loss.\nThis game is almost entirely survivor-centric and will give your hardworking murderous ass the boot at every entity-damned opportunity.\n\nThey can and will break your hooks, sometimes just before you hook a survivor. They know this and when they see you nearby, will rush the hook you're bringing their ally towards.\n\nThey'll blind you so fast you won't be able to blink, much less turn away. Worse, they can do it during ANY animation, allowing them to blind you whilst you're locked mid-animation at ANY TIME. Breaking a palette? Blinded. Hitting a generator? Blinded. Picking up a survivor or setting them on a hook? Fukkin blinded boi.\nYou will soon learn the most horrifying creatures of the dark cower before mortals wielding handheld battery-operated torture devices.\n\nYou'll be stabbed in the neck while you carry them, should they fail to have an ally with a flashlight nearby, and flee at the speed of sound whilst invulnerable using Dead Hard. And then? Then ANY damage you've dealt to them is gonna git healed right up as soon as they're out of range to be detected by perks or otherwise. Because FUCK YOU.\nHell, even without perks they run faster if you slap them. Why? Because perks are [i]overrated[/i], duh. I mean really, why not let the survivors sprint even faster after you hit them? How else will they heal if they aren't halfway across the map?\nBesides, there should be so-[i]OH WAIT[/i], I just remembered. You know how you have to clean your weapon after every fucking hit? Yeah.\nThe sprint speed post-strike and animation? They stack, in terms of time wasted. [b]Fair, innit?[/b]\n\nThey'll rush and camp a generator per survivor at a time, finishing them before you can even manage to find one if they can get every check without error. Chase them away? Now they all know where you are and can watch you chase their ally from a distance while they safely screw up and fix their generator, forcing you to either give up the chase and try to get them off of their generators OR resume chasing their friend... And getting circle-jerked around the numerous loops, ran through ledges that they quick-vault with ease and slapped like a sucka by a fucking endless supply of palettes. Which, by the way, since the \"nerf\" way back now regenerate. They were \"nerfed\" by removing some from the maps... Which they later went back on and re-added. Only this time, more palettes in \"safe loops\" instead.\n[i]Look that shit up and cry.[/i]\n\nPalettes... Stop murder machines with supernatural strength. For a fair span of time, to boot, with the best perk to break palettes reducing the time to break by a mere 20%. And no, this doesn't include the duration of the stun should they throw a palette on you... Which they will. See, survivors LOVE to waste your time. Because that's how THEY have fun. Nevermind that they shout if you camp one on the hook that's been cucking you the whole game, THEY need to have fun or else it isn't fair.\n\nAnd boy, they have a lot of fun sitting right behind palettes with you on the other side. Wanna circle around and hit them? GREAT. Just have to do so before they do the exact same to avoid you, but they can just step past the palette with little worry, unlike your sad mangled face. Shame, but they'll waste about between 12-60 seconds doing this crap, depending on how masterful their trolling is and how safe the loop is, as well as if there are any windows nearby.\n\nHow long is the average match, you may ask? Why, it's about between 2-6 minutes long!\nI tended to find most matches end at 3 minutes, but some I've been in lasted less than a FUCKING MINUTE. How? WHO KNOWS? Maybe those toolboxes all 3 carried, while the 4th's flashlight was used to troll and blind when trying to carry them away. But hey, that means all those lovely perks with time to reuse them at more than a few seconds are gonna be extremely limited in utility, no matter how awesome they sound.\n\nBut wait, the match is near done and you have a single survivor injured? Well gee, if you hit and hook him, it won't be a total loss! Oh, but again I must apologize. Literally every single survivor nearby is gonna body-block you and prevent you from downing ANYONE, since even if you HIT someone, you'll have to wait to wipe that tasty blood off of your tickling toy before you can dare to swing again. While you do that? Yup, one opened the gate and the rest are now fleeing with their flashlights blinking at you joyously for your kind treatment and gentle caresses.\n\nI mean really, it's not a horror game until the entire team comes to greet YOU with flashlights and shivs.\nWhy run away from the horror monster? I mean, it's not like it can actually kill them.\n\nYou wanna kill anyone, you need to hook A SINGLE FUCKING SURVIVOR THREE DAMNED TIMES or alternatively... You can wait 120 seconds and hope the fella you hooked doesn't get rescued by anyone while you have your back to them.\nIt takes a full 3 seconds or so to rescue them and even if you hit the rescuer, they won't go down if they're healthy. But hey, you CAN grab them! If you're in body-to-body distance. And the game registers it correctly.\nI mean, sometimes the hooked fella gets unhooked anyways. Often you'll just hit the rescuer and they'll both flee whilst cackling at you sampling your murder prod.\n\nIf you're lucky or skilled enough, maybe you'll hit the guy you just hooked and rehook them! BUT WAIT, IS THAT... A BATTERY-OPERATED TORTURE DEVICE? Oh glory, you've had your eyes singed by the unholy sadism of the survivor's favorite, the DED BY FLASHLIGHT. Or perhaps just prior to hitting the previously hooked boi, you got body-blocked by a third party? Or perhaps they used Dead Hard or the like to escape your attack and flee to the exit.\n\n\nInevitably, all your perks are either shit, mediocre or effective... Hexes which they will promptly ruin without so much as a skill check. Yes. That's correct. The better perks you can get can be destroyed in a matter of seconds without even making a skill check. Because again, fuck. You.\n\nGot an ability to detect a survivor if they run past crows? Doesn't do shit if they crouch or have a perk to literally be friends with the animals. It also only works 75% of the time and within a short distance of you.\n\nEven your killer's baby pacifier of choice can be totally countered, such as The Pig's reverse bear traps, which can be totally negated by popping a massive luck boost item that will let the survivors find their keys in just about any box they check. Consequently, this add-on item will also allow them to get all-powerful torture devices, hi-spec medkits and toolboxes that would make the gods of war blush.\n\nKilled all three through persistence and sheer effort? Sorry stab boi, but the last just slid down the hatch. You shut the hatch? If he's not a slug, he'll leave via one of two gates that you can't hope to possibly simultaneously monitor... Or he could crawl out one of said gates, if a pal left it open.\nBecause... FUCK. YOU.\n\nNow! With all your hard work and skill negated by mechanical advantages in numeric bonuses and penalties, in time spent per task, in number of tasks achievable at a time, in stun and control options, in methods to kill... How do you enjoy this game as a killer?\n\nWell, as the devs so kindly put it a while back in reply to what we should do as killers that can't enjoy our time being endlessly trolled and given the shitty end of the stick, \"Maybe you should go play Civilization.\"\n\nFuck you too, Ded by Flashlight.\n\nEdit: Updated review info in the comments.","timestamp_created":1528096105,"timestamp_updated":1609882727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482381939888000488","comment_count":16,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42484794","author":{"steamid":"76561198090422009","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":206689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1890,"playtime_at_review":93537,"last_played":1660602674},"language":"russian","review":"Поиграв не малую часть времени, скажу, что игра с интересной концепцией, а главное захватывает.\nДа, здесь немного грубое комьюнити ( не все ), но если закрыть на это глаза, то выйдет очень даже забавный хоррор :D.

Not even that well thought out, I might add. While this is the case, the community is full of terrible players (both survivors and killers; mainly the latter) and it is no wonder the game is dead and no one likes to play. \n\nFor starters, killers get no punishment for body camping, whereas survivors get the bird circling them to reveal their location when then stand in one place too long or hid in a locker too long. There is no implimentation to stop killers from standing right in front of the hook so others can save the person on the hook, which is quite honestly a joke. \n\nKillers get to waltz around doing whatever they damn well please and the survivors get to suffer for it. The developers of this game are hilarious to think that their game is even remotely good, instead of changing things to make the game better, why not just shit out another terrible killer (the pig), oh yeah, invis was so good on Freddy, lets put that on her, BUT WAIT, why not put an instakill on her for free, that she can put on every player, then pick them up, hook them, camp them on hook, then if BY SOME MIRACLE they get free, why not put the only way of getting the trap off their head as a stand alone station THAT ISN'T EVEN GUARANTEED TO WORK, so that way when the killer knows the player is close to getting it off then can camp those too. \n\nWhat a joke of a game. Dead by Daylight could not have been a more true title because after the first week of release the game was more dead than my grandfather. 2/10 is a generous score to give this game.","timestamp_created":1528082159,"timestamp_updated":1528082159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42482159","author":{"steamid":"76561198005452291","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1640224646},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom.","timestamp_created":1528078915,"timestamp_updated":1591590412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42482071","author":{"steamid":"76561198090397773","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":10246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5784,"last_played":1587594133},"language":"english","review":"The game is actually really fun!!!

have lots of problems because of Turkey's internet connection. We cannot get efficiency from the current connection. I believe you can create new server near to us. \n\n\"7.09.2018\"\nIf decide to playing as survivor don't buy this game. Before the last updates this game was pretty good to play as a survivor. Although you die in a trial, you'd just don't mind it because it is fair enough. There was many pallets for killers to break it in 2-3 seconds. We were enjoying DBD as a team. \n\n-Nowadays there are no pallets left in any maps. Although you find one, it won't protect you. When you drop the pallet, you stun the killer but at the same time you got a hit. Yeah you can't just run and play as a talented person. Although it is red ranks, they camp you and you lose all pips. Killer is amazingly easy to play in this update. But still talentless people complaining about it. There is no balance in this game. If you have a chill life don't buy it. At least don't play survivor for your brain health. \n\n27.11.2020\n\nEvents are pay to win now. There is still a lot of bugs such as pallet hits, air hits etc.\n\n19.02.2021 \n\nThere is an incredible hitbox bug, lots of animation bugs, pipping system bugs and etc. in the game.

This is the general life and death , survive or die aspect of the game .\n\nBloodpoints wise i do beleive that the killer has the upperhand , as they can gain bloodpoints far easier than the survivors , which helps to offset the bully tactics that most matches ive played tend to have . So a killer can level easier and get new perks faster then most survivors , and also spend alot longer time waiting for a game in que .\n\nAll around its fairly ballenced , the community is what will make or break the game in general . There is maybe 1 in 4 matches where at least one survivor if not more wont disconect , this is becomming a issue . The more dc's the less bloodpoints for a killer overall and the harder the game becomes for the remaining survivors . \n\nI have also noticed alot of matches where people have admited to useing discord or other means to comunicate as a organized group of survivors . I am not sure exactly how this is done but it does give them a huge advantage over a single killerand takes away from the killers fun and ability . I have seen groups of randoms work in a pac and do a exellent job , that is the way its meant to be played and i give them props for that .\n\nIt is a very fun game when people actualy play it like its suposed to be . be warned though , if you dominate as a killer expect to be flamed in the aftermatch and accused of cheating . Most survivors I have met dont beleive a killer can win with 2+kills without cheating , which tells you a little about how the game is rigged survivabily wise against the killers .\n\nThere are alot of great players , there are alot of ... not so great players as well (im not talking about skill) , so its a potluck . They are adding a new killer and survivor as well as more customizations soon . They do work hard at trying to keep the game balenced and fresh . \n\nWith that said , though people may take alot of what i said as being negative , im just telling it how it is good or bad , and i would still recomend it . Issues with the comunity is not the developers fault . \n\nAfter 3 more months of playing the game and seeing the state its in i had to change my review . The swf discord groups run rampant over the game now and most (not all) are highly toxic . Survivors complain about camping and tunneling in the forums 10 times a day , killers complain about swf groups about the same . The developer just sits idely by offering half off sales to help replace lost players and a new killer/survivor every 3 months to generate intrest and more money as a solution to not balancing the game around their own decisions . \n\nthe decisions im talking about is the swf groups and telling killer that camping and tunneling are valid playstyles . each side has their own complaints and rather try to solve the issues at hand they just say we are going to do something about it and then seems like they ignore it and hope it goes away on its own ...","timestamp_created":1528052786,"timestamp_updated":1538327983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462249606847763062","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42476305","author":{"steamid":"76561198043177390","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4181,"last_played":1640377058},"language":"russian","review":"Уважаемые разработчики.

Спасибо друзьям за то что показали, что  при игре в кооперативе она обретает новый смысл (психи,крики,маты и т.д не то,по сравнению со смехом и стёбом). С другой стороны упоротые рандомы часто играют только на себя, при этом показывая что им просто срать на вас. Игра замечательная, игре хочется отдавать свое свободное время, дополнения так же радуют,начиная от внешек, заканчивая новыми героями,маньяками, конечно некоторые навыки маньяков явно делают дизбаланс в игре, но от этого игра не становится противной или еще какой то такой от которой будешь блевать, наоборот она шикарная во всех смыслах. В игре я заметил только 2 минуса: это пинг, и лагающие сервера, которые почему то часто начали падать. Аналогов данной игры нет, не считая неудачные попытки в стиле пятницы 13 (мёртвая игра к большёму сожалению) и других более мелких. Игру однозначно рекомендую, только советую приготовить нервы и валидол, так как ваша психика многих моментов может не выдержать. 10 из 10 неудачных скиллчеков генераторов\n\nСпустя время, всё же дополню. Игра неплохая, можно повеселится с друзьями, но, играя один, станет очень скучно. Решать наверное вам, как поступать. Фановая игруля, для собранной пачки, для соло игры - минус.
