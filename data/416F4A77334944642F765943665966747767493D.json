Constant fear of being discovered, and not being able to hit space in time while a generator goes cabang and you have to hide in a locker while the baddy goes right by you? Gold! I will say it takes forever to get into a match as a survivor. It would be much better if everyone was in a lobby and the killer was picked at random. Also wished there was an easier way to get cosmetics as a lot of it seems to be on their market place for purchase. Also wish some of the dlc would be free so you have a wider pool to choose from in the way of killers and survivors. Everyone playing is super kind in the chat and always come to pick me off hooks, so the player base is really awesome. All in all, I got this game for $20 and so should you.\n\nEDIT: For some reason the lobbies were really slow last night; so far games have been pretty easy to get into as survivor.","timestamp_created":1610606537,"timestamp_updated":1610660117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84654889","author":{"steamid":"76561198209936963","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":14995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4024,"last_played":1630659408},"language":"russian","review":"симулятор

almost 800 hours, I think its worth reviewing. Dead by Daylight has me in its grippy meaty little hands, stuck in a love hate relationship. \n\"Dead by daylight isnt a fun game,\" yes,\" \n\"so stop playing it,\"\n \"but its fun.\"\nIs basically how it is. Anyways,\nHeres the top 5 pros, (in my opinion.):\n- Thrilling. It gets your heartbeat stuck in your throat. Some games are lazy games, but sometimes youll get the shit scared out of you so bad, that you wanna play again just to get that jumpiness. You want to complete tasks, theres always something to do. Whether youre a killer main, survivor main, or fluctuate between both, theres never nothing to do. As a killer, youre on the edge of your seat with each swing, and as a survivor youre tensing at each dodge.\n-Cosmetics/characters. Now, some characters cant have cosmetics due to legal issues, but for those that can, theyre pretty damn good. The characters cosmetics are reasonably priced, too, and most of the time you can earn your way to get those cosmetics and characters just by playing and completing things. (Especially during events, where you can get the shards which you use for currency.) Theres 3 forms of currency, Iridescent shards, auric (idk how to spell it) cells, and bloodpoints. You earn bloodpoints each match, and use those to level up characters. Shards are earned by leveling up, and cells are irl currency. The pricing of things are unusually fair. \n-Map designs. Map designs are rad, the way they have windows laid out and loops, its amazing. Youre on the edge of your seat trying to make it to a window, whether youre running or chasing. The maps are pretty, immersive, theres secrets in some and stories in others, each map goes with a character or theme, and some even get updated every now and then. Some can dispute its for better or for worse, I just like the layouts in general. \n-You can play alone. Now sure, its easier to play with friends and have communication, but it isnt hard to solo queue. There are ways to make up for lack of teamwork, because some people just arent team players, but that doesnt mean you have to fail and the game makes sure of that.\n-You can get bored of it, but its easy to get right back into. This games hard, attention span wise. Essentially, its the same thing over and over. But theres things you can throw into, like tasks and the rift (unlockables,) that keep the game entertaining. And if you leave for awhile, you might miss some cosmetic things and some major updates like new characters, but you can get right back into it without being actually punished for it.\n\nNow, my top 3 cons. Theres more than 3 but these are the major ones. A make or break for a game.:\n-Lag, and bugs. Oh jesus christ, the lag and bugs are out of control. Youll glitch through things, get stuck in a pose, teleport back to where you were running. Killers know when to swing early to abuse their lag, and youll get hit like 60 feet away. Its insane. Luckily, the game is always being worked on and when the bugs are real bad, its priority, but it never stays fixed.\n-Wait times. The queue times are so bad for survivors, it used to take a solid 45 minutes to boot into one game. For killers, ive noticed it isnt that bad. It even depends on the time of day, mid day isnt as bad as night time queues. Now itll only take up to 15 minutes, but thats still 10 minutes too long to find a game, especially because I know how many people play it.\n-Toxic Community. Like, bad. This is a huge one for non dbd players, its usually because of the lag or the players. Youll get more toxic people than non toxic, theyll be rude as hell in chat or toxic by letting you die if they dont like you. Once you learn how to handle them and just be better than them (attitude wise but also play wise,) then they dont really bother, but in the start its definitely a buzzkill.","timestamp_created":1610593583,"timestamp_updated":1628053321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84648425","author":{"steamid":"76561198129250711","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1378,"last_played":1631750343},"language":"brazilian","review":"Recomendo muito esse jogo, com certeza traz momentos de agonia e risadas KKK (principalmente se for na companhia de amigos).","timestamp_created":1610593220,"timestamp_updated":1610593220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84648344","author":{"steamid":"76561198087961587","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":16263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1659714464},"language":"italian","review":"Il gioco è molto catchy, peccato che spesso il matchmaking sia casuale, assegnando giocatori di diverse abilità nella stessa partita, il sistema di segnalazione sia praticamente inutile e molti giocatori, soprattutto di rank rosso, abbiano comportamenti tossici che rendono la partita poco godibile.

И все бы хорошо, только вот развеивается «магия» очень быстро.\n\nDo you bleed?\nDead by Daylight жонглирует условностями и штампами фильмов-слэшеров, выстраивая на них весь игровой процесс. Классическая ситуация — герой что есть мочи улепетывает от маньяка, тот мрачно шагает следом, но все равно настигает жертву. В Dead by Daylight подобная волнующая сцена есть почти в каждом матче. Неубиваемый (буквально) маньяк всегда чуть быстрее жертв, он умеет читать оставленные ими следы, лучше видит карту и имеет куда больше времени для ее изучения. Беги не беги, а шанс, что убийца внезапно появится из-за угла или схватит за пятки, когда ты в отчаянии лезешь в окно, всегда велик.\n\nВ этом и интерес. Для обеих сторон.\nСочно вонзив мачете в плоть жертвы, маньяк обязательно остановится и вытрет инструмент о рукав, давая раненому герою небольшую фору. К тому же одного удара всегда мало. Убийца очень медленно протискивается в оконные проемы и долго разламывает сооруженные выжившими препятствия — чтобы жертва получила еще один шанс и игра в кошки-мышки растянулась.\n\nСтранное дело, но это даже не раздражает — условности формируют атмосферу, почти создают на наших глазах фильм ужасов. Туповатый, но увлекательный. Вся игра выстроена так, что ты собственными действиями невольно воссоздаешь знакомые с детства штампы.\nDead by Daylight одинаково хорошо заставляет игрока чувствовать себя и испуганной жертвой, и хладнокровным охотником. Хотя правильнее будет сказать — «заставляла». Когда только вышла и первые, совсем еще неопытные, убийцы и жертвы зашли в игру. Теперь же бал правят холодный расчет и беспардонное использование багов и дыр в балансе. И пути назад, кажется, уже нет.","timestamp_created":1610580244,"timestamp_updated":1610580244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84640612","author":{"steamid":"76561199005479061","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":13184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1809,"last_played":1652624644},"language":"spanish","review":"a\n","timestamp_created":1610579746,"timestamp_updated":1610579746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84640412","author":{"steamid":"76561198358145714","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":21993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":344,"playtime_at_review":4131,"last_played":1660332823},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1610579416,"timestamp_updated":1610579416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84640128","author":{"steamid":"76561198413594782","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1651765046},"language":"russian","review":"Интересный сурвайвл хоррор который затянет на много часов, на данный момент вижу только один минус - слишком большая стоимость персонажей и убийц за внутреигровую валюту. 9к мне придется копить очень долго, и это я куплю только одного. :(","timestamp_created":1610578998,"timestamp_updated":1610578998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84639867","author":{"steamid":"76561198023819448","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":5506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2195,"last_played":1652498133},"language":"english","review":"Does exactly what it says on the tin.

The first issue is, the developers had introduced a report system, where if somebody was sabotaging game play you could report that player. However, I have dealt with numerous people using cheats and hacks in this game and nothing has ever come of it. It seems like overall the developers introduced this report system not because they care about game play integrity, but to give off the impression that that they care without having to do any actual work to protect game play integrity.  Additionally, this game is listed as a horror game on the steam page. However, after over 100 hours of playing this game I can positively say that this is not a horror game. Dead by daylight is more of a 4 versus 1 survival game with a spooky atmosphere than a horror game. Another issue with this game is that, while dead by daylight does still have a large player base, not enough people are playing as killer. Therefore, anytime you want to play a game with friends, unless you have five friends to be 4 survivors and one killer to make a custom game, the likelihood that you're going to get a match is exceptionally low. Therefore, while I would recommend this game to be played with friends I honestly cannot because if you try and play this game with friends, you most likely will not find a match. Therefore, I would recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a casual time burner game above anything else. If you are looking for a fantastic horror game this is not the one. If you are looking for a great survival game this is not the one. But if you are looking for a good time burning game this is the game for you. Overall, while dead by daylight created the genre of 4 versus 1 survival horror games, I feel like the now dead game, hide or die executed this genre in much better fashion.","timestamp_created":1610575574,"timestamp_updated":1610648561,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84637253","author":{"steamid":"76561198272050673","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":49598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38361,"last_played":1648091885},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego esta bien, lo malo es que tiene muchos peros...\nsu comunidad es medio incomoda ya que cuando no te toca con alguien que trollea en la partida te toca alguien que colabora con el killer, que se desconecta, que sabotea a sus compañeros\nlos bugs siempre estan presentes y son bugs viejos que aun no han podido arreglar\ny los queridos hackers, para que esta el easy anticheat si aun hay hackers es horrible y tremendamente incomodo la cantidad de partidas en las que uno se los encuentra y arruina totalmente la experiencia de juego.","timestamp_created":1610574751,"timestamp_updated":1610574751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84637042","author":{"steamid":"76561199102458160","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":37620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7001,"last_played":1658975171},"language":"spanish","review":"Alto juego, mi favorito","timestamp_created":1610574471,"timestamp_updated":1610574471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84637005","author":{"steamid":"76561198211448059","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":25183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":258,"playtime_at_review":17939,"last_played":1660198340},"language":"english","review":"FOR THE BOYS!!!!","timestamp_created":1610574427,"timestamp_updated":1610574427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494943767786026001","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84636590","author":{"steamid":"76561198289903053","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1650058386},"language":"english","review":"trash game wont start","timestamp_created":1610573835,"timestamp_updated":1610573835,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84636520","author":{"steamid":"76561198379565529","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1629676971},"language":"turkish","review":"Sadece arkadaşlarla oynanır.","timestamp_created":1610573730,"timestamp_updated":1610573730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84636449","author":{"steamid":"76561198247116998","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":174301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":946,"playtime_at_review":81337,"last_played":1660558881},"language":"english","review":"This game is different from any other game I've played.

Ибо нет смысла играть,когда есть у кого то преимущество вместо баланса","timestamp_created":1610570797,"timestamp_updated":1610570797,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84634119","author":{"steamid":"76561199122335458","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1468,"last_played":1648423795},"language":"english","review":"its good","timestamp_created":1610570518,"timestamp_updated":1610570518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84633871","author":{"steamid":"76561199019974397","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1612434839},"language":"english","review":"64rew","timestamp_created":1610570173,"timestamp_updated":1610570173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84633725","author":{"steamid":"76561199112193577","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1621873339},"language":"english","review":"Played for years and absolutely love it, unless someone exploits a glitch.
