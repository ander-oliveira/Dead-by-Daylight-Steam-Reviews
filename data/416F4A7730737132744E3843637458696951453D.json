The survivors are very toxic, they will take the game hostage and try to taunt the killer right at the exit gates so they can hurridly leave (even if you play as freddy which i do and blood warden really isnt useful in that sense actually)\n\n2. it takes an outrageous ammount of time (as a killer) to find a fucking game to play (for me its about 30 minutes per match, but ive seen others where its an hour wait), and then people will DC as soon as they realize its freddy, fun right?\n\n3. As a survivor, many killers just want to camp you if your on the hook because usually people will try to unhook you, so actually trying to unhook people just goes away once you know the killer wants to camp everyone they catch. \n\n4. Survivors will constantly go through windows or stay around pallets to intentionally waste your time, and then laugh about it once the round is over \n\n5. Almost evertyime i try to play as a killer, my game freezes and i disconnect from the round, even though ive never had that problem as a survivor.\n\n6. The devs dont seem to care about the game. at all. Many people have had their memory whiped from the game, there are still many bugs that need to be fixed, and yet they want to add more killers and survivors and maps to a game that already has a good ammount of bugs in it. To me it just seems like they want to gain some money with new killers as fast as they can rather than actually trying to balance the game to help survivors and killers and to fix constantly occuring bugs that basically force people to rage quit.\n\n\nThis game is extremly fun to play if you just want to  casually get spooked for a few hours, but if your actually trying to rank up....the killers are toxic and the survivors are even more toxic to deal with. This game has a lot of potential, but i just cant reccomend it as it is now until there are some major changes to it :/ and to be honest i dont even know why im writing this, the devs wont even look at it anyways because their probably too busy making the next killer/survivor

Admitedly yes as other negative reviews say there are bugs, the game is not perfect, and some of the killers are pretty damn strong. But the core aspect of the game \"Horror\" rings true despite these shortcomings.\n\nThere is a very attentive design approach to Dead by Daylights horror theme and that horror is derived from adversity--a point that is missed on a lot of players. If the game were easy, or balanced you would not feel even a semblence of horror because you'd always have a way out. The cold truth of the matter is that sometimes you will queue into a game and you will die. Sometimes you might even be the first to die. And thats part of the experience. It creates that tone and atmosphere that can only be established in the time you spend at whatever map you're on. \n\nAdapting is a key part of the survivor experience. Learning what does and doesn't work through trial and error. Research and study, and grinding points to get addons that will increase your odds. I want to place special attention to the level up system in the game because its probably the best format for a horror type game like this. As you level you'll find that the 'entity' the being that controls all these games will try and eat your level ups and perks. This means you have to carefully strategize how to get in and out of the bloodweb to get the most out of each level. This ideology of optimization and adaptability is what the survivor experience is all about.\n\nAnd when all is said and done, if you're having a hard time as a survivor, that means its time to truly embrace the entity and play a killer.\n\nKiller is the most fun aspect of the game to me. its like playing as an endgame boss and exerting power and fear unto your enemies. I would say to still play survivor to get a hang of the game and get map knowledge before trying killer, but once you do you'll find a very fun gory game of hide and seek.\n\nEndless strategies, endless possibilities. The games can range from very fun to very frustrating and all the feelings in between.

Divertido jogar tanto de sobrevivente como de assassino.\nAlgumas coisas poderiam ser diferentes como escolher partidas livres ou ranqueadas, pelo menos até agora não encontrei isto (a não ser que seja com amigos). E realmente o Freddy está completamente desbalanceado no jogo, é possível correr e se esconder de todos os assassinos exceto Freddy, pois ele corre mais do que os sobreviventes e os vê o tempo todo no mundo dos sonhos o que está atrapalhando as partidas consideravelmente, muitos jogadores até saem da partida quando vêem que estão fugindo do Freddy.\nFora isto não vejo muitos outros pontos negativos.\n\nEdit: \ndepois das modificações no Freddy e o frenesi de jogar apenas com ele diminuiu acredito que as análises negativas devido a este assassino e minhas colocações já não sejam necessárias. Ademais o jogo atualmente parece estar tendo dificuldades para iniciar as partidas. A despeito de ter muitos jogadores em certas situações está se esperando bastante tempo para começar partidas e algumas vezes as mesmas não iniciam devido a uma nova comunicação que está existindo com o server deles.\n\nIndependente disto o jogo continua sendo muito bom, espero que mais assassinos sejam adicionados ainda e repensado o balanceamento dos sobreviventes. Mesmo tendo falado do Freddy anteriormente, não posso esquecer de mencionar que em grande parte o jogo favorece muito mais os sobreviventes, o que pode dificultar no futuro encontrar quem queira jogar de assassino, dado que em ranks mais altos é muito mais fácil ver os Sobreviventes dando rodeio do que o oposto. Alguns têm reclamado da minha posição inicial contra o Freddy não compreendem que existem diferentes tipos de jogadores e as mudanças no Freddy são muito mais para os jogadores com menos experiência do que para os experientes, para os quais Freddy ou qualquer outro são apenas um bobalhão correndo pra lá e pra cá com uma arma na mão.","timestamp_created":1509295818,"timestamp_updated":1510874794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36117287","author":{"steamid":"76561198380822622","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":34174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23606,"last_played":1638664641},"language":"english","review":"Do you like to sit still and have a staring contest?
