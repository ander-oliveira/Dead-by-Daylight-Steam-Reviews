If you don't already have this game or you don't have friends to play with and just not take it seriously, don't buy this game. Simple.\n\nThe Community is overall pretty toxic, the Devs don't like when you have anything negative to say about the game even if it's constructive critisim, the game has a lot of bugs that have been there for ages and the Devs love to pick and choose which ones they deem \"urgent\". Let's also not forget that BHVR used NFTs and tried to hide it from their community until we forced them to tell us about it, and even then they just tried to hide it away again. I have been red ranks both on the survivor side ( as both solo q and full SWF) and killer side, and honestly killer side is so easy it bores me - but dedicated killer mains will love to say it's the hardest thing ever. In general the game has become boring no matter what side you play, solo q or SWF, no matter what it's just...boring. The latest map they added, \"Eyrie of Crows\", feels like it is unfinished and just looks rushed. The content in this game has only been going downhill for the last couple of years and it shows no signs of stopping, even with tons of their players leaving and never returning. If BHVR wishes to run this game into the ground and not take any truthful feedback from their long term players, then I say let them.\n\nJust please don't get into this game if you haven't already or if you have other options out there to try first, at least not til the Devs actually start to show they care about this game again.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing it even though it has a couple of issues. But I want to warn some new players about playing this game. \n\nYou see, like I said before it is unbalanced. And this can lead to some not fun situations. In my eyes playing survivors with friends is the most fun you can have. Because even if the killer in the game plays not in a fun way, with friends you can do some goofy things to make it fun again (which makes losing not so bad).\n\nSolo queuing as survivor is something you should do if you have more experience with the game.  They changed the ranking system, so you should in theory be grouped with people of the same level, but it can happen that good and bad players will be grouped together. And because of that good players can sometimes get salty on the bad players, because they don't match their standard. So unless you can handle the salt or you can tolerate games not going your way because of teammates, I would suggest not solo queuing. \n\nAnd now playing killer (oh boy). As killer you should expect a lot of salt from the survivors. Because they will destroy you in the post game chat. The survivors expect that you as killer play to their standards so they have fun (even though they won't play the way that gives you the chance to play like that). For example they want you to not chase 1 or 2 survivors constantly. And I don't mean tunnelling, but chase all survivors equally. But in reality they will rush the generators, so you don't really have a choice if you want to secure a kill. If they even think that you are chasing a survivor too much, they will accuse you of tunnelling.\n\nBecause of this playing killer is less fun then playing survivor. Because as killer you need to sweat more in my opinion and you actually need to play like a D-bag (speaking from the standards of the survivors) to secure a kill. So if you don't handle salt in the chat that well, DON'T PLAY KILLER. \n\nAlso I think most survivors who complain or give salt are players who mainly play survivor and never or barely played killer. So they have no idea how it is on the other side (I can know, because I was a survivor main). So if you are going to complain against your killers, you should first play it yourself. I think you only have the right to complain at the killers play style, if you experience the killers pressure yourself.","timestamp_created":1613064074,"timestamp_updated":1640012121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477941185235977173","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86410691","author":{"steamid":"76561198152606080","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":77318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33405,"last_played":1658433282},"language":"koreana","review":"매튜야 이게 겜이야?","timestamp_created":1613063874,"timestamp_updated":1613063874,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86410668","author":{"steamid":"76561198259386746","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1881,"last_played":1656016484},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would play 24/7\n","timestamp_created":1613063847,"timestamp_updated":1613063847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86410305","author":{"steamid":"76561198930908549","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":32615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30082,"last_played":1656512985},"language":"thai","review":"ยิ่งอัปเดยิ่ง...เบื่อเกิน","timestamp_created":1613063438,"timestamp_updated":1613063438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563380300998687744","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86410209","author":{"steamid":"76561198996697275","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":34982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":78,"playtime_at_review":1916,"last_played":1660578822},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1613063342,"timestamp_updated":1613063342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86409857","author":{"steamid":"76561198165228236","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":84054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":45,"playtime_at_review":48580,"last_played":1659962034},"language":"polish","review":"Stanie se jakiś cymbał pod hakiem i się podnieca.
