The matchmaking is also horrible, as Survive With Friends causes Rank 20 killers to be matched with Rank 2 survivors because people get to play with whoever they want and get a free boost across the whole game. Playing survivor is marginally fun but gets boring the further it goes on because once you know what you're doing the game gets to be monotonous and boring. Playing survivor can be difficult however the horror dies around Rank 15 and the killer gets to be more scared of your ability to run. Your ability to get away should be based on if you can be clever but instead it's just about however many pallets you can slap down and loop until the killer gets you, or he makes a mistake and loses track of where you are. Match length is also annoying short and I believe should be slowed down to about 20 minutes at a time based on gen repair speed, if gens took longer to repair than the game would be fixed in a lot of ways because long chases would make more sense.","timestamp_created":1569028447,"timestamp_updated":1572823944,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468228727579116821","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55206466","author":{"steamid":"76561198367342924","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4128,"last_played":1632951793},"language":"english","review":"A very fun game until the matchmaking system places you against red ranks when you're in yellow.

Причём зачастую все четверо выживших выше рангом.

An offer for everyone who wants to feel like in a movie like \"Friday the 13th\".\n\nThe basics are fabulously - or rather: horrible - simple. There are four defenseless teenagers and one serial killer in the closed location. The goal of the youth is to escape, and the killer must hunt down terrified people.\n\nPlaying as one of the potential victims, we must have eyes around our head. In order to activate the gates leading to freedom, you need to activate five generators - there are always more of them on the entire map, so as not to lead to a dead end, when one remains to be turned on and the murderer is just waiting by it.\n\nSo we sneak up, hide behind walls and trees, take our time, so as not to scare the birds off, and listen, all the time going towards the nearest generator. When the killer is close, the music changes accordingly and the atmosphere thickens - although Dead by Daylight is an online production, it can scare you.\n\nOnce you reach the device, you only need to hold down one button. At the same time, however, we must carefully look at one point on the screen, because it is possible that you will have to press the second key at the indicated moment - if we fail, the generator will explode, drawing the attention of the madman. The need to watch carefully when repairing and look for a quick-time event is a well-thought-out mechanism. We cannot freely look around and this makes us a little panicked.\n\nAs a representative of young people, we observe the action from the perspective of a third person, which gives an advantage in playing hide and seek. We can also press a button to run faster. Often, however, it is not possible to plan everything well, we will start running too late and we cannot lose the murderer.\n\nWhen we get caught, the maniac hangs us from one of several hooks. We are then at the mercy of our companions who can take us down. Self-release is almost miraculous and carries the risk of immediate death. After activating five generators, teenagers can use two gates - open the passage and escape from the fenced-off location with a lifelong trauma.\n\nMeanwhile, playing a murderer is a completely different style of play. The camera goes into first-person mode, which limits the field of view. We also can't use sprint, we are moving at a constant speed all the time. We are also less agile than our victims. It's a pity that Dead by Daylight becomes repetitive a bit too quickly. The generator mode is the only type of fun available. A bit of variety is introduced by the presence of several maps, but the layout of the objects is similar in all of them. It's a pity we didn't get more options to compete and play cat and mouse.\n\nThere were also some mistakes that are sad to see in the - theoretically - final version. Rough animations, texture bleed, and weird hit detection are prime examples; Fortunately, it's only discernible occasionally, and not all the time, every round.\n\nDead by Daylight can scare you, and successful hunting can be rewarding. However, the lack of various game modes means that after a dozen or so hours we do not feel like another repetition of the bloody entertainment, unless three friends are always ready to play together.","timestamp_created":1569007586,"timestamp_updated":1612624985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55203144","author":{"steamid":"76561198206485895","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":205259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":120,"playtime_at_review":89821,"last_played":1660549003},"language":"english","review":"Played the game for a little bit, here's what I can say\n\n1. if you play survivor, do it with friends, it'll be more enjoyable\n\n2. if you play killer, do so only if you like challenges. be aware it'll be unfair sometimes\n\n3. in general: don't take this game too seriously, it'll just not make it enjoyable over a long run.

The Community is extremely toxic where basically everyone hates eachother. Playing Survivor is a pain because killers enjoy ruining peoples fun with annoying gameplay mechanics or lagswitching and playing Killer is a pain because Survivors just disrespect the killer and taunt him in various ways. The end game chat is always the same too. killers hate and flame survivors and survivors hate and flame the killer. Some people even openly admit on their profile that they only play the game to annoy others or to make them angry and for no other reason.\nIf you are here to have fun or to have a good time this definitely is not a game i could recommend. if you are here to try your hardest to win and are not looking for relaxing or fun gameplay... this might be the game for you. If you want fun and a nice environment i'd suggest to watch some good Dead by Daylight Streams instead of playing the actual game.\n\nEdit:\nThe endgame is badly designed too. it looks fancy as hell i have to admit but the gameplay mechanics especially including the hatch \"solution\" is pure garbage. you can just camp it as killer and make it unavailable. as soon as the survivor is close you can simply close the hatch and the survivor cant do anything to escape. the developers of this game dont think things trough. killers get so many buffs and positive changes to make them stronger which is just not needed anymore. they take ages to fix things in survivor favor but when killers benefit from it they take ages. example: huntress hatchet hitbox. the huntress hatchet hitbox is still just horrible as you can even hit survivors around the cornerdue to its sphere shaped hitbox.[/b]\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n[i]1- love the variation of characters and perks and combos this just makes the game a whole lot better.\n2- killers are pretty scary and look really good.\n3- you don't need to know more because her comes what will make you hate the game.[/i]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n[i]1- as i said, community messed the game up big time if you are new you will rarely get a game with the killer not camping the damn hook.\n2- killers in this game are mainly 2 types (campers and farmers), campers (which there are alot and i mean alot of) dont care about winning they just wanna watch you die for 2 minutes.\nfarmers just wont let you die or escape they will make you do multiple tasks so they can farm blood points (ofc you can report them but that doesn't do sh*t).\n3- most of the charecters are DLC's and killers too which is kinda *****.\n4- unability to communicate with your team is kinda a bad thing imo i think it's a big part of having fun is saying and hearing some funny stuff i mean it is a video game meant for fun after all.\n5- servers are trash and the \"host system\" is a huge mistake and really exploitable basically the killer is the server host which he/she can higher the ping and just pick off survivors one by one.\n6- if you want to see yourself having fun in this game you can murder your friends which is pretty fun or get you some friends to survive with.[/i]\n\n[quote=ppeacedeath][/quote]","timestamp_created":1568981095,"timestamp_updated":1603569625,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55619436502456665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55197019","author":{"steamid":"76561198364070310","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":8071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1630058641},"language":"schinese","review":"DLC有喜欢的电影屠夫入的
