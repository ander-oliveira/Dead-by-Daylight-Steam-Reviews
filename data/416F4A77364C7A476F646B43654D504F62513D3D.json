Since the days of Obscure, I dreamt of this exact game. Cooperating to survive another player has a lot of potential. I mean, if I could get stressed out by an invader in Latria Tower in Demon's Souls, no doubt being chased by a Jason Voorhees knock-off would do the trick. And the trick it does, even if Dead By Daylight isn't the most generous game in terms of maps, modes or options. The way it selects the map randomly between something like five or six places, the number of characters you can pick from that isn't really extensive or the only way you can win a game (since there is just one mode) make for a game that doesn't feel like it is at its full potential.\n\nYou play either the killer, that have a set of tricks up his/her sleeves (a weapon you can swing around and an ability, like using traps, teleporting, using a chainsaw etc...) or one of the four survivors who have...well nothing special really (they have some stats changing, but nothing groundbreaking in terms of gameplay). The survivor you pick at the beginning of a game is just a skin (except you level up that particular survivor so you better pick one and stick with it). The survivors have one job: getting to the exits: two doors and one hatch. So a game is all about activating five generators that are going to power the doors, and then opening that door, all that while not getting brutally murdered. On the other hand, the Killer has to find, hunt down, and sacrifice the survivors on hooks that are placed around the map.\n\nThe game is surprisingly pretty well balanced. The killer can only see in first person, making it easier for survivor to escape when they are being hunted, and the survivors are playing in third person, which helps a great deal when looking at the surroundings. The killer can see the generators through walls, and each time a survivor f*cks up while activating the generators (there are QTEs you need to press succesfully in order to avoid making too much noise), the killer sees the particular generator brightly shone. The survivors can hear the killer coming (except for the unholy Michael Myers, the creepy f*ck) since there is a loud heartbit that starts everytime he/she is getting near. The killer only has to touch the survivors twice to put them down to a slow crawl. He/she can then put them on a shoulder to transport them to a hook where the sacrifice part begins. Once you are hooked, this isn't the end, since your partners can get you down... So for every advantage one side has, the other one gets something else. And it is fun to play both sides, even though the survivors are way more enjoyable to play with buddies you can talk to in a vocal chat.\n\nIn my opinion, the real success of the game is in the fact that there aren't really clear win or lost states. Sure, for the survivors, escaping with a complete team is the ultimate goal, and for the killer, sacrificing the four poor souls is the best deal. But the game doesn't put it that way and only gives points for achievements done during the game; and these points are basically experience points that give you access to objects and perks you can use to help you during the game (like a toolbox that makes you activate the generator faster). Meaning that a killer that stalked a lot of players, put survivors down several times, is going to get more points than one that only caught one player once and camped in front of him/her when he/she is hooked to prevent the other players from saving the poor survivor. And one of the main source of points for survivors is altruism, the act of getting someone off the hook, healing someone or playing close to each other. \n\nThe fact that the survivors have too many generators to boot on their own, and that saving and healing buddies brings a lot of xp force the cooperation on the team; while the fact that you are not clearly losing a game if not every single survivor makes it to the end gives the permission to let someone die if it is a lost cause. And recognizing when a survivor is a lost cause or not is one of the greatest and most stressful part of the game, especially when playing with buddies in a chat room. Plus the fact that the killer can reach a really high score at the end of the game even by killing just one or two survivors lets him/her roleplay more, being more of a stalker, a relentless brute than just an executioner. And that creates much more tension than having the killer putting you to rest instantly. The more I play, the more I think the hook part is a pretty brilliant idea. The more delayed is the death, the more hope and despair you get out of your situation.\n\nTL;DR\nWith only one mode to boot, the developer made a game that can look a bit short content wise; I would say that for the price tag, it's pretty okay as far as killers and map goes (these really need to be made carefully to get a cool balance), but at least one other mode with different kind of objectives, and a handful of other skins for the survivors (like the coach, the headmaster etc...) would be a good thing. \nBut I can safely recommand the game as it is, since it is pretty damn fun for both sides mechanically. The Killer has a great emphasis on stalking, letting the prey go and coming back to it afterwards, creating a good amount of tension. And the survivors are way more efficient is they work together, which makes for a real tragedy when a buddy is getting murdered and you can't do much about it...\nYou wanted to play a slasher game: THERE, you have it!

Got this game for free on Epic Games and years later they really didnt add a whole lot to the game. To me this game is a snoozefest and I only played it for 4 hours and I am already starting to get bored. On top of that, the DLC they peddle is just extortion and absolutely stupid. Even with the game constantly going on sale, with some of the biggest sales the game still costs at least 150$ for all the DLC and the game. Thats ON SALE. The DLC is extremely costly for the very small content you get as well.\n\nAs for is this game fun? The base game is yes, but to me its barely fun and very poorly designed. The lack of voice chat makes it almost force you to cheat and get a duo on discord and play together. Which is extremely common, a lot of people will team up as survivors and be in discord while gaming with each other giving a hugely unfair advantage because this game is not balanced around voice chat. The gameplay is some of the most boring and snoozefest gameplay I have ever seen in a popular game where some comparative games are Summoners War or Clash of Clans. The only games I can really compare to this are P2W mobile games because even though it doesnt have those P2W mechanics, it looks, feels, and plays like a P2W game. Scummy marketing, poor content, expensive microtransactions, boring gameplay, etc. \n\nI believe the devs said they have no intention of adding voice chat either which for any co'op game is just a huge design flaw. Name a single co'op game that DOESNT have voice chat. Go on. Name literally just 1. They also never punish people for using discord too. For them to say, \"We have no plan to add voice chat because our team isn't competent enough to put this feature in the game.\" While having over 300$ worth of DLC for the game is just downright scummy and lazy.\n\nThis game is what I call one of those \"Herd Mentality\" games. Much like those mobile phone pay 2 win games like Diablo Immortal or Summoners War or 7 Days to Die. These games are garbage and terribly designed games that pull people in because they are emotionally invested into it. Not because its a good game, or even a decent game. Since virtually any other game is better designed and a better experience.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Ultimately, no. It is not worth the time or effort and there are a ton of better games out there that does a whole lot better job in this genre with VOICE CHAT features.\n\nHere are some better games with a much more fun experience and better built in features that are this genre:\n\nFriday the 13th, Deceit, Hunt: Showdown, and if you are looking for just a 4 player coop experience I can make a huge list of way better games.

There are so many massive issues with this game and when they release DLC little to no Black/White box testing has been done and some real serious bugs are always prevelant for weeks if not months after the release.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the amount of bugs that exist from BETA.\n\n\nThere is a progression system which is totally random and even after they reduced the time it takes to level is still horribly grindy and needs an absurd amount of points spent to get the essential perks needed to be even semi compotent.\n\n\nOnce you reach the \"max\" level of 50 it takes about 40-50k Blood Points(BP) the ingame currency/scoring system to clear out the blood web and get a new web and perks to appear. Problem is a good game for either player averages about 20-22k BP. A survivor averages about 12-16k BP. Killers can average a bit wider in 11-18k (huge gap I know) but that is if you get a standard game it is very easy to get really unlucky on both sides and come out with less than 8k hell I have cauesed survivors to get super unlucky and get out with no points cause I caught and killed them straight up.\n\n\nMatchmaking is basically non existant do not even pretend there is a balanced system for that. There are survivor and killer ranks but they are mainly for show and as a killer it is actually really hard to go down ranks unless you DC or survivors pull some real nasty crap like instantly finished generators.\n\n\nI'm not going to get into the imbalance of perks or addons as there is problems on both sides of the fence and the other always seems to think it has it worse off.\n\n\nThere are no servers for this game either it is Peer to Peer hosting meaning your connection is going to vary WILDY as it is awlays the killer that hosts. I have had to stop playing the killer as I am now on WiFI and the flux in my connection severly hampers the survivors and creates an unfun game for all as I can genrally find and kill people super easy because they can be standing still and the game suddenly registers oh they should actually be standing out in the open not in the hiding spot they are clearly standing in.\n\n\nI could go and list the bugs but others have done it and will have done it in far more detail than I can be bothered with going into right now. However I will go into the devs goal in the way they want to balance this game which will be impossible to enforce on all levels of play. They want it super simple right? 2 survivors to die and 2 survivors to live in all games. Not an average count across all games but in every single game 2 die 2 live. This will be IMPOSSIBLE to obtain due to the fact it is so difficult to survive for new players where as in the high ranks survivors are domminant and it is the killer that suffers. \n\n\nTLDR: Devs are starting to look more and more like overkill right now and im not liking where things are going with balancing as they are going for what will be unobtainable and will drive away players in droves. They are not fixing bugs and are releasing new DLC with even more bugs avoid this game at all costs currently standing.","timestamp_created":1482903415,"timestamp_updated":1482903415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541174173355102539","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28740357","author":{"steamid":"76561198353450801","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1631572361},"language":"brazilian","review":"Depois de ter comprado no lançamento comecei a jogar hoje, anos depois kkkk\nEnfim é um jogo legal até, mas não é tudo aquilo... vale se estiver em promo e pelo amor de Deus só DLC, e nenhuma grátis  tem umas que não valem um ki suco ou aqueles salgadinhos vagabundo que fazem os rins lutarem, enfim daqui a pouco lançam o Chuck (brinquedo assassino) no jogo ¬¬\nmas se tu quer matar e não pode na vida real compra ai então...\n\n","timestamp_created":1482903375,"timestamp_updated":1594185915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28740325","author":{"steamid":"76561198218521975","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6711,"last_played":1484823538},"language":"schinese","review":"蛮不错的只是BUG比较多 尽快修复 ！！！","timestamp_created":1482903285,"timestamp_updated":1482903285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28740190","author":{"steamid":"76561198048170760","num_games_owned":563,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1648185777},"language":"english","review":"Arguably my worst decision this christmas sale.\n\nI cannot refund and I was forced to keep playing in a vein attempt to get my money's worth.

Not that its been fixed yet. \n\nKiller = Host\nEverything is server side, so those \"Skills checks\" can fail if the other guy has a potato he didnt plug into an ethernet with high enough speeds.\n\nI want to bitch about -\n\nThe community does this really annoying thing where to get matches you have to switch to a download region where its 1-5pm. I do not kid, to get matches it must be in those time zones because prime time and everyone switches at those times. Getting an insane amount of lag and its 2pm? That because the host could in australia while you're in the UK. The \"Ranking\" system isnt a measure of skill, its of luck, 90% of low level players camp so you have to be lucky enough (little to no skill when the kill wildly marches around the map face fucking every wall until he finds someone and kicking every  locker until someone is inside one) to see if you get enough points to continue. Things like saving another player is valued less than leaving him behind. Most matches people finish with 0-200 altruism (Helping other players point catagory) because its not worth it. There is a worthless leveling system that turns what should be a fun game into a shit grind for points that you need thousands of just to get anything of substance, and all progression is 100% RNG. Not like stat wise, but literally the perks you get, items you get, what ranking, all 100% RNG. \n\nAlso a massive bug that prog. wipes has happened too.

Jason and Michael? Good. Do you like stealth games? Good. Do you like murdering teenagers? I wouldn't admit that on a public forum if I were you, but it helps if you want to play one of the killers. \n\nSo, I should admit this shit first before I move onto anything else: Dead by Daylight's super repetitive - the basic formula of the game is that you're a survivor stuck in some 80s slasher's backyard and you have to go fix some generators while avoiding death. On the other hand, you can BE the 80s slasher and kill teenagers or 20 somethings. Now, don't get me wrong, Dead by Daylight is a fun party game, just give yourself a long break every now and then.\n\nAnother problem with the game is the community - there's a chat for the post/pre-game lobbies, but it really doesn't serve a purpose as nobody uses it to plan and you can't use it ingame; people just use it to badmouth eachother or spam. So, there are these hooks, right? Yeah, you're supposed to put your victims on those for a higher score, except people will accuse you pretty regularly of camping the hook even if you aren't.\n\nAnyway, as I said before, you can play a survivor or a killer. I'm not gonna list them because that list is probably going to get outdated, but they all their perks which you can unlock through getting points in matches. You get the points through doing things like: saving your friends, disarming traps, or chasing down and killing people, or setting traps. The killers all have different abilities, for example, the hillbilly has a chainsaw and can run around waving the thing all willy-nilly.\n\nIt's pretty fun.\n\nBut yeah, if you can get past the shitty community and repetitive gameplay, it's a pretty decent game.

MMR is gained by escaping as survivor and kills as killer, which sounds great but actually it isn't, because neither of these things necessarily take skill to do. A Bubba can camp a basement kill for instance, taking no skill and gaining MMR, while a survivor can run a killer for 5 gens and get camped, taking skill but losing MMR. This is just one example of many problems with this system.\n\n[b]Matchmaking[/b]\nAs a follow on to MMR, at peak times in the UK, you'll be waiting for 5 minutes + for a game consistently and then you might have to leave due to bad ping. You can also then be tunnelled/camped as a survivor, ending your game or be gen rushed as a killer, also ending your game... then having to queue up again for what may or may not be a fun game. The MMR matching is too strict, bad mechanics can shorten games and there's no region lock so ping can ruin the game too, as many in-game actions are time sensitive down to the millisecond.\n\n[b]Developers[/b]\nThe lead game designer, Patrick Harris, compared this game, an asymmetric horror, to a game of hockey and literally said that \"if you run a killer for 5 gens, was it really a skilful play?\"... need I say any more?!\nQ&A's live stream is not meaningful, with only their select questions being picked, rather than the real issues and the answers are very vague, or hold no meaning. \"soon\", \"we are thinking about this\", \"early stages\", \"we are working on this\". No actual details, times, or ideas thrown out there.\n\nAlso...\n\n[list]\n [*]Patch notes are inconsistent, confusing at times and don't quantify values consistently to allow us to understand changes fully.\n [*]Developers remove gifted skins from streamers because of a valid meme and banning people on the forums for repeating it, calling it an attack on the developers when it really isn't.\n [*]Censoring developer names in the in game chat, because they really get petty and waste time doing this, rather than improving the game.\n [*]Removing streamers from fog whisperer program because they have opinions, or because they made a silly voice and they called it mocking the disabled....\n [*]Do not understand their own game across all skill levels, which is obvious from the Q&A's, forum comments, game changes, balance, etc.\n [*]They do ask for feedback via surveys every few months or so, however they seem to miss the point a lot of the time in the questions they ask, as it's always aimed at the last paid DLC and one issue they think is in the game. This is OK, however in the last survey for example, they were asking about what they could best do to reduce toxicity and all of the options we could select from were way off... i.e. remove in-game chat...! but nothing about removing tea bagging, flashlight macro, camping, tunnelling, etc, etc.\n [*]The game is made from spaghetti code and there are often game breaking bugs that allow wall hacks for example and even though there's a kill switch for perks to remove them instantly without any update, as it's server side, this takes them 4 days to do while in the meantime, it's all over Youtube and being heavily abused. Also, for 5 years you could stretch your resolution using the in-game menu to essentially double your FOV, allowing you to remove all mind games because you can see over and around loops. This was just one check box in the unreal engine and it took the developers 5 years to check it!!!\n [*]There are so many cheaters in this game and little has been done to stop them. There are even cheating bot killers that are coded by cheaters that are literal terminators. Most cheaters are subtle cheaters with wall hacks or movement speed buffs.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Camping, Tunnelling & Toxicity[/b]\nThis has been in the game since day one and any killer can do it and be successful if they choose, ruining everyone's game, as you often lose against this unless you're coordinated and prepared. It's been made worse with the rising toxicity, where killers do this for fun as they enjoy making people feel bad... and also worse with the introduction of bad MMR, as killers sometimes have to employ this strategy to get kills to increase their MMR as kills are the win condition. Camping and tunnelling can easily be solved but the developers are too scared to make any changes, despite having a test build they could add it to.\nThe tea bagging, flashlight macro from survivors is also extremely common and just makes the entire game toxic for everyone. This can easily be solved by adding a small animation delay, yet it'll probably be in the game for another 5 years.\n\n[b]Balance[/b]\nAll killers share a base MMR, so if you're really good with Nurse but awful with Ghostface, Ghostface will still probably have high MMR. This sounds fine, except Nurse is the best killer in the game and is way more viable than Ghostface. MMR should be separate for all killers, or all killers should be able to perform on the same level.\nLoads of perks are just worthless and there are so many of these, yet only a handful or so of useful ones. It just means that there's always a meta and you'll barely see any perk variety, which is boring and the meta perks are typically quite game changing, like Dead Hard.\nSurvivors at a high level stomp killers typically and it's not just down to the skill of a killer. Items and add-ons make survivors extremely powerful if they're coordinated and generator progression is just too quick and easy.\nSolo survivors  are not as powerful as SWF (group of friends) survivors, which has been in the game for 5 years and needs to be addressed.\n\n[b]Grind[/b]\nTo unlock everything in this game, it will either take several years, or you will have to spend money. To level up your characters to maximum, it would literally take 10,000 hours. No joke. Levelling up is extremely tedious and drawn out. There are no real benefits to prestiging and there should be.\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]\nI play this game still, despite my review because it's fun some of the time if I play with friends, however I would not play it if or when I have an alternative game to play, due to the fundamental issues addressed above. I would not recommend this, unless you don't mind having 1 hour of fun out of 3 hours play time, as you likely have something better in your library to play. The game is also in a downhill spiral due to the above issues as presented in the steam player counts.","timestamp_created":1482893988,"timestamp_updated":1650754754,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28736568","author":{"steamid":"76561198043891113","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1527236385},"language":"english","review":"i was hooked at start but got bored after 10+ hours.\nplay it with friends for some fun time.","timestamp_created":1482893902,"timestamp_updated":1538034467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28736406","author":{"steamid":"76561197983028116","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1654036565},"language":"english","review":"Best Loading Screen Simulator 2016.\n\nThe random crashes after waiting 20 minutes for a game are fun too.
