Debo decir que estoy viciado con este juego. \nJugar en equipo cuando eres superviviente es genial y ver que ganas puntos o logros por hacer ciertas acciones que podría costarte la partida, también lo es. Suelo jugar como sobreviviente porque los asesinos predeterminados sin DLC de pago, no son de mi agrado, pero al comprar el DLC de Stranger Things, me encanta ser asesino con el Demogorgon, es realmente genial ver como este causa miedo con sus gritos y jugar con los dos últimos supervivientes también es genial, verlos correr y reparar generadores mientras tu estás detrás es gracioso y divertido (Pienso que debo verme así xD). \nAsí que, el truco para no aburrirte, es jugar en ambos lados, tanto como superviviente, como asesino.\n\nYa con más de 1000h jugadas, no me canso de jugarlo y me encanta que vayan agregando más y más contenido enriqueciendo en lo más posible al juego.","timestamp_created":1572994191,"timestamp_updated":1606431220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56590808","author":{"steamid":"76561198132329589","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":10660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4443,"last_played":1649124415},"language":"english","review":"its a good multiplayer game that keeps updated pretty frequently.

Your telling me as a survivor i can find 3 other survivors and a killer within a min in que but killer takes me between 15-45 mins to find a game? Its totally unacceptable that i can go do house work , prep dinner and start and finish a anime episode and come back and still be searching for a match. Then i exit outta killer side and be ina match within 1- 3 mins as a survivor. What the hell is wrong with your game ? Im currently in que for killer and have been for the last 35 mins, and there is no way it takes that long to find 4 survivors since apparently finding 3 survivors and a killer takes less then 60 seconds. Can you please make survivors broken as shit again so i can atleast attempt to play killer more then once or at most twice a hour ? i can get atleast 4 maybe 5-6 as survivor depending on team mates. Then the cherry on this shit cake is getting into a killer match and being called a toxic pos F%$##et p$#@#y sh%ter who donesnt let them get hatch and doesnt instantly leave the area after hooking

hasta los 30fps con frecuencia a pesar de estar en gráficos bajos y la GPU no parese subir de 70% de utilizacion.\n\nAun con una buena computadora lo recomendable es jugar con graficos bajos pues es

1/5 de la gente quiere jugar asesino, se requieren 5 jugadores para la partida, 4 sobrevivientes y 1 asesino.\n\nCompras el juego y aun hay mucho contenido por adquirir, la mayor parte de los asesinos
