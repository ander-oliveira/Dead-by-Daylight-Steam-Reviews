Dead by Daylight is a cooperative that rewards teamwork, but does not force it. Helping your fellow survivors get objectives will reward you with extra points and move things along faster, but it could also be your downfall if mistakes are made. \n\nI have had this game since release and I have been pleased with the attention the Devs have given it so far. The two major cons about this game are the horrible lobby system and some balancing issues with the perks. The past few updates have made changes to perks in an attempt to balance the playing field for both survivor and killer. I have not noticed any updates to the lobby system, so hopefully that comes soon. \n\nI have had some awesome moments in this game.

It is a very interactive game where you run from the killer and try to repair generators to make an escape. There are only a couple of issues I have with the game and I will list them below:\n\nMatch making is absolutely trash! - Like I said above, this is great game to play with your friends, but it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a game online. It will go through the same process every 5 seconds. You will tell your friends to \"Ready up\" and then you wait for the timer to go down to 0 seconds left and then it will tell you \"No matches have been found\" and then you will have to ready up AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN (This process usually takes around 20 - 30 minutes if you qued up with 4 people). Once you actually get into a game you are looking forward to be playing against a level 10- (20 being the worst and 1 being the best) and getting demolished because they know the tactics and you don't. The game dosen't have any balance to it when it comes to queing people to their ranks, so if you are going to get it make sure you are ready to be patient for games and learn fast.\n\nLots of bugs - When you are new to the game you won't know what is going on with yoyur match making so when you first \"Ready up\" it will say \"Searching for matches\" and then it will stay like that, but instead of the button saying \"Unready\" it says \"Ready\" which makes you want to click it. Don't get me wrong, this is a very small glitch, but it is just one out of the many I wanted to point out.\n\nBoosting is a thing - Sometimes you will get paired up with a killer who doesn't do anything and stands next to you and watches you fix all of the generators. Sure, it might be great for your bloodweb (Money/points), but it just ruins the game and you have to find another que which will take 30 minutes.\n\nI just feel like this game was very rushed and I was going to refund it, but I thought I would give it one last chance before I do and I went over the time required to be able to refund it just because I had to sit in a lobby with my friends and wait for 30 minutes at a time.

Played quite a bit on it and of course with that being said, I don't understand why people complain about other survivors not going after them when a killer body camps. Honestly team work is a thing yes sometimes. But if you are on a hook and being body camped you can buy the others more time. That's how I see it though when I play I do try to rescue as many people as possible if I can manage it. \n\nOf course the only thing I don't really like about the game are as follows;\n\n1: Finding a match can be near impossible sometimes. I think they need to work on this at least a little bit. Perhaps find an easier way to set it up so matches can be found instead of spending 10 minutes looking for one only to have the killer disconnect or just leave for some reason or another.\n\n2: The chainsaw guys move that allows him to do a one hit knock down and can also hit people AFTER they vault. like I figure the ability needs some form of cool down. It doesn't bother me if the map or the setting is more in the favor of the killer but I feel like this is just a little too massively OP for that. Let them keep it but like how our perks have at least some form of cool downs, the killers should be the same.\n\n3: Now this one I don't think they can do much about but it bothers a lot of players I have noticed. Cause it's something people constantly complain about. And honestly yes I was annoyed about it at first but really the way I look at it, if the killer is body camping you. Then well you must have annoyed him enough to have him keep his eyes on you at all times or he just wants the easy points. But whatever make his life heck and don't struggle. Make him wait around till the prompt comes up then STRUGGLE. people can literally finish two or three gens in that time period, I've seen it happen. So take it as an honor to be the sacrifice. This isn't so much of a complaint on my end XD I'm just tired of seeing people complain when it's a good thing and a bad thing at the time.\n\n4: The killers should also be slowed by the obstacles like the survivors are. I mean I never really look behind me long enough to notice, but I've run AROUND a tree before and they've hit me through the tree. So just make the obstacles a little more against the killer too maybe? Hard for us to get through but also not so easy for them either, more than just the boards and the windows that we can vault through.\n\nBut really I do love this game and will keep playing it no matter how many times people complain about how it gets boring. And it's never fun. You always seem to get a different killer. And some are different. They don't body camp all the time, they give you chances. Or they completely miss you . I've had a lot of matches where I have trolled killers into thinking I was somewhere else. And escaping right under the person's nose. It's great. There was also another match where my friend was playing and I was watching. He escaped BY CRAWLING. So again it's all how we make this game fun by just enjoying it. I don't even care about survivor rank anymore. I just want my blood points XD and to troll killers. Is that so bad? Highly recommend this game tho~\n\nUpdate! I still highly love this game but I hope they fix the camping and the issue with decisive strike currently and how traps work under hooks.

At a few hundreds hours the game is just massively unpleasant to play. Keep in mind this review is after quitting and returning to the game a few times, and trying to give the developers the benefit of the doubt and chances to redeem the game.\n\nHere are a few warnings and points I have to make which I feel you ought to keep in mind if deciding to purchase the game:\n\n- Developers\n\nAlthough reasonably communicative and polite, no input from the community is truly implemented in a meaningful or somewhat timely manner. The game still has glaring core game play issues which haven't been fixed from release. There is also arguably a balance bias towards survivors, the pessimist in me would point out they seem to make up most of the player base and thus omake the dev team the most money. There are awful frustrating gameplay elements which haven't been fixed, but cosmetic releases seem to take priority in their eyes.\n\n- Has one of the most toxic communities I have ever experienced.\n\nThe core game play essentially resorts to bullying. The post game chats are awful, the forums are just people complaining with no real input on how to fix their complaints. There is also a fairly cringe role playing aspect now, where people will role play in matches, losing their teammates games. I wish I was making this up. The community also seems to have a strange stranglehold on the devs which may or not lead to lore changes, weird game design and extremely poor balance.\n\n- The Killers are poorly balanced\n\nThe power imbalance between killers is the strangest aspect of this game. Stealth killers although able to perform at high ranks, are mostly negated by one perk (Spine Chill), meaning they have to do an awkward crab walk (facing slightly off target where they are going) in order not to be detected. It's weird. Then you have Nurse, a killer who will wipe every match at high ranks, being able to instantly port onto a survivor and hit them pretty much, in comparison to that most other killers are restricted to boringly run around and around \"loops\", impassible terrain with pallets and vault height walls in between. Most killers have no map pressure meaning games are over extremely fast.\n\n- Boring Survivor Game Play\n\nOnce the fear or initial adrenaline has passed, it becomes apparent that the survivor game play is a repetitive mind numbing experience. Every match is essentially fix a generator and then walk off/hide when the killer comes. If discovered, simply run around objects while blocking the killers paths with pallets and waist high walls. There are ofc perks to add \"Spice\", but once again the balance is so horrendous you'll find most survivors running the same perks, which are at most completely broken, boring and predictable.\n\n- The Grind\n\nThe grind for viable perks which are integral to the game play is beyond ridiculous and is frankly immoral. You will spend hundreds of hours grinding for perks on a randomly generated skill tree. Then you will be grinding to unlock those perks on other characters skill trees, and then grinding again to unlock those perks on the characters you want. This process also repeats every time you \"prestige\" resetting a character. The game's skill tree, called a blood web, feels like a mobile game invention to keep you playing. I don't think core gameplay aspects should be locked behind such a heavy grind.\n\n- The Matches\n\nThe matchmaking system is awful. You will find new players pitted against high level killers and vice versa. This becomes worse when most survivors at high level have jaded themselves from playing so much and simply resort to trolling the killer for fun, abusing the many mechanics the behaviour team has turned a blind eye to.\n\n- Survive With Friends\n\nEither playing with voice communication wasn't intended for this game, or the developers never properly tested it's impacts on the game. It is such a powerful tool in DBD it might as well be cheating and unfortunately results in an even worse exaggerated version of the generator rush. At higher ranks SWF Survivor game play derives fun from bullying the killer, the obvious power imbalance between the two becomes glaringly obvious.\n\n- Generator Rushing\n\nThe objective of the match is to fix generators to power the exit gates to escape and win. The killer has to stop the survivors from performing these objectives, however currently generators pop faster than fireworks on new years. This of course hurts both sides, as with competent survivors the game simply goes too fast for killers to make any actual impact, eliminating chase time which is supposedly the most exciting aspect of the game. (Unless playing nurse). With a co-ordinated SWF group the game can be over within 3-4 minutes.\n\nAs of now SWF is a big issue and is pretty much leaving killers to quit or de rank, in turn leaving only extremely skilled killers in the matchmaking pool who end up stomping new and less skilled survivors. Leading onto the next issue\n\n- Matchmaking and Queue Times\n\nIt's no secret there is a shrinking killer pool because of the above issues, I only see this getting worse until the power imbalance is addressed. This leads to more unbalanced matchmaking and longer queue times.\n\n- Strange Perk Design\n\nDecisive Strike: for 1 minute immune to being picked up by the killer. It is not used as a perk to stop the killer from focusing one survivor down but instead to punish the killer for bad survivor play or to hide in a closet to force the killer to either be stunned or have to leave the chase.\n\nObject of Obsession: It's a literally a wall hack, I think you can imagine how stupidly OP this is especially in communicating 4 man teams.\n\nUnbreakable: Pick yourself up off the floor once downed. Now coupled with Soulguard, it is a growing trend in this game to give survivors more and more chances for playing badly, even though they have to be hooked 3 times already to actually die.\n\n- Hook Camping\n\nAn issue which has been in the game since day 1. Killers will simply hook a survivor and facecamp them, although this may lead them to losing the match, this takes a survivor and player out of the game making it an unenjoyable experience. This behaviour is becoming more common as the killer/survivor tribal mentality leads to more toxic interactions.\n\n- Cosmetics\n\nMost bar a few halloween and older cosmetics, look absolutely ridiculous and I feel prove that the dev's greed is the priority. They completely negate any tense dark atmosphere the game had and completely eliminate the horror element. It's very hard to take seriously with people running around in bright spandex and bunny costumes. \n\n- Bugs\n\nThe game is full of bugs that can make or break the game for you, most of them freezing the game or your character, one bug even allowing the survivor to view the killer the whole entire game if you glitch on his back. Another wipes away all sounds from the survivors, which is massively important information for killers. They are plentiful and can even delete progress, these have not been addressed or fixed.\n\nIn conclusion, I simply feel it's wrong to give money to this company, it's encouraging poorly made games with addictive mechanics and micro-transactions which is in abundance in the game industry already. I had given them the benefit of the doubt but after years of revisiting, it seems that it's not really going to improve the core game play. I want my games to be fun and enjoyable, but this feels soulless and mostly frustrating, compounded by the toxic community.\n\n This game has such potential but with such passive, slow and money greedy devs I highly doubt it'll ever reach it. All in all, 5/10. Fun for a casual game, get it on a high discount, but expect glaring issues which will ruin it for you at some point.","timestamp_created":1470703330,"timestamp_updated":1595262249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24785563","author":{"steamid":"76561198118109773","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":37858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2225,"last_played":1655252181},"language":"spanish","review":"este juego es la polla\n","timestamp_created":1470701188,"timestamp_updated":1470701188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557923257350921631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24785539","author":{"steamid":"76561198133846272","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":83,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1604380795},"language":"english","review":"you cant even join online lobbys with firends. lobbys dont work at all","timestamp_created":1470701054,"timestamp_updated":1470701054,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24785406","author":{"steamid":"76561198208728897","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":407,"last_played":1599497687},"language":"english","review":"The game itself is fun, the atmosphere is immersive while the gameplay does keep the player active and entertained. As far as the accessibility go, it doesn't require high end specs in order to be able to play the game. However, thats probably as far as the good things go. The queue for the game is broken to some degree, often failing to join a game and popping me back out to re-queue. The communication between players is very limited as there are no voice or text chat enabled once the game starts. I know that this may be intended to emphasise the genre of survival horror, however with more communication between each member, it can open up more strategical views of the game, such as the distribution of each member, how they will deal with the situation etc. I would like to reiterate that the game itself is fun, however I find it more of a solo gaming experience more than a multiplayer. For those who play just for the fun and horror, this is a great game to consider.

É um game estilo pega pega extremamente tático e criativo, que lhe coloca dentro de um mapa onde o único objetivo é sair com vida caso seja sobrevivente, ou matar todos caso esteja na pele do caçador. A Jogabilidade é bem fluida, os gráficos não sao nada de outro mundo, porém o jogo é pesado apenas no ultra, já no low é bem tranquilo pra rodar. Os menus são intuitivos, o sistema de rank e level de personagens é bem feito assim como sistema de perks ( habilidades que o personagem ganha conforme sobe de level) e tais mecânicas criam a vontade de jogar o jogo por mais repetitivo que seja, garantindo portanto uma boa diversão e muitas risadas caso esteja jogando com seus amigos. O jogo deixa a desejar entretanto apenas com relação aos bugs e algumas mecânicas que desequilibram caçador - sobrevivente, e por também não ter sistema de filtro de jogadores por rank, o que pode dificultar pros mais novatos. Mas como um jogo recém lançado, tem tido um ótimo feedback da comunidade steam, um bom numero de jogadores e um bom número de atualizações. Espero que lançem dlc's que complementem a experiencia.

It's filled to the brim with bugs that just make you stop and go \"wtf\", but at the same time there's plenty fun to be had once you get a good match or get some friends together to mess around. It's pretty crazy how fast a game can be going your way, then in a split second decision, get you and possibly most of your teammates killed. If you want a good co-op horror game, or just a casual game for you and four other buddies to play, I'd for sure recommend it.\n\nEdit: As of now, I have found myself appreciating the game much more. I put more hours into Killer and I have realized that you can either have the best time or the worst time. There's never any real \"meh\" matches. After getting used to the metas, getting into higher ranked play and overall just making the whole experience a new world to explore, it's something quite admirable and makes me completely appreciate the game in a new light. Game is a salt fest though, a lot of the community is a brutal and savage wasteland.","timestamp_created":1470681304,"timestamp_updated":1548265772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24781376","author":{"steamid":"76561198236388690","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":17662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3003,"last_played":1630932390},"language":"schinese","review":"早就想买了就等官方汉化，农场主砍偷电戝真的是非常爽！\n","timestamp_created":1470681232,"timestamp_updated":1470681232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24780865","author":{"steamid":"76561198165227579","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3354,"last_played":1640187509},"language":"russian","review":"Когда выживших 4, а убивают только тебя. 10 овечек из 10","timestamp_created":1470679303,"timestamp_updated":1470679303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497953981161117554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24780862","author":{"steamid":"76561198302387356","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1496007227},"language":"schinese","review":"更新简体中文好评，虽然是机翻，跟进化换着玩","timestamp_created":1470679283,"timestamp_updated":1470679283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24780755","author":{"steamid":"76561198151433479","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1573995196},"language":"russian","review":"Aherennaya geima chtob sigratj s druzyami , no nadoedaetj.\n(Prizrak chlen s kosichkami)\nGhost chlen x2!","timestamp_created":1470678853,"timestamp_updated":1470678853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24780717","author":{"steamid":"76561198017800204","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1485593346},"language":"schinese","review":"好好好，刺激又动感","timestamp_created":1470678739,"timestamp_updated":1470678739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24780672","author":{"steamid":"76561198208244359","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":592,"last_played":1630889546},"language":"english","review":"GG if you like slasher movies get this game hella fun some bugs but hey its still so awesome and unique","timestamp_created":1470678560,"timestamp_updated":1470678560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24780657","author":{"steamid":"76561198123929891","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1949,"last_played":1637879921},"language":"english","review":"This game needs to fix their queue system then i'll give it a good review.
