The game's mechanics are pretty simple and therefore very friendly towards newcomers and \"casual players\".\n\nTo learn and understand the game the best while still having a s#!t ton of fun, I suggest to play both sides (survivor and killer) frequently, instead of \"maining\" one side only. At this point I want to mention that it is possible to play survivor with friends in a public match(\"Survive with Friends\") vs a random killer or only with friends -the killer is being played by a friend as well- in a private/unranked match(\"Kill your Friends\")\n\nThe balance of this game is definitely not in a perfect state yet and I as many others do not agree with all decisions the devs have made in the past, but it is getting better over time since release. The developers of this game [u]really[/u] care about this game, they released so much patches and new content over the last 16 months.\nJust a lil' heads up: This game had 3 different killers and 4 different survivors at release. Now we have 10 killers and 11 survivors! (In case I didnt misscount).\n\nThe only real negative points I wanna mention here:\n-the high rank meta can become a little bit stale, but new balance patches and a big variety of different killers definitely helps on that.\n\n- the community(especially when you get closer to the higher ranks) is pretty toxic. especially the constant \"survivor main vs killer main\" flamewars are annoying. Since we have a so-called \"soft-ban\" system here in DbD to deal with any kind of misbehaviour, it got [u]tremendously[/u] better. Before, deaththreats, cancer-wishes and harassment on Steam with group invites were standard whenever you played killer.\n\n- some flawed game design decisions (but it's getting better!)\n\nTL;DR this game has a more than fair price. If you are a fan of the survival horror genre, just give it a shoot, not much you can do wrong with 20$. Keep in mind that you are also able to refund within the first 2h playtime on Steam :)\n\nIf you are still unsure, just check out some \"Let's plays\" on YouTube or some streams on Twitch","timestamp_created":1509573348,"timestamp_updated":1509573643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483225613832473755","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36203003","author":{"steamid":"76561198033421482","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1516435795},"language":"russian","review":"поиргал всего 5 часов.

Perhaps the best asymmetrical online survival horror game wihout any doube!. Coming from a horror movies/games fan, this game is a must have especially if you have friends to play with.\nThe game idea is simple, as a survivor you need to survive! fix generators to power up the gates and escape, help your teammates and make the killers life harder by sabbotaging their hooks!.\nAs a Killer, earn your title :). \nThe game play is great. I saw and heard people criticizing various aspects of the game but I totally disagree with that, for instance:\n1. Third person view a survivor and 1st as a killer: I think this is great and makes the game fair and balanced especially since survivors can't fight back.\n2. Lack of weapons: Honestly, that the true fun of this game, you are absolutely defenseless! however, you can still use the environment to your advantage, along some of your characters perks. If you want to use weapons to beat the killer, then play Friday 13th (which tbh I didn't quite liked) or Evolve!\n3. Paid DLCs: The game without DLCs is still great and tbh relatively cheap! moreover, you can still still play against DLC killers/survivors even if you don't have the DLCs which is good. Besides, if you want copyrighted characters like Freddy Kreuger and Michale Myers then obviously that won't be free!\n\nGraphics: They aren't topnotch but who cares! the game is absolutely amazing besides what do you expect from an Indie game!.. and tbh the graphics imo are still better than most bethesda games graphics (which is a AAA company)\n\nOverall, I think this is the counterstrike of the horror genre... simple, addictive and great fun!","timestamp_created":1509561127,"timestamp_updated":1509561127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36198604","author":{"steamid":"76561198434858879","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":27178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1002,"last_played":1521400009},"language":"english","review":"It is  so funny","timestamp_created":1509560618,"timestamp_updated":1509560618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36198306","author":{"steamid":"76561198253707236","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14754,"last_played":1634567651},"language":"english","review":"Can you read my messege at gmail ;)\n","timestamp_created":1509559883,"timestamp_updated":1509559883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36198130","author":{"steamid":"76561198137393098","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":72940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72197,"last_played":1647170304},"language":"english","review":"Dbd at its core is an amazing game. The problem is the community and developers being unable to balance the game and fix issues. \n\nWhen you first start playing you'll think killers are extremly powerful and if you're going up against a more experinced killers in the lower ranks you'll almost certainly will die, so will your whole team. But as you progress and learn more, you'll quickly notice just how weak the killer role really is. \n\nAt the highest rank, the only viable killers are Nurse, Spirit and Blight. All of them have strong mobility and can counter loops. Hag comes close but the three mentioned above are better in my opinion. Then you've got every single basic m1 killer who can't hold their own against strong survivors, especially SWFs. Both sides have second chance perks but the survivors have far more that are harder to counter, while killers really only have a few, NOED being the strongest. These second chance perks ruin the game experience for both sides in my opinion. Yet these perks never get nerfed. Stealth is also not very viable in this game and most of the times you'll be better off looping the killer than trying to hide from them. \n\nThe DBD community is by far, the most toxic community I've ever seen. You'll certinaly need to have some real thick skin in order to enjoy this game. You will get facecamped and tunneled as a survivor, and you will get tbagged and called trash as killer. But that's not the worst part, entitled dbd players (Mostly survivors) will literally have the audacity to come to your profile and -rep you and call you bad things if you killed them. \n\nNot only that, but the game suffers from hackers too. Played against one myself yesterday as a killer. It takes a solid 15 minutes to get into a killer game and to have the whole match ruined because of hackers really sucks. There's nothing you can do except staring into a wall and wait until they all escape. \n\nIn conclusion, BHVR cares more about people buying their cosmetics and battle pass ripoff than actually fixing issues in the game.","timestamp_created":1509559299,"timestamp_updated":1628685103,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36198069","author":{"steamid":"76561198046392232","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":5954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2892,"last_played":1627951882},"language":"english","review":"I recommend this but  \n\nFreddy is too overpowered. pay to win in a game where the kiler is good already...\nI actually gained a Phobia from hearing freddy's children singing. not joking.......","timestamp_created":1509559161,"timestamp_updated":1509884551,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48245614767074585","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36197982","author":{"steamid":"76561198139071717","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":26811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24348,"last_played":1631126796},"language":"russian","review":"Я купил игру, чтобы потом доплачивать за новых маньяков и сурвов?
