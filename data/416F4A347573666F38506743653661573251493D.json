The game favours toxicity, any griefing, camping, tunneling, selfish plays, basically everything that can ruin the game experience is rewarded. The more toxic you are the more you'll advance and the more you'll gain. It's basically the PC version of a gatcha game where you pay money to grind like a slave in matches that are rarely rewarding unless you play meta perks/strats. Also no matter how many perks and characters they add the meta rarely changes. The game needs massive balancing and patching but they care more about adding flashy characters than working on improving the game experience and what is being rewarded. Forget about doing objectives because they barely give anything and chances are the Survivor that ends up with the most points brought the Killer straight to you as you're repairing gens so you can die and they can get the hatch and gain free 5k points for griefing. Forget about chasing multiple survivors and fair play because you'll lose unless you have the meta perks that require massive grind. Oh and forget playing your favourite Killer/Survivor until you grind and farm like crazy to get the perks you need to have a decent (not even a good) match. You can't even report bad behaviour because the game itself rewards it. The matchmaking system is non-existent, the ranks are all over the place and it's a free-for-all in regards to the skills of the players in a match. You get pros that have rank 1 and 1k hours of playtime in the same match as people that just installed the game and barely finished the tutorials. Oh and THE GRIIIND, Gatcha games have the same grind as this game.

If you want to play a game that makes you want to jump off a cliff without a parachute, go ahead and play. This game used to be so much fun. It was a great concept. But the community is made up of 98% crybabies or people who play as toxic as possible because they think its funny. These people have completely ruined the game. And the devs do absolutely nothing about the insane levels of just pure toxicity that has completely enveloped this entire game. The devs also do nothing about fixing problems that have been around for the past 3 years, yet they find the time to push one new DLC or cosmetic out after another. As long as it makes money, am I right? I mean, why put effort into fixing this broken game when you can make David a new outfit that costs the community $10 to buy? So yes, if you feel like your frustration levels are not met for the day, come on down and play some DBD. Guaranteed to make you see red. Just remember, the devs aren't liable when you throw your mouse through your computer screen.\n\nUpdate 7/21/22: This game is total & complete garbage now. The devs said they were gonna make changes to balance the game out and make it more fair (as they should because playing as killer was definitely a struggle) but they went so far over the line that it has made this unplayable for anyone that plays survivor solo (without friends). Every single killer is now bringing in the same perks every single match to make gens so slow that you're stuck in game for a half hour just trying to finish one damn gen. It is so ridiculously boring. Yes they needed to make changes and balance, but this is so slowed down that it makes playing survivor impossible. I am so glad VHS dropped the same day as this garbage update. Good luck devs, you'll need it when more than half your player base refuses to play survivor anymore.","timestamp_created":1618705548,"timestamp_updated":1658448541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90493277","author":{"steamid":"76561198145762107","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":717,"playtime_at_review":1194,"last_played":1660538248},"language":"english","review":"I have a love hate relationship with this game.

Według mnie tak\nCzy dead by daylight to dobra gra? Nie.\n(recenzję piszę tylko z perspektywy ocalałego bo mordercą po prostu nie grałem wystarczająco)\nZ założenia dbd to asymetryczna gra horrorowa multiplayer (1 zabójca vs 4 ocalałych) w praktyce jest trochę inaczej, jako że to gracze wcielają się w morderców to są oni nie przewidywalni i podejmują często głupie decyzje (to nie jest wadą dla gry) albo zdarza im się być friendly i często dawać uciec ostatniemu ocalałemu albo w ogóle nie walczyć tylko biegać po mapie i się przyglądać ale nawet jeśli morderca będzie się wczuwać i polować na ocalałych to i tak gra nie jest jakoś specjalnie straszna, większości graczy można łatwo uciec albo się schować, mimo to gra nie jest zła bo rywalizacja i staranie się nie dać złapać mordercy naprawiając przy tym generatory i zdejmując innych graczy z haków daje dużo satysfakcji\nJeśli chodzi o społeczność to po stronie survivorów przez 100 godzin spotkałem dosłownie 3 grieferów więc nie ma na co narzekać ale mimo to przez długie matchmakingi warto mieć swoją ekipę do grania. Po stronie killerów jest trochę inaczej bo może nie ma toxiców, grieferów czy cheaterów ale sporo graczy jest po prostu friendly i może nie brzmi to jak wada ale jak się chce po prostu czasem zagrać zwyczajny mecz to taki nic nie robiący zabójca będzie tylko przeszkadzał, zazwyczaj robiąc wtedy standardowo generatory bo bez mordercy nie ma dużo więcej do roboty dostanie się +0 a czasem nawet -1 do rangi więc po prostu tacy gracze często marnują czas swój i 4 graczy w przeciwnej drużynie. Co do cheaterów to spotkałem kilku ale nie jest to jakiś nieakceptowalny poziom żeby się nie dało cieszyć grą\nCo do grafiki to, szczerze? jest zła, nie tragiczna ani nic ale dobrą czy nawet przeciętną bym jej nie nazwał gra, nie jestem specjalistą i nie wiem czy wina jest w shaderach czy w czym dokładnie ale oświetlenie jest tragiczne, szczególnie rzuca to się w oczy w menu kiedy oświetlenie tła inne niż ognisko nie daje żadnego światła na postacie, poza tym dużo przedmiotów nie daje światła kiedy powinno, bohaterowie rzucają brzydki i nierealistyczny cień itp Tekstury obiektów są do zaakceptowania ale i tak jest im daleko do dobrych jak na ciągle wspieraną grę w 2021r, z rzeczy które mi się rzuciły w oczy to mordercy i ocalali mają po prostu okropne włosy, są brzydkie nierealistyczne, często są po prostu przyklejone do postaci i nie reagują na jej ruchy a nawet jeśli tak to robią to w zglitchowany i niedopracowany sposób, ale jak dla mnie grafika nie jest w takiej grze najważniejsza wiec można to wszystko wytrzymać\nWspomnę jeszcze tylko że podoba mi się projekt map i umiejscowienie na nich obiektów z którymi można mieć interakcję i myślę że są dobrze zbalansowane dla obu stron we większości przypadków, chyba że mowa o zamkniętych mapach w jakichś budynkach czy kompleksach bo te zdecydowanie nie dają ocalałym miejsca do ucieczki i chowania się i bardzo faworyzują zabójcę\nJeśli chodzi o stan techniczny to jest bardzo dużo do poprawienia od dużej ilości glitchy takich jak model postaci widoczny przez szafkę w piwnicy, setki zbudowanych animacji i innych rzecz które nie działają tak jak powinny poza tym są jeszcze po prostu okropne hitboxy dzięki którym w zamkniętych mapach ocalały nie ma szans uciec zabójcy, który jest w stanie np uderzyć survivora z ~3m szponami którymi nie sięga nawet na metr, czy to że postacie nie muszą rzeczywiście trafić bronią w ocalałego ale jeśli np taki morderca zamachnął by się od lewej do prawej to ocalały będący po jego lewej będzie miał taką samą szansę przetrwanie co ten po prawej, bo jak tylko zabójca zaczyna animacje to nie ma znaczenia kiedy ją skończy tylko po prostu trafi każdego kto stoi przed nim i w tym jeszcze pomaga mu to że może się obracać jak tylko chce podczas ataku więc trzeba mieć na prawdę duże szczęście żeby zrobić unik\nAle mimo tych wszystkich wad ja nadal miło spędziłem te 100 godzin więc to tyle z tej recenzji i mam nadzieje że pomoże komuś pomoże to zdecydować czy jest to gra dla niego","timestamp_created":1618694144,"timestamp_updated":1618694144,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49939236044883728","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90486005","author":{"steamid":"76561198355985926","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1651547119},"language":"english","review":"its dece","timestamp_created":1618694125,"timestamp_updated":1629763883,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90485897","author":{"steamid":"76561198834775803","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1653392494},"language":"english","review":"Да здравствует ЛЕГИОН","timestamp_created":1618693987,"timestamp_updated":1618693987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90485856","author":{"steamid":"76561198013573607","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1845,"last_played":1632180976},"language":"english","review":"Fix your fucking hitboxes. shitty devolopers.
