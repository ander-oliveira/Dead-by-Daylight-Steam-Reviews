Even the good killers get nerfed hard as hell for no good reason. The rank system is so broken that even if you win, and you win fast as killer, you still wont be able to pip (rank up). Every killer is counterable with a good 'survive with friends' group, and you have no power as the killer to stop a 4 friend queue from absolutely wrecking your shit. This game is very fun on the survivor side, but if you ever want to play Killer you might as well forget it, you are going to lose 90% of your games once you reach a comfortable rank, plus its damn near impossible to get every perk in the game without waiting and grinding for years or buying every killer in the game.

Aber klare Empfehlung ist der Shop ALLES SUPER BILLIG UND DIE GAME MACHER GEHEN AUF EUCH EIN KAPPA KIPPO. Kauft euch das Game nur im Sale....

Fun Fact es gibt ein video wo einer der Devs als Killer von den Survivorn in ner runde gebullied wird. Ist wohl das beste was dem Pleb jeh passiert ist. Aber zum Spiel selber kann ich nur sagen das ihr euch den müll nicht kaufen solltet wenn ihr ein Mensch mit skill seid. Desto tiefer ihr im rank kommt (also desto besser ihr werdet) desto mehr bestraft euch das game. Wie? fragt ihr euch? Ihr kriegt nur noch die letzten verblödeten und dümmsten teammates die noch mehr useless sind als Angela Merkel in den letzten 10 Jahren und die Killer campen oder tunneln euch nur noch, weil sie wissen das ihr der einzige seid der was rafft und der muss aus dem game genommen werden.

No, not really. It just makes it a really good game with big flaws BUT the flaws are only really apparent when playing at higher levels or getting bad teammates as a solo Survivor. Beyond those specific cases though? The game is great to play on your on as Killer or Survivor and as a bonus it's an incredible party game.\n\nWith it's great gameplay, plentiful updates and upcoming total visual revamp you and your friends will enjoy this game for hundreds, thousands of hours.

This game is VERY unwelcoming to new players who most likely will find the game hard as hell until they get the hang of it.\n\n*This point is one the few points that is still very true. This game's community will rival league of legends and dota 2 for most toxic community. But if you like me and play a decent amount of killer, just bath in their salt or close end game chat. You'll be doing yourself a favor.\nI'd also like to mention how gamers who even play the slightest amount of killer on xbox one are having their reps destroyed by salty gamers which punishes them in alot of online games. There's ways to up your rep to circumvent this but its still a testament to this game's toxic community.\n\n2. Killer for alot of people is a very frustrating experience, I've checked alot of the negative reviews for this game and nearly all of them complained about how people don't fear the killer and will often teabag and taunt the killer. So many players have the same overpowered perks of Saboteur 3, Self care 3, and Sprint Burst 3. WIth the 4th one being the only one that's differnent for alot of people. For example when you realize they disabled ALL of your hooks and just have to rely on downing people cause you can't reach the basement without them wiggling out is a prime example of some of the bs you will deal with as killer. Killers need a major buff to make survivors fear the killer again and counter the cheap perks of the survivors.\n\n*This point is half true. Self care 3 and sprint burst 3 are still very meta perks hundreds of hours later. Although saboteur 3 is no longer meta, and getting all your hooks disabled is no longer an issue as hardly anyone sabos anymore. That said killer can still be a very frustrating experience but its alot easier than it was back then. Even though the survivors now have even more crutch perks such as decisive strike, dead hard, and borrowed time. The killers (excluding nurse) are heavily underpowered compared to the survivors and their many crutch perks. Especially if you're playing against swf which massively shifts the balance in their favor. Not to mention in my opinion the introduction of pallet looping since this review has made winning as killer significantly harder. Like sure we had some infinite back in the day. But pallet has down right made enjoying killer alot harder as the devs refuse to do anything about it. Even though it would be an easy fix.\n\n\n3. The ranking system is total horse crap. Some of the more no-life players who reach rank 1 like its nothing will just tell you its easy and for you to get better. And that may not be too hard for someone who has the damn time to do so. But if you're like me and have a job and can only play this game a few times a week at most, you'll find reaching rank 1 a pipe dream. Hell even when I REALLY commited to getting my rank up I only got to rank 13 before they reset the rank season and I was back to rank 17. They honestly reset the seasons WAY too quick. Plus they don't tell you at all the length of the season such as September 1st - 15th or something like that. If they did that at least I'd know how much time I'd have left to reach those high ranks and get the achievements for them.\n\n*This point also rings half true. I actually managed to get up to survivor rank 3 before the rank reset. They should say resets happen in game instead of just on their website. Its still a little frustatrating. But the length is always a month with the reset happening every 13th of a month I believe. Its also alot harder to rank up as killer now since the victory cube which doesn't help the situation.\n\n4. This is sorta of an add-on to previous points but you have to have a level head if you play this game. There's 2 situations in this game that have made me rage to the point that my blood was practically boiling. First situation which I've had just a few today where the killer either spawns nears you or finds you instantly and practically insta downs you and then when you're on the hook he either camps you or no one even attempts to save you. The other big one is as a killer to have survivors teabag and taunt you at the same cheap spots over and over with the same overpowered perks, basically aquates to trying your hardest to win only for EVERYONE to get away. Either of these situations you will be very tempted to rage quit, which I have at times. Do NOT play this game if you have anger problems like I do.\n\n*I don't even remember why I made this point. I think its cause I was pissed and frustrated when I made this review. Is it still anger inducing sometimes? Sure what game isn't, but this issue relates more with killer I find than playing survivor\n\n5. This one is a small one, but this game isn't exactly Crysis levels of good looking graphics, yet it is one the most poorly optimized games ever. Do NOT buy if you have a crappy PC.\n\n*This point is still true, its very poorly optimized. I still play the pc verson despite running it on low graphics. Which is why I ended up buying it on xbox aswell for a smoother experience. If you suffer from a crap pc on this game I recommened buying the console version instead.\n\nNow onto pros:\n\n1. This game is amazing to play with friends, if you got 1 or 2 buddies its great to work together. You can have some truly memorable experiences when playing this with a bud. But good luck finding a game with 4 people. If you have more than 4 people then kill your friends is a great and at times hilarious mode to play to scare the absolute S**t outta your \"Friends\"\n\n*The load times since the original review have VASTLY improved. It used take 30-60 minutes to game into a game as swf but now it only takes 5 minutes thankfully. At the same time this is almost a con as the survive with friends mode provides too many advantages to survivors against killers that it upsets the balance of this game.\n\n2. Perk system is great, gives you something to work towards and you get really cool abilities that will overall make the game easier for you as you progress.\n\n*Still a great point. The perks are why this game is such a time sink as you'll level so many people or killers just to get that perfect build that let's you surive way more or absolutely destroy survivors.\n\n3. Gameplay is very fun, engaging, has alot of replayablity, no 2 matches are ever the same. Will definately get your adrenaline pumping at times.\n\n*The core gameplay loop has only improved over time with 10 different killers (soon to be 11) giving the game massive variety in matches. This along with all the different maps, perk loadouts, items, and add-ons. No 2 matches are alike.\n\nAs you can see Con list is nearly twice as big as the pro list. That said I got my money's worth when it comes to hours, I bought their dlc, and I'm still gonna play it. If you got a couple friends to play this with and can stomach the toxic community and what at times will be a very frustrating experience as killer or survivor, ESPECIALLY if you manage to reach rank 10 or higher. Then by all means buy it and you will love it just like I do as it's definately worth the $20 price tag for the 50-100+ hours of playtime you're probably gonna get outta this.\n\n*In this game I main survivor 60% verus killer 40%. Yet I still find myself siding with the killers in this game. I'm still playing 400 hours later. I'm still buying their dlc (although freddy was a big regret). But this game, unless they seriously buff killers, fix swf balance issues, and fix pallet looping. There will be no killers soon and this game WILL die.","timestamp_created":1477423753,"timestamp_updated":1516478768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26219855","author":{"steamid":"76561198339449341","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2258,"last_played":1637745258},"language":"schinese","review":"为什么我进入游戏就秒退！买来1个小时了就玩了一吧！","timestamp_created":1477423488,"timestamp_updated":1477423488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26219799","author":{"steamid":"76561198163154578","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1469244361},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun for the first several games then gets MASSIVELY boring very quickly.
