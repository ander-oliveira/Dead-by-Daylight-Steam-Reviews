This game is always changing, good or bad. One problem I find is that the balancing system at play is very fickel.  It will go either survivors side or killer side with waves on both sides protesting  about it being unfair for \"___\" for this or that reason with devs saying they gathered info to back up the changes. They wanted to create a game that would be a horror movie experience. The big problem here is that the killers in those horror movies either die or get put away somehow. Unlike the killers here, so in reality the \"killers\" are not so much killers;  rather puppets for the entity. \n         -Killers and survivors BOTH feel like they should win. In reality it should average, two kills and two escapes. That rarley ever happens.\n        - After a while that feeling of \"I'm going to die! RUN!!!\" just turns into \"how to loss or juke the killer. (Not a bad thing)\n-  Perks made things intresting but caused so many problems that overpowered both sides. ( If they had a mode with no perks or one perk for both sides, I think it would be an intresting change of pace.)\n-Lag will be an issue once in a while, people will say \"It's not my end, it's on you\" But reality is people try to get better games in different regions which will cause lag for the survivor. Some killers will take it easy on you, others will say \"Free points!\". \n\n               But facts are this game gets to be same ol same ol very quickly.  The devs made an intresting game for a while but it's lost all charm because perks overtook what was a good base.

All they do is handle cocky survivors that don't fear the killer at all and just want to troll him, bodyblock him, use exploits to get unfair advantages and run all the powerful perks like selfheal, sprint boost and sabotage (removing the hooks), while flaming every single killer perk or strategy that could cause the slightest danger to them, usually resulting in getting those features removed or nerfed. Killers are becoming more naked and naked, weaker and weaker, with lots of good mechanics removed, and when they complain about this, they get told they just \"lack the skill\" and should \"stop crying\".\n\nBut the toxic community isn't the only problem. The developers themselves laughed the killer's complains off and said they were probably just bad and that the \"statistics\" speak another language. The \"statistics\", BTW, only contain rank 1 killers and survivors, so if you want to casually play this game, get ready for the fact that your opinion won't count at all. The general opinion on the forums is \"if you have played for less than 200 hours, your opinion is worthless, unless you are a survivor main. Killers better shut up in general.\"\n\nThe game is called \"Dead by Daylight\", a \"horror experience\" where the survivors have to \"fight for their life\". Unfortunately, reality looks much different. Nobody fears the killers anymore. They are just toys. Some laugh about them, some, like me, pity them. The game is not what it used to be. It's just so heavily survivor-favored that playing killer has become an extremely frustrating experience, and playing the survivor is in no way terrifying or scary. It's just a game for points and ranks. And since the devs only shrug off complaints, this probably isn't gonna change anymore.\n\nTL;DR: If you happen to be new and want to play the killer, better don't buy this game unless you are ready to get trolled a lot. If you want a fair and balanced experience, better don't buy this game. If you want to be a teabagging, exploiting prick: welcome! But be sure you won't get much for your money, because people like you are ruining this game and soon there'll be no killers left at all.\n\n\ntruth.","timestamp_created":1476318512,"timestamp_updated":1476318512,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566320836544036865","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26005516","author":{"steamid":"76561198334641525","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":127487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3679,"playtime_at_review":4420,"last_played":1660593410},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏总体来说还是不错的.就是BUG很烦.就比如有时候屠夫可以卡到板子里去让玩家怎么办.还不是只能拔线.影响游戏体验、、","timestamp_created":1476315772,"timestamp_updated":1476315772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26005316","author":{"steamid":"76561198102106467","num_games_owned":513,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":885,"last_played":1614639161},"language":"brazilian","review":"Recomendo.","timestamp_created":1476314408,"timestamp_updated":1476314408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26005194","author":{"steamid":"76561198310395103","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":132506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104252,"last_played":1592854393},"language":"latam","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1476313583,"timestamp_updated":1574796424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26005117","author":{"steamid":"76561198044035909","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2304,"last_played":1524320752},"language":"english","review":"1.

There are some core problems that need to be taken care of, like the map generation working properly so it doesnt favor a side or a huge lack of options for survivors to deal with the killer, interact with each other or the world/level.\nThe options survivors have to hide or get away from the killer are broken down into \"jumping through windows\", \"Push pallet to block the way\", \"hide in closet\". The first of these suffers from a problem that if windows get used too often, they will be blocked so you cant jump them anymore. But beside that, they are scarcely placed in the level or often simply placed so bad that they become useless. Also they suffer from glitching from time to time (killers attack clips through the solid wall and still hits survivor on the other side). The second one, the pallets are a quite solid idea, if the killer wasnt able to simply destroy them. This gets completely rid of them and takes away options to get away from the killer.\nSince the killer is naturally faster than the survivors, outrunning isnt a possible strategy, so missing those pallets can mean that you simply cant win no matter how good you are.\nThe killer can destroy the pallets without any perk needed.\nThe last option is only viable when the killer didnt see you in the first place. So as a method of escaping when being chased, totally irrelevant. Also if the killer opens the closet with you being in there, he skips the whole chasing sequence where he had to hit you two times to bring you down. So getting caught in the closet is basically an instakill for you, which shows that it is quite favored for the killer.\nWhat more options do survivors have? They could sabotage the hooks and destroy them, leaving the killer with less options to pick from on where to hook survivors. But there are undestroyable hooks in a cellar with only one entrance, a paradise for camping killers and easy to generate kills there.\nDestroying the hooks is only a good strategy to stay longer alive on the map and get more time. It doesnt help the survivors when they are chased, or to hide, also its not achieving any goal.\nAdditonally the survivors can only sabotage when having a toolbox equiped or a perk selected that allows the sabotage skill. We could now set \"destroying the pallets\" and \"destroying the hooks\" on the same level of importance. Destroying either limits the options of the one who would use it. But lets face it, the killer can ever destroy them and redude the survivors options to escape, the survivor cant ever destroy hooks and destroying hooks doesnt prevent them from being killed anyway. So again, its an easy win for the killer.\n\nIn this game, player interaction is so minimal that it is non existant. The people you play with, could also be bots, it wouldnt change a thing. Theres no way to communicate or chat. No strategies or tactics can be made with teammates, no way to interact with each other in the world. Its only you and your choices. Do you follow another player and repair a generator together or not, do you heal a survivor or not? Do you help him/her when he/she got hooked or not? Whatever you do, you cant communicate. You cant share your decision and it has 0 impact on the relation of you and your teammates. There could be many ways to fix that problem, allow communication and therefor some new ways to create teamstrategies without making either side overpowered.\nThe game needs this badly, also it needs badly to have more mechanics and options for either side to deal with the other side. Survivors need more options to escape a chase and the killer needs more options to deal with survivors jumping through windows all the time.\n\nSince then, this game is too simple, far from complex and flawed in many regards. Its no teamgame, i wouldnt even really call it multiplayer as i see no benefit of it being multiplayer without any slight communication. If they would integrate bots that are slightly competent, you wouldnt feel a difference.","timestamp_created":1476298580,"timestamp_updated":1476311627,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434607118368148804","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26002184","author":{"steamid":"76561198318774495","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7687,"last_played":1641178163},"language":"english","review":"OK so I've had this game for awhile but was so obsessed with chasing down survivors I forgot to leave a review.
