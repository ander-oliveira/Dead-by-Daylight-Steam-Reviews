Killer feels mentally like what every survivor player should be feeling. Extremely stressful and tense as you hear every gen popping before you can down one person so you're forced to hang around your sacrifice because the survivors just did all their objectives before you could do one of your 18 objectives + generator patrols.\n\nOr to put it another way, you genuinely just feel like an old man with a stick waving off kids off your property than anything remotely resembling a killer, unless you of course plan to spend 3k hours in the game, then by all means sure. But even the best killers in all the game have extreme difficulty with Survive with friends that are on comms.\n\nWhich on that note, this game is balanced around having zero communication with your fellow survivors, making the game somewhat annoying as solo q but just an automatic win 89% of the time as a SWF group.\n\nBHVR tried to \"fix\" that by increasing the time it takes to do gens with 4 people, by 4~ seconds. Leaving the solo gen speeds untouched. They also tried to fix it by reducing map sizes, but map sizes are still too big for a lot of killers to even get across the map before an objective is already finished, and if it's not, the survivors are spread out doing multiple generators so if you do find one person, 3 gens pop before you down them. With downing said found person in under 15s.\n\nhonestly i could probably write an essay about the math on it and why it's objectively the worst balancing i've seen but i don't care enough\n\nIt might sound like I'm focusing on the killer aspect here, and I am. Talking about the survivor side of things is really short and simple. There's not much to see beyond that it's an automatic easy win majority of the time, and that's with me not even being good vs rank 2 killers. I've never once felt stressed about the killer or \"tense\" besides the other survivors making the game harder for me. That's about it really, The killer has to play around my mistakes. I don't need to play around theirs, proactive vs reactive. \n\nBut every time I've even thought about queueing up for killer? I think to my self \"Do I really feel like putting up with a lot of BS just to get called a retard anyway by game and players alike being unable to leave until the match is ended regardless of my feelings?\" Most of the time it's no.\n\nSurvivor? Worst thing I'm scared of is my team just not doing gens, if they aren't I just kill my self and go next almost instantly. In and out. No concern.\n\nWhich is probably why survivors whined about the actually hard killers in the game that if you were truly skilled at killer, were assured wins 100% of the time to where nurse got nerfed and spirit is probably getting nerfed. But they are so damn self-unaware to realize it's their own damn fault those killers HAVE to be played. Any other killer is so poorly balanced, so annoyingly weak if you go against any competent survivors, you're better off just sitting afk. You'd legitamently have more game impact than actually playing if you're just a casual killer vs survivors.\n\nToxicity: \nThis plays into the balance but I'll start at why I'm 100% sure this started.\nEven on the game's release survivors had life impossibly easy. Maps were absurdly large. Tool boxes basically never ran out. Instant heals. True infinites that a killer could quite literally, never under any circumstance catch you no matter how hard they tried. Ever.\n\nThis lead to some massive entitlement mentality with the game being skewed in their favour against killers who also just got the game. Which has persisted even to this very day.\n\nThe main thing you'll see is tbagging at exit gates, and pallets that survivors know that no matter what the killer does, they cannot under any circumstance do anything to them.  I know tbagging is in other games, but in an fps it's about who shot who better. In this, their \"skill\" is just handed to them rather than earned in an fps. \nUnless you're a killer that's actually a threat of course. But that won't last long because those killers are \"extremely op\".\n\nKiller Toxicity:\nCamping, Tunneling, Slugging. Common terms other survivors use to talk about a killer being toxic. Let's look at where it comes from though.\n\nKiller \"Toxicity\" in my experience, isn't even toxic. But stems from a complete lack of power rather than an excess of it like survivors show.\n\nCamping/Tunneling occurs because a killer feels like they have absolutely zero power or control in the game leading them to fervently guard the one person they managed to finally catch. And killers are going to be fervent about it because the game it self calls them a retard if they don't kill all 4 survivors. (Despite the game being balanced around no comms and killing 2 and 2 surviving but we won't talk about that) Proper game feedback is important, and calling a casual killer a retard for not being able to killer all 4 of us isn't particularly good design.\n\nSlugging isn't even toxic but I'll talk about it anyway. Some killers will run a build to just force everyone in the game to be dying, putting the game into a solid lock. Which is boring but I sympathize having played killer my self. They literally just want to, for once, feel like they are a threat and have game impact rather than a joke that's better off sitting afk than playing.\n\nAddons are also considered \"toxic\" if you use the ones that instantly down survivors. A bit boring personally for me, but hardly toxic. I mean really, God forbid I be afraid of the killer for once and they actually get to be a threat instead of a joke. \nA lot of addons also feel like you're forced to run them or the killers power is so absurdly weak it's not even funny the time you'll waste other wise. \n\nMost of the killer addons in yellow feel like how the killer's power should be by default rather than something I get to do occasionally if \"I'm a good boy\" \n\nYeah there's some toxic killers for sure, but they are such an absurdly low percentile it's not even worth bothering to talk about since they worst they can do is hit someone on a hook, which is significantly more time wasting for the killer than tbagging would be for the survivor due to how slowdown works.\n\nNot that I blame them. Remember how I said the game calls you stupid if you don't kill all 4 survivors? Well if you kill all four survivors too quickly, then the game still calls you stupid. God forbid you actually managed to take advantage of survivors and kill them fast rather than wasting time. \n\nI genuinely do not know of any other game that punishes the 1 for being so vastly superior to the 4, while happily rewarding the 4 for being vastly superior to the 1. It'll pit you against survivors with 3k hours when you're new and reward them for doing well,  while still calling you an idiot for not being able to win.

lo recomiendo. Es un juego muy divertido, si, pero hasta cierto punto. Luego de jugar durante mucho tiempo, te cruzas con el único problema que trae el juego, mas allá de los terribles bugs; La comunidad, el tipo de players tóxicos (Tanto por campeo del Killer como el toxiqueo de los survival hacia el Killer). Es como dije un juego divertido. Pero cuando empiezas a tener partida tras partida, este tipo de compartimientos dentro del mismo.. se vuelve frustrante, y encima que no haya sanción para ambos tanto para killer como survival al momento de desconectarse cuando el killer los tira en menos de un min, se vuelve nefasto. Una penalización de 5min no es sanción. En fin, gran juego, pero comunidad muy nefasta, dejan mucho que desear.","timestamp_created":1591546752,"timestamp_updated":1591546752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70447850","author":{"steamid":"76561198093968260","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1647467990},"language":"russian","review":"Рот ебал,люблю маньячить 8/10","timestamp_created":1591546647,"timestamp_updated":1591546647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70447637","author":{"steamid":"76561198980752855","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3674,"last_played":1597387723},"language":"russian","review":"ОЧЕНЬ ПРИКОЛЬНАЯ ИГРА РАЗРАБАВ ХВАЛЮ БЫВАЮТ БАГИ НУ И ЛАДНО","timestamp_created":1591546337,"timestamp_updated":1591546337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70447514","author":{"steamid":"76561198161643059","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":13174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1128,"last_played":1649099948},"language":"schinese","review":"吓死我了","timestamp_created":1591546174,"timestamp_updated":1591546174,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70447470","author":{"steamid":"76561198006278386","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":114537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":171,"playtime_at_review":27775,"last_played":1660514528},"language":"czech","review":"Commander Sheppard: This is my favourite game on Steam.","timestamp_created":1591546128,"timestamp_updated":1591546128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70447208","author":{"steamid":"76561198071965555","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1657328684},"language":"english","review":"It is a very fun and strategic game.
