Mimo wszystko zacznijmy od pozytywów: Potrafi wciągnąć jak mało co, duży wybór postaci oraz umiejętności, sporo zróżnicowanych map i (prawie) idealna do gry ze znajomymi. A teraz przejdźmy do minusów:\n- Balans leży i kwiczy, większość postaci potrzebuje nerfa albo buffa\n- Hitboxy są za duże\n- W rzeczywistości da się grać tylko samemu lub z pełną drużyną znajomych, we 2 osoby od czasu do czasu nie dołącza do meczu i daje errory, w 3 osoby nie da się grać: nie dołącza do sesji prawie w ogóle, a jak dołączy to zawsze kogoś wyrzuca w trakcie rozgrywki\n- Mimo, że nie mogę za to winić devów to muszę o tym wspomnieć: coraz częściej ludzie wychodzą z meczów lub zabójca/ocalali afczą przez cały mecz\n- Im wyższa ranga tym więcej cheaterów\n- Po tylu latach nadal nikt nie wpadł na pomysł, żeby dodać rozgrywki nierankingowe\nPodsumowanie:\nTo co się dzieje dosłownie boli, bo nie całe 3 lata temu ta gra była genialna, mocna 9/10, ale mimo sporej ilości nowości jakie dostajemy, pojawiają się również spore błędy, które nie są naprawiane i jak to już wspomniałem gra wciąga, więc zaczynam trochę czuć się jak masochista.

And I think they've succeeded.\n\nWatching Youtube videos, it was clear that a lot of the bugs had been fixed, so I decided to download this again and give it another shot. The bug situation is well within acceptable range now. It's still a toss-up who you get matched with: depending on your perks and their perks, each match could be a walk in the park or a frustrating slog. More impressive, however, are the stuff the devs have done to fix jerkwad behaviour, including:\n\n- Hiding player levels until the end of the match. No more exiting matchmaking! This does wonders for new players.\n- Some anti-cheat measures, such as disconnecting players who are connected to Discord. It's not a perfect system, mind you, but it's a bit harder.\n- Flagging players who are doing crap.\n- Players who disconnect mid-game get docked a \"pip\" (kind of like experience points for ranking).\n\nAll in all, I am very impressed by the devs continued efforts to improve this game. I still think it was released too early (perhaps to claim a userbase before Friday the 13th), but it's also clear that the game is not merely a quick cash grab. I would now recommend this game, though be prepared to lose a lot early on.\n\nORIGINAL\n\nEven though I've played this game 30 hours, I don't like it. The idea is very neat, but the execution is terrible. Today I finally decided to cut my losses and uninstall.  Here are the reasons why:\n\n- Bugs. They are still there. Granted, there are fewer. Nonetheless, when you're in a ranked match and your game freezes up on you,  you really feel cheated. Plus, the lobby is pretty much always broken. You have to press \"join game\" a whole bunch of times.\n- Matchmaking. There appears to be very little in the way of balance. Top tier players with top tier perks are pitted against the bottom tier. Perks are a huge difference. Be prepared to lose a lot before you get enough perks to compare. Or...\n- Play like a jerk. This isn't just being \"selfish\" as the game intends. There are a number of ways to game this game in order to get lots of points, usually at the expense of others. For example, as a survivor you can disconnect at any time without penalty. As a killer you can refresh lobbies until you get bottom tier players, much to the chagrin of the other players. Plus, there are far too many ways for people to waste your time. A killer might wait as you bleed out on the floor, or a survivor might wait by the exit until you watch them win.\n\nIn short, don't play this game. Wait for Friday the 13th.","timestamp_created":1470798866,"timestamp_updated":1483199773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50643002986907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24803808","author":{"steamid":"76561198169283501","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6148,"last_played":1654529735},"language":"spanish","review":"por que cada que ponen parche  me pide el doble de espacio en disco solo por que si\n cuando el parche pesa menos de 1 gb me pide tener libre 8 gb y tengo que desisntalarlo y volverlo a instar que mal juego","timestamp_created":1470798066,"timestamp_updated":1470798066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24803787","author":{"steamid":"76561198010117354","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":77227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":166,"playtime_at_review":57311,"last_played":1659550730},"language":"english","review":"Very cool I like","timestamp_created":1470797890,"timestamp_updated":1577230516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24803779","author":{"steamid":"76561198149272638","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1598935440},"language":"english","review":"I really wanted this game, but it is being extremely slow.

by Daylight es un juego que no me esperaba que fuera así para nada, en el lado positivo.\n\nPor fuera, en vídeos y demás lo ves como \"no esta mal, pero no será tan complicado\", pero cuando entras y juegas tu mismo al juego, te mete en una tensión sin quererlo ni beberlo que al menos para mi, es adictiva, nunca había tenido tanta tensión en un juego, ni en los de terror típicos, que ya una vez te los conoces, no hay tensión ninguna, pero aquí como cada asesino es un mundo, no sabes con lo que te puedes topar.\n\nEn ese sentido, es un buen juego en mi opinión pero como todos los juegos, tiene sus contras:\n\n-El smartmatching es bastante pésimo, a que me refiero, a que tarda mucho (o poco si tienes suerte) en encontrar partida, y encima se va cancelando por lo que tienes que volver a darle a buscar, en vez de darle una vez, y que siga buscando hasta que encuentre una partida, sinceramente espero que arreglen eso pronto.\n\n-Bugs en el mapa, en algunas zonas, el personaje no se puede ni mover, por que se queda atrancado con el suelo y con alguna roca y no se puede levantar para correr, y en un momento en el que te a visto el asesino y te pasa eso sabes que estas muerto.\n\n-Laggs, se que esto no tiene que ver nada con el juego sino con los asesinos, pero debería de haber alguna manera de regular eso, por que como te toque un asesino que vive en la otra punta del mapa y es él el que hostea la partida, ya te puedes preparar para ir saltando de lado a lado, por que te teleportas por el mapa y es imposible jugar, asi que espero que ideen alguna manera de lidiar con ese problema, aunque sea por zonas o no se, pero a veces es imposible jugar.\n\nY por el resto a excepción de estos ultimos 3 puntos por lo restante me parece un juego muy recomendable, espero que introduzcan más supervivientes y más asesinos, y corrijan los fallos, existentes, espero que sirva esto de ayuda y guía a los que vayan a comprarlo y espero que lo disfruten como lo disfruto yo, pasadlo bien

(not much but it's my free time). I've loved learning new ways to play this game and get better. Even with some of the updates I still couldn't get enough. Bravo. Now to why I made up my mind to write a review. The tweeks that have been updating to my game some good and other not so much. I have noticed alot of fixes to help out the killer. While all is fine I find it quite irritating to be able to level up my killer quicker and easier than my surviver.

The game is very killer heavy and licensed killers get more love and attention than their base killers because of how they are loving the DLC throat stuffing rather than making a more mechanically involved game. To me the game is very monotonous and may have something to do with how it has a good reception as it is fairly accessible and can be understood by a larger demographic within a circle of friends. \n\nWhy is this a problem you ask? Well, if you add in 20+ licensed characters into a game that is as mechanically in depth as a children's sandbox, you run into a mechanical ceiling very quickly that doesn't offer much breathing room for different killers or even survivors to flourish with a unique sense of placement. You're essentially playing a very similar mechanic and paying for the likeness of a killer to feel nostalgic and increase cognitive ease.  So when this happens, the game is essentially a Hook, off of hook, juke, run, and camp fest that can trick people into thinking the game is toxic or makes the game feel more tedious than it needs to be compared to say, \"Friday the 13th\" game. Which has it's own seperate problems from Dead by Daylight but objectively has a more reasonable reason to exist. \n\nIn conclusion, this game has essentially watered itself down into a \"parachute game\" where the most fun you might get is playing with close friends.","timestamp_created":1470762474,"timestamp_updated":1594610246,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24796483","author":{"steamid":"76561198068421434","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":33511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2248,"last_played":1567441887},"language":"english","review":"\npros\n- excitement\n- team work make you win\n- window cheese to killer\n- sabotage all hook  all trap :)\ncon\n- failed to join the game simulator\n- Unbalanced perks this game have many perks but it like 4-5 perks is useful\n- teachable perks is cancer it make game joke like the 4 characters have unique perks but the all of them can have it same if devs remove teachable perks it will make more tactics  in game \n- map suck\n- poor matchmaking \n- lag sometime because this game use p2p\n- many bugs in game\n- unbalance between suvivor and killer\n- always crash  for me it  crash around 10-20 time(30 hours played)\n\nim play this game with my friends so im not recommend until devs can fix the bugs and crash or some mechanics","timestamp_created":1470761423,"timestamp_updated":1470761423,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24796417","author":{"steamid":"76561198317166038","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7655,"last_played":1478616497},"language":"schinese","review":"为什么我在黎明杀机里会出现无法找到对应信息啊？","timestamp_created":1470761122,"timestamp_updated":1470761122,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24796102","author":{"steamid":"76561198106303422","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3117,"last_played":1473551808},"language":"brazilian","review":"Very good","timestamp_created":1470759819,"timestamp_updated":1470759819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24796073","author":{"steamid":"76561197991173367","num_games_owned":649,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":42179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4051,"last_played":1653949267},"language":"english","review":"dwight","timestamp_created":1470759715,"timestamp_updated":1586754974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24796056","author":{"steamid":"76561198015166634","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1604776371},"language":"english","review":"It's has to be called \"The Ready-Simulator\"\nNever ever have I pressed \"ready\" more often than in this game.\n\nIf you play alone - its fine.
