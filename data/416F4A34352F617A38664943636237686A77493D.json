Survivors try to repair generators to power doors to escape the killer. Way better with friends. \n\n[h1][b]Basically...[/b][/h1] \n\nYou can either play as survivors or a killer. As a survivor, you work with 3 other people to repair generators. You need to power \n\nThere is no chat system while you are playing so it is best if you get into a party of 4 as survivors so that you can actually communicate and coordinate \nwith each other. \n\nQueuing as a killer is significantly longer than as a survivor. This may be caused by the low rank, but it seems to me that its much harder to find a game when you try to play as the killer. \n\n[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1] \nGraphics look pretty good, but by default, the game locks your fps at 60. You can unlock it by updating some of the game files. \n\nI recommend running the game on the lowest settings because its much easier to see. \n\n[h1][b]Controls:[/b][/h1] \nWASD to move, you press space to interact with objects in the game like the generators or pallets. Using Mouse 2 allows you to use other tools. \n\nNothing weird with controls. They are simple and work great for the game. No control changing needed.\n\n[h1][b]DLC:[/b][/h1] \nI will review the DLC I know as I play more of it.\n\nCursed Legacy: \n\nHalloween:\n\n[h1][b]Overall...[/b][/h1] \nIf you are looking for a horror game, this may not be the game for you. From time to time, there are jump scares, but overall, it's not scary.\n\nIt's a great game if you play with friends because working together makes the game way easier and way more enjoyable. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n- Really great game with friends\n- You get dropped right in \n- A lot of characters \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- None right now","timestamp_created":1592948701,"timestamp_updated":1593721462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71244035","author":{"steamid":"76561198294920051","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1622655148},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom jogo","timestamp_created":1592948651,"timestamp_updated":1592948651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71244016","author":{"steamid":"76561199052213440","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1640412351},"language":"english","review":"its fun asf no cap","timestamp_created":1592948628,"timestamp_updated":1592948628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71243862","author":{"steamid":"76561198980766119","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":88675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43266,"last_played":1659150881},"language":"english","review":"The game is pretty good and fun as a team and there're many updates/dlc/events which make it interesting.

Undeniable that it's a one of a kind game that includes all of our favorite killers besides Jason. And it's that concept alone that's keeping a lot of players from booting the game still. I had a positive first impression during the 4th anniversary and I don't regret what I complimented before. I still think it's very strategic. Teamwork and sound is heavily needed. Lots of horror fan-service. It's incredible that we finally have a game that brings Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Left 4 Dead all together. It's the first free weekend game that convinced me to actually purchase afterwards. It's getting close to 3 years later and I gotta say. It's bad. This ain't a filtered /v/ take. Problems just keep stockpiling. \n\nConnection\n2021 onwards, hit detection seemed to have improved. MMR matchmaking is pointless. It only encouraged everyone to out-sweat the opponent. Everyone that's a pro, or even a popular streamer doesn't take it super seriously and lower their MMR from dying, focusing on entertaining tricks while sacrificing themselves getting other people to escape safely. Thus making pro players contributing the most interaction and activity to stick with bad players. All because of what the devs deem a \"win\"\n\nGraphics\nAt best it honestly looks like a Wii U game. I had to use ReShade to make it sharper and the grass looks nearest neighbor. The survivors look more ugly than the killers.\n\nAnimations\nThe current idle animations for the survivors are gross. \nMori animations for old killer are horrible. They look like gmod. Hope they remaster them. I do have to say, 2021 onwards have been pretty solid. Kudos to whoever worked on Trickster, Sadako and Pinhead's animations.\nEDIT June 2022: Seems like Trapper is going to be the first of many to have a Mori overhaul. Good stuff animators, keep up the good work!\n\nConfiguration\nEDIT June 2022: Okay I had a long rant about ultrawide problems and stretch res cheating but they actually listened and fixed it. Still tho, I heavily dislike that in order to experience certain settings such as 120FPS or specific aspect ratios/resolutions. You NEED to go into the files, edit the values in Notepad and force it to Read-Only. NO GAME should make you do that under any circumstances. REPLACE the resolution percentage gauge. No good video game does that. \n\nSound Design\nThe general noises in dbd are atrocious. Audio Occlusion is a joke. It's crucial too, with how the game is designed. Especially for killers who can't hear the generators 5 steps away from them, all because a wall was blocking it. I don't know why either. It's not hard for Unreal Engine 4. For a game that's meant to be \"scary\". It audibly fails at tone and atmosphere. Stock SFX that sound waaaaay too cartoony. Getting hooked and Freddy's clock sounds like a Nickelodeon slime gak. PInhead's voice lines being way too bassy. Some Killer's special abilities do sound nice. Ghostface's stalk, Twins switching, Trickster's bat, Blight's syringe, and even all of Sadako's SFX are satisfying.\n\nKiller Gripes\nFreddy is very boring. In a way, I gotta give props to the devs. They made it a real immersive experience to fall asleep in real life when you enter the dream world and deal with a \"Forever Freddy\" build. Glad he got nerfed.\nLegion is boring. Horribly misses the concept's point and they will never give him a major rework to fix that. Most likely would make a new OC that does what he was meant to do.\nTrickster is annoying. I wish he was either reverted to what he was at launch or balanced better. \nEDIT June 2022: THANK YOU whoever changed Pig to essentially doing almost beat for beat exactly what I wanted. My prayers have been answered. You deserve a promotion. I also had problems with Deathslinger, Spirit and Wraith but as of this review, they got a fair nerf and I'm happy with the changes.\n\nCommunity Gripes\n[spoiler]Why is almost everyone a tumblr white girl that binges True Crimes? No joke, they are more horny than the dudes here. Demanding shirtless Myers, or reverting Pyramid Head. Is that why over half the girls are ugly in this game? So they can self-insert?[/spoiler]\nOkay on a serious note, you can't block console players. That's a flawed system. Everyone has a unique player ID, and the game is smart enough to display a globe for crossplayers outside Steam. Yet you cannot block people outside Steam? They don't even inform that ingame. The block button is there and you can click it. But in reality, it does NOTHING. If you're incompetent to implement the feature. At least grey it out.  \n\nPaid Content\nIt's a $20 game that's FILLED with micro-transactions, DLC and pay to win perks if you don't want the slowest online grind to collect iridescent shards to earn them for free. They must be raking in tons of money for a game that released looking like an indie game. The game offers you less than a third of the total roster now. That's insane! Double down and at least make Feng Min and Ace's DLC free. You already did that on console anyways. \n\nSo why am I still here? Simple. It's a social game to me. I only play it with friends. Try to have the most fun out of it. The Bill Rift was the only Rift I cared to Tier 70. But it's glaring with issues. Without these problems, it could honestly be a masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1592945060,"timestamp_updated":1654999449,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558823525905609131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71241719","author":{"steamid":"76561198813093067","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6633,"last_played":1655226883},"language":"english","review":"Great game at the beginning u will have some trouble to understand how to play etc... but later on it's so fun, and its more fun if u play with friends","timestamp_created":1592944796,"timestamp_updated":1592944796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71241500","author":{"steamid":"76561198922349840","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1657094457},"language":"english","review":"It's a very nice game, even if it is a little bit old(from 2016).
