If you are new player and only play solo survivor, not touch this game.\n\nDevs didn't give the difference between solo survivor and swf (survivor with friends). Solo survivor (hard mode) and swf (easy mode) are totally different game. When survivor with firends, they dont need perk to get killer's information and teammates' information and they can get more details by communications.\n\nFor solo survivor, most of killer players play like against swf that they just camping and tunneling and no teammate even can help you. What you can get in that game depends on killer. So just hope you can get a good killer.\n\nFor killer, you cant tell which is or solo survivors. I play lots of solo survivor games, so I will try to play nicely as killer, but these swfs will totally reckt me. But most of time I get lots of solo players, which is fun to play against.\n\nOver all, playing as killer is more easier than playing as solo survivor.

wollte jetzt nach einigen Stunden Spielzeit meine Review dazu verfassen. Zuerst einmal ist das Spielerlebniss ein sehr gruseliges das mit vielen Faktoren verknüpft ist. Ich selber war am Anfang sehr geflasht von diesem Game der Grund dafür ist folgender: Die Umsetzung von Killer Vs. Überlebende ist eine sehr simple Aufgabe aber schwierig umzusetzen aus der Sicht des Killers wie auch des Überlebenden. Der Überlebende hat Aufgaben die nicht unbedingt leicht zu gestalten sind unteranderm auch auch weil die Aufgaben darin bestehen Motoren mit dazugehörigen Fähigkeitschecks zu meistern sind die am Anfang sehr schwierig erscheinen. Rund um ein simple aufgebautes Spiel das sich aber als etwas schwieriger heraustellt. \n\nEine Erweiterung würde mir gefallen undzwar ein Modus in dem es zwei Killer gibt und doppelt soviele Überlebende als mit einem Killer. Mit doppelt so großen Maps und doppelt so viele Generatoren. Das würde nochmal einen schönen Spielerlebnisskick geben der mir persönlich und Freunden von mir sehr gefallen würde. Ich hoffe das sowas in der Art bald in Angriff genommen wird. \n\nIm Großen und Ganzen ist das Spiel sehr empfehlenswert.","timestamp_created":1527467974,"timestamp_updated":1544388396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42325518","author":{"steamid":"76561198091925368","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1646674155},"language":"english","review":"cum","timestamp_created":1527466913,"timestamp_updated":1647363592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42325410","author":{"steamid":"76561198143792375","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":10247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7170,"last_played":1658446790},"language":"english","review":"Its just amazing would definetly recommend it if you like horror+multiplayer love it <3","timestamp_created":1527466497,"timestamp_updated":1527466497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551506578922271729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42325395","author":{"steamid":"76561198408158636","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":159776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":698,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1660114091},"language":"english","review":"Update 3/18/21\n\nTakes over 10m - 15m to get into a match, where there is a 95% chance you will get tunneled/camped by players in both high and low ranks in order for them to belittle you in chat about how \"bad\" you played and brag about their ranking - I say both high and low ranks bc ranking is a non factor in this game, its just there for looks - just look at the dull colors and feel proud of your achievement to nothing.\n\nMany homophobic & racist remarks in post/endgame chat on both sides with no consequences - Devs do little to nothing to resolve this. I have an entire folder dedicated to how many times I have been called the LGBTQ+ F slur, last updated 1 day ago.\n\nWhen playing as survivor, be aware that your teammates are much worse than the killer. \n\nThere are many streamers saying the DBD Community is not the most toxic community out there bc there are other games that have worse communities. This statement literally is brushing off all of the issues plaguing the game. \n\nThis game may not have THE most toxic community, but it is up there with the rest of the ones those streamers like to point out.\n\nDon't let the streamer hype fool you, this game has not gotten better, the devs do not care about anyone's input, so any issues people are complaining about - believe them, because its been the same for almost 5yrs with no foreseeable change.\n\nUpdate 11/13/20\n\nDue to current state of the game, I do not recommend this game for new players. \n\nThere are tons of glitches and issues that the developers are refusing to fix at this point - Hitboxes & Matchmaking being the most important - now you know why it goes on sale a lot \n\nWhen asked via their support, you will always get the same generic response: \"Our team is working hard to get these issues worked out\"....Their team has been \"working hard\" for 4yrs with no change, the \"team\" has fallen asleep at the wheel.\n\nMaybe my feelings will change if these issues are fixed, but it's been 4yrs - I won't hold my breath waiting for assistance, they have more important things to deal with, like finding another killer/survivor/cosmetics to add in game to cover up their lack of attention to the things that need fixing. \n\nAnother generic response you will get when asking \"why there are no fixes but more and more cosmetics/DLCs being released\": \"Different Department\" - when you ask what department deals with the issues, no one responds or you get the same answer I stated above - aka a company that does not communicate with each other or does not care.\n\nLet me be clear about something, I love this game, to the point that I probably play it more than I should - but just because you love something does not mean it is free of criticism. It's why I chose to edit this review. The game is in the worst state it has been in a long time.\n\nYou would hope a company that claims to love its community so much would treat them better by listening/fixing the issues plaguing the game rather than worry about cosmetics and adding more things that they are just going to have to fix later on. Sadly, they have proven they do not care about the issues, its all about $. \n\nI hope I can edit this review again with more positive news later on, but for now, it is what it is.","timestamp_created":1527466455,"timestamp_updated":1616112517,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42325353","author":{"steamid":"76561198444783219","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1573396402},"language":"russian","review":"кайф","timestamp_created":1527466213,"timestamp_updated":1527466213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42325292","author":{"steamid":"76561198120349278","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":38756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1810,"last_played":1646255316},"language":"english","review":"\nThe game itself is pretty good, but the problem that should be solved, in addition to the animations that are bugged from time to time, is the multiplayer system.

I give the game a 6/10 because it has many things to solve being that they have been with the game for 2 years. I hope the developers someday listen to the community or finally listen to my message to have a better game.","timestamp_created":1527465920,"timestamp_updated":1527465920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42325198","author":{"steamid":"76561198089371433","num_games_owned":736,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":158854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1240,"playtime_at_review":12622,"last_played":1660602242},"language":"english","review":"Avoid like the f*****g plague.

Conclusion: Fun game in itself with many cool survivor/killer models and licenses, would have really good potential to be a good cool game, would there not be this incredibly large toxic part of the community plus there would be a possibility to have a proper reporting system, where also somehow times a feedback would come.","timestamp_created":1527437711,"timestamp_updated":1645462163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42314762","author":{"steamid":"76561198060649096","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2660,"last_played":1565646613},"language":"english","review":"Cheaters with speedhack and mb maphack, balance=0.

Распределения похоже между нубами, про, и более менее понимающий игру нет. и это не только проблема у выживших ну и у маньяков. иногда играя за маньяка можно встретить выживших с топовыми навыками или играя командой то есть общаясь по дискорду или по скайпу и игра за маньяка бывает очень тяжёлой особенно если ты нуб и у тебя плохие навыки.\n3 минус это читеры. Недавно мне как раз встретился такой.  Поставил я подношение которые телепортируют как можно дальше от маньяка, захожу,вижу генератор начинаю чинить слышу звук пилы думал что маньяк попался деревеньщина, через 2 секунды слышу биение сердца, он сразу находит меня и примерно за 2-3 секунды заводит пилу и режет меня потом вещает на крюк. и у меня вопрос. КАК ОН ПОНЯЛ ЧТО ЗАВОДЯТ САМЫЙ ДАЛЬНИЙ ГЕНЕРАТОР????? это ещё не всё. меня спасают с крюка снова где то слышу пилу думал он нашёл выжившего, и да он нашёл выжившего. МЕНЯ. я ведь спрятался но он снова каким то чудом меня нашёл. на этот раз он решил меня не вещать а распелить насмерть. и снова вопрос. КАК ОН ЗА 3 МИНУТЫ МАЧТА СМОГ УБИТЬ УЖЕ 1 ВЫЖИВШЕГО????? НАВЕРНОЕ ДАЖЕ ТОП МАНЬЯКИ НЕ СМОГУТ СДЕЛАТЬ ТАК КАК ОН!!!!!!!\nесли разработчики ничего не предпримут с этим в ближайшее время то игру лучше просто смыть в унитаз. но если всё таки не обращать внимание на это то игра правда хорошая. надеюсь что они это исправят вскоре и эти минусы учтут и уберут.покупать игру или нет решайте сами мне она понравилось но минусы игры всё портят\n","timestamp_created":1527437381,"timestamp_updated":1527437381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42314590","author":{"steamid":"76561198259883586","num_games_owned":504,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":489,"last_played":1606634977},"language":"koreana","review":"처음에는 단순한 게임 플레이로 다소 지겨웠다.\n그러나 나의 오래전부터 꺼져있던 게임에 대한 열정을 다시 밝혀주었다.\n단순히 게임을 체험해보려고 했지만, 정신 차리면 이미 게임을 구입하고 있었다.","timestamp_created":1527437217,"timestamp_updated":1527437217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42314436","author":{"steamid":"76561198035356981","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2376,"last_played":1558719620},"language":"spanish","review":"el juego mola","timestamp_created":1527436810,"timestamp_updated":1527436810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42314383","author":{"steamid":"76561198044473249","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":5668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3369,"last_played":1597319888},"language":"italian","review":"BAO","timestamp_created":1527436680,"timestamp_updated":1527436680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42314339","author":{"steamid":"76561198797554747","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1290,"last_played":1657459893},"language":"english","review":"游戏不错","timestamp_created":1527436566,"timestamp_updated":1527436566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42313860","author":{"steamid":"76561198153965100","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8199,"last_played":1656171363},"language":"koreana","review":"처음에는 무서울지도 모르지만 엔티티가 원하던 생존자의 모습이 점점 가까워 지고있습니다.\n그게 뭐냐하면....직접 살인마를 플레이 해보시길 바람니다!\n","timestamp_created":1527435460,"timestamp_updated":1527435460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42313801","author":{"steamid":"76561198262739102","num_games_owned":1055,"num_reviews":221,"playtime_forever":48829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1652472830},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun tek kelimeyle mükemmel \nArkadaşınız yoksa almayın vs. şeylere kulak asmayin alın aldırın \nTabi girebileceginiz arkadaşlarınız varsa oyun 2 katı zevk veriyor\nÖzetlemek gerekirse yusuf yusuf, korku, gerilim, içe doğru s*çış, zevk, gibi duyguları tadacağınız bir oyun.","timestamp_created":1527435332,"timestamp_updated":1527435332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42313686","author":{"steamid":"76561198445631057","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1649089586},"language":"russian","review":"Играть можно","timestamp_created":1527435073,"timestamp_updated":1527435073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488454699516296387","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42313639","author":{"steamid":"76561198131687838","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1653600562},"language":"brazilian","review":"é dificil e desafiador , porém muito divertido.
