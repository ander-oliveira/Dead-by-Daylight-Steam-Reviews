L'ambiance du jeu est vraiment géniale et le jeu est vraiment fun et addictif (enfin, surtout au début).\n\nMalgré de très nombreux très bons points, DBD possède quelques gros défauts.\n\nLe points positifs pour commencer :\n- Super ambiance dans le style film d'horreur/slasher,\n- Jeu assez addictif et vraiment fun au début,\n- Excellent jeu si vous jouez avec des amis,\n- Bon jeu en solo même si plus difficile,\n- De très bonnes licences in game (resident evil, silent hill, scream, etc.),\n- Jeu assez original et qui est assez dynamique,\n- Pas mal de mises à jour avec modification/ajout de contenu, hype à chaque nouvelle sorti de DLC.\n\nConcernant les points négatifs :\n- Jeu vraiment très mal équilibré. Plus vous avancez dans le jeu et plus vous vous rendez compte qu'il existe une méta bien installée. A noter qu'il est néanmoins possible de tenter des builds originaux mais qui rendront vos partis vraiment dur.\n- Un jeu qui devient très toxique à un certain niveau pour plusieurs raisons : équilibrage pourri qui oblige les tueurs à jouer toxique (camp et tunnel) pour réussir leurs games. Le grand nombre de cheaters.\n- Les cheaters... Vraiment beaucoup de cheaters à un certain niveau. Des cheaters subtiles comme des pas subtiles du tout.\n- Des graphismes plutôt moyens même si ça tend à s'améliorer avec temps. Pour ma part, obligé de sortir des filtres pour trouver le jeu plus beau,\n- Des maps belles mais qui ne sont pas du tout équilibrés (trop en faveur des survivants qui ont trop d'options de survie),\n-Enfin, un jeu qui est pris dans une sorte d'ambivalence entre, rester un jeu pour le fun et donc osef de l'équilibrage et un jeu qui asseye de devenir compétitif avec des tournois, mais du coup avec un équilibrage qui est peu permissif.\n\nCe sont les points vraiment centraux que je retrouve après avoir passé pas mal de temps IG. Il y en existe bien d'autres, mais que je n'ai pas relaté ici.","timestamp_created":1649025281,"timestamp_updated":1649025281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544994950294494629","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113304559","author":{"steamid":"76561197963833433","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6560,"last_played":1658985871},"language":"english","review":"Game can be really fun but until you reach a problem where you're game freezes and kicks you out of the match and you get a game ban for that and it might be 2 mins or even 12 mins but it keeps going up and this freeze problem is not just one thing that happens it happens all the time so then your bans will go from 12 mins to 24 hours 48 hours or even 72 hours and the game becomes unplayable at that point cause once you wait all that time just to play it your game crashes and you have another 72 hour ban and it says it's your internet but my internet was working fine and many others are  coming across this problem to.

However, I think killers could do with more of a leg up because survivors have a suite of second chance perks to the killers' one. \n I want to invest a lot more time into this game, but the current killer environment means you will have games where survivors will be un-catchable for non skill-based reasons. This creates a lot of burnout on the killer side.\nBut, this is a semi-positive review. I do enjoy the game, I think it's a great concept, and I hope the game thrives for years to come. It's incredibly rewarding to have 4 hook games. It's okay if all four survivors escape on occasion, because there's always next game. What creates the burnout is the narrow margins of error for killers.","timestamp_created":1649022868,"timestamp_updated":1650424932,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113303059","author":{"steamid":"76561198254494684","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":159,"playtime_at_review":2169,"last_played":1659650997},"language":"english","review":"bad","timestamp_created":1649022537,"timestamp_updated":1649022537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113302676","author":{"steamid":"76561198872960778","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":125,"playtime_at_review":12843,"last_played":1660535480},"language":"spanish","review":"gran juego xd\n","timestamp_created":1649021937,"timestamp_updated":1649021937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113302149","author":{"steamid":"76561199249726619","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":271,"playtime_at_review":2676,"last_played":1659798089},"language":"english","review":"This a Great game i have played it before when stranger things came out and it has changed but it is still 5 stars out of 5 for me Good game!!!","timestamp_created":1649021114,"timestamp_updated":1649021114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113301973","author":{"steamid":"76561199237897848","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":278,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1660087379},"language":"spanish","review":"Es incrible","timestamp_created":1649020819,"timestamp_updated":1649020819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566882133483886719","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113300894","author":{"steamid":"76561198034774010","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":164700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126579,"last_played":1658211421},"language":"english","review":"game good. game nice.\n","timestamp_created":1649019216,"timestamp_updated":1649019216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113300735","author":{"steamid":"76561198092380876","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1659350862},"language":"english","review":" i love this game","timestamp_created":1649018973,"timestamp_updated":1649018973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113300659","author":{"steamid":"76561198971782871","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2377,"last_played":1657419507},"language":"spanish","review":"ta weno","timestamp_created":1649018867,"timestamp_updated":1649018867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113300206","author":{"steamid":"76561198804583417","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3361,"last_played":1655495342},"language":"russian","review":"нормальная игруха, советую","timestamp_created":1649018240,"timestamp_updated":1649018240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113300070","author":{"steamid":"76561199063351593","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":43231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":231,"playtime_at_review":34343,"last_played":1660324399},"language":"english","review":"stop playing legion -

Samouczkiem sobie można co najwyżej dupe podetrzeć bo jest to po prostu jakiś żart, ale przynajmniej sie troche punktów dostaje. Fabuła postaci jest naprawdę dobrze opracowana, każdy ocalały oraz zabójca ma ciekawą historię ze sobą powiązaną. Jest kompletnie niezbalansowana, są perki które totalnie nie powinny się w niej znajdować, dodają jakieś żałosne 15 sekund do pościgu z killerem, a tak nie powinno to wyglądać. Społeczność w większości ogarnięta, chodź zdarzają sie ludzie którzy stoją przy bramie i tylko wkurwiają killera, tak samo są killerzy którzy campią, po czym smieją sie z ciebie ze nic nie zrobiles w meczu. System MMR to też totalna porażka, mając najwyższą rangę ze wszystkimi perkami (opal 1) mogę trafić kogoś kto pierwszy raz gra w grę killerem, ma najniższą rangę (pył 4) nic nie potrafi i nie ma totalnie funu z gry. System rozwijania postaci za pomocą punktów krwi jest naprawdę fajny i ma sens. Podsumowując, fajnie pograć ze znajomymi, wręcz zajebiscie, ale problem jest taki, że jak się traktuje gry poważnie i sie tryharduje w każdej możliwej (jak ja) to się można często zdenerwować ;). Końcowo i tak polecam, często daje satysfakcje.","timestamp_created":1649009761,"timestamp_updated":1649009761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113293511","author":{"steamid":"76561198930853550","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":13420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":10037,"last_played":1659731484},"language":"english","review":"its good i like it","timestamp_created":1649009682,"timestamp_updated":1649009682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113293360","author":{"steamid":"76561198272083000","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":17136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":240,"playtime_at_review":7197,"last_played":1659766627},"language":"english","review":"i can make orange rhyme with banana (bornana)","timestamp_created":1649009501,"timestamp_updated":1655328782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113293300","author":{"steamid":"76561199015723148","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3753,"last_played":1649528793},"language":"brazilian","review":"apenas sim","timestamp_created":1649009436,"timestamp_updated":1649009436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113292251","author":{"steamid":"76561198873154565","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":14665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14665,"last_played":1648234733},"language":"czech","review":"smrdí","timestamp_created":1649008250,"timestamp_updated":1649008250,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480686694383621216","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113291587","author":{"steamid":"76561197985252860","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":65188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":32718,"last_played":1660592660},"language":"german","review":"Top","timestamp_created":1649007465,"timestamp_updated":1649007465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113291433","author":{"steamid":"76561199191608563","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2619,"last_played":1651624670},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1649007305,"timestamp_updated":1649007305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113290901","author":{"steamid":"76561199118722951","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1653675424},"language":"schinese","review":"需要朋友\n","timestamp_created":1649006699,"timestamp_updated":1649006699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113290841","author":{"steamid":"76561199172670666","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":119154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1549,"playtime_at_review":90169,"last_played":1659979365},"language":"english","review":"I love and hate this game at the same time","timestamp_created":1649006633,"timestamp_updated":1649006633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113290488","author":{"steamid":"76561198207022091","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7819,"last_played":1649344436},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра.

So without further ado, here we go…\n\n\tI want to start off by saying that I played this game on PS4 for what I think may be close to 30 hours, so anything I say here may not be totally reflective of what the Steam version is. I bought this version on sale last year because at the time, my PS4 burned out. But I eventually got a replacement PS4 so I could continue playing in the platform that retained all my progress. However, since this game has cross-play, I believe anything I say here can be applied to this game on this platform. I maxed out 4 survivors, repeating Meg Thomas again at tier 1. I have not leveled up any killers because I am not that great at being killer and I found playing as a survivor more appealing, but it has cons and not very many pros from what I see.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\tThe best I can say about this games’ graphics is that they’re average at best and rough at worst. Don’t go into this expecting ground-breaking graphics. It looks like a late 7th gen game from Xbox 360 or PS3. The game uses Unreal Engine 4 and that couldn’t be more obvious. I see the same graphical errors in other Unreal Engine titles and Dead By Daylight is no different. The killers are probably the best looking characters about this game, but of course, some of them are licensed and if those didn’t look great, this game’s graphics would be below average for an 8th gen title. To me, graphics aren’t what makes a game good, gameplay is what defines a good game for me.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\tThe best example of how I can explain this game is it’s like cat and mouse… If the mouse was absolutely defenseless. Killers hack away at Survivors and then must place them on hooks for them to be sacrificed to the entity. Survivors must repair five generators then open a door to escape or escape through a hatch, if one is available. Survivors can help each other by repairing gens together, healing one another, or helping each other off hooks. It is possible to get ones’ own self off a hook, but I barely see anyone have any success in doing so and failing to do so speeds up the sacrifice. A survivor can be hooked three times before they are instantly killed, unless the killer chooses to mori them. A mori is the killer offing the survivor in their own signature fashion, instead of hooking them. These are the basics of the game. Cons? Well, the survivors have absolutely ZERO means of defense against the killers aside from conveniently placed pallets around the map that can stun the killer for a couple of seconds, if it is knocked down and has made contact with the killer and “blinding flashlights”. Other than that, that is it. Survivors escape or die. At least Friday the 13th the Video Game tried to do something different and let the survivors have weapons that can stun Jason for a good chunk of time. I have gotten better at playing this game, but I am not a fan of how unfair this style of gameplay is sometimes. In the most recent update with the girl from the Ring, I started to see killers hit survivors through walls and surfaces. Either they’re cheating or Behavior Interactive messed up the hit registration somehow. A mic is almost vital to communicate with your fellow survivors, otherwise, you could be in for a difficult time. Lastly, the only buttons you’ll be using in this game will be the bumpers and triggers on the controller and the analog sticks for movement and camera (I do not know how it works with keyboard and mouse). WHY do the right and left bumpers do nearly EVERYTHING in gameplay?\n\nGAMEPLAY REWARDS:\n\tThis game has the most pathetic reward system I have ever seen. Every match you play, \tyou earn currencies through leveling up and doing things in a match. I am so sick of seeing games nowadays release and have three or four different types of currencies that can only be used for certain things. Your main source of currency is bloodpoints. Bloodpoints are used to unlock gear and perks for use in matches, except gear cannot always be kept unless you have an attachment that prevents it from being lost. The only permanent rewards in the game are the perks. Basically, you unlock currency so you can play the same repetitive and tedious game mode. The other two currencies are used to unlock cosmetics and DLC killers. One of these currencies, known as auric cells can be bought through microtransactions in game and on whatever storefront the game is being sold on. I really hate seeing this kind of thing in games and I want it to stop.\n\nMAP DESIGN:\n\tIt’s a mixed bag. I don’t have any favorite maps in this game because they’re all heavily confined and dense, with many bumps and cracks in the geometry. It’s like being a rat in a skitterbox with a cat that is hungry. Some others may like the maps, but I don’t very much. There’s not a map I like, it’s more like “which map do I hate the least?”.\n\nSOUND:\n\tThis game is all about sound cues and thankfully, I have not encountered many sound bugs. Maybe a scream from when someone is hooked will not play, but that is it. Is it the best sound I have ever heard in a game? Not by any means, but it functions.\n\nUSER INTERFACE:\n\tWho designed this interface? Whoever did it needs to be fired. It is slow and jittery. On PC, the interface may not be a problem, but on console or controller, you still have a cursor that you must use the left (or right) analog stick for. NO, you CANNOT use the D-pad. I wish I could say this is the only game I know that is this way, but with every passing year, I see it in more and more games and I HATE it. I’m not even going to talk about the new options menu which is in BETA. SIX years after the game released. Again, in the newest update, the menus have glitched out for me and wouldn’t even load in at all. This is something else I did not see before the new update in my 30 hours of playing this.\n\nCOMMUNITY:\n\tIt’s just like any other gaming community. You have some very nice people and you have some very toxic people. These toxic people are, in most instances, the killers. I’ve been camped while I was on a hook, I’ve been tunneled, sometimes even handed over to the killer on a silver platter by random survivors. Here’s something crazy though.. there are NICE killers. These killers will play fair, sometimes even helping the survivors out if they so wish to. Whether it is them being a good sport or they’re just farming for those juicy bloodpoints. I’ve heard rumors about how the community on PC is bad and not so much on consoles. But again, after this latest patch, toxic killers became more prominent and therefore, the game became all the more frustrating to play. Even hardcore DBD friends of mine agree to this.\n\nPLOT:\n\tI don’t know if there is lore for this game or if there’s even a story, but if I have to leave the game to understand what story there is, that aspect of your game has failed. \n\nCONCLUSION:\n\tI did have fun on this game, but I only ever played this game with friends. If I am not playing this game with friends, I do not have much motivation to play on my own. I wasn’t a big horror fan before this game and I still am not. I play games like Manhunt or Dead Space if I got a horror itch to scratch. And all this stuff about “This is a game that is more fun with friends”, ANY GAME IS FUN WITH FRIENDS. I’ve cracked open a drink and laughed at bad games with friends. If I am having a difficult time enjoying this game, chances are I will not be coming back to it. This game is your typical live-service, always online game that will fade into irrelevancy once the servers are shut off.","timestamp_created":1648973821,"timestamp_updated":1648973821,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113264881","author":{"steamid":"76561199097364169","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3497,"last_played":1653455866},"language":"english","review":"sus","timestamp_created":1648973476,"timestamp_updated":1648973476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113264410","author":{"steamid":"76561198031707187","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":30787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":60,"playtime_at_review":24833,"last_played":1660081976},"language":"english","review":"This game is hell","timestamp_created":1648972715,"timestamp_updated":1648972715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113263629","author":{"steamid":"76561198038599736","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":54919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3618,"playtime_at_review":19371,"last_played":1660548544},"language":"spanish","review":"En este momento no lo recomiendo, perks rotas, killers rotos, survivors rotos , es imposible tratar de jugar una partida tranquilo , sumado a la toxicidad del mismo juego","timestamp_created":1648971381,"timestamp_updated":1652336969,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113262316","author":{"steamid":"76561199095251131","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2544,"playtime_at_review":43266,"last_played":1660601607},"language":"spanish","review":"La vdd este juego me ha viciado bastante, lo recomiendo si estan buscando una nueva forma de divirterse y sentir la adrenalina que produce u.u","timestamp_created":1648968921,"timestamp_updated":1648968921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113262295","author":{"steamid":"76561199250194052","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1986,"last_played":1659074514},"language":"vietnamese","review":"thi thoang van gap 1 so loi\n","timestamp_created":1648968891,"timestamp_updated":1648968891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113262248","author":{"steamid":"76561198183598026","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":20006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19441,"last_played":1649683720},"language":"schinese","review":"不让win7玩家玩了是吗？","timestamp_created":1648968797,"timestamp_updated":1648968797,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480314970016479492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tOGM9/8CeOqHsAM="}
