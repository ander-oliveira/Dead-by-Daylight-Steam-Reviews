by Daylight é um jogo onde há 4 sobreviventes e 1 assassino, e você deve utilizar de certas habilidades para fazer os 5 geradores para abrir um portão de fuga antes que o assassino mate todos os sobreviventes, e caso haja apenas 1 sobrevivente restante, ele pode escapar por um alçapão, mais chamado por \"hatch\". \nJogo recheado de conteúdo. Já joguei há anos em outra plataforma e devo dizer que com o tempo o jogo só vem melhorando, com adição de novos killers e novos sobreviventes, tanto licenciados, de filmes de terror, séries e etc, quanto originais, e ambos adicionam mecânicas novas e interessantes ao jogo. Cada sobrevivente possui um set de 3 habilidades únicas, que podem ser repassadas para outros sobreviventes caso você alcance um certo nível e libere essas habilidades únicas no que é chamado de \"teia de sangue\", uma espécie de \"up\" de nível individual, que quando você completa, seu personagem passa 1 level e com isso a teia vai resetando e trazendo novas coisas pra se pegar com o personagem. Há sim jogadores tóxicos, e há um problema no balanceamento de muitos aspectos, porém é um jogo divertido e vale muito a pena. Viciante e intrigante pra se jogar, seja com amigos, ou não. Recomendo muito.","timestamp_created":1637982861,"timestamp_updated":1637984299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104258717","author":{"steamid":"76561198873025425","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":29280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6245,"last_played":1658547161},"language":"schinese","review":"货真价实好游戏，排去一些不符合规则的玩家，去掉一些恶意外挂，忽略一些地图技能bug，删掉一些不好情节，加上人类排队时间减少一些，屠夫单排遇车队少一些，还是很好的游戏的。xd","timestamp_created":1637982844,"timestamp_updated":1637982844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104257945","author":{"steamid":"76561198809675093","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13848,"last_played":1655899310},"language":"english","review":"damn this game has changed my whole life, before i was happy and now i am depressed and feel like trash, thanks, also my wrist is fxcked cuz i played the game too much, love it 5/10","timestamp_created":1637982411,"timestamp_updated":1637982411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538922131061553955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104257923","author":{"steamid":"76561198036536658","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15841,"last_played":1654021092},"language":"russian","review":"крутая игра, для совместной игры, до 5 человек","timestamp_created":1637982404,"timestamp_updated":1637982404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104257091","author":{"steamid":"76561198097982991","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":100035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1849,"playtime_at_review":60572,"last_played":1660450839},"language":"english","review":"I love this game, but probably don't get it.
