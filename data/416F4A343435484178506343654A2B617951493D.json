Devs do not listen to the community whatsoever. The entire community hates on the changes and they push it out anyway. They change the game at a snails pace its awful. The game became so old because they never push out changes and when they do they just make the game worse. Literally the worst devs I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the game is also the most unbalanced thing ever. Survivors and Killers can bring perks, addons, and items to make the game a 90% chance they win. This happens in most matches. Not to mention the solo q experience is absolutely atrocious. Every game your tm8s will dc or be so awful to the point that every game you have a 15% chance to survive. Every match is also completely unbalanced. People with 2k hours go against people with 100 hours constantly. Literally nothing about this game is good. The skill cap is at like 400 hours theres no point to playing after. Theres no ranked mode and no reason to even get the highest rank in the game, no reward, no badge, nothing.

In a game where every second counts, and status changes happen so frequently, it's hard to believe how this made it out of the Public Test Build (PTB).\n\nA full revert back to the old UI is senseless. The new updated graphics are nice (they could be better, but it's a very nice start), but it's almost unplayable in it's current state.

REVIEW 2021-02-10\nFor quite some time now this game is completely broken.

This game is not worth playing. Devs can't see that 80% of killers are rank 1, 20% have rank 4 and above, and skills that before would mean rank 19 max!\nIf you want to know how to completely destroy a good game, ask Behaviour Interactive.\n\nUPDATE 2022-07-17\nAfter reading PTR and changes \"because killers are so weak - we need to boost them\" - LOL! I present to you: company that is developing the game that they know nothing about!\n\nFINAL UPDATE 2022-07-30\nI have wasted way too much time and money on this game, only reward being a middle finger from devs. For over a year now, BHVR focused on promoting LGBTQXYZ instead of focusing on quality of the game. Direction that was taken by movie producers as well resulting in tons of movies that nobody wants to watch not to mention pay a ticket for cinema. And no! not because of LGBT content in them... because there is absolutely nothing else. \nI thought that games can hold against \"new fashionable genders\" as GAMERS DON'T CARE!  trash talk was always part of competitive gaming, politics not! \nSo all focus from devs is going to new cosmetics, stories promoting LGBT and piece by piece destroying quality of the game. \n\nR.I.P Dead by Daylight","timestamp_created":1612917044,"timestamp_updated":1659173917,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511067032814025879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302760","author":{"steamid":"76561198110026070","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":77567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":708,"playtime_at_review":38046,"last_played":1660531667},"language":"english","review":"Terrible UI design that the designers should be ashamed of, the locomotion changes have worse animations than before and no one asked for either to be updated.

Behaviour Interactive Inc. has had the same mediocre output since Jun 14th 2016 when dead by daylight released, and now that its 2021 they are starting to make me lose interest.","timestamp_created":1612916374,"timestamp_updated":1617145271,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302385","author":{"steamid":"76561198845889313","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":30862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14797,"last_played":1627999314},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um pouco bugado, mas divertido haha","timestamp_created":1612916358,"timestamp_updated":1612916358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302361","author":{"steamid":"76561198313173924","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":14321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5881,"last_played":1654900067},"language":"latam","review":"El juego se fue a la mierda :(","timestamp_created":1612916328,"timestamp_updated":1612916328,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507986307144165039","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302337","author":{"steamid":"76561198866769462","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":46737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":344,"playtime_at_review":21787,"last_played":1660517820},"language":"english","review":"Jogo horrivel","timestamp_created":1612916294,"timestamp_updated":1612916294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505089938640594482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302255","author":{"steamid":"76561198090024575","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":19997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":94,"playtime_at_review":19560,"last_played":1660270439},"language":"english","review":"This game just gets worse and worse with every update, the developers don't care what the players want, they just want cosmetic money","timestamp_created":1612916142,"timestamp_updated":1612916142,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50289684534072876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302185","author":{"steamid":"76561198871114843","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":104474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":156,"playtime_at_review":64974,"last_played":1660194997},"language":"english","review":"changing previous review which was mainly a rant on 4.5.0 (which is still inexcusable in my opinion since it should've never been released leaving the game practically unplayable for about a week but i digress).\n\njust hear me out\n\nI love this game. One of my all time favorites. However, I still can't FULLY recommend this to other newer players simply due to the grind and unpredictability of the devs. Over the years, the game has grown....a LOT. This is great but it leaves newer players in a bit of a tough spot. right now, if you were to buy the base game (20$), you are essentially blocked from using 60% of the perks available. about half of those perks can only be brought by DLC or being very lucky in this sort of perk lottery which is the shrine of secrets. You would have to essentially be playing for hundreds or possibly thousands of hours to be able to unlock all the free killers and survivors and that is still leaving the other half of the roster which can only be payed for (in which the amount is starting to sharply rise as more licensed DLC starts being released). The devs also seem to be at a standoff with the community. this was highlighted in patch 4.5.0 which everyone hated and was still released in an even worse condition. It took a review bombing and a huge outcry for them to finally resolve their mess of an update after two weeks (there are more instances but i don't want this review to be just shitting on the devs since i really do believe they are good at what they do...just a little misinformed). Other issues like rank still not mattering after 4+ years, long queue times, etc. are also very annoying and have been brought up time and time again by the community only to fall on deaf ears or mentioned and then later forgotten. \n\nbut for as sometimes frustrating this game is for new and old players alike, it is still a really good game unlike any other. The devs should be proud of their creation and hopefully we won't get another complete mess of an update like 4.5.0. I highly suggest giving this game a try if you want a different experience from the over saturation of other genres like FPS shooters, battle royales, etc. If it means anything, your first few games will be terrifying and i wish i could go back to my first moments of this game","timestamp_created":1612916017,"timestamp_updated":1614104758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529657363891601563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86302123","author":{"steamid":"76561198112062901","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":203741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177213,"last_played":1659097380},"language":"english","review":"3,000 hour player here, both survivor and killer.\n\nFix the awful hitbox, animation, and UI! \n\nHalf the fun of playing survivor was the ability to 360 the killer, they completely ruined it with this patch.
