It used to be pretty balanced, with balance patches here and there mixing up the meta. \n\nNow, this 1v4, intentionally imbalanced, \"survive against all odds\", horror game has become a 1v4 \"try and get a kill against all odds\", surprisingly balanced for a 1v4, bully-the-killer game.\n\nOver the last few months, patches keep coming out that directly address complaints of survivor mains, then either ignore, barely touch on, or outright claim it's not a problem whenever killer mains have any complaints of things in game that had really ought to be changed. This has resulted in the survivors being able to negate things the killers do that take a lot of effort (outplaying a survivor to get two hits on him, hooking someone, etc.)  by just standing in the right spot, equipping one perk forever, or doing one skill check.\n\nDespite the survivors becoming more and more unnecessarily powerful, and the people who play mostly killer continuously and loudly voicing their concerns, the developers release patch after patch after patch and have developer live streams where they announce that they will not be working on things the killers would like changed at any point in the near future, but have many plans to tend to the wishes of the survivors. I used to be a killer main and this was my most played game. Now I sometimes get back on to play survivor, but I've moved onto other games. It's a crying shame. Do not buy this until the devs make an effort to fix it, which, if the last handful of awful patches are any indication, won't be any time soon.\n\nEDIT 1: I definitely purchased this game at full price, I'm not sure why it says I got this for free...\n\nEDIT 2: I've more than doubled my hours since this review, and I can say now that the game is in a better place than it was at the time of the above review. The developer (BHVR) has purchased the full rights of their game from their publisher (can't remember the name), and it has been only great stuff since then. There's been way more communication, way more use of the play test server for big changes, and way more ACTUALLY listening to the community. I'm far happier now with the game than I was before, and I'm happy to change my review to positive.\n\nObligated to say maybe this more positive experience is because I'm now a survivor main...  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","timestamp_created":1510017893,"timestamp_updated":1532405753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546020448207855225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36333091","author":{"steamid":"76561198104083983","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":107556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":891,"playtime_at_review":39398,"last_played":1660537146},"language":"english","review":"It's a crying shame that the devs of this game can't stand up to the survivor community turning what could be one of the greatist game of its kind into well....this.
