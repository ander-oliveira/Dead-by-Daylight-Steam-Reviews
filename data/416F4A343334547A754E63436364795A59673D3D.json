But that's where my appreciation for this game stops. I've pumped out a lot of gameplay in the past few weeks trying to force myself to like the game, but there's simply too many issues with it right now for it to be playable. At first it seemed as if the devs were taking into account the communities complaints and fixing things based off of their suggestions, but the past few weeks this has seemed to stop. \n\nThe biggest issues of the game in my opinion;\n- While their update claims to have 'fixed' the matchmaking issues, finding a game can still be excessively long and will often throw you into a game where you're playing people across the world.\n\n- Game is currently incredibly unbalanced IMO, makes it more frustrating than fun to play. Some perks need to be evened out a lot more, and there absolutely needs to be a consequence for killers camping people who are hooked.\n\n- Graphics customization is very limited, as well as sound balancing. The main menu music is incredibly annoying and can't be individually turned down.\n\n- Matchmaking has a HUGE skill-gap. I'm either in a game with brand new players or people with 400 hours in game, there isn't really an inbetween. \n\nTL;DR: at the moment I wouldn't spend the $20 on this game, it's not quite a finished product yet. I think if some of these issues (along with others) are addressed, it will be a really fun game. But for now I wouldn't bother.","timestamp_created":1475197588,"timestamp_updated":1475197588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530650675296783447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25774367","author":{"steamid":"76561198084646426","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":143350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7186,"playtime_at_review":25511,"last_played":1660606970},"language":"english","review":"Fun game you can get a lot of hours in if you enjoy horror based games and don't mind a few bugs.","timestamp_created":1475196139,"timestamp_updated":1475196139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25773739","author":{"steamid":"76561197985422083","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":53802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12958,"last_played":1656538310},"language":"german","review":"fuck dis game!° its shit","timestamp_created":1475192321,"timestamp_updated":1475192321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503448307514190674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25773720","author":{"steamid":"76561198268960371","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1545009535},"language":"english","review":"One of the worst communities I've ever played with.\n\nIt's so bad I don't even wanna play anymore.\n\nStill fun but the people are assholes.","timestamp_created":1475192189,"timestamp_updated":1475192189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591156363487243652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25773342","author":{"steamid":"76561198262432834","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4973,"last_played":1580591018},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunun tek sıkıntısı Türkçe dil seçeneğinin bulunmaması.

Dies kann ziemlich frustrierend sein, wenn man denn mal Lust hat dieses Spiel zu spielen.\n- Community\n  - Viele erwarten von diesem Spiel ein non-plus ultra Spiel, welches keine Fehler besitzt und wunderbar zu spielen ist.\n     Man kann jetzt schon sagen: Das ist dieses Spiel \"noch\" nicht. Es besitzt Bugs, es ist noch nicht komplett ausgereift \n     und somit nicht das Spiel, was viele erwarten, wodurch die Spieler dieses Spiel negativ sehen, wie man es auch in den\n     Reviewprozenten sehen kann.\n- Bugs\n  - Die eben gerade schon angesprochenen Bugs. Sie sind nervig, sie verderben einem den Spielspaß. Auf beiden Seiten, \n     sowohl Killer als auch Survivor, gibt es sie.\n\nPros:\n\n- Spielspaß\n  - Das Spiel macht übelsten Spaß, solange man über die Bugs und die Community hinwegsehen kann. Vorallem über die\n     Bugs, weswegen ja auch die Community eher negativ geprägt ist. Zudem ist das Devteam immer drauf und dran alles\n     irgendwie zu fixen, auch wenn sie es nicht immer schaffen. Wie ich schon sagte, dass Spiel ist \"noch\" nicht das\n     non-plus ultra Spiel, macht aber in dem Stadium in welchem es zur Zeit ist für mich und meine Freunde Spaß.\n\n- Spielgestaltung\n  - Das Spiel ist ein gut überlegtes Spiel, wenn man sich mal aufregt, geht man einfach im tryhard-mode als Killer rein und\n     regt sich wieder ab, so läuft es zumindest bei mir immer. Man lernt das Spiel durch learning-by-doing und dies ist in\n    meinen Augen eines der besten Prinzipien. Selbst wenn man Leute hat, die das Spiel vorher gespielt haben, können sie\n    dir maximal das Grundprinzip erklären, lernen musst du es trotzdem. Zudem wird man immer stärker, sowohl als Killer\n    als auch als Survivor und das während man das Spiel lernt. Super Prinzip.\n\n- Spielweise\n  - Man startet auf einer verlassenen Farm, in einem Wald oder sonst noch wo und versucht zu entkommen. Die \n     Atmossphäre stimmt. Man hat Geräusche die man selbst hervorbringt oder welche aus seiner Umgebung. Sie stimmen \n     dich darauf ein, dass du gleich wahrscheinlich tot bist. Denn wirklich entkommen, schaffst du nur, wenn du beweist, \n     dass du es auch verdient hast. Schaffst du es, feierst du dich zu Tode, aber wenn du stirbst, dann regst du dich darüber\n     auf wie blöd doch dein Team sei oder warum der Killer so ein Arsch zu dir ist. Mich persönlich regt es auch auf, wenn\n    der Killer mich schnell erwischt und ich reg mich über die gleichen Punkte auf, aber im nachhinein lach ich wiederrum\n    drüber, weil ich dann doch mal ne gute Runde hatte.\n\nZusammenschluss.\n\nIn meinen Augen ist dieses Spiel eine Hass-Liebe. Ich kann es nicht durchgängig spielen, da ich sonst wahrscheinlich schon gefühlte 10 neue Mäuse bräuchte, aber wenn es mich mal fesselt, dann richtig. Es macht mir Spaß neue Perkkombinationen herauszufinden, welche man nach und nach freischaltet und ab und zu hab ich auch Spaß an einer Runde in welcher ich gestorben bin. Aber wie ich es auch schon sagte, regt man sich darüber auf, das man als Survivor versagt, dann bringt man einfach andere Survivor zum Versagen und verliert somit seine Frustation. Es ist sozusagen der ewige Salt-Kreislauf von Dead by Daylight. Man verliert als Survivor. Danach bringt man andere Survivor zum verlieren, geht darauf wiederrum wieder als Survivor rein und regt sich nach ein paar Runden wieder auf.\nIch hoffe, dass dieses Spiel weiterhin einen ordentlichen Support enthält, da ich wirklich sehr viel Potenzial in diesem sehe. Zudem ist das Devteam ein ziemlich cooles und spielernahes und es bemüht sich auf alle Fälle kräftig darum, dass dieses Spiel weiterhin gut wird.\n\nNochmal als Randnotiz:\nJeder hat seine Meinung und ich verstehe auch, warum Menschen dieses Spiel oder das Entwicklerteam als schlecht ansehen. So sollte jedem seine Meinung gelassen werden und wenn Leute das Spiel trotzdem spielen, obwohl sie sich drüber aufregen, dann hat das Entwicklerteam doch das geschafft, was sie wollten. Sie haben es geschafft, dass Menschen von ihrem Spiel gefesselt werden.","timestamp_created":1475184309,"timestamp_updated":1475184309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25771401","author":{"steamid":"76561198060590372","num_games_owned":573,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1660123538},"language":"english","review":"So i made a review a long time ago complaining about matchmaking times.\n\nThey fixed that, but do you know how they fixed it?\n\nBy removing the idea of balanced matchmaking and result in placing you against people who are up to 5 ranks higher than you.\n\nFor a new player, thats fucking cancerous.\n\nOn top of that, half the games i play only have me and one other survivor.

The game rewards risky gameplay but for the killers, even safety is punishing.\n\nThe devs are very much in favor of nerfing the killers over and over again so that Survivors can get out of situations they put themselves in, to get found out by the killer is a mistake on the survivors side, there is so much juking potential available so getting downed is either a testement to the killers skill, or the survivors lack of game knowledge.\n\nThere's a lot more I could go into but to sum it up, I have been in a lobby for 10+ minutes trying to find a solo game, with no game found yet. This is because no killers want to play anymore, Nurse required great skill and strategy to play, but now she is arguably the worst killer. The Trapper used to be the best killer since he could trap off infinite sites and actually play the game fairly. Now he's nerfed and probably second worst.\n\nTl;dr the devs love survivors and hate killers, the game is unbalanced due to infinite juke spots, camping as a prime deterent to the GLITCH that still has not been patched known as infinites has been nerfed, standing near a hooked survivor ticks down the entity rate. Basically, if you're a survivor main you're gonna wait 15+ minutes for a >20 minute game, and if you're a killer, you'll be lucky to kill one person in each game.","timestamp_created":1475175745,"timestamp_updated":1475175745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.392744928598403931","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25770235","author":{"steamid":"76561198263461647","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":61105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24594,"last_played":1656852789},"language":"french","review":"Super jeu d'horreur entre amis contre un tueur qui vous pourchasse, mais de nombreux cancers qui facecamp, camp, focus... et des bugs vraiments graves...

Obwohl das Spielprinzip eigentlich immer das gleiche ist, kommt doch regelmäßig viel Spannung auf. Ich bin in punkto Horror recht abgestumpft mittlerweile, aber am Anfang hatte ich hier doch etwas erhöhten Puls.\n\nSeit den letzten Patches ist das Spiel jetzt auch anständig Spielbar. Bislang hatte man riesen Probleme, mit einer Party eine Lobby zu finden und ins Spiel zu kommen. Das wurde diese Woche alles behoben, sodass wir mit Freunden nicht mehr auf den Offline Modus angewiesen sind, bei dem man keine Punkte bekommt und nichts freischalten kann.\n\nFazit: Ein sehr gutes Gelegenheitsspiel, wenn man mal nicht nur ballern will. Aber nur, wenn man nicht gleich ne Schlafstörung bekommt von jedem Bisschen Grusel. Wer zu Alpträumen und Verfolgungswahn neigt, sollte vielleicht erst ein paar Lets Plays schauen.","timestamp_created":1475099313,"timestamp_updated":1475099313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25746509","author":{"steamid":"76561198162035252","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3552,"last_played":1623257238},"language":"german","review":"Super game :)","timestamp_created":1475098129,"timestamp_updated":1475098129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501655638217926025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25746506","author":{"steamid":"76561198287861692","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":1654033113},"language":"romanian","review":"your game is shit","timestamp_created":1475098113,"timestamp_updated":1475098113,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486028611660003662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25746066","author":{"steamid":"76561198040770793","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":71596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21306,"last_played":1655852656},"language":"english","review":"•\tWhat is Dead by Daylight? *Updated 12/24/2016*  edits * * \no\tDBD is Horror game focusing on 1 v 4 asymmetrical gameplay Killer vs Survivors. While most horror games today focus too much of its scare factor on jump scares to accomplish its task DBD takes another approach gradually increasing tension. The tension brought on by the sense of your impending demise and the heart beat building intensity, or for killers the sound of completed generators which signals that the amount of time you have left to sacrifice the survivors is almost up. Or sneaky survivors which you have a hard time tracking down. DBD puts 4 survivors against a killer who must repair five generators and work as a team before they scarified by meat hook to the entity.\n\n•\tThe Good: \no\tI love this game, and would recommend you to give it a try. \no\tRandomly generated maps and layout\no\tAs of 9/28/16 the game IS NOT a jam packed DLC cash cow with micro transactions *Every DLC except for the nurse you would have to pay for* \no\tFeeling of a 80s horror movie where at any moment the killer could be right over your shoulder. \no\tThe soundtrack and heartbeats as the killer grows nearer always puts you at a state of unease and is spot on (even with ~200 hours in it still feels uneasy)  *survivors are no longer scared of the killer bc of their perks* \no\tEven though Evolve (Original Not Stage 2) and this game focus on asymmetrical gameplay do not compare them; that would not be doing this game justice. \no\tThe problem of unbalanced matchmaking *hasnt been fixed*\no\tFairly low $20 price tag\no\tDevs seem very passionate about their project so the game should have frequent updates, support, and future content. \n\n•\tThe Bad: \no\tThe Bugs: At launch the game was very buggy but with frequent updates the game feels a bit smoother, but you will encounter some bugs, like all games. *Still many bugs months later* \no\tThe game favors survivors most killers are no longer viable against survivor perks and try hard survive with friends* \no\tInfinites and campers *the problem now is survivors the meta builds desisive strike / self care / adrenaline / sabotage* makes most veteran survivors unkillable* \no\tUnsure of the Devs direction on future DLC plans *all payed* \no\tGetting out of rank 20 hell (~ 16 – 20) can be a nightmare bc of inexperienced survivors\no\tLaggy killers need for dedicated servers *still*\n\tSimply type 1 repeatedly in the lobby chat to test for lag. \no\tEvery perk on both sides should feel as a viable option to match a certain playstyle but this is not the case, some perks such as iron grasps on the killer side are absolutely mandatory while others are a waste of a slot\no\tA few killers use macro bots (depending on your outlook can be a hindrance or a quick way to farm points for both parties). \no\tWould like to see more emotes or proxy voice communication (restricted to a limited distance for survivors) \no\tWould like to see an additional game mode / focus on completing a different randomly decided objective rather than generators every game. \n\n•\tFinal Thoughts: \no\tDon’t let the number of problems that I brought up dissuade you from purchasing the game. The game is amazing and the unique dynamic between killer vs survivors and an altruistic team focused survivor group vs a selfish group that views itself as individuals that hasn’t been matched in any game that I have seen. You can read all the reviews on steam, but until you play it you will never know if a game is right for you. The game does have a few problems but what game doesn’t these days. Once a problem is found the devs usually get taken care of in a timely manner. I would like to see more item diversity on the survivor’s side. As of today I would rate DBD an 8/10 it has a few problems but does several new things for gaming and does them quite well. \n\n•\tTIPS: Your focus while playing shouldn’t be to kill everyone or simply survive you must entertain the ominous prescience known as the entity in several ways if you wish to rank up, completing objectives surviving, helping teammates etc. If you face camp survivors on the hook not only does it take away from the overall fun for survivors,but you don’t get nearly as many points for chasing the survivors usually results in a derank. \n•\tLearn how to hide, and remain calm, the killer can only see your tracks when you run so use this to your advantage. \n•\tRepairing the generators to 99% and not completing it is a strong option for survivors, killers have more generators to patrol meaning that they are less likely to find you. \n•\tSurvivors can now crouch past and crouch next to crows without setting them off. This is a new hiding option for survivors that is quite effective, most killers even the more experienced ones will look for alerted crows to see if a survivor has been in the area and will not walk near them in fear of setting them off themselves. \n•\tAt the start of the trail look for a hook first, each killer has their own hook allowing you to identify the killer and lets you prepare a strategy against that killer, also watch you should watch out for. \n. Killers also have their own distinct sound grunts, chainsaw, bells, claps of a trap, shrieks etcs to let you know which killer it is. \n•\tAlso at the start of the trail try to get a sense of where the killer is before starting a gen, a generator with little to no progress is often an indicator that a survivor is near. \n•\tLearn how to do the quick time skill checks and master getting great skill checks. \no\tFailing the skill checks not only slows down the time it takes for healing sabotaging a repairing but it also alerts the killer to you location which could compromise a whole team. \n•\tIf you are on the fence about purchasing the game I would say go ahead and try it out. I hope the tips that I provided will allow you to get out of survivor hell and rank high in no time.","timestamp_created":1475095920,"timestamp_updated":1482623114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25745966","author":{"steamid":"76561198019484071","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4888,"last_played":1591279077},"language":"german","review":"!!! könnte mir gefallen + schmecken ! ! !","timestamp_created":1475095470,"timestamp_updated":1475095470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25745801","author":{"steamid":"76561198117670694","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20064,"last_played":1494612294},"language":"english","review":"垃圾检测机制，你检测到外挂，那你就封号啊，草，吗的！！ 三番两次的进不去游戏，这垃圾游戏也是吃枣药丸!\n\nSpam detection mechanism, you detect the plugin, you're titles, grass, please!!!!!

Multiple balance changes that seem to come from nowhere and harm the health of the game from even an average player's perspective. \n\nThis game has a steepish learning curve, what these developers are trying to do at the moment is lessen that, which in itself isn't a bad thing. What's wrong is people who've sunk that time and effort in are getting the short end of the stick. If you decide to play killer, you're going to be in for a stress-inducing role that rewards you with very little. As it is a 1v4 game, killers (the 1) are really not in a good position today. What baffles me is they have a dedicated forum for feedback that's bursting at the seems with activity. But it seems like no one on the team really cares about what is being said. Not to mention the vast majority of what is posted there is in conflict with the devs decisions. It's hard to find a post praising the developers, hard.\n\nThey are catering to new players like you. But when you become well-acquainted with this game you will soon learn the gaping flaws in it all and the blind eye the team will give to those of high-skill.\n\nIt didn't always use to be this way. Back in 2016-2017 balance was terrible, but at that time no one knew what they were doing. There was active efforts to make the game genuinely better. But it seems we aren't addressing the real problems, instead using a bandaid to cover up the laceration.\n\nI'll be honest, in its infancy DBD had some of the most generous devs around. We got TWO free DLCs with some of the highest tier characters in this game. That's outstanding in terms of pay to win. But today it seems less and less wholesome. I don't know what happened.\n\nThis game is fun. You will likely accumulate hundreds of hours. But in the end I fear you might end up like me, veteran leftovers. I've spent many years attatched to this game, its community, and it's competitive scene. It breaks my heart to see something I loved so much and for so long go down the wrong path. So from one gamer to another, this might not be something you want to invest in.","timestamp_created":1475094425,"timestamp_updated":1579761430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25745737","author":{"steamid":"76561198097014227","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1473507635},"language":"spanish","review":"Al principio pensé que sería el típico juego repetitivo, pero tengo que decir que NO, que una vez lo empiezas a jugar, te das cuenta que, cada asesino y cada superviviente es un mundo, por lo cual esto hace del Dead by Daylight que cada partida sea totalmente diferente.

[/u][/h1]\nYes, there are not quite balanced every moment in it, but it's not critical cause the right set of skills (and your skill of the game) changes the balance scale in your direction.\n[h1][u] 3. What can you say about other players? (community) [/u][/h1]\nOhh...For me, the main problem is the community, but only players can make it look brighter and friendlier. No matter what u prefer to play as killer or survivor > another player will blame to you(common toxic effect in every community)The survivors who opened the gate crouch at the exit and click the flashlight, and the killers stand point-blank the hook near the victim (Both sides are not happy with this, but no one wants to start with themselves) and this shit destroy the atmosphere of madness, atmosphere of the terrible nightmare when killer starring his eye at you( this atmosphere was killed by players in 2017). Now survivors don't afraid the killers and this game start to be more competitive cause u should select right perks which help u to become a winner.\n[h1][u] 4. Ok, should I pay to win? [/u][/h1]\nAs for \"donate\" purchasable killers can't be better than \"vanilla\" killers if u  want to play for survivors it will be more difficult without DLC, but now u can buy every character for game currency. That is why Donat is cosmetic.\n [h1][u] 5. This game isn't new, it still alive?...and breathing XD [/u][/h1]\nYeah, developers are constantly releasing patches and adding new cosmetic items to our favourite characters. Also every few months a new DLC (killer + survivor + map) and a “combat pass” are added to the game, which is called the archive and created to develop the lore of the game.\n [h1][u] 6.

The community is very very very VERY VERY VERY VERYx1000 toxic. So don't listen to some of these bad reviews. MM right now takes some time to get into the game but it is for the better. You need some thick skin to play this game because like i said the community is toxic as hell. Try to avoid the forums. But if you want unique and fun as hell game play this is the game for you. \nPS: Playing surv is a huge learning curve in the beginning so don't get frustrated.","timestamp_created":1475082987,"timestamp_updated":1475082987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495495468378067017","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ434TzuNcCcdyZYg=="}
