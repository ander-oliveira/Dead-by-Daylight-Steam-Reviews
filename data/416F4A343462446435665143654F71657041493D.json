Yes this is not a horror game. If you wanna play horror game, this is not for you. It is a competitive game. Currently this game is relatively balanced. Although at the top rank, the game can be survivor sided and killers can feel very frustrated to play, the majority of the play should be able to have much fun while playing both killer or survivor. The consistent updates and new chapters are really nice, You always get new contents to play every season and time investment is really worthy into this game. However, the queue time in lower ranks can be quite long and this game does require you to grind a lot. Overall, DBD is a really good game to play.","timestamp_created":1601178659,"timestamp_updated":1601178659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76635267","author":{"steamid":"76561198324299739","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":198,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1660443086},"language":"english","review":"Spoopy game","timestamp_created":1601178228,"timestamp_updated":1608933248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76635173","author":{"steamid":"76561198104760907","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":17081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13584,"last_played":1651955301},"language":"danish","review":"I wouldn't say the game is bad if you find it on a good steam sale by it played of couple of times  don't get invested","timestamp_created":1601178029,"timestamp_updated":1601178029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76635120","author":{"steamid":"76561198965680118","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8599,"last_played":1617290514},"language":"english","review":"too scary\n","timestamp_created":1601177950,"timestamp_updated":1601177950,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76634957","author":{"steamid":"76561198971404447","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6714,"last_played":1657027100},"language":"russian","review":"Если не играть то впринципе нормально","timestamp_created":1601177659,"timestamp_updated":1601177659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76634925","author":{"steamid":"76561198330734616","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":4274,"last_played":1660027337},"language":"english","review":"The game appears brainless at first but actually has a lot of strategy.","timestamp_created":1601177605,"timestamp_updated":1601177605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76634569","author":{"steamid":"76561198275049894","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":79504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":96,"playtime_at_review":34854,"last_played":1659910167},"language":"polish","review":"wysmienita produkcja bardzo dobry balans.

Também, porque é divertido escrever [i]reviews[/i]. :p Vale sempre lembrar que as opiniões aqui são [b]próprias[/b] e não tendem, de forma alguma, afetar alguém ou algo em específico.\n\n[b]Resumo do Jogo[/b]\n\n[i]Dead by Daylight[/i] é um jogo de horror cooperativo desenvolvimento pela Behaviour Interactive Inc., onde um assassino deve sacrificar 4 sobreviventes os quais precisam consertar um total de 5 geradores espalhados pelo mapa e escapar por um portão, pelo qual vão fugir de seu destino fatal. O jogo possui uma série de [i]perks[/i] e itens que irão ajudar e/ou atrapalhar os jogadores de diversas maneiras, tanto para sobreviventes quanto para o assassino.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]História[/b]\n\nNo passado, [i]Dead by Daylight[/i] tinha uma história pouco explorada. Basicamente, um grupo de pessoas acordavam em um acampamento desconhecido e precisam fugir de um assassino enquanto realizavam tarefas para escapar daquele local. O assassino, também vindo do mundo real, tem o objetivo de sacrificar essas pessoas à uma [i]Entity[/i], conhecida por manipular a mente do assassino e criar esse \"universo\" de carnificina e desespero.\n\nHoje, o jogo conta com uma história bem mais elaborada. Os sobreviventes possuem mais personalidade e um [i]background[/i] mais impactante. Assim como os assassinos, que muitas vezes são ligados à X personagem e, juntos, criam uma história maior.\n\n[i]Dead by Daylight[/i] agora possui um sistema de [i]Tomes[/i], onde os jogadores devem cumprir objetivos para liberar pequenos pedaços da história do jogo e de seus personagens.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nO objetivo dos sobreviventes é simples: não deixe o assassino te pegar, conserte 5 geradores e fuja por um dos dois portões existentes no mapa. Para isso, eles podem utilizar janelas, buracos nas paredes, [i]pallets[/i] que atrasam o assassino e outras mecânicas. O objetivo do assassino é justamente impedir que isso aconteça sacrificando os sobreviventes em ganchos espalhados pelo mapa ou com suas próprias mãos. \n\n[b]Itens e [i]perks[/i][/b]: cada sobrevivente pode equipar 1 item - como mapas, lanternas, [i]kits[/i] de primeiros socorros etc. - com 2 [i]addons[/i] que melhoram os [i]stats[/i] do item em questão. Assassinos podem equipar apenas [i]addons[/i] que melhoram suas habilidades.\n\nAlém disso, também é possível que ambos equipem uma oferenda que possui efeitos positivos ou negativos.\n\nCada sobrevivente/assassino possui 3 [i]perks[/i] únicos e os assassinos possuem uma habilidade que pode ser utilizada durante toda a partida. Cada jogador pode equipar até 4 [i]perks[/i] de uma vez, sendo eles únicos ou genéricos.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]Level Design e Sound Design[/b]\n\n[b]Level Design:[/b] bom, eu digo que é 50/50. Alguns mapas são bem construídos e possuem desafios para todos os jogadores, enquanto outros beneficiam uma das partes. O tão conhecido [i]looping[/i] é um grande problema gerado por isso, tornando o jogo mais difícil para um assassino sem tanta mobilidade.\n\n[b]Sound Design:[/b] um dos quesitos importantes, se não o mais importante, do [i]Dead by Daylight[/i]. Com ele, você consegue ouvir os sons gerados por outros jogadores, o [i]terror radius[/i] do assassino através do batimento cardíaco dos sobreviventes, mecânicas espalhadas pelos mapas e outros. Nesse ponto o jogo possui pequenas falhas, mas a experiência é muito boa, no geral.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]Bugs e Erros[/b]\n\n[i]Dead by Daylight[/i] é conhecido por seus bugs. [b]Muitos deles.[/b] Infelizmente, a desenvolvedora sofre com bugs que atrapalham muito a vida de quem joga. Os bugs vão além da jogabilidade, uma vez que afetam os [i]perks[/i] e destroem o dinamismo e a experiência. Além de tudo, costumam demorar a consertar certas coisas que ficam quebradas por um bom tempo.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]Observações Finais[/b]\n\n[i]Dead by Daylight[/i] é um jogo que possui uma proposta bacana, mas que falha em muitos pontos. O jogo atualmente sofre de um desabalanceamento muito grande, onde a inclusão de várias coisas com um tempo acabaram fugindo do controle. Há sobreviventes que dizem que ele é muito forte para o assassino, assim como assassinos que dizem que é mais forte para os sobreviventes.

I wasn't wrong. I would love to play this game for the first time again - to be one of the teenagers at their friends' house at 1 AM.\n\nAfter the initial few hours, the game lost it's scariness for me, and became something that I can get good at. It is a little off putting at first, as both survivor and killer - not escaping or not killing anyone can make a new player feel hopeless... However, once you get that first good escape or that first good merciless victory, the game gets so fun.\n\nEvery killer feels unique to play, although some of their powers may be similar. They all have a learning curve, and they all have perk builds that works well on them, but not others. There is still some meta perks that every killer can benefit from, at higher ranks you may really start needing them...\n\nSurvivor is really fun to play with friends. Working together to survive against this serial killer is amazing and really helps with team building. Personally I don't enjoy playing survivor solo that much, but it is always an option if you want to.\n\nRecently Dead By Daylight has become that game that I play periodically - I like to play it a lot for a while, take a long break, and come back to it and see what's new. The game updates regularly with new killers/survivors and maps. The maps are also procedural, with a few consistent elements, so that you can never truly know where everything is, but rather where it might be.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dead By Daylight, especially if it is on

game is ultimately a recommendation, but not by a large margin. The gameplay loop of chasing is satisfying, but the buggy nature of some interactions combined with terrible dedicated servers (which are the butt of many jokes) can make some aspects of gameplay a bit frustrating. The ranked system is terrible at truly measuring skill, leading to a massive difficulty spike when reaching red ranks. This is even worse considering that ranked is the ONLY way to play in randoms. In my opinion, there should be a true random queue where you can go up against anybody and a ranked queue without survive with friends. The design behind killers receives a lot of negative comments, but I think that a lot of the killers (besides nurse, spirit, and clown) are well designed and fun to go up against. The gameplay balance at the moment is very survivor-sided, with perks like decisive and unbreakable oppressing most of higher ranks. The map design is sometimes terrible and can sometimes seem to not have any thought put into it (not to mention the absurd imbalances created by random generation). Worse than all of this though is the community themselves. They are often 'main' either killers or survivors. Since the gameplay is asymmetrical, they struggle to understand the other's argument and thus can end up being very entitled and toxic. However, this game offers a unique type of gameplay not seen anywhere else, so I have to recommend it. However, you should only buy this game if you have a cool head and can rise above the emergent toxicity","timestamp_created":1601141780,"timestamp_updated":1601141780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76609195","author":{"steamid":"76561198330309583","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":1963,"last_played":1660230335},"language":"english","review":"So much fun with friends","timestamp_created":1601141314,"timestamp_updated":1601141314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76609192","author":{"steamid":"76561199069964303","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":699,"last_played":1653882437},"language":"english","review":"Annoying as hell but its fun lol","timestamp_created":1601141311,"timestamp_updated":1601141311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44bDd5fQCeOqepAI="}
