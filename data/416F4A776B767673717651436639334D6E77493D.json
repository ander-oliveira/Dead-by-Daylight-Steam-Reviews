If you are a fan of cult classic horror characters and killers there's plenty of that for you here. It does have a quite high learning curve if you want to play this on high ranking matches from either side. The base game will give you pretty much all the survivor cross-character (called teacheables) skills you need. If you want to main killer you will have to invest a little bit on DLCs as some of the best teacheables for killers are from DLC killers. You do not need the DLCs to play DLC maps, since players who has them can use the item to summon the map. As a downside, I could say it's quite grindy to get all the skills to make the builds you may want and you do need to restart your character 3 times if you want the experienced player unique outfits + high appear rate of special items (That can turn around a match). If you get hooked (Pun intended) to the game, there's thousands of hours here for you. If you want to play it casually alone you may not get the most of it. DLCs, microtransactions and the game pass do not offer any kind of advatage at all over other players with just the base game, so I recommend trying the base game at least.\n\nAlmost 500 hours since I started playing and 400 hours after I wrote the original review, this game is still one of the most fun experiences I had this year.","timestamp_created":1599208721,"timestamp_updated":1606329825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75412844","author":{"steamid":"76561199027622508","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1333,"last_played":1658683373},"language":"english","review":"A thrilling game that will get your heart pumping.

OG cast is getting neglected (RIP Billy), and newer killers performance are so basic that they are quickly forgotten in favour of Nurse, Spirit, Huntress and Blight.\nWith the introduction of a hidden MMR system, the focus has changed to kills verses escapes, so survivors run gen rushing builds and chase extending builds, while killers are forced to proxy camp and tunnel their way to victory.\nWhile the devs are problematic in their own way, the worst aspect of this game is the community.\nHalf of the community are snowflakes who complain about bming and consistently try to bring their drama onto your steam profile or private messages.

Even though I would say I still recommend the game to the average steam gamer, it is far from a game I would want to take seriously and  have it be my primary game. This game has many balance issues that a new player would probably not notice and would just glance over. However someone who has accumulated this many hours would start to see the game in a more negative light, and realize the game's downsides. DO NOT main this game. Play once in a while, play it with friends to have a fun time. The second you start to take the game more seriously, you will realize just how flawed and the many balance issues this game has. Scott Jund the content creator has a ton of videos talking about just how awful the game is in terms of balance, and how behind the developers are in terms of fixing the game and communicating with the player base. Should you still buy/play the game? Sure, but don't take this game to heart. It is far from the ideal game it should be, because developers just don't know what they're doing. \n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nAfter playing this game for more than 2 years and approaching 3 years, here are my thoughts about this game. It is without a doubt that I still enjoy the game. The reason why I enjoy it so much lies within playing with friends and constantly improving your own play. The smallest things I want to perfect and play well keeps my interest. Yes, you can argue there are certain mechanics, powers, and perks in the game that makes it feel unfair or unjust. No, this game is not perfectly balanced. However there are many aspects of the game where if you played just a little bit better it would have made an impact in the match. Using and applying your knowledge to outplay and outwit the other side feels satisfying especially when it works out. Instead of raging at what the other side has done to you, look at what you yourself could've done better because that is what you have control over. With that being said, if you do not have the right mentality, you will burn out of the game quick.\n\nThe game has a certain demanding skill cap where it can be punishing towards beginners. Not knowing any of the fundamentals regarding objectives and chase interaction can be frustrating for both sides because you will constantly lose. This makes it easily frustrating and rage inducing. In the end, the fun from this game is what you make of it. If you learn and self improve, then you'll enjoy it. If you rage after every match, then you will burn out fast. I will admit that the community isn't great asmost people are biased to the whichever side they main. Play with a good mentality, lose the salt and salt from other toxic players, and you will have a fun time.","timestamp_created":1599191499,"timestamp_updated":1624854262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75405762","author":{"steamid":"76561198819476934","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4404,"last_played":1626763289},"language":"schinese","review":"主要是可以在这个游戏里舔舔角色，谁不喜欢迈扣？谁不喜欢迈扣？谁不喜欢迈扣？但是什么时候把那个卡石头的傻逼bug解决一下谢谢，虽然说是恐怖游戏但总会卡出很多欢乐bug，这很好","timestamp_created":1599191003,"timestamp_updated":1599191003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75405753","author":{"steamid":"76561199059443536","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1324,"last_played":1657375808},"language":"english","review":"it is such good game and good graphices\n","timestamp_created":1599190984,"timestamp_updated":1599190984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75405291","author":{"steamid":"76561198949682687","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":21497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":116,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1660527820},"language":"english","review":"I bought this game because my friends have it on the PS4 and it is ALL THEY PLAY but I low key see why lol","timestamp_created":1599190165,"timestamp_updated":1599190165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75405234","author":{"steamid":"76561198980458233","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1679,"last_played":1654638612},"language":"english","review":"This game is too much fun to play with friends and good players online.

Which goes to show that the PC community is just over it.\n\nNow if you can get past ALL of the above, The final boss is Crash to Desktop. WHICH if you're in a match it will de-rank you and remove your items.\n\nAnd if you're still not convinced?, Go watch the hour and hours of players having the same issues.\n\nThe game is a really cool concept, The play loop of it COULD be really fun, However, this has been the only game EVER to make me uninstall and write a review based on how disappointed I've been with this experience.\n\nMaybe they will get it right with DBD 2? who knows.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: Reinstalled to try the new patch in hopes things might have been better. Nope, Only worse. Hex totems spawn in places you can reach them, Hatches spawn in places where your characters animation can't play out so you just float in the middle of the air and do nothing while trying to open a hatch. \n\nNot sure if links are allowed but here's an example of an unreachable Hex Totem - https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/9061/eQAf1N.jpg\n\nBalance is no different if not worse. New hero comes with a massive amount of map presence and MORE expose mechanics.\n\nWhen I read all the stories about broken, unwanted, unfair content been patched into the game that no one asks for... I now understand. This dev man... awful, Everyone that plays this REALLY wants it to be good, they just keep missing the mark... by a long shot.\n\nOh, Game looks more shiny with graphics update... About the only good thing the games seen in a while, Clap for that I guess.","timestamp_created":1599179648,"timestamp_updated":1599730608,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48125755786895752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75399576","author":{"steamid":"76561198862287729","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":105605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19418,"last_played":1658267874},"language":"english","review":"I would really like to say I recommend this game because I really do like the game at its core, but I can't with good conscience do so. \n\nIn Dead By Daylight, you can play as either one of 4 survivors or a killer in what basically amounts to a glorified game of tag mixed with  hide and seek. While the first few dozen matches are genuinely thrilling and scary, the grind, reliance on spending money, and the very apparent lack of balancing, performance and quality quickly makes the game lose its luster. \n\nThis game is probably one of the grindiest games I have ever played, requiring hundreds of hours to max out survivors and killer, and the paid battle pass offered each season makes the grind even worse, requiring players to go out of their way to complete challenges that are sometimes unreasonable and difficult in order to get the rewards for the season. Many players feel pressured into buying tiers in the battle pass just to complete it. \n\nOne of the biggest problems with this game is how stale it becomes to play over time. Most people who play killer will run the same 10-12 perks on their characters, regardless of their power because the game's balance is so out of whack, that it becomes tedious, difficult, or sometimes impossible to win without running them, despite there being almost 90 perks for killers, and even more for survivors. \n\nMost perks are also locked behind paid DLC, Each character, both killers and survivors, comes with 3 unique perks, and must be owned to unlock them. With some characters being available for purchase only with the game's premium currency (Auric Cells, not to be confused with the in-game currency iridescent shards) many people are forced to purchase characters with their money so they can maintain a competitive advantage, as unlocking a character with iridescent shards can take hundreds of hours, and licensed characters can only be purchased with Auric Cells for real money. \n\nDead By Daylight is also riddled with bugs and glitches, many of which have persisted for months or even years with no fixes. The developers of the game appear to be more concerned with pumping out paid DLC's every 3 months than actually fixing the game. Rather than rolling back updates and working on fixes or delaying updates in order to make sure they aren't broken on launch, they continue push $10-15 cosmetics and their $10 battle pass, along with all of their paid DLC's without properly addressing the issues that were raised during Player Test Builds (whose purpose was to identify and flag these bugs for fixing before release).\n\nWhile I love the gameplay of Dead By Daylight, the lack of attention to the community, the refusal to slow down to fix the game, and the egregious monetization practices the developers employ stops me from really wanting to recommend this game to anyone.","timestamp_created":1599179486,"timestamp_updated":1636673830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75399451","author":{"steamid":"76561198282730964","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":49,"playtime_at_review":9521,"last_played":1659838096},"language":"english","review":"its ight","timestamp_created":1599179247,"timestamp_updated":1599179247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75399378","author":{"steamid":"76561199043967216","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2140,"last_played":1642984408},"language":"brazilian","review":"e um jogo muito bom, pena que a comunidade é toxica, a BeHaviour fez um jogo com uma otima jogabilidade e graficos, as perks são bem balanceadas","timestamp_created":1599179081,"timestamp_updated":1599179081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75399350","author":{"steamid":"76561199044489359","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20282,"last_played":1593556604},"language":"english","review":"Favorite game.
