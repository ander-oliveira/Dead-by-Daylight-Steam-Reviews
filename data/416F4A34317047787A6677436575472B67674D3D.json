Had barely any hitboxes on terrain, so he was basically useless at launch. The Resident Evil DLC? The map broke instantly and took itself out of commission for MONTHS. It broke itself so bad it started to break other maps somehow. Nemesis? Bricked lower end PCs if people played against him. Pinhead? Voice lines immediately broke on release (despite them working just fine in the PTU). The new matchmaking system is a complete joke. Play a Killer you JUST bought and have zero perks on? Have an Iridescent SWF party. It's been YEARS and they only just trotted out a couple accessibility features because the community was crying out for it and they caused a stir by dunking on accessibility. \n\nThat's all without even considering the recent scandal.
