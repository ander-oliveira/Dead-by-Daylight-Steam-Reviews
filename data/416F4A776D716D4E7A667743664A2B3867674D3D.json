If you get high MMR as a survivor you either get Hackers and Meta Squads for teammates and spent 3 minutes holding the right mouse button or you get shitty teammates that got into high MMR by being carried by Meta Squads and hackers and get camped by the killer on hook without having done anything in the match.

Overall the game is very intresting either as a killer or survivor\nFor someone beginner:\n-As survivor you have to fix the gens in order to escape - otherwise find the hatch before the killer does if you are the last one standing\n-Try to delay as much as you can the killer while the others are fixing the gens - or healing (and you hope they will fix the gens)\n\n-As killer you have to kill as many as you can before they can actually manage to escape - or just being byllied by toxic main survivors\n\nFor someone new as well \nDont buy DLCs very fast\nDont buy Skins with ingame money - Buy perks first - its more important the gameplay than just looking good\nDont give up if you straggle against the ranking up system or your MMR\nAs you play you learn and you become better\nPlay as killer and survivor to learn better the game - to see what killer sees and what feels to be on the ''enemy side''\n\nFor someone who plays a lot this game \nI strongly recommend the battlepass that this game offers - You actually give 10 euros (as i remember) and all you have to do is to play the game-missions and in the end you get free skins and points (worth 10 euros)\n\nAbout this game - as in all games - there are some disadvantages such as\n-MMR system is a huge problem here and years or the matchmacking. For example you might play against a full team, premades with 1000 hours in the game and you just got up to rank 1 killer (Rank I, in roman right now - new update)\n-You might play with some survivors not as good as you would like to be so you have to carry up the game (which is not the games fault actually) [ i mean we all have our days ]\n-The systems changes a lot, about the mmr system, about the items or the perks (sometimes is op to use, the next is useless so you have to change your favorite strategy)\n\nBut there are so many advantages\n-New survivors and killer with new perks to play, new maps to learn and new skins to choose.\n-Several events and free stuff for new players\n-You have fun with custom games - or join full team against a random killer \n-You can have fun as killer killing a full team or random people (sometimes being on a team is not as good as it sounds)\n-Easy matchmacking, almost in the same levels\n\nWhat i would persnonaly like / dislike\n-I would love to see something different even as an event. For example many people abandoned the game because you do the same thing every time - You fix the gens or die - You run or die - mostly its just fixing and looping the killer. A different object would be fine, or something to change a bit the gameplay\n\n-I love the way you can swap perks between killers and survivors and use several strategies, items aswell, and having a friendly community (leave ggs after a game)\n\n-I dont really like the fact in the perk store you can buy perks from the free killer-survivor. After playing 200 hours you have unlocked almost all the free to play perks from either survivor or killer, os every week you have a chanche to get 2 DLC perks to buy\n\nTo sum it up. I love this game and i strongly recommended to someone, mostly because as a survivor its funny to play with familiar people, while as a killer you are always solo. Also the prices for the DLCs are very good (while for skins are a bit expensive). Have fun and Thanks for reading.
