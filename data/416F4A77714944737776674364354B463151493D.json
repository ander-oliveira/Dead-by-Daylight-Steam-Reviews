Don't buy this game unless you want to sink hundreds of hours into a buggy game to receive nothing back that rewards your time spent, where the developers don't listen to the fans, and just want you to spend money on cosmetics. You're better off spending your money on DBD 2 when that comes out since this game is getting outdated real fast, and doesn't do well comparatively to other online multiplayer games, especially with the amount of hacking outright ruining games.\n\n     Dead by Daylight (DBD) is an interesting game at its premise that fills a niche that not many games fill today in such a developed state. Perhaps it is due to the amount of time since it's release, or maybe the passion that the developers have for the game, but passion alone does not lead to a worthwhile product. The developers are slow to fix bugs in the game from audio, to visual or even to ones that affect game play. The sole exception to this is when there is a game breaking bug, which is to be the bare minimum for all multiplayer games. There are audio bugs where music cuts in and out for killer since their 4th year anniversary, a game play bug where if the killer swings with M1, a survivor might stop and do the picked up animation for no reason, or even ones where survivors might somehow get stuck \"inside\" a locker but cannot be removed by any means. Three examples is good enough; moving on. Let me mention that there is also a \"known bugs\" list included in the patch notes, that they haven't fixed, filled with more examples.\n     With the release of the newest chapter/DLC at the time of writing this being the All-Kill one there have been many gripes from the fans of the game, including content creators that have fallen on deaf ears. The killer in this chapter, \"The Trickster\" is much weaker than say some of the other killers, to the point that with players that have reached high rank, the killer will lose. However, this was not unexpected, as when the chapter came out on PTB, many people took note, yet instead the developers made him weaker, by removing the add-ons that made him better. We can use this to infer that the developers do not listen to fans, and just add in or change features that they THINK we as the player base would like (noises with flashlights from survivor side when the killer is blinded, and more graphics when you as the killer are blinded are other examples). After the release of the Twins, and all the bugs that came with it, I think I can speak for many people when I say that we probably expected more from the developers, in terms of quality of life changes. \n     The developers have even repeatedly pushed for an ELO system dispite their first attempt absolutely failing, while also failing to understand that only few killers are genuinely viable in higher ranks. What constitutes something as viable though? Well, since the game doesn't clearly define what a win is, it is whatever you want it to be! This is incredibly arbitrary and thus you might get toxic killers who face camp one survivor if that is their goal or survivors who actively chase after the killer and point out other survivors. The implementation of this \"advanced\" matchmaking system is likely a push to become a more relevant competitive game, when for this to work you need to have the killers each be capable on their own, with a static winning condition.\n     Something I think that DBD also ignores is rewarding the player for improving and getting better at the game. There still is not any seasonal rewards, as they had hinted at from [earliest forum post I could find was] Oct 2019, which was later confirmed to be an inconsequential amount of blood points, but nothing of substance. What happened to old games where if I poured time into a game I could unlock cool cosmetics that couldn't be bought? Answer: Companies can put cosmetics behind a paywall that forces you to play to get the things you want, to keep a player base. Let's also take a look at the price of cosmetics or characters, where all of them can be purchased with in cash transactions, yet the premium earned currency, Iridescent Shards, cannot be used to purchase some survivors, killers, or even cosmetics. The price of Iridescent shards to buy some cosmetic sets is more than what it costs to even buy the killer, which alone already took dozens of hours to grind and save up for. This kind of model is ultimately counter-intuitive to casual players who maybe just want to play a few games a night after getting home from work.\n     Now I get it, I sank +1000 hours into the game so it can't be that bad right? that's true, but I tend to think of this game as a ship with holes in the hull, which are either slightly fixed or ignored. What happens to the ship though? well it eventually sinks and likely remains at the ocean floor. The developers might have made the game work well up to a point, but with the current state, I wouldn't be too shocked to hear that they are starting or even have started development on a DBD 2, with a whole new engine, with a MUCH better anti-cheating system (I think mentioning this alone makes the point self-explanatory).\n\n                                                                   DON'T BUY THIS GAME!","timestamp_created":1617163176,"timestamp_updated":1617163176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89408596","author":{"steamid":"76561198912238251","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":18587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7427,"last_played":1657240355},"language":"english","review":"balls","timestamp_created":1617162932,"timestamp_updated":1617162932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89408270","author":{"steamid":"76561199002462689","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1656952285},"language":"latam","review":"adssadsad","timestamp_created":1617162320,"timestamp_updated":1617162320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89408101","author":{"steamid":"76561199147032310","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":332,"playtime_at_review":2659,"last_played":1659962454},"language":"english","review":"a good game","timestamp_created":1617161990,"timestamp_updated":1617161990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89408065","author":{"steamid":"76561199039122616","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1659883857},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏不错玩，只要屠夫不守我更好（TnT）","timestamp_created":1617161920,"timestamp_updated":1617161920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89407958","author":{"steamid":"76561198357871927","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":173039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1641,"playtime_at_review":103257,"last_played":1660458509},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏还不错  就是最近的版本人类有点弱了 最好找朋友一起玩 孤狼也很适合","timestamp_created":1617161718,"timestamp_updated":1617161718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485436886548995972","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89407868","author":{"steamid":"76561198049551601","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2977,"last_played":1626725727},"language":"english","review":"game is fun as hell to play over and over","timestamp_created":1617161527,"timestamp_updated":1617161527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89407831","author":{"steamid":"76561199081820200","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1619,"last_played":1652640950},"language":"english","review":"Great Game I did not think I would like it this much","timestamp_created":1617161463,"timestamp_updated":1617161463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89407768","author":{"steamid":"76561198141677445","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3089,"last_played":1618205307},"language":"english","review":"Wonderfully horrifying!

Gameplay is ALWAYS broken, and trust me, I have been playing this for years. It's always full of bugs, exploits and Dead by Daylight got one of the most toxic communities to play with(at least in my country, not sure if that is worldwide).\n\nBesides that, the game get really repetitive after sometime. Also, if you want to play as a killer, you'll face another problem: Survive With Friends(SWF) groups. The game is about the lack of communication, especially since you DON'T HAVE an in-game chat to communicate with other players as the match goes on. But some people doesn't seem to get this... and exploit the surviving mechanics with voice communication on discord, teamspeak, etc. That sucks, for real. Players on the other side of the map will be aware of what you're doing as a killer even without seeing you, just bcse someone is telling them by voice, wich totally breaks the atmosphere of non-communication the game offers. And as survivor, if you are fine with really shitty hitboxes where killers can land hits on you, even if they ACTUALLY didn't touch you AT ALL, well... if you're fine with that then this is your game! \n\nIf I could resume Dead by Daylight in a few topics, it would be:\n\nPROS\n- Fun to play casually with friends without taking it too serious.\n- You can play as some cool killers you might be obsessed with if you're a horror movie fan.\n\nCONS\n- Sucks to play as killer, survivors can AND will exploit communications if they are playing with friends.\n- Totally innacurate hitboxes(for real).\n- Matchmaking sucks. Players with bad ranks face players with high ranks all the time.\n- Lots of bugs and exploits.\n\nIn resume: If you want to play as a killer and take this game seriously, DON'T BUY THIS. But if you don't take it serious at all, give it a chance when it's on sale. If you want to play as survivor, I suggest you to get this on sale as well, a good one. But be warned!

Baştan aşağı mind game içeren bir kovalamaca oyunu kendisi, iyi oynamak tamamen tecrübe istediği için bolca oynamalı, oyunu bilen insanları izlemeli ve izlerken boş boş bakmak yerine gerçekten nasıl yakaladığını/kaçtığını öğrenmelisiniz. Genelde oyunu satın alan insanlar bu oyuna başladıklarında zorluk ve alışma süreçleri diğer oyunlara kıyasla daha uzun sürüyor, bunun sebebi kendi kanaatimce geçmişte böyle bir yapıma benzer bir şeye vakit harcamamış olmamız. Oyunun iyi yanlarını ve kötü yanlarını karşılaştırırsak: Oyunda fazlasıyla eğlenebiliyorsunuz fakat eğlenebilmek için oyunu gerçekten öğrenmeniz gerekiyor (5 kişilik arkadaş grubu ile oynamadığınızı varsayıyorum) ve bu vakit gerektiriyor. Katil ve hayatta kalan tarafında ''perk'' denilen Türkçe çevirisi ''avantaj'' olan şeylere sahibiz, bunlar oyun stilimizi ve oynayış tarzımızı tamamen değiştirmeye odaklayıp, oyundan alınan keyfi sanki başka bir oyun oynuyormuş gibi hissettirmesi ile ön plana çıkıyor. Bu bahsi geçen avantajları açmak içinse yeni katil ya da hayatta kalan açmak (çoğu seviye atlayıp oyun parası ile açılabiliyor) ve ardından her maç başı kazandığımız kan puanlarını bu karakterlere yatırmak belirli seviyelere ulaştırmak gerekiyor, ve bu gerçekten ve gerçekten çok zaman istiyor. Oyunda buglar var, 1 metre öteden hit yeme var, sunucuları sadece NA tarafında olduğu için Türkiye'den bağlanıyorsanız pinginizin 80 civarı olması çok yüksek, oyunda ''Avcı'' isimli katil balta fırlatıyor ve oyunun hitboxları inanılmaz kötü olduğu için çok saçma sapan şekilde hit yiyebiliyorsunuz (bunu özellikle buraya ekledim çünkü inanılmaz sinir bozucu bir durum) ayrıca oyunda ''Dead Hard'' isimli Türkçesi ''Kum Torbası'' olan bir avantaj sayesinde kısa bir ileri atılma ile katilden uzaklaşıp bir hitinden sıyrılma imkanını elde edebiliyorsunuz ve bu avantajın açıklamasında özellikle şöyle yazıyor: ''EYLEM SIRASINDA HASAR ALMAZSINIZ'' bu açıklamaya rağmen kum torbası sırasında çoğunlukla hasar alıyorsunuz, belki de oyunu 80 70 pingten aşağıda oynayamadığım için başıma geliyordur. Kısaca oyunu öneriyorum ama almak gibi bir düşünceniz varsa oyuna fazlasıyla saat harcamadan eğlenemeyeceğinizi bilmelisiniz, tabii yukarıda açtığım parantez gibi 5 kişilik arkadaş ortamı varsa herkes oyunu bilmediği için o durumda gayet eğlenilebiliyor.\nOynamak isteyenler ekleyebilirler memnuniyetle tanışırım :)","timestamp_created":1617156417,"timestamp_updated":1617156417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89404934","author":{"steamid":"76561198007742380","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":219316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1489,"playtime_at_review":157162,"last_played":1660604234},"language":"english","review":"The game itself is fun.
