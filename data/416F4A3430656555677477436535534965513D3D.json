That may come off as a bad thing but i dont see it that way. It has a very core function that the fun comes from mastering or at least finding new ways to go about it. It never really feels overly repetitive despite the fact you are essentially only going to be tasked with the same few task every match. I play solo so im always paired with randoms, that provides a nice little change up each match as i learn to adapt to different teammates play style.\n\nCore Gameplay aside this game is very \"haggard\", from very unpolished animations to some of the cringiest grunts and groans i've ever heard in a game it just has a very \"work in progress\" vibe all over it! It is not enough to make the game unplayable or even less fun but i am looking forward to further touch ups, which we've gotten some already that have helped a bit.\n\nPerformance is where it kinda gets iffy for me, im running 2x 980ti in SLI with an i7-6700k at 3440x1440 and i hover around 45-55fps. Usually i just crank down some settings to lock in 60fps, but even maxed out this game looks like a remastered ps3 game so any lower and we get into ps2 era visuals. Sure graphics dont make a game, but when its this low quality and still cant lock in 60fps on a 650$ GPU then that is a problem. \n\n","timestamp_created":1494784504,"timestamp_updated":1494784504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31753402","author":{"steamid":"76561198125741047","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14976,"last_played":1642116477},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, годный контент и сбалансированные перки и предметы инвентаря))\nДавай DBD, я за тебя!!!","timestamp_created":1494783018,"timestamp_updated":1511463782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31753374","author":{"steamid":"76561198376820455","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":25184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1534025166},"language":"russian","review":")))","timestamp_created":1494782960,"timestamp_updated":1494782960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469768494367599487","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31753354","author":{"steamid":"76561198049930284","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5489,"last_played":1575755552},"language":"russian","review":"Нравится выживать в данной игре.\nИ не дать выжить другим.\nАдекватная цена на доп. контент.\nНадеюсь, выжившие в дальнейшем не только мастерскими механиками останутся, а еще и побывают в других ролях.\n","timestamp_created":1494782900,"timestamp_updated":1494782900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31752923","author":{"steamid":"76561198065262670","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1049,"last_played":1510924514},"language":"tchinese","review":"大部分時間都在排隊","timestamp_created":1494781599,"timestamp_updated":1494781599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593348681926727295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31752864","author":{"steamid":"76561198152525506","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2944,"last_played":1539190023},"language":"russian","review":"Все пропало перезашел в игру и весь уровень со всех персонажей спал изчезло абсалютно все","timestamp_created":1494781386,"timestamp_updated":1494781386,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484803467988967896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31752764","author":{"steamid":"76561198154626291","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13042,"last_played":1648751630},"language":"spanish","review":"Entretenido y adictivo.","timestamp_created":1494781060,"timestamp_updated":1494781060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31752415","author":{"steamid":"76561198278339807","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1494461166},"language":"english","review":"1. environment is too dark for me.

Instead of slowly releasing killers and survivors, BHVR rushes to release DLC to increase the hype which unfortunately dies short once they are put in full release. There are no longer any powerful killers. I always played deathslinger but they nerfed his speed and ability so he is useless. Want to play myers? nope he has no chance of catching up to survivors who run in a straight line. Balance and master the game BHVR. I have put so many hours into this game and seriously want to see improvement.

It gives me this rush of hunting real human players when I'm killer and this fear and dread as survivor that games like Slender Man gave us. The DbD Team provides many free expansions to the game, something not so common with modern games, and the dlc they do charge is very affordable if you so choose to go that route. They listen to feedback and I have really enjoyed my nearly 300 hrs in this game. \n\nHowever this game is still unfinished and is always being balanced and fixed. That being said if you are looking to get this game I would recommend giving it a solid week of gameplay.

They make it so windows would get blocked after a little, pallets get broken faster, killers get a speed boost for being in a chase for so long... But there are things killers do, like Facecamping to get easy points, making a survivor lose points like nothing, so what the Devs do? nothing. \nReally, devs need to do something about these kind of things, because game is getting boring by the minute, I love the game, don't missunderstand me, but it has some little things that make someone a little less prone to play the game anymore.

That was around the time when the free nurse update came out. \n\nThen, just yesterday (I think?) a new DLC comes out for the crazy electro doctor and I decided to give it another shot, so I reinstalled and queued up as survivor. After a few games of suriving, I gotta say the game has become a lot more fun and balanced since the last time I played. I even ended up buying the Myers DLC because he's my favorite fictional serial killer of all-time and I have been having an absolute blast stalking and killing people as if I really was Myers himself. Sure, the game still has its fair share of bugs and balance issues, but as of right now that's not personally stopping me from having fun. However, do take my opinion with a grain of salt, because I'm still at ~18 rank in both survivor and killer, so that is subject to change as I get into the higher ranks. \n\nI have no real issues with connecting to a game although it can take some time depending on the time of the day. As far as specs go, I have a GTX 970 with an i5 2300 @2.8GHz 10GB RAM installed on my SSD. Not the best rig I'll admit, but the game runs pretty damn smooth aside from the occasional lag and hiccups. Keep in mind that you don't really have much control of graphics other than a preset menu (Low, Medium, High, Ultra) and your basic full screen, brightness, etc. Not the best optimized game but not a big deal for someone like me. \n\nFor $20? Honestly that's a pretty damn good price for the content that you're getting without the paid DLCs. If you DO decide to buy DLC, keep in mind that it is possible to test out those DLC killers/survivors in-game before purchase.","timestamp_created":1494721642,"timestamp_updated":1494721642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31736139","author":{"steamid":"76561198380763359","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":32120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2548,"playtime_at_review":2382,"last_played":1660605794},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlarınızla birlikte oynayınca çok güzel oluyor :D","timestamp_created":1494721183,"timestamp_updated":1494721183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40eeUgtwCe5SIeQ=="}
