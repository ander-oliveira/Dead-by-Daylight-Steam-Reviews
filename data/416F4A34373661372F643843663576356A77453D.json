Чем прекрасна эта игра? (Внимание,это лично моё мнение,я не пытаюсь никого оскорбить,обидеть и т.д.)\n1) Графика. Я лично не графикодрочер,и по этому как считаю я - Графика на высшем уровне.\n2) Задумка. Как таковая имеется,и реализована отлично! 4 против 1. Вы можете примерить на себя роль как жертвы,так и убийцы. Так же можете играть с друзьями или же против них.\n3) Система прокачки. Игра имеет свою систему прокачки,довольно таки неплохо реализованную.\n4) Геймплей. Геймплей продуман,сделан простенько,но \"На ура\".\n5) Персонажи. У всех персонажей есть свои особенности,навыки,умения,история.\n6) Цена (Да,я жирный еврей,ценю игры в основном по ценам). Цена даже очень хорошая для такой игры. Малая цена за шедевральный товар;\n\nНу а теперь к обратной стороне луны :\n1) Баги. Серьёзно,их тут настолько много,что с ума сойти можно. Большинство багов очень даже весёлые,но люди в основном смотрят на плохое. Смешные баги - Застрял в досках,мгновенно завёл генератор. Плохие - непрогруз,вылет (В основном зависит от вашего капухтера,но всё-таки хромает оптимизация). Бесящие - улетел под карту и умер,вылет с катки во время игры с другом,во время игры за маньяка выкинуло в меню,\"синхронизация со Steam Cloud\" (Кто сталкивался поймёт),баг ворот/генераторов.\n2) Community. Эту игру меняет комьюнити И ТОЛЬКО! Игра построена полностью на мультиплеере,оффлайн игры как таковой нет,по этому зависит она только от \"Населения\" этой игры. Сейчас всё подробно распишу\n     I) Играешь за маньяка,повесил выжившего : Проверил вокруг крюка,есть ли ему подобные - Кемпер. Прошёл мимо крюка с выжившим - кемпер. (Для тех кто не знает : кемпер - мразь,портящяя игру тем,что стоит прямо рядом с крюком,не давая спасать жертву другим жертвам,стоит прямо перед крюком,что вообще не даёт снять выжившего (Конечно это уже пофиксили,теперь крюк можно вращать на 180,но всё-равно,неприятно) и вообще мразь ужасная,не будьте такими.),да и вообще - одно \"неверное\" действие - клеймо кемпера на всю оставшуюся жизнь и -rep на стенку.)\n     II) Выжившие - в большинстве случаев если тебя повесили на крюк ты провисишь там пока тебя не сожрёт \"Сущность\". Спасать тоже не все умеют - Насрать что рядом маньяк гуляет по опушке,в 3 метрах от крюка,тебя будут снимать ценой ТВОЕЙ жизни,если тебя конечно успеют спасти. Если же нет - \"за плечо хвать,на крюк второй пошёл!\".\nБольше пока не буду писать про них,чего спойлерить,сами ощутите потом.\n     III) Ливеры - \"Бля,что за гавно игра,не могу поймать этих выживших,пока за этим \"кровавым\" гадо гонялся завели 4 генера,а я его даже не ударил. Пока гонялся ещё и капканы сломали,твари. ПОШЛИ ВЫ НАХУЙ!!! \" /leave.\n \"Сука,ебаный маньяк,как же ты меня так быстро поймал,всё,не буду с тобой играть! Чё за херня? Вроде на 20 ранге катаю,а такие сильные уроды мне хуи в очко пихают уже который раз,я уже очка и глотки не чувствую,ливну-ка я нахер,не могу играть,тем более катка идёт уже 10 секунд! Затянулось чёт.\" /leave\n \"Так,началась игра,я одержимость,так,ага,ебать,аааа,сука,поймали меня,ну ничего,ща проверку реакции пройду и свалю под шумок - \"Проверка реакции провалена\" - МЛЯЯЯЯЯЯ!!! \" /leave \n  И таких случаев дохера и больше.\n   IV) Фармеры. Пидоры в сговоре с маньяком / выжившим. Палят союзников,а сами потом делают съебейтен. А ещё они мрази. ;\n\n3) Баланс. Ну тут спорно. Ты ман 15 ранга,против тебя сурв 1 ранга. Вот и случай из статьи выше или проигрыш.\nТы выживший 16 ранга,против тебя престижный ман 1 ранга. Пизда тебе 1 словом.\n\n\n\n\nВ общем - то и всё. Игра очень классная,очень затягивает. 6 плюсов на 3 минуса. Игра 12 из 10.

This means that it can be played indefinitely. However, its simple community can easily be misinterpreted. Opposing players will generally reciprocate or escalate eachother's actions. If you are rude and boastful, the opposing player(s) will likely reciprocate your rudeness. And in the case that you are kind and sportsman-like, you will often be met with the same sportmanship. However, some people may be upset about losing and will respond to kindness with indifference (Which is still better than rage)\n\nI don't recommend this game to people who are overly boastful or easily angered. This community often vexes pride and weakness. No one likes being looked down on, and people like to poke fun at fragile personalities.\n\nIt's best to remain positive and sportsman-like to assure others that you see them as equals.

It is honestly one of the best games I have ever played so far in 2017. I must admit, it does feel like the killers that you could buy with real money seems kind of like a pay 2 win situation. The killers you can buy are way too over powered and I feel like they should be nerfed. Even though these problems seem pretty big it can't defeat how fun this game really is.  The purpose is too activate 5 generator and escape from the killers' grasps. You play with 4 other people(can be your friends), and you whole main goal is to survive and get out of the terrible and scary environment. Sometimes you will even maybe jump a little while playing this game and it sometimes leaves me sitting on the edge of my seat when the killer is chasing me. \n\nOverall this game is a blast to play with friends and just play in general. I do wish they would nerf the buyable killers but at this current state of the game it doesn't seem to bad, it may cause some frustration sometimes but in the end of the day you'll get over it. I would totally recommend this game, do not hesitate to buy it at all, it will probably be one the most fun games you will ever play. \n\nDear Devs, if you see this please take into consideration that the killers you can buy cause some frustration and they feel like they are pay to win sometimes, I know you guys probably won't see this but, if you do, please take it into consideration.\n\nOverall I give this game a 9/10 and I am looking forward to playing it even more.","timestamp_created":1511767526,"timestamp_updated":1511767526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37756224","author":{"steamid":"76561198167934068","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1571297328},"language":"koreana","review":"살인마들 너무 무서워서 손에 땀이난다\n특히 토끼 흥흥거리는거랑\n마스크 쓴놈 심장소리잘안들리는거 \n그게 젤무섭다","timestamp_created":1511767428,"timestamp_updated":1511767428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37756200","author":{"steamid":"76561198150257716","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":40945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18432,"last_played":1603574559},"language":"russian","review":"Топ игруля всем саветую!<3","timestamp_created":1511767396,"timestamp_updated":1511767396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37755923","author":{"steamid":"76561197967704687","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":111412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1086,"playtime_at_review":33444,"last_played":1660510085},"language":"english","review":"This game is a labor of love.","timestamp_created":1511767070,"timestamp_updated":1511767070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37755603","author":{"steamid":"76561198049902631","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1409,"last_played":1643325599},"language":"english","review":"If you like playing as a survivor with no means of defending yourself against broken killers and a future update that screws even more with the survivors, go on and give your money to the devs!

The que for survivors takes forever so once you get in a match you will probably get killed anyways but thats ok because its about the points, not surviving. Sure you get more points if you live but that just hurts when you hanging on a hook and the teamate could try  and save you, but they run off and escape through the escape hatch after you die....  thats more points. Rewards for being a bad teamate. So now all the people who make this game toxic are gonna complain that this review is stupid but it's not..... it's and honest review.

The intense moments you'll have while hiding, running and outsmarting killers are the best part of playing survivor.\n\nBeing killer is on the polar opposite. You are almost all powerful, with only the occasional pallet to slow you down in your hunt for your prey. Predicting what survivors are and will do is much of the game here, along with intense chases.\n\nOverall Dead by Daylight makes an amazing first time expirience, and while it doesn't neccesarily get better as you go it does hold its ground well enough.\n\nEdit: Now that I have played the game for more than 50 hours, here's what I think of it:\n\nAs many others have said, killers are not feared. They are simply along for the ride as survivors loop them into the ground, only to use crutch second chance perks in order to get away. It's only when a survivor screws up that the killer has a chance to get them.\n\nDoes this mean that playing survivor is easy? Not exactly. It's still up to the killer whether or not to tunnel you for the whole match, and ultimately there are only so many pallets you can throw.\n\nDoes all of this mean that Dead by Daylight is a bad game? I really don't think so. Even some 550 hours in, I still enjoy the game greatly. It's no longer scary to play survivor like it once was, but that doesn't make it not fun. The way I enjoy the game has changed. No longer am I tensing up when the killer gets near, but instead feeling great when I manage to save my team mate off of the hook, or juke a particularly good killer. Same goes for killer. It's not just about killing everyone, but doing what you want to get done. Someone looping you the whole match? Either leave them alone and try to get others, or count it as a win if you manage to tunnel them until their demise. 4 man swf Squadettes may be an utter pain in the ass, but when you manage to get them it's extremely satisfying.\n\nI still think that Dead by Daylight is an amazing first 50 hours, but whether you will enjoy it up into the 100's is really up to you.

Yes, I've looked at the tutorial, but it's still very difficult to play. If you're new, people with perks will just make the game way too hard to get into. Community tends to be very toxic as well. I've noticed a few bugs but they don't seem too bad.\n\nOne extra thing that irritates me is that when you are in a party, you can't stay with them once you exit to the lobby.\n\nThe good thing about this game, however, is that it has more depth than the average survivor game. There's a lot of customization for your bloodweb. The survivor perks are pretty unique. It's just not for me, though. The game takes way too long for beginners to even breach the skill floor. It's a massive information overload to try and understand everything about the best strategies, killers, perks, etc.\n\nToo bad there's only a \"yes\" or \"no\" recommendation setting, because I personally wanted to give it a neutral rating, but I've decided to hit \"No\" because dying and losing over and over just isn't fun.","timestamp_created":1511745394,"timestamp_updated":1511748196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505813956260681152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37736612","author":{"steamid":"76561198147274547","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":20364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":114,"playtime_at_review":2509,"last_played":1660505966},"language":"spanish","review":"el juego esta chidoris :v","timestamp_created":1511745181,"timestamp_updated":1511745181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37736142","author":{"steamid":"76561198212133473","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":68418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39665,"last_played":1657389317},"language":"english","review":"people that put a negative review are bad salty gamers.","timestamp_created":1511744699,"timestamp_updated":1511744699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501918196678161621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37735459","author":{"steamid":"76561198002982924","num_games_owned":532,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1537,"last_played":1512351599},"language":"english","review":"Could be a good game if it didn't use p2p connection.","timestamp_created":1511743980,"timestamp_updated":1511743980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37735416","author":{"steamid":"76561198093341375","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":37017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":1010,"last_played":1660591438},"language":"english","review":"Really fun game, most slashers make you want to be the killer and while the killers in this are all unique and fun, surviving is just as enjoyable.\nI have to recommend surviving with a friend or two though as it feels very isolated without  and can be frustrating.
