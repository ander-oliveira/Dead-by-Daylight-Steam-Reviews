Туннелинг от маньяков теперь еще легче чем раньше. Есть два выхода как получить наслаждение от игры: Взять всё на генраш и с пятой попытки против слабого мана выиграть. Либо же упасть в первую минуту игры и ливнуть не подарив очки маньяку. Подождать 5 минут. Повторить процедуру. Перки которые должны были формально заменить мету урезаны. Анимация спрыга с плеча от осколка  длящаяся 50% всего стана маньяка, который теперь всего лишь 3 секунды, и через полторы секунды ты снова лежишь не.
