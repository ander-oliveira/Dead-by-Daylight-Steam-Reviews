really fun asymmetrical multiplayer game offers plenty of tension as you try to avoid one of three Killers, each with unique abilities.\nHowever, one of the Killers is quite OP and that is the Wraith that has the ability to turn invisible through the use of a bell and can't be detected unless you've managed to unlock certain perks that enable you to detect him even while invisible, but he apparently is a lot weaker when you use the flashlight item against him so he's at least got one weak point that you can use against him.\nBut the other two Killers are quite fun and terrifying to go up against, especially the Hillbilly that's got a chainsaw which he can use not only for cutting down Survivors but also for getting around more quickly, plus it is rather fun playing as him and make people jump out of their seats as you come rushing towards them with the chainsaw.\nThere is however another bad thing about the game, or rather two, as there's no ingame chat nor any VOIP, if you want to play this with friends then you will have to use either Skype or Discord so that you can talk with them during the matches.\nAlso, you may encounter an error that says you couldn't join a match, a lot of DBD players have been having this issue for a while myself included and you could also end up in a match with a very laggy host, so be aware of that.\nBut aside from these issues, which most likely will get fixed in the future, it is a really fun game that is best played with friends.\n\nUpdate: They recently added a new map and a new Killer to the game as a free content update, an asylum and a former nurse that worked there.\nNow, the nurse have got the ability to blink around the map depending on how long you hold down the ability button, but she gets fatigued after doing so and must rest for a few seconds, unless you're quick enough to hit a Survivor just as you blink right next to them.\nAll in all, the game is still fun and the developers are posting patches with regular intervals to address issues like OP perks and whatnot.","timestamp_created":1471081442,"timestamp_updated":1472229546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485338330268859863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24879414","author":{"steamid":"76561198207357905","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":50610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19971,"last_played":1568527149},"language":"russian","review":"[h1] Некогда - любимое дитя, сейчас - всего лишь выкачивание денег [/h1]\n\nСразу упомяну, что я олдейший олд и играл почти с самого релиза в 2016 году. Тогда игра была страшной и захватывающей, она пугала меня своей атмосферой, я действительно боялся встретиться с врагом и прятался по всем углам, лишь бы остаться незамеченным. \n\nСуть игры проста: вы - выживший, который неизвестным образом попал в локация_нейм, на которой также бродит страшный убийца, вы должны заводить генераторы, чтобы открыть ворота и сбежать, спасайте раненых товарищей, которые находятся на грани смерти или же сбегите один - выбирайте с умом.\n\nВ игре есть система прокачки и множество персонажей, как и маньяков. В 2016 году их можно было по пальцам сосчитать. Каждый персонаж обладает тремя личными навыками и чтобы они появились у других выживших - нужно прокачать оного персонажа до обучающего перка. Всё просто.\n\nА теперь начинается негатив, ребятки. \n\nЭто уникальная игра, я не стану спорить, никогда не видел игр в подобном стиле и атмосфере. Фраза \"раньше было лучше\" не такая уж и неуместная здесь. В 2016 году игра была страшной, треки погони были напрягающими, а атмосфера давящей, во всяком случае, так мне казалось. Я взрослел с этой игрой морально и сейчас, окрепнув духовно, пройдя десяток других игр и навсегда забросив этот мусор я готов пояснить вам, что в этом произведении не так. Но вот то, что с ней делали многие годы это страшно, это ужасно. Та атмосфера начала пропадать, потому что появилось всё больше \"света\", я не знаю, как это можно правильно пояснить, но раньше она была более.. глубокой, что ли? Хорошо, подкину ещё больше негатива. Ладно первые маньяки, которые начали выходить: Майкл Майерс, Ведьма, Медсестра, но... Трюкач. Это что бл@дь такое? Дейв, ты вообще еb@нутый что ли? Вы вообще видели этого маньяка? У него плащ распахнут и видно кубики пресса, рыло смазливое, это гей, а не маньяк. Половина маньяков бездумно скопированы из сериалов и игр: Демогоргон, Кошмар, Каннибал и т.д.\n\nЯ понимаю, студии нужны деньги, чтобы развивать проект и так далее, но вы ведь только уничтожили все интересные фичи и добавили кучу душнярской бредятины вместе с клоунами-маньяками. А.. нет, самые настоящие клоуны это вы, Behaviour, спасибо, что испортили мои нервы и загубили проект 0/10.","timestamp_created":1471081232,"timestamp_updated":1638244558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24878878","author":{"steamid":"76561198289761736","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":199715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":115441,"last_played":1660304716},"language":"thai","review":"เกมนี้เป็นเกมที่ผู้พัฒนาม่เคยใส่ใจอะไรเลย มีบัคในตัวเกมก็ปล่อยมันอย่างนั้นไม่เคยคิดจะเเก้ จะเเก้ทีก็เเก้อันที่ไม่ตรงประเด็น  \nเอาเเต่เพิ่มชุดใหม่ เพิ่มคิลเลอร์ ปรับแมพใหม่ให้มันดูมืดกว่าเดิม เกมมันต้องการอะไรกันเเน่ ต้องการเอาเปรียบผู้เล่นงี้หรอ เเล้วก็เเบนมั่วด้วยนะ เราโดนเเบนไป 2 ไอดีเเล้วทั้งๆที่ยังไม่ได้ hack เลย.\n\nเป็นเกมที่กากที่สุดที่เคยเล่นมาละ","timestamp_created":1471079703,"timestamp_updated":1622123390,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514686167240142822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24878682","author":{"steamid":"76561198059248290","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1457,"last_played":1525593626},"language":"russian","review":"Очень много читеров в игре, надеюсь вы пофиксите это, а  то расхотелось даже в нее играть/\n","timestamp_created":1471079188,"timestamp_updated":1471079188,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24878256","author":{"steamid":"76561198257562454","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":65201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11540,"last_played":1650694296},"language":"english","review":"So, this game is fun.

For instance as you may have read in other reviews the whole window hopping issue has been completly nerfed to the point where it is gone. They have also added a good but still needs fixing survive with friends match making system. The one thing they need to fix is make the matching making system keep searching for matches. i have waited for 15 minutes just to get in a match and then the killer is a point farming wraith ;(. Another thing which you saw in the previous sentence is the point farming wraith's yes it is really good if you want to get bloodpoints but if you are like me and already have your perfect build of a survivor then this annoying system is very frustrating and game breaking. overall the gameplay is amazing and the constant updates keep me on my toes and wanting more perks and more killers and more

My only big problems is number 1. theres like no players who play the killer (A.K.A nobody hosts a match) either its cuz in my own opinion its more fun to play as a survivor or they think they are gonna get their asses handed to them. but it seems like if you find a killer its the one who puts you on a hook and then stands there, its almost like they think its a staring contest but the thing is that one of the contestents is actually on a meat hook and being devoured by some creepy spider forest thingy.\n\nhere is my list of killers you can find: 1. the one i just talked about. 2. the one who is actually giving you a chance by walking around and sometimes going after other people. 3. the one who is trolling and mostly just knocking you to the ground only to let you go so you can repair a generator. and lastly 4. the AFK (pretty self explaining... but i love to get those boldness points though) .... almost forgot i have to tell you the second thing that is bad.\n\nand here is my list of the other survivors you can find: 1. the beginner is the new players that dont know alot about the game and often fail skill checks (wich if you are new is really bad) he/she is often the guy/girl that i feel like i wanna help with generators and stuff but if i do i basically take suicide since if he fails on a generator either 1. we never get done. and 2. the killer comes and kills us. 2. the \"pro\" is the guy who is high level and doesnt fail a single skill check (most of the time) i dont like repairing with these dudes since i know there is no voice chat or chat at all  wich is nice cuz all i get if i repair with a \"pro\" and fail a skill check, im either met with him running across the map or just that friendly stare that means \"you just fucked up\". number 3. the guy who allways saves you from a hook (even if the killer is beside you) now this guy, makes my life either beutifull or a living hell since either he gets me of and i run away and get healed and escape, or the killer interupts wich means instant death if im struggling, or he pulls me of the hook only for the killer to slap me again and then i die. lastly number 4. these are not only one but 2-3 people who are in skype or what not that ONLY HELPS EACHOTHER. its like, im on a hook and the killer is on the other side of the map and they can easily help me, but nah man we gotta fix this generator, and by the time they're done the killer is back to check if anyone is near me. and then they say \"welp i guess we cant help you now since the killer is there, sorry\" ... i just want to punch these guys in the face. and its kinda funny since i often say that i want teamwork like nobody go alone and stuff, and they just like answer \"yeah sure why wouldnt we teamwork\" and then... they dont teamwork... cuz i dont call 2 guys running around while the other dies teamwork.\n\nnumber 2: its bugs and glitches. now, i know every game has them, but this game has some really game breaking ones for example my list of the most hated bugs and glitches: 1. getting stuck at the bottom of one of the hills (theres no reason to get stuck but you do...) 2. killer picks you up and you cant wiggle, he cant move, and you are stuck like that... fooooooreeeeeeveeeeer... or... you know?... the killer changes graphics and turns them back... or he just leaves... number 3. escaping from a hook yourself, but then ending up inside the hook and yeah... you either get killed or is stuck until you leave. lastly number 4. (this is mostly hated by killers or just me since i dont know how this glitch happens) this glitch involves me (or someone else) finding a glitched generator that is like 99.99999999999999999999% done. and you touch that baby and she revs up and shows the murderer where you are ( not in a bad way though since all generators do that) but yeah, i dont know how this is possible but i dont think its humanly possible to let a generator go at 99.9999999 (you get it)\n\nAll in all 10/10 is my rating since i think that if the creators can get more support and stuff like that so they can fix all the glitches, the only thing we need is more players (specifically killers) so yeah, that was my opinion of the game.","timestamp_created":1471045234,"timestamp_updated":1477962849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24863922","author":{"steamid":"76561198041488383","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":242514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81640,"last_played":1658775319},"language":"english","review":"I used to recommend this game but after 2 years I finally changed my mind.

Some of the issues I mentioned in my original review below have been solved, many new bugs have popped up. That's just how it goes unfortunately. The game is better than it was, but still has a long way to go. I'm not giving up hope just yet.\n\nThis is honestly one of the most fun games I've ever played. It's something completely new that's never been tried before, which is great, but also really bad. They're programming their way into uncharted waters and it shows. The game is riddled with bugs, lag, and half-finished features. It still plays like a beta version and doesn't feel complete.\n\nI still recommend the game because I've seen it grow and improve before my own two eyes. Every single patch the game gets better and better. I truly believe that with time the majority of bugs will be ironed out and the various imbalances will be balanced. The exploiters and hackers will be stopped and the unfinished features will be finished. It just takes time.\n\nI would honestly recommend buying the game right now, but I would understand your uncertainty. So instead just follow the game, keep up with the patch notes, and see for yourself as the game improves as time goes on. Then buy it. If it's worth 150 hours of my time now, it'll be worth 10 times more than that 3 months from now.","timestamp_created":1471037071,"timestamp_updated":1480000196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516372799873352051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24858694","author":{"steamid":"76561198043409682","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1471904009},"language":"english","review":"Between the camping killers, the high amount of glitches and all of the other Bulls***.

There should be a better map selection and no needed to remember the recipe cook book to play the maps you like or enjoy... \n\nThe matchmaking is very unstable and it takes very much time, one have to press the \"join\" button like a frenzy, in order to join a server.  This take almost 95% of the game time, just waiting to find 4 other people to play with. Impossible to start a game, constant error on loading screen, take ages to load a game, constant kick out of lobby for no reason, worse graphics since they upgrade the engine. \n\nThe gameplay has many irritating bugs, and the developers needs a lot of improvements when it comes to more crisp graphics, the sound has improved and you can use the sound to your advatages as an killer or a surviour.  The progression tree has become better, but yet all the surviours seem to have same abilities. Odd point rating system. Bad matchmaking system that doesn’t work as it should. \n\n\nWhile some people may enjoy hours of entertaining tension in Dead by Daylight, I think the vast majority of players will struggle to find any replay value as the game always gives very similar looking environments, and repetitive objectives, eventually take it will take a toll on you as a gamer. You will get tired of starting up generators and finding gates. \n\nA huge frustrating factor is the developers of the game, ALWAYS release new content, without any prior effort to actually buff the visual effect nor taking under the consideration the numerous bugs this game have gotten during the many constant updates from the dev team.\n\nThe extra DLC do bring different maps, surviours and killers but no different gameplay and seeing how this game is progresseing it may end up llike Payday 2.

When I bought it I didn't expect that much from it to be honest. But now that I played it a lot I have to say it is pretty impressive. This horror multiplayer game is such an amazing idea. I really don't play horror games that much but this one is something different. I really enjoy the idea of being a Killer that slaughters every survivor or at least thats the goal. Or playing as a survivor and trying to escape from a death sentence :)\nIN A FEW WORDS - FUN, DARK, COMPETITIVE.\n\nThings I really like:\n-4v1 Competitive Horror Multiplayer Game\n-Being a Killer and trying to slaughter all the survivors (atm there are only 3 killers - trapper,hillbilly&wraith)\n-Being a Survivor and trying to escape from hell basically (atm there are only 4 survivors - dwight,meg,claudette&jake)\n-Having a rank system from 20 to 1 , 1 being the highest one.\n-Maps are generated differently everytime which means only landmarks will be in the same position the rest is random.\n-Every match is different so it doesn't get that repetitive.\n-A lot of different perks and addons you can use for your killer/survivor build.\n-KILL YOUR FRIENDS - the ability to make a private lobby invite your friends and kill them :p\n-SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS - the ability to start a ranked game with 3 of your friends.\n-And I really like that they update the game often to fix the problems and also add new content.\n\nThings I don't like:\n-The game is a bit too grindy I would say.\n-Matchmaking is an issue if you want to play SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS - it takes 10+ minutes to find a game.\n-Some of the perks that are in-game are that bad that nobody ever uses them.\n-No timer for matches. So if a survivor wants can keep the killer hostage in the game until someone disconnects.\n-A few minor bugs that will probably get patched sooner or later.\n\nOVERRAL THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND IT COSTS ONLY 20$ SO GET IT NOW AND ENJOY IT !","timestamp_created":1471029868,"timestamp_updated":1471029868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24852139","author":{"steamid":"76561198044909608","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":21894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5045,"last_played":1658375016},"language":"english","review":"This is definitely my favorite purchase of the summer and I've clocked about 82 hours as of this review, with 32 in the last two weeks. There's something about this game that just is so interesting. Each game feels different as the killers set t he pace. Being a survivor, you have the option to be stealthy and try never to get found in game or a team player who opts to distract the killer and save teammates from their death. If you ever get bored you can transition to the role of the killer and try to hunt down as many people as you can to blow off some steam. There are plenty of great experiences I've had, assuming that I was perfectly safe only to get attacked and scream quite loudly or murder people in pleasure.\nAs for the bad, because this is an only multiplayer game, so some people will decide to be \"friendly\" in order to farm points (which will hopefully be fixed in the future) or you may have disconnecting survivors. The lobby queue system could also use work but the devs are very active in listening to problems and address them in a weekly stream.\nTl;dr Very interesting and unique game that takes hide and seek to a new level, and will most likely cause people to have a lot more good moments than bad. Definitely worth $20 if willing to deal with bugs/glitches.","timestamp_created":1471029676,"timestamp_updated":1471029676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24851944","author":{"steamid":"76561198048054941","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":24141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1655443836},"language":"english","review":"broken","timestamp_created":1471029424,"timestamp_updated":1471029424,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24851753","author":{"steamid":"76561198196326934","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":52820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1719,"last_played":1659322758},"language":"english","review":"The best 20, i have spent, this game is non-stop fun when your a killer, the only part i dun like when you are the killer is how fast they jump out the windows and how slow the killer has to walk around objects.\ni had to chase the last person for 20 minutes until i figured out a plan to take him out, with the chainsaw.   to many obstacles that you have to get around when you jump out of window, makes player almost like a ferret, slippery, can get out of sticky situations with the killer,\n\nOverall i would give this game a 9/10","timestamp_created":1471029234,"timestamp_updated":1471029234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24851572","author":{"steamid":"76561198138495926","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":35340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2361,"last_played":1640473738},"language":"german","review":"Hat zwar noch den ein oder anderen Bug (wenn man mit Freunden spielt muss man ewig warten) aber darüber kannman hinwegsehen.\nIm großen und ganzen ein gutes und Unterhaltsames Spiel","timestamp_created":1471029065,"timestamp_updated":1471122268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24851545","author":{"steamid":"76561198027363082","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1213,"last_played":1647743079},"language":"english","review":"Great game, I love it.
