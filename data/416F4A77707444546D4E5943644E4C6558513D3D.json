Оригинальная идея казалась невоплотимой, начиная от общей механики игры и заканчивая различными мелочами. Игру я купил по чистой случайности, друг уговорил, и ни чуть не пожалел о покупке.\n\nВ начале, честно говоря, было не по себе, я постоянно ходил вдоль стенки на корточках, побаивался маньяка и редко нормально мог попадать в мини-играх, но буквально через несколько часов игры ко многому привык, и даже маньяк перестал быть чем-то страшным. \n\nВ игре приятная, качественная графика, при этом игра не слишком требовательная. Игровая механика не сложная, однако, что бы начать хорошо играть, придётся понять некоторые тонкости и изучить кое-какие основные тактики.  Игра на удивление не приедается и не надоедает даже после многих часов геймплея (лично мне точно). Честно говоря, в игре еще есть некоторые шероховатости, однако разработчики активно трудятся над улучшением игры. Доказательствами этого могут служить стримы разработчиков (да и вообще их наличие) и часто выходящие патчи.\n\nИтог: уникальная в своем роде игра, не имеющая пока что нормальных аналогов, с достойной графикой и приятным геймплеем. Подтверждением того, что игра хорошая и интересная, может стать активность сообщества проявленная к Dead by Daylight. Лично я, ничуть не жалею о недавней покупке, и хочу сказать, что игра полностью стоит своих денег.","timestamp_created":1469777577,"timestamp_updated":1479932663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":159,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.86649399995803833","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24590793","author":{"steamid":"76561198151851825","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":80023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":383,"playtime_at_review":9288,"last_played":1660268909},"language":"english","review":"My spacebar is now missing   (EDIT)\n\n\nAfter coming back to the game since the RE: chapter I cant say I wanna continue to play the game.

The survivors can simply disarm traps or wiggle off of the hooks which makes all the time you put into catching them wasted. Ranking up has no real value as you don't get to really keep any of the perks plus the survivors become way too overpowered after awhile so those perks become useless.

And I have to say, they have adressed nearly all of the issues I had with the game since then. Though the game isn't perfect, most of its problems stem from the community, which is much better than just having a broken game.\n\nThere's not a whole lot of in game glitches. They happen from time to time, but I haven't gotten stuck in a wall/hook since October of last year, which is a major improvement from the game at the start. Also, a system has been put in place to try to catch cheaters and to report people who engage in toxic behavior. THE DEVS ARE LISTENING!\n\nThough I question the pricepoints of the DLC packs, I have to say that I'm impressed with how much the devs are pumping out good content for the game. Aside from the whole second chapter, every single one of them has been of high quality (in fact they keep getting better). And on top of that, the devs have stated that they are going to redo the entire swamp map and have buffed the hag since release to make her not entirely useless.\n\nI can't say how glad I am that I stuck with this game. Though I have to say if you do go to buy it, be prepared for a somewhat toxic community. There are issues with the game like I said, but again, most of them come from the community. Though it sucks and I don't always have a good tiem with the game when I play it, I don't think it's fair to fault the developers for it.\n\nOh and the 1.5 update optimized the shit out of the game so that it actually runs well on my card even on bigger maps :D\n\nOverall, I give it like a 7/10.

The game INFRASTRUCTURE feels very much so like a beta. To clarify, games are hosted by the killer. This means that the connection and latency are determined by a peer to peer connection instead of a stable server wide host that maintains a universally smooth experience. The RANKING system in my opinion is terrible and leaves much to be desired. The ranking is based off of points instead of purely objective based merit. This means that sacrificing 2-3 players as a killer doesn't guarantee you enough points to rank up if you don't chase them enough, or attack them enough times, or use your killer secondary mechanic enough. (Survivor point of view - If you are running the killer around distracting the killer while your team repairs generators and then you all escape in most cases that survivor won't net enough points to gain a rank because you didn't repair enough generators even though you played an integral part in helping your team escape.) The 3rd con that I really feel is a major issue at the moment is the overall bloodweb experience in the game which equates to a talent system. That poor ranking system I referenced gives you bloodpoints based on the points you accumulate during the game and then you spend them in this \"talent tree\" to gain add-ons, perks, and items that you can use in the game to modify your game experience accordingly. The values of many of the \"picks\" are very boring, and don't really feel as worth the investment in many cases. There are also many perks that are lack luster in favor of others considering you may only pick 4.\n\n[U]TLDR:[/U]\n[list]\n[*]Bad hosting / Connection System [Hosted by killers]\n[*]Awful ranking system that really doesn't determine skill when you see player rank [Opinion]\n[*]Bloodweb needs an overhaul on values / choices. Point gains and accumulation should be looked at/modified\n[/list]\n\n\n[B][H1]Pros:[/H1][/B]\nI literally have played like 70 hours of this game in only 4 days. For me, this game is one of those games that hooks you and then keeps you addicted for many many hours and days. It's very challenging and has progression over a multitude of characters and has very interesting lore and unique gameplay aspects that no other survival horror game offers I.E (Asymmetrical 1v4 experience and a CHOSEN cooperative experience just to name a few.) The devs haven't personally reached out to me even though I've contacted them on several occasions with questions or feedback which is unfortunate but i'm sure many have done the same. During the twitch streams they do once per week currently they seem to at least listen to some community feedback regardless of whether they seem to value it. The game has received as far as i'm aware 3-4 patches in only a months time and some days which is very good news for the player base. The studio has mentioned on a few occasions that they are in it for the long haul (\"marathon\") and will continue to make improvements to the game as time goes on. In a nut shell, for a game priced at $20.00 I can promise that you have plenty of entertainment with this game to warrant a twenty dollar purchase and many more hours after that. With a game that has obviously been packed with many hours of love, passion, and many sick minds, Dead By Daylight is definitely one to try for $20.00. \n\n[U]TLDR:[/U]\n[list]\n[*]Buy the game\n[*]Buy the game\n[*]Addicting Gameplay\n[*]Versatile ways to play\n[*] Great lore / Vivid graphics\n[*]Unique gameplay\n[*]Frequently Updated\n[*]Weekly twitch stream from Devs\n[*]Worth a $20.00 investment\n[*]Reaper VX's Seal Of Approval\n[*]Buy the game\n\n[I]Seal of Approval is very hard to achieve![/I]","timestamp_created":1469719808,"timestamp_updated":1469720694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24577154","author":{"steamid":"76561198099023200","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":14286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7575,"last_played":1642326382},"language":"schinese","review":"玩起来很爽，但是这次外挂玩家明显减少。但是有不少改存档的作弊玩家，还需要加大力度。官方的中文翻译虽然出了，但是做的不够仔细，在切换简体中文后出现数字没有对上列表，翻译错误等等。这是让人很恼火的事情。\n\n\n\n2018.4.1更新评论\n今天忽然想回来玩一下，重新下载了游戏，发现以前的存档全都没有了！！！全部都没有了！！！还没有补偿！","timestamp_created":1469719729,"timestamp_updated":1522572867,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24577107","author":{"steamid":"76561198051324152","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":3376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1908,"last_played":1564595012},"language":"english","review":"1.buy dead by daylight deluxe edition\n2.play on patch 1.0.1 till patch 1.0.4\n3.delete dead by daylight becuz this patch is trash\n4.cry a lot\n\n0.1/10 never trust dev again","timestamp_created":1469719569,"timestamp_updated":1469719569,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451674044132232666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24577051","author":{"steamid":"76561198145361194","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2133,"last_played":1640714162},"language":"russian","review":"10 НАЙТИ ВЫЙТИ/10","timestamp_created":1469719349,"timestamp_updated":1469719349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492307692766189575","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24577038","author":{"steamid":"76561198142207149","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1630951456},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight-Одна из классных игр про маньяка!\nВ игре находятся 4 выживающих и 1 маньяк, у каждого из них своя роль.\nЗадача выживающих-активировать 5 генераторов,разбросанных по всей карте,\nчтобы открыть двери и выбежать с закрытой территории,на которой находится маньяк,который должен \nпоймать всех выживших и обездушить их или пока они не умрут.\nИгра подойдет для игры с друзьями ,как и одному. +REP","timestamp_created":1469719305,"timestamp_updated":1469719305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515091180801391602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24576606","author":{"steamid":"76561198321248903","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":18559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1599370888},"language":"thai","review":"ปับการกระตุกหน่อยคับ","timestamp_created":1469717975,"timestamp_updated":1469717975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24576484","author":{"steamid":"76561197994275385","num_games_owned":1136,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":13551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13082,"last_played":1558983478},"language":"english","review":"Когда-нибудь здесь сделают нормальный матчейкинг.

later in the game\n- Hillbilly being able to chainsaw you through certain walls on occassion \n- No ping limiter, which means extremely laggy killers being the host who in turn pick the Trapper to take advantage of it \n- Losing pips if the killer disconnects & deranking if your game decides to crash\n- Absurd lag during skill checks \n\nI honestly enjoyed this ranking up as the survivior in the beginning (rank 10) but eventually you get fustrated because there is nothing you can do as a survivor once all the pallets are dropped to defend yourself from the killer if you decide to try & get atleast 12k points for a rank pip.\n\nJuking them is nearly impossible when the higher ranks have perks that can alert them to when youre nearby so this game is purely based on luck as the survivor.\n\nOntop of that certain defense items like the flash light dont work as intended. \n\nThe devs and half of the community approve of the killer constantly being buffed, if you plan on strictly playing the killer then this game is for you. \n\nOtherwise just avoid it, its not worth your time and fustration considering your rank gets reset every
