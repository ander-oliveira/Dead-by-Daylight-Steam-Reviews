And so, I started taking breathers at the end of every game, and stopped stressing as hard over every single thing not going my way. Hell, started just not taking the game seriously and actually had more fun with it instead of acting like I was inclined to win every single match and oooh how dare the opposing team not do what I want them to do grrr.

Killers were already OP but survivors could win. Now killers are gods and survivors have really no chance.\n\nI gave it some more time to evaluate the game since the update:\n\nI watched a developer live game play, just leisurely chasing survivors and mocking them as he hooked them... He showed no skill, meanwhile the survivors have to work so hard to stay alive. He laughed at the idea of survivors getting tunneled and acknowledged that it's probably going to happen more.\n\nKillers have everything handed to them and can have a leisure time playing while the survivors can't. It takes no skill to be a killer but all the skill is in the survivor and the killers whine. the developers are pro killer and cater to their cries. It's not about the skill of a killer, for there is no real skill being one.\n\nBoons are totally useless, since it takes time to find the totems and time to set up your boon. But the killer can just walk up to them and kick them with no real effort... Totems are easy to find by the killer, so if you want to lay boons, that's all your going to be doing for a great part of the game, gens are more important. Boon totems should take time for the killer to take out, not a single stomp and walk away.\n\nI love challenges, before the update it was a fun challenge. Now it's not fun anymore, the challenge that mainly ends in your death, even being skilled, rarely wins anymore. It's no fun to have everything stacked against you, to the point that you're like a rat in a maze that does all it can to get out, you lose hope and give up.","timestamp_created":1658268147,"timestamp_updated":1659395828,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119097871","author":{"steamid":"76561198447934115","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":460,"playtime_at_review":4414,"last_played":1660601037},"language":"english","review":"this game genuine angers me but at the same time manages to bring me enjoyment somehow 10/10 would recommend\n","timestamp_created":1658267800,"timestamp_updated":1658267800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119097196","author":{"steamid":"76561198045913750","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":39396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39396,"last_played":1658261945},"language":"english","review":"positive:\n- it is(was) fun and challanging to fullfill the dailies and try to survive\n- well there are content that can be bought or earned and they update them regularly/at least until now.\n- not pay2win.\n\nnegative:\n- no reactions to reports --> I mean NONE! not by the killers or by the players.

Before the update I had most of the characters at level 40 which gives you the teachables for each of their 3 perks so other characters can learn them through the blood web. Now, you get all 3 perks from a character unlocked for every other character just by prestiging them (getting 50 levels) but only at level 1, in order to get level 3 for the perks you need to prestige them twice more for a total of 150 levels..... that's 110 levels more in order to unlock level 3 perks on all your characters and it's just absolutely ridiculous. For the experienced players that already had every DLC bought and all the characters unlocked this just means they'll need to do the 150 levels on all new DLC characters that are released but for us lowly mortals with less than 500-1000 hours played before this update we now need to get 110-150 levels on every single character, including the DLC ones that we may or may not own.\n\nUnless they revert large portions of this update I really can't recommend this game to anyone. If you buy this game, which is already mostly filled with people who have played it for years and are far more experienced than you are, not only will you have to deal with the harsh learning curve, the crazy amount of DLC that you're strongly encouraged to buy just to have access to all the game content, and grinding out millions upon millions of blood points just to get to level 40 but now you need to do more than triple that just to get level 3 perks on the characters you actually care about playing.","timestamp_created":1658261802,"timestamp_updated":1658261802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486961543560028076","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119092072","author":{"steamid":"76561199170286876","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10350,"last_played":1658261177},"language":"english","review":"DDD","timestamp_created":1658261306,"timestamp_updated":1658261306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119092027","author":{"steamid":"76561199040237860","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":749,"playtime_at_review":8803,"last_played":1660522522},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego como killer, aun que muchos trolls y gente toxica la verdad.","timestamp_created":1658261256,"timestamp_updated":1658261256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119091884","author":{"steamid":"76561198090930585","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1658261011},"language":"english","review":"Absolute trash game unbalanced as fuck.

First of all, this is a TEAM game to escape the killer however, there are NO WAYS OF COMMUNICATION except discord if you play as a group.  Solo Queuing is a joke and you're least likely to survive.  There's no pinging or in-game communication.  Not only that, they buffed killers.  Killers already have their special abilities ontop of perks, they are faster and now to outrun a killer is impossible.  Youre only able to do a \"360\" skill to outrun them.  Theres no point of hiding in closets and you can be hit mid vault.  The pallets are also quicker to be broken down.  Not only that, survivors now have to take a longer time on generators however they need to stay there for 90 seconds because the regression rate is high especially when they hit it.\n\nKillers benefits:\nspecial abilities\nfaster running\npallet breaking faster\nperks, not debuffed\ngenerators regress faster, slower for survivors to fix\n\nSurvivors benefits:\n5-15minutes of getting killed or fix generators.. and getting tunnelled or camped. :)\n","timestamp_created":1658260284,"timestamp_updated":1658260284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467935234308242798","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119090781","author":{"steamid":"76561198352791807","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2317,"last_played":1658968106},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo maravilhoso para jogar com amigos","timestamp_created":1658259904,"timestamp_updated":1658259904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119090577","author":{"steamid":"76561199103097429","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":59056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1965,"playtime_at_review":55764,"last_played":1660582605},"language":"polish","review":"Nie istnieje bardziej wkurzająca gra od tej, plus twórcy gry mają gdzieś graczy i idą im w większości pod górkę, utrudniając i psując to co nie potrzebuje zmian.
