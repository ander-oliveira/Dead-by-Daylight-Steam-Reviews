They add more content than they fix, and continue to let problems fester. \n\nUpdates are super unoptimized, with an update that would take a normal game 10 minutes taking well over an hour. The public test builds are an absolute fucking joke. Bugs, glitches, and features that blatantly don't work make their way into the main game, where they fix them maybe a few weeks later, maybe a few months. \n\nMassive power level difference between killers, which is amplified by some killers having absolute dog shit add-ons, and others having ones that turn them into gods. \n\nJust hold W as a survivor and 80% of killers just lose the game. The only skillful thing you can do as a survivor is loop, and most of the time, it's not the optimal thing to do, and some killers completely negate this.\n\nSurvivors are encouraged to bring Exhaustion perks, further exemplified by the recent change to Dead Hard, which makes it so when you would have gotten a hit, they scream as if going down, then proceed to run away. These perks make the meta of holding W even stronger.\n\nmeta Generator Slowdown perks are literally required for killer unless the survivors are making mistakes, and can become oppressive with certain builds.\n\nMMR has made it so every game is a lose-lose. Did you escape or sacrifice three survivors? Now you get to go against better survivors who might completely stomp you. Did you die or get 0 - 1 kills? GG EZ Baby, git gud. \n\nDevs literally don't listen to the players. It took them a couple of years to fix how broken Spirit was, how underwhelming Trapper was, how bad pig was (Who now got a buff... With the rework of add-ons...). \n\nThe grind is so BS, and is even greater on the killer side. As a survivor, you can easily get all perks on your favorite survivor. Hell, in 1130 hours, with four level 50 survivors, I have two survivors with all of their perks. I currently have 0 killers with all of their perks, which is the side where perks have a bigger impact. You get about two perks for every 88,000 blood points spent (according to an online source with lots of data). With a cap of 1,000,000 total bloodpoints in your inventory, and a cap of 32,000 with perks or add-ons, you get an average of 1 perk every game. Daily challenges will get you barely half a blood web, and with the tome, you can get a nice amount of extra blood points, but it's not nearly enough to be worth it.\n\nI constantly have to take months off from this game, because it gets so frustrating seeing how little the devs care, how broken the game is, how the experience of killer has been going slowly downhill, and survivor hasn't been improving much at all either, and some may argue has been going downhil (although the last few patches, as of the review, introduced boons, hit reg Dead Hard, and some perk buffs for both sides). Also, the most fun way to play survivor, with friends, literally breaks the game, tipping the scales in the survivors favor. There's no good way to balance it, so nothing can be really done with it except buff solo-que's without buffing teams, which is nearly impossible. \n\nI can't recommend a game where the devs care so little about the game, and constantly miss the mark on what the community wants. The only good thing about this game is the art department, whose always on point.","timestamp_created":1636666889,"timestamp_updated":1636666889,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56301194429397583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102612209","author":{"steamid":"76561198176335298","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":5332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4888,"last_played":1655555817},"language":"english","review":"Best game to Rage bad losers.\nIf you win with the Killer, 90% of the time you will be called by a tunneler or a camper.","timestamp_created":1636666846,"timestamp_updated":1636666846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102611967","author":{"steamid":"76561199086641597","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5939,"last_played":1653774367},"language":"spanish","review":"que buen servicio :v","timestamp_created":1636666533,"timestamp_updated":1636666533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102611760","author":{"steamid":"76561199121944431","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3249,"last_played":1654876405},"language":"russian","review":"Очень токсичное комьюнити.\nМного багов \nИгра буд-то в бете!\nНекоторые игроки даже не понимают что им делать.\nКонкурентов этой игре нету, только из-за этого могу посоветовать поиграть в неё.\nНо будьте готовы что будете играть с токсиками!

The devloper does not care in the slightest about everyone having fun, they only care about the survivors having fun. (On higher skill level) SWF Groups will just bully and taunt you to the point you genuinely hope they are un-alive in real life. The grind to get perks and items is horrible and heavily RNG based, balance among killers is completely neglected. Maps are complete dogshit gameplay wise.\n\nIf you have 4 friends and just want to have fun in private matches it can work I guess but please, if you decide to buy this game, do not try to get good. Being good or even just decent like me takes out the fun COMPLETELY. Oh yeah and it takes hundreds of hours to get kinda decent at the game.\n\nThis game is like a drug and I mean that in the worst way possible. It (or more specifically the players) hurt you physically and mentally, leave you exhausted and deranged. And the dealer has no intention of fixing that but you just can't quit completely.","timestamp_created":1636654582,"timestamp_updated":1636654582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102602313","author":{"steamid":"76561198427506335","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1658534335},"language":"english","review":"Nice Graphics, Good detail and nice Lore.
