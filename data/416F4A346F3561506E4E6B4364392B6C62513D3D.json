It's a fun game, it's a cool concept, and it serves it's purpose, however I keep running into a main menu game breaking bug that forces me to exit the game and restart it. That, and a bug that throws me out of online lobbies are things I can't help but think other people are experiencing too.

There's not many other games that can effectively scratch the need to play hide-and-seek like this game does. There's so many things it gets right, and if you're a fan of horror movies like I am, you'll be thrilled at the little moments the game gets right: being chased by an unstoppable killer, desperate for some help or relief (or being the one doing the chasing).\n\nObviously, this would be a huge, stonking thumbs up if everything else bar the gameplay was in place- which it just isn't.\n\nThe matchmaking and lobby system for DBD is absolutely horrendous, and will be the true thing you'll be struggling with constantly, rather than a killer. You'll get into lobbies, only to be unceremoniously kicked or crashed to your desktop. You'll connect into a game and the killer will instantly drop. Sometimes the game won't give you the pleasure of letting you know a queue's failed for some random reason and you'll just be sitting there with your mates twiddling your thumbs in the lobby.\n\nLong loading times abound, endless loading screens as well. This is a well-reported issue to the DBD devs, judging by older reviews from Early Access, and remains unfixed.\n\nIt pains me to say don't buy this, but it's the only fair response. Until the networking issues are fixed, this is a flawed gem, with all the caveats that come with it. Keep it on your wishlist, check the discussion forums/Reddit or whatever takes your fancy, and pick it up when it's fixed- if that ever happens.\n\nAlternatively, the Friday 13th game is on the way, and if that isn't a buggy mess on launch it's likely going to kick DBD into the dust, so I'll see you there.","timestamp_created":1482747375,"timestamp_updated":1482747375,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28665727","author":{"steamid":"76561197991505696","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":29743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3715,"last_played":1600353917},"language":"italian","review":"adoro

в своём жанре проект, который уже нашёл своё место под солнцем и обзавёлся армией фанатов. В ней есть всё, присущее жанру \"слэшер-хоррор\": огромные свирепые маньяки-мясники и паранормальные сущности, мрачные атмосферные локации со своей историей, и шкафчики! в которых любят посидеть пугливые людишки. Так же стоит отметить уникальную (извините за тавтологию) систему геймплея в виде починики генераторов и умерщвления выживших с помощью жертвенных крюков, и именно из-за своей уникальности игра стоит свеч! Она не идеальна, в ней есть множество косяков и багов, которые разработчики нехотя стараются исправлять, но лично со мной они случаются крайне редко и вряд ли нарушают игровой баланс.[/i]\" - так я думал изначально.\n\nНо для меня эта игра стала неоднозначной. Неплохая задумка, но ужасная реализация убивает её в моих глазах. Постоянная игра в хороводы с маньяком из раза в раз быстро может наскучить и утомить, а кривой движок и соединение заставят вас не раз негодовать от ударов сквозь доски, окна и несколько метров безопасного расстояния. Проект, задумывавшийся как слэшер-хоррор плавно перебрался в простой экшОн, способный разве что насмешить и повеселить игроков, нежели напугать.\nИгра обладает достаточно высоким порогом вхождения, из-за чего новичкам будут довольно тяжело осваивать игровые механики, тайминги и движения. (А некоторым даже будет казаться, что маньяки чрезмерно сильны, и их надо ослаблять 😆).\n\nНа момент обновления обзора этот проект переживает не лучшие годы. У разработчиков явно наступил творческий кризис, ибо, создавая новый контент, они паразитируют на популярных культурах с целью привлечения новых игроков, и в то же время даже не пытаясь прислушаться к \"старикам\" и удержать их. Но правда такова, что эта игра для настоящих олдов! Для тех, кто в ней с самого начала. Для тех, кто любит историю её мира. Для тех, кто наблюдал весь путь её становления, и кто прошёл через бесчисленное множество переработок, нёрфов и баффов. Для тех, кто давно стал частью игрового сообщества. А не для тех, кто ничего в ней не понимает, не хочет разбираться и заходит, чтобы навести хаос в матчах. Исходя из этого, этот проект новичкам я рекомендовать не буду.","timestamp_created":1482742539,"timestamp_updated":1622321324,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28663697","author":{"steamid":"76561198343292994","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1485,"last_played":1551027336},"language":"schinese","review":"很不错的游戏，集合多种元素，强力推荐。","timestamp_created":1482742178,"timestamp_updated":1482742178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28663210","author":{"steamid":"76561198337309008","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1480323822},"language":"thai","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1482740829,"timestamp_updated":1482740829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502485513687133789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28663018","author":{"steamid":"76561198315886495","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3598,"last_played":1583909638},"language":"english","review":"Excelente

by Daylight is not a horror game. I think we all know this now, since the marketing tone has shifted from a 4v1 horror experience to a 4v1 competitive action experience. And that's mostly what DbD is.\n\nBut to be completely honest with you, this game played at the highest level of skill is very boring. It's the same 6 or 7 perks in rotation, the same 4 or 5 killers, the same items and addons. DbD shifts its meta slower than literally any game I have ever seen. The perk Decisive Strike has been a must-have and extremely powerful for nearly 5 years, only just now is it so butchered that it's seeing less usage.\n\nHOWEVER. Most of the players in this game are not that good. And that's where the fun is. Dead by Daylight isn't fun when you play Spirit with broken addons and gen regression perks against a 4 man SWF all with keys, medkits, BT and Unbreakable. Dead by Daylight is fun when you experiment with new builds and fun killers.\n\nYou could play nothing but the most on-meta build 24/7, but no matter what that's going to get incredibly stale. You might see a lot of talk about the community this game has and how 'terrible' it is, but in reality it's just people joining bandwagons on the forums about what's broken or annoying. When you actually play the game you might get some toxicity but it is FAR better than most competitive games, like Valorant, League of Legends, Overwatch, CoD, etc.\n\nIn fact, this community more often than not does things that benefit the other team just because it's funny, or it's nice. Like a killer giving survivors a free escape just because they played well, or letting someone escape because they got screwed over by a bug. Or survivors giving themselves up to the killer because they got screwed by a bug, or throwing pebbles at killers and shaking their camera around like a madman. This is something people don't realize about Dead by Daylight that NEVER happens in other games. Literally losing on purpose because it's nice, or it's funny. There's a level of understanding and empathy between both sides in a match that you don't get anywhere else.\n\nThere's also so much content to this game it's basically infinitely replayable. Only major complaint I have is you only get 4 (maybe 5) killers for free, and you have to pay up for all the others. You can theoretically grind for all the DLC killers (except for licensed ones like Myers or Demogorgon) but it's so insanely slow it's basically not even an option. \n\nTL;DR\nIf you're willing to spend a decent amount of cash for the DLC content this game is fantastic.

Most of the time you get stuck on the lobby loading screen and the only way to get out of it is shutting it down from Task Manager. It's no longer Early Access and they've YET to work on the bug that causes equipped items to be rendered useless, which has been around since conception.  Every time they update this game the old bugs are still there and new bugs are found, yet they continue to add new monsters and survivors.  GUYS!  STOP!  If you don't fix these bugs you are really going to lose your following.  I know many who have given up on this game because of the bugs.  Love this game, but the issues make me give up when I can only successfully get into one match out of five or six attempts!

If you play games to be competitive or if you are a competitive player by nature, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!  They have built it so that you WILL die.  If you're killer is leveled, you are going to die.  If you have a team that doesn't work together, you are going to die.  If your team is not on voice together, you are going to die.  They continually make it easier and easier for killers to kill you.  They are encouraging killers to camp you (much like corpse camping so you can't rez/respawn).  If you have friends who own the game, though, and you queue with them, it is worth getting.  Fun to hear your noob friends get salty (please be sure to be nice to them because you were there at one point too - tell them to stop caring and shake it off).

They have fixed lots of stuff. The balancing is still broken from time to time depending on what they change. It has been optimized and runs a lot better and you can instantly find lobbies. \n\nIn it's current state I would NEVER reccommend this fucked up shit. I REALLY enjoy playing it, but it's so frustrating that I barely find any lobbies. Every second or third search gets stuck in the \"searching game\" or \"joining game\" screen. The only thing you can do is to kill the process. Sometimes people can't connect to the host (the monster) so in the end it's just three/two or in the worst case only one player vs the monster. What fucks me up the most, is that the amount of gens you have to fix doesn't always adapt. I had several games where we were only three or two players, but still had to fix FIVE generators. Those kind of games are basically lost from the beginning. Of course you do lose ranks for that, too. The game isn't forgiving in any way. Winning doesn't boost the significantly rank, unless you get a certain amount of blood points. I had several games where either I was stuck or the monster was stuck inside of invisible objects/walls/planks, etc. All of this is ruining the fun. Also please give more explaination about the perks and items. What are the point categories? What do all these perks do? Why do I have to interrupt the game every time just because I need to google explanations for all these things. They are NOT anywhere explained in the game. This is just hilarious. Games should be self-explaining or at worst deliever some tooltips with good explanations. DbD is so much fun, but it has so many bugs right now, that I am currently forced to take a break and my anger towards the developers is rising with every single (unfair) game.","timestamp_created":1482713121,"timestamp_updated":1572564049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28653402","author":{"steamid":"76561198049835411","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":73173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":510,"last_played":1660355622},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dead by Dayligth é um jogo e tanto! <3","timestamp_created":1482712658,"timestamp_updated":1601173188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420104801654815674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28652818","author":{"steamid":"76561198255960689","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1625233333},"language":"schinese","review":"反作弊bug终于没搞到我了，趁特价支持杀鸡一波，拒绝网易，从我做起，只需要一个皮肤的价钱在这里可以当大爷，真舒服","timestamp_created":1482711287,"timestamp_updated":1527225665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28652615","author":{"steamid":"76561198273255642","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":25093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7023,"last_played":1657401152},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juegazo.
