It can be fun sometimes, and I do enjoy playing it with my friends. This game is easy to learn the basics of and very quick to suck you in, especially if you have a group of four you can swf with. This game is one of those games where it is easy to learn but hard to master, which is why I will talk about match making as one of my serious issues with the game. This game is wild when you're running around and doing wild shit and popping off regardless of what side you're on. When you're just goofing off with friends and not taking the game seriously, that is where the game really shines and shows how truly fun it can be. As much as I find myself continuing to play this game, there are always a few issues that I will continue to find with it.\n\nAlso to note: I got this game while it was on sale, for half price on free weekend\n\nFirst, there is no matchmaking for this game currently. Devs say they're working on it, but so far no dice. What I mean by this is that you'll often find yourself in a game with people you're vastly better than, or with people that will steamroll you because of your skill difference. The wait times are short most often, but that comes with the price of not being properly paired with people that you're equal to. This game used to have 10+ minutes of wait time just so that you could be properly paired with a group through what was referred to as a pooling system; but since there were issues with wait time, the matchmaking was scrapped entirely in order to \"combat\" the issue. You'll most likely, if you play killer, enter a match where everyone on the survivor team is ready to bully you because they're ten ranks higher than you and you derank, or you quickly get a 4k because you're ten ranks higher than them and still derank. Same goes for survivor and yes, you'll still most likely derank or barely not derank because of the poor match making system. The game rewards good players and good killers when they play together, although it struggles to match them together due to the lack of a proper matching system.\n\nFurthermore, the ranking system is complicated and clandestine leaving you often feeling unsatisfied with your results regardless of how you preformed. For example, the ranking system judges you for how often/well you perform certain actions such as helping players, completing objectives, and surviving encounters with the killer. However, as stated earlier,  if you steamroll a killer because of matchmaking or get creamed by a killer also due to matchmaking, you'll derank because you didn't get enough points in interacting with the killer, or helping other survivors off the hook or healing them. This game tends to punish your rank due to their lack of matchmaking, often leading to more frustrating moments. Furthermore, the game punishes you for focusing on one aspect of the objectives, and often requires that if you want to rank up you'll need to do a little bit of everything, leading to a lack of coordination on the survivor's end of gameplay if you're not with friends. Also I should mention that it is considered \"unfair\" to a killer when people coordinate through swf, especially if you're matched with a killer who is so much lower than you in skill or rank.\n\nFinally, there seems to be issues with balancing on both ends of the spectrum for both killers and survivors, there are killers who are problematically broken (both for better or for worse), and survivor perks that you would be foolish for not running because they're busted. There's also a great divide between those who play killers more often and those who play survivors more often, claiming that one is more favored by the devs than the other making it more unfair for the other party. This leads to issues within the community when discussing aspects of the game, often leaving people to claim \"git gud\" when other players have genuine concerns or topics of discussion in the forums. This is not particularly an issue with the game itself, but it seems that the devs will continue to upset one side of the community with whatever they do. \n\nI understand that behavior is a smaller studio, and things such as proper match making, connection, and balance take more time to fix than for larger studios; but as it stands, the game punishes you for things that are out of your control and due to a ranking system that barely exists and probably shouldn't even be there; as the devs themselves have said that 'ranking is not a true indication of a player's actual skill.' This game has a community of people who feel as though one side of the game (killers, or survivors) is less important, often raising hell over reworks or changes, when the dev team has bigger issues to address. This game needs a lot of love and serious work to fix the issues that currently reside.\n\nWhile I can find enjoyment playing this game, I would not recommend this game to anyone who would seriously try and play competitively. If you can learn to not care about your ranking and look past the blatant issues with matchmaking, this game can be thrilling and entertaining when you have serious cooperation, and the matchmaking works in your favor.\n\n8/10, has a little something for everyone.","timestamp_created":1597105647,"timestamp_updated":1597105647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74108298","author":{"steamid":"76561198141830923","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1299,"last_played":1643503941},"language":"russian","review":"dota2","timestamp_created":1597104316,"timestamp_updated":1597104316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74108121","author":{"steamid":"76561199033685873","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1598198383},"language":"english","review":"Game is lit !","timestamp_created":1597103948,"timestamp_updated":1597103948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74107787","author":{"steamid":"76561198880673963","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":507,"last_played":1658520577},"language":"english","review":"Very good","timestamp_created":1597103297,"timestamp_updated":1597103297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74107744","author":{"steamid":"76561198316978075","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":37785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31831,"last_played":1624605226},"language":"schinese","review":"挺欢乐的游戏","timestamp_created":1597103209,"timestamp_updated":1597103209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74107696","author":{"steamid":"76561198272367711","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1597102506},"language":"english","review":"game full of nigerian cock sucker black mamba gays worst game ever played","timestamp_created":1597103121,"timestamp_updated":1597103121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462427735328674316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74107549","author":{"steamid":"76561197991173953","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4725,"last_played":1615677663},"language":"english","review":"So much fun to play, with or without a group.

All it has done is brought in what should of always been there; the feeling of dread knowing that the killer is a powerful force chasing you down, no more of survivors just running loop after loop and teabagging when they get a pallet drop. I hardly EVER play killer, out of my 275 hours, probably about 20 of them are killer matches. So as a survivor main, yes it's frustrating getting absolutely destroyed match after match with this update (As generator regression builds for killers are slightly OP right now) It has brought back a sense of dread when I hear that terror radius, knowing I can't just run loops all day anymore, I feel like this update needed to happen. So ignore the negative reviews from whiny children who are butthurt that they can't simply escape a chase by clicking 'E' to deadhard anymore, this has forced survivors to rethink their builds & has brought a new breath of life to the game! \n\nAnyway give it a go, boop the demo snoot while your at it!

However, for a good month now, the progression randomly breaks. I love the gameplay loop, but I can't recommend playing Dead By Daylight as a new player when you lose all progress anytime the game decides.\n\nUpdate: So, they have \"fixed\" error 111; however, this has just remediated the number on the error rather than the actual error itself.

Mechanics seems to be well planned at the beginning. The problem starts when you level up a bit, and discover all the variety of malicious and toxic behaviors of the players. Killers who won't stop focusing you till you're dead, survivors who won't cooperate in a single bit, leaving you wounded for half a match, or unable to repair even 1 generator (a main objective each match). Also, among the wide variety of perks for characters, some become a must after certain level, otherwise new matches will be unplayable. Periodical nerfs / reworks fix the meta setup, but usually for a short duration. Other are just clogging the upgrade tree (called Bloodweb), cause you're not gonna run them, but you must unlock them anyway to finish this page of Bloodweb that was generated for you this time.\nTL; DR - overall concept and execution are appealing, but the community and occasional bugs will make you regret buying it.

I could say a ton of stuff about how broken it was, how the devs did put in significant work to adress issues and what not, but i'll say this one thing.\n\nAsymetrical multiplayers are amazing, thrilling and exciting. That is , IF the in place method of matchmaking is working as intended. In the earlier days of DbD, it WAS understandable to have clumsy matchmaking, since the player base was low, hell, the game was on the verge of dying at some point.\n\nBut now having over close to 50k average players, there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSES, that veterans are matched with beginners killers and vice versa. Of course, the first few games are hilarious, stomping and, let's face it, bullying the killer. But the 100th one? Ain't much fun owning someone who is not even ABLE to fight back.\n\nThis negative review is a way for me to make my voice heard, since the actual matchmaking is not due to the lack of playerbase, but BEHAVIOR own doing.\n\nTo all newcommers, this game used to be amazing, but in the state it is, chances are you will NOT enjoy your games, being matched with top tier survivors as a new killer OR being matched with the TOP TIER killers as a new survivor. In the state of the actual matchmaking, I would definately NOT recommend any new person to buy this, as the experience will most likely be VERy frustrating, Very unfair and unbalanced to a point where you will just play a few games and abandon, without ever considering to come back.\n\nHell, even I am thinking of un-installing.\n\n","timestamp_created":1597086075,"timestamp_updated":1597086075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572312414646148682","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74096542","author":{"steamid":"76561198799199774","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":64215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":50,"playtime_at_review":12459,"last_played":1659900197},"language":"polish","review":"bardzo fajna gra polecam\na i marek nie dawaj fejk info","timestamp_created":1597085747,"timestamp_updated":1597085747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74096524","author":{"steamid":"76561198035948514","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":6925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":50,"playtime_at_review":2899,"last_played":1659734262},"language":"english","review":"If you play a killer be prepared for full man teams gen rushing you and being toxic as all hell.
