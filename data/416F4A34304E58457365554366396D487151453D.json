Цена. Совсем символическая.\n2. Атмосфера. Иногда испытываешь животный страх, аж трясешься.\n3. Геймлей. Можно забить на команду и спастись самому, или же помочь своим друзьям по выживанию и попытаться спастись вместе (например, если маньяк кемперит). В первом случае меня мучает совесть и я всегда пытаюсь помочь, от этого мне становится еще интереснее играть. А еще очень классно собрать пати и играть вместе с с друзьями.\n4. Геймдизайн. Очень детально и красиво построены локации.\n5. Звуковое сопровождение. Сердцебиение в игре сливается с моим воедино. Шорох и любой шум заставляет постоянно оглядываться. Чувство загнанного зверя.\n\nЯ однозначно рекомендую эту игру, и ко мне стоит прислушаться любителям хорроров, мистики, триллеров. Почему?

Devs are constantly trying to make it fair, new content about every 3 months. The game is fun when being played how it is supposed to be played. Survive With Friends groups that get on discord do tend to ruin the experience for the killer and salty killers ruin fun for survivors, but most of the games you play won't be like that. If you don't dwell too hard on the bad games, you'll have fun, especially if you enjoy asymmetrical games...\n\nThat is what I thought when I was new at this game, but now that I have put so many hours into it, I can see that the devs don't listen to the veteran fan base. They are only trying to get new people in. Once you play this game for a bit, you will see how imbalanced it is. Survivors have it way easier, and it is so much more chill as survivor. Killers go through constant nerfs that hurt them, but survivor (even with nerfs) is still super chill. I wouldn't recommend this game because eventually you'll have dropped $120 on it or so and then see that the devs don't care about your experience because they already got your money. Survivor isn't scary once you know the game and you just watch how sad it is to be killer. Survive with friends on comms makes this game super easy too. If you want to consistently dominate at this game, get a 4 stack of SWF, get on comms, your team will never lose. I would wait till the devs actually fix this game before you drop money on it.\n\nI will recommend because it definitely can be fun, but get it on sale for sure. It will be annoying and frustrating, but that is something you may just have to deal with.\n\nEdit: I cannot recommend this game anymore. The devs have worked more on pushing out things that make money than the quality of this game. It is a game that will die in a year or two at this rate. The devs don't care about you, just your wallet, and they've made that very obvious.

About a year ago, I saw the dev diaries and some early gameplay when the game just took off, I wasn't particular drawn to or impressed by the game at all probably because I also didn't really understand the premise of the game. I suppose the game needed time to grow, and grow it did. The game was picked up by streamers and their followers and subsequently grew a considerable playerbase.\n\nDead by Daylight is a 4v1 multiplayer game where you take the reigns of a supernatural killer/slasher or a survivor trapped in a stage with the killer. As a survivor, you work in a team of 4 to power generators in order to power the exit gates to escape the map. As a killer, you try to prevent the survivors from escaping. You don't kill them directly however, and must injure them before placing them on sacrificial hooks for the game's omnipresent Entity to consume them. Doing so take times and survivors are able to rescue each other before the Entity consumes them. If you want to boil this game down to its essentials - it's a game of extreme hide and seek with objectives. The gameplay is fairly simple, but yet the satisfaction you get from playing the game is so rewarding. Outsmarting the killers by hiding from them or escaping a chase; outsmarting survivors by predicting their tactics gives you a sense of triumph over players.\n\nThere are various survivors and killers with varying abilities, though with survivors, once you learn the perks for each character they essentially become skins. However, survivors have different voices and appearances which may play to your advantage or disadvantage. Killers have vastly different abilities, each one specializing in different playstyles that you can try out. Some DLC content can even be unlocked just by playing the game and earning the virtual currency to unlock exclusive cosmetics, survivors and killers. If you're after another fun multiplayer game to sink your teeth into I'd recommend trying out the game during the next F2P weekend and seeing if it piques your interest.","timestamp_created":1535026500,"timestamp_updated":1535026500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44330138","author":{"steamid":"76561198131937027","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":57456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":104,"playtime_at_review":4429,"last_played":1660231014},"language":"english","review":"It has changed over the year for the better.
