put alot of hours into Dead by Daylight and I used to main killer, started playing survivor so I could play with friends. Since the release of Freddy it has been the worst choice made by the devs to not work on fixing him quickly. Trying to juke him is impossible and when I say that its literal. No perk or any build counters him, not only can you barely find him if he is near you but he has no cooldown on how quick he can put you back in the dreamstate, mind you that to get out you have to give away you position by failing a skillcheck. The concept is great and I was pumped for Freddy but a killer that doesnt need deerstalker, or nurses calling, can stop gates from being opened because he hits a player a couple times and even if you manage to open the gate he can have Blood Warden which prevents you from leaving even further. The whole \"get gud\" isnt something possible against him, players try to adapt to him but his add ons prevent you from getting out the dreamstate which makes action speed 50% slower. Hopefully the Devs will actually do something about him before November 1st so all players can actually enjoy earning 2x bloodpoints, not just the killer.","timestamp_created":1501667431,"timestamp_updated":1509236713,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33966871","author":{"steamid":"76561198403261815","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1738,"last_played":1521934117},"language":"english","review":"Devs fucked up my rank and lvl so now i would have to start over on this game but yah im done not gonna play this fucking trash game anymore cuz too many fucking bugs and really cant enjoy it anymore.","timestamp_created":1501664764,"timestamp_updated":1501936925,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487804889678955078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33966410","author":{"steamid":"76561198092245222","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1501754182},"language":"english","review":"So...\n\n>Never played any 4vs1\n>Second match ever, decide to try Killer\n>Pick Huntress because \"that sweet a..xe\"\n>2 minutes pass, find 1st survivor, hit him,  hook him, then go check on the others\n>They free him, I hit the 2nd one, hook him\n>They free the 2nd, I hit the 3rd one, hook him\n>This goes on for a while as they keep freeing each other, they are not even going for the objectives now and it's getting way too long\n>\"Idea!\"\n>Find 4th, hook him, then stay in range for my hatchets\n>\"It works!\" Bloody murder everyone as I use 4th one as a Meat bait\n>Go on using the survivors as bait as they fall for it each and every time\n>Round finally ends, I win\n\n\n\nApparently that's not a valid tactic and it's called camping, and that's how I was told to get a lot of diseases, that my mom is a lady of the night and that my dick should fall off.\n\n\n7/7 it's fun anyway.\n","timestamp_created":1501663077,"timestamp_updated":1501663077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492598086595535278","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33966132","author":{"steamid":"76561198150492421","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":23226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14288,"last_played":1649603947},"language":"russian","review":"полная параша, берите по  скидке и играйте на здоровье","timestamp_created":1501661749,"timestamp_updated":1645464684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33965954","author":{"steamid":"76561198018350316","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":27022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1102,"last_played":1630970618},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome, while I don't think that playing with random people is the most fun, playing with friends and just hunting each other while talking is some of the most terrifying and satisfying fun I've had.

For the most part, yes.  \nDoes this game have some serious, almost game breaking issues?  Oh my god yes.\n\nThe game's been buggy and full of exploits since it came out.  Every attempt to fix unsporting strategies merely creates more problems.  It might be excusable, if not for the fact that the game has since released DLC worth 150% of the game's value, and seems to prioritize development of DLC over fixing the gameplay.\nThere are also plenty of reasons NOT to play this game that are somewhat beyond the control of the devs.  This game has a seriously toxic community, on the level of League of Legends.  It's about 50% regular people who just play games for fun, and occasionally rage, and 50% people who will declare a blood vendetta against you for daring to be better/worse than them.  Is this beyond the control of the developers?  Yes.  Did the developers make the inconceivable choice to a post-game chat that adds nothing to the gameplay experience and is merely used as a tool for complete psychopaths to hurl abuse at random strangers?  Yes.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have at least 3 friends who you can talk into spending $20, I can almost assure you that you WILL enjoy this game.  Kill Your Friends is surprisingly polished, allowing use of all items, addons, and perks, allowing for experimentation and providing a place to learn.  It's actually the perfect experience for the casual gamer who wants to be able to experience everything the game has to offer.  Even more fun is being in the same skype/discord/third-party-voice-chat-of-your-choice with your fellow survivors and the killer, which adds another dimension of mindgaming and bluffing to the experience.\n\nIn short, unless you enjoy dealing with jerks on a daily basis, only buy this game if you have at least 3 other friends who have this game who will play with you.  Ranked multiplayer is horrid and full of exploits on both sides, half the community are terrible, but Kill Your Friends is a real gem.\n","timestamp_created":1501659253,"timestamp_updated":1501659253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33965139","author":{"steamid":"76561198717132918","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10435,"last_played":1577373267},"language":"english","review":"Camping

Pomyślisz czemu tak krytycznie? A już śpieszę z wytłumaczeniem, w sumie chuj by mnie bolało gdyby to był kolejny przypadkowy bug po wyjebaniu się aktualizacji / albo testy nowego systemu przez jeden dzień. Nie oni wprowadzili CELOWY upadate pod rangi i system dobierania, który generalnie pierdoli się częściej niż Alfa na warsztacie. Po wprowadzeniu patcha, jak to ostatnio u nich bywa wszyscy wylądowali jak jeden mąż w najniższych rangach (popiół IV) kiedyś poprostu słynna 20. Przez pierwsze pare dni spoko zrozumiałe ze bedą braki balansów. Ale grając na prawie że najgorszych rangach z kumplem, dostajemy turbo kretynów do gry a po drugiej stronie stoi zabójca, z najwyższej obecnej rangi dojebany jak skurwysyn. Powiesz że pierdole i płacze XD ale jestem pewien że jest wielu co uważa tak samo o tej aktualizacji to samo. \n\nKolejna rzecz, dodatki swego czasu ta gra miała dobre wsparcie, dodatki wychodziły sensowne a co najważniejsze kompletne. Od ostatnich 3 dodatków wychodzą ubogie i niedorobione. Co mam na myśli? Liczna ilość bugów (łańcuchy co trzymaja cie do usranej śmierci u Pinheada, świetnie zaprojektowane IA zombie dla Nemesis itd.) Z dodatkiem RE przez blisko 2 jak nie 3 miechy nie widzieliśmy nowej mapy, po naprawieniu nowej mapy zjebali starą mape i też nie działa. Niestety, przegrałem w tą gre tyle godzin a jedyne co moge powiedzieć po systemie rankingowym że nie ma meczu bez wkurwienia się, i już nawet nie chodzi o to że ludzie grają w tą gre jak najgorsze kurwy, ale o rozrzutność i bezcelowość tego systemu. Jak \"nowicjusz\" gówno z szarej rangi może dostać mistrza z czerwonej, co jak co ja już sie przyzwyczaiłem do braku sensu tej gry ale nowy gracz zrozumie że to nie dla niego i tyle.\n\nTeraz największy paradoks tej gry czyli BALANS. Świetne słowo, a dokładnie jego brak. Pomimo iż gra ma pełny magazyn DLC w postaci zabójców, ocalałych to chcąc nie chcąc zauważycie że przeważnie starcia będą opierały się na tych samych postaciach. Zarówno grając killerem jak i ocalałym. Grając survem dostaniesz na 70% szans zabójce z kategorii: Huntress, Spirit, Wraith, Blight, Nurse słynna piątka, może kogoś pominąłem ale generalnie jest to ten zespół który psuje gre od samego patrzenia sie na nich. Żeby nie było że jestem SurvSidowy to grając killerem przerważnie zobaczysz powtarzające sie postacie odziane w jaskrawe toksyczne kolory tylko po to żeby zwracać na siebie uwagę i wkurwiać Cie. Latarki, palety, borrowed time itd. będą darli z Ciebie łacha bo balans gry nie pozwoli Ci ich zbyt skrzywdzić (jeżeli nie straciłeś życia w tej grze albo nie grasz którymś ze UN-SKILLOWEJ PIĄTKI). W sumie jedyne co może Ci dobrze pójść grająć przeciwko toksycznej teamówce to wkurwienie i w sumie nic wiecej. Oczywiście to nie wina gry że ludzie grają kurwy, winą gry jest to że na to pozwala. Mechanika nie ograniczna zarówno jednej jak i drugiej strony tak aby zachować kilimat i nie czynić ofiary (bo taka role gra) napastnikiem.\n\nNiestety póki co nie polecam, obecny system nie szczędzi nikogo, jeżeli chcesz pochillować i tak pograć sobie z kumplem czy też drużyną to wątpie że przypadnie do gustu. Może pierwsze mecze potem urok opadnie i zobaczycie prawdziwe bagno. Jak jest sie toksycznym tryhardem to pewnie gra idealna xD. Póki nie wprowadzą jakiegoś sensownego balansu, który znormalizuje te rozgrywkę i przywróci różnorodność zabójców to może zmienię te opinie. Ale na to sie aktualnie nie zapowiada. Musieli by znerfić cudowną piątke oraz zmienic gameplay survem, Lub zbuffwać wszystkich pozostałych zabójców (co raczej bedzie trudne). No generalnie nie mi nad tym myśleć, moge powiedzieć tyle że w przeszłości ta gra była lepsza, albo jak to sie mówi \"kiedyś to były czasy, teraz to czasów nie ma XD. \n\nW skrócie, niech wypierdola ten system rankingowy bo on ssie po same bille i chociaż Spróbują, wprowadzić jakikolwiek balans między rolą Zabójcy a ocalałym (żeby te słowa miały jakieś odzwierciedlenie) i niech unormują tych zabójców bo jest za duży odstęp pomiędzy skutecznością przez co cierpi różnorodność.","timestamp_created":1501619198,"timestamp_updated":1632357369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520201981067657471","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33956825","author":{"steamid":"76561198066199001","num_games_owned":764,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1637386159},"language":"english","review":"Every time you are in any way successful as the Killer you get accused of cheating or camping and then you get \"reported\".

Not like all of those other games that try to copy Dead by Daylight, nothing like them! They're all [b]terrible[/b] compared to Dead by Daylight! Lets look at that name, Dead By Daylight:\n\nD: Damn, its Dead by Daylight!\nE: Ernist, look! Its Dead by Daylight!\nA: A good game?

Just the whole vibe of being up close and personal with the killer at times gives you the thrill most games can't. And its even better when you're able to juke out the killer during a chase. Some people claim that Friday the 13th is way better than dead by daylight. The only thing I believe is better about Friday the 13th is how many items you can get. Other then that dead by daylight is way better because you can actually get away from the killer. Most of the time in Friday the 13th, the killer will stay on your tail until someone else distracts him, or if he just gives up running after you. And that happens rarely. Dead by daylight can feel repetitive at times but overall i feel dead by daylight is better. Definitely recommend both games, they are both good.
