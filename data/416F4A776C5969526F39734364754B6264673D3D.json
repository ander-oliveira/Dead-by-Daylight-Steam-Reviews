It provides us with the ability to actually have a fun time but in very small doses and ultimately that is the problem.\n\nAs of right now, I cannot recommend the game. Allow me to explain my reasoning to you; \nI've played the game now, close to 64 hours. At first the game was a total blast. You picked your respective survivor or supernatural killer, set your equipment up & then you were ushered into the gloom. To the horrid, wretched hellscape that the Entity has prepared for you like so much motley, rot & squalor found in the wooden buildings of the games.\n\nAt first, you could tolerate Dead by Daylight for its faults. Be it whimsically floating 10 feet from a killer when they pick you up or when you get physics glitched into a locker or in the rare occasion where a killer was both connected and disconnected, allowing farming. \n\n I myself got to prestige 1 with Dwight and my favorite killers are the Nurse & Hillbilly but things have gotten too hard these days to actually say I'm having \"fun\". The effective strategies created by players have altered the landscape. The inability to alter the way players can deter you has created a very difficult balance to manage. The problem is that it cannot be comfortably met without compromise or a recomposure of the game. As the game got harder through the tricks employed by players, the Risk Vs. Reward, or the incentive to play AS a killer has severely diminished.\n\nWhen I first started out, it was hard to earn points. People would quit on you as a killer when you killed them & killers would quit on you out of sheer frustration. Nobody was happy. To this day it seems like nobody really still is.\nApparently there has been a huge amount of players that are Very, VERY dissatisfied with the way you play as a killer. I share this pain. I see no reason, to play a game the way it's meant to be played, but have the community scream and moan at you about \"camping\" when you literally have to when there are 3 other people purched around a rock wall or a hillside only for you to turn your back and allow them to launch like spidermonkeys the minute you aren't looking.\nThe same can be said for Trappers who place their beartraps under the survivors. Or in the path of a pallet to stun him. Or Hags when they imitate Trappers.\n\nIt is a cruel balance of survivalism vs altruism on your behalf as a killer, surprisingly. Much like in the actual game point system but I assure you, as a killer, I do not have nearly as much fun. I cannot have fun when I can't even capture enough survivors to justify my purchase of perks & trinkets, so I can spend my bloodpoints to go to another room, where I'll be yelled at because I am desperately trying to play the game with minimalist gameplay tools & blamed for utilizing the tools I do have. That is an abusive relationship at its very core. \n\nI do very much LIKE the game though. I promise you that. I wouldn't have slogged out 60 hours of my life to prestige my Dwight, facing down Myers, Trappers & Wraiths so I could get my Bloody Shirt. \nThat however, is something that really hammered a cruel point home to me though. As a player, there really isn't much of a purpose to it all. Now I know, it's a game so there isn't really a point in the first place but what I mean is; What is the point of prestige if there is no actual honor or worthwhile over-merit? \n\nDon't give me shared skills and all that tripe. That comes 30 levels in and by that point you're in fighting standard at that point anyway. Those provide nothing to me as an immediate award for my hard earn drudgery. As tacky and cliche as the phrase sounds \"I played 60 hours of my favorite mass murder simulator and all I got was a lousy shirt\" should not be as embittering & as striking as it is.\n\nThat's when I realized that this game is actually for masochists & not in the way Dark Souls or other games could be. It's hard to believe that the notion of artificial difficulty can actually be created BY players, but Pallet-Jumping and a lot of the tech at their fingertips actually allow this. Which is partially good game design, and partially terrible. If one side has an overwhelming advantage, then shouldn't the game be inspected for balance?\n\nEven during the periods where it was 2 or 3 of us, there were more matches than not that where I was the survivor, I could dupe the killer. Less people means less stains to follow. Less stains means the killer has to hunt more. Hunting more means the killer should receive more incentive. Instead it's sort of like a slot machine. As a killer though, I know what it's like to actually walk in with a room of 2 people and get neither due to their ability.  \n\nI spent enough time on both sides. I shook with scorn & wrath when a Hillbilly would manage himself a cross-map chainsaw sprint, downing me as I was fixing a generator. And I frothed in utter incomprehensible rage when I had worked so hard to get a survivor on the hook after a fierce chase, only to briefly turn around and for them to be gone when the doors are open.\n \nIt's a shame, really. I think I like Dead by Daylight probably more than I'll like Friday the 13th based on sheer map variety, lore & design theories put into place. That is not to say that Friday the 13th will be bad, I'm merely saying that Dead By Daylight, will always, stylistically, represent this sort of Murder Arena genre to me. I know there have been others but none of them actually seem as popular for whatever reason.\n\nThe problem, or rather the grievance I have, is that Killer gameplay continues to suffer with no reprieve. Survivor gameplay is easily represented by the phrase \"We are only as strong as our weakest link\" because it's true. As my high level Dwight, I remember doing my hardest to save my weaker teammates as we had a more-than-capable Killer disposing of us. I was always the guy who would be single-handedly fixing generators while they were dying or getting hooked. Rushing in, distracting them & rushing out.\n\nAs a killer however the mindset of \"You're only as strong as the doubts you cast\" comes to mind. Did I see a survivor? Did they see me? Should I roam? Should I stay? Should I go to that generator or stay at this one & stalk them?\nYou have nobody to assist you. Which is  understandable considering the nature of the movies that Dead by Daylight is based upon but Dead by Daylight does not have any reason to STAY with the cliche of its' source material. It is its own idea. Its own property which means it should be allowed to experiment with its style. \n\nAm I saying 2 Killer/ 8 survivor maps? Not necessarily. That would be nice but I know that would be a server nightmare as we can hardly get enough killers with good connections to harbor us a regular chance at the game. What I am craving from the system, is something a bit more. Something that perks shouldn't account for. I am asking for more chances of actual Gameplay As the Killers. \n\nOverall, to me, as it stands, Dead by Daylight is like a bitter coffee. You should enjoy it in doses where you need something different, but don't play it too much. You'll only get sick. The gameplay, if you can manage to avoid the exceptions and the pitfalls I have mentioned is solid. Sometimes it feels like people just play the game to troll killers, which really does not help with the player chemistry and the community.\n\nUntil a point in the future though where more features and effects can be given to us to balance the game out, I cannot find myself enjoying the game like I used to. Call it a burnout, call it a bias but I put in my time to see how the game was flawed. \nIf I could tell the developers one thing, it'd be \"Please refresh what it is to be a Killer\".\n\nMaybe wait for a balancing act to both sides. The \"Kicking Generators\" update was good. As was adding Bill from L4D. Maybe one day, things will be better. For now however, I simply can't take it anymore.","timestamp_created":1491536663,"timestamp_updated":1491546812,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541836678981781006","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30989952","author":{"steamid":"76561198111222996","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4265,"last_played":1643003676},"language":"english","review":"I love playing this lobby simulator,  Awkward small talk simulator, and Alt + Tab Simulator.

What really ruins it for me is the horribly long wait time my friend and I have, even if it's just us in our lobby. With 4 people I can understand that might take a while but come on, 45 minutes just for two people?! I don't get why they keep adding more and more stff to this game when they should be focusing more on the actual problems their game is having. Sure, new stuff brings gamers in to play, but with the same ol fucking problems showing up they quit playing after a couple tries! Fix the match making and maybe they'll actually get their costumers back..","timestamp_created":1491532530,"timestamp_updated":1491532530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlYiRo9sCduKbdg=="}
