by daylight is an asymetric horror game where 4 survivors try to escape 1 killer.\nThe gameplay loop is generally engaging considering how moments are unexpected when playing against other people.\nI.e playing as survivor can genuinely freak you out sometimes from a great killer sneak-up (same goes vice versa)\nThe core issue with the game is how boring working on generators can be and the prevelance of DLCs.\nThis is however, made up with how envigorating chases can be and how you generally only need 1-3 DLCs, each often receiving their own sales.\n\nThe Horrible:\n1) Firstly, 5 generators must be powered to activate the exit gates, however considering each generator takes ~80 seconds alone, this amounts to you just spending half the game holding down the mouse button waiting.\n\nThe Bad:\n2) Secondly, although all survivors are just reskins of each other, certain perks (abilities) are locked behind a paywall. The Devs tried to mend this with the shrine of secrets, however this amounts to 4 random perks being purchasable using in-game points which cycles once a week. This low frequency of cycling along with the perks chosen being random, means you are highly unlikely to get the perks you actually want. Luckily, if you're willing to dish out an additional ~$10 for the DLCs you want, they often go on sale so you can bulk buy.\n\nThe Great:\n1) Playing against human opponents means it can be much harder to predict the exact movements of another. Furthermore, due to the vast amount of different perk combinations, you never know what you may be up against. Chases are what I believe to single-handedly redeem the game. I just find it a shame how conservatively some play due to a desire to escape rather than receive the highest score.","timestamp_created":1622741506,"timestamp_updated":1622741506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93118599","author":{"steamid":"76561198855145592","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":135646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":110811,"last_played":1659639282},"language":"russian","review":"Pretty

Devs bad at balancing. Game can be fun, especially at beggining stages. After a while you start seeing the huge grind and how money-hungry the devs are. I think the game has potential but it's starting to going downfall if the devs keep treating DBD as a cash cow and not as a promising amazing game.\n\nDevs don't know/care to balance the game and define important things like what is winning/what is fun. Every week new skins come out and balancing takes months and months for stuff that is actually more simple than they actually make it sound like. (But Wolf, the designer team is a completly different team from the balance team...) Well, where the hell is all the money that they make off the expensive skins and dlcs going to? It ain't the balance team for sure because last time I checked (actually a few years ago but by the looks of things it hasn't changed) the balance team was formed by less than 5 people. Small props to them on recently buffing not that used perks which is always a good thing to do but nerfing perks is not something simple as just the opposite of buffing. Professional game devs should be more careful with nerfs. They refuse to listen to some very good constructive feedback from experienced players because they want to balance the game around the average player. This is where they fail again because they use statistics from the games truly terribly. For example, instead of looking at a high percentage of certains perks, they immediatly assumed that they are overpowered and not take in account another factors. This happens for example to perks, where most of them are either trash and a very few of them just are necessary to even have a chance of playing a match without getting destroyed (generator slow down perks for killer for example and I I'm not a killer player and it's obvious how much needed these 2-3 perks are to some playstyles/killers).\nGetting into the dlcs now and Im not going to even start talking much about price but you can check it for yourself and see how expensive the game can get. (Yea you can get every perk and most characters for free but only after you reached a few thousand hours in this game, this is no exaggeration). Anyways, DLC's are a joke. What makes this game good with the DLC's is actually the monopoly that they have already. Where's another game with DLC's from famous movies like this one where you get to play them in a horror setting? That's really cool but the devs really are only out there for the money. We get dished out DLC's faster than you can chew the last one. Looking at you poor trickster, who came out all weak, needing buffs because behaviour's balance team and then, just a few weeks, they smack us with the Resident Evil DLC announcement. And well, this was DBD of today: Trickster still weak, with the need of balancing issues. New map is completed bugged and is disabled. The Twins, the killer before Trickster, still hated by many players (survivors) due to unfun mechanics such as camping.\nAnd with the mention of camping I'm gonna pass to the problem which is the lack of definition of win and what is fun to play. Personal experience from playing and watching streams and videos online and developing an asymmetrical board game: To have a good sense of balancing an asymmetrical game, it's crucial to understand all roles possible for the player. And to me, I'm sorry, but I find it impossible to believe that someone who says that camping (the act of staying near a hooked person to ensure you get a free another hit or even a free down) and tunneling (the act of going over and over after the same player so that player dies and you get 1 less survivor in the game) are part of the game to ever have played and enjoyed survivor on a somewhat serious/skill wise level. There's nothing more unfun than waiting 5 to 10 mins for a game, to then get camped to death, with no opportunity of escaping to then just have to accept the fate that I got unlucky and got queued agaisnt a killer who plays like this. (But Wolf, there are perks that can save you there, so it's no opportunity, you god dam liar). \nGood that you mention that because that's another terrible thing that the balancing team does. They balance stupid/unfun mechanics of the game by making/buffing perks to combat them.... What the actual hell. No, just remove/rework those stupid mechanics! Why should a player not be a able to create his own build and play with it just because he has to run stupid meta perks to combat stupid unfun playstyles? That's nuts. And what's even more nuts is that players get annoyed/frustated agaisnt these said perks. The reason for this lies into the community when big and famous content creators promote these unfun playstyles and makes players want to do them. I just blamed the community while typing this last sentence and I'm not gonna delete it but this also goes back to one of the first things I typed on this long review which was the lack of definition of important things by the devs. If the devs would come out and express themselves and start being objetive with what is the direction of the game that they want, this would be more easy to understand what the problem really is. But the devs have showed over and over that what they care is $$$ and they are afraid of hurting their cash cow because that are failing over and over to make DBD not just a cash cow but a solid great game.\nWith all these negative comments about the game. I do like DBD as a concept and I do play it from time to time. But I used to a lot more before and you check my hours in the last 2 weeks and on record. The game has a huge potential to be one of the best games ever been made and that's also why I am upset with the devs.","timestamp_created":1622731659,"timestamp_updated":1625310954,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93110019","author":{"steamid":"76561198305394014","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":37558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":626,"playtime_at_review":20467,"last_played":1659636862},"language":"polish","review":"gierka zjebana, hitboxy zwalone i mocny desyng","timestamp_created":1622731550,"timestamp_updated":1622731550,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93109147","author":{"steamid":"76561199074927932","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3157,"last_played":1649501781},"language":"turkish","review":"lets do this coldwind farm duuudddeeeee\n","timestamp_created":1622730587,"timestamp_updated":1622730587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93109051","author":{"steamid":"76561198103306685","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1654357320},"language":"english","review":"very nice game i like it","timestamp_created":1622730484,"timestamp_updated":1622730484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93108753","author":{"steamid":"76561199001758064","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1684,"last_played":1623585291},"language":"english","review":"sus","timestamp_created":1622730129,"timestamp_updated":1622730129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93108748","author":{"steamid":"76561199100768676","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":412,"last_played":1642164716},"language":"brazilian","review":"OTIMO JOGO\n","timestamp_created":1622730126,"timestamp_updated":1622730126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93108737","author":{"steamid":"76561198356288953","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":96035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2379,"playtime_at_review":74326,"last_played":1660541558},"language":"english","review":"My second favorite game of all time behind WoW.

En réalité j'aime beaucoup ce jeu et y jouer avec des amis. Il est sympa et propose de nombreux personnages et tueurs personnalisables avec skins et compétences pour faire son style avec des originaux mais d'autres issus de licences pour le plus grand plaisir de nombreux fans.\nMais alors, pourquoi un pouce rouge que je mes ? Tout simplement que depuis un moment, le matchmaking est pourri. J'ignore pourquoi, mais à présent je ne me retrouve que face soit des survivants de hauts levels ou des tueurs de rang presque 5 alors que je n'arrive pas à passer la barre des 15 ou 14. Résultat, impossible de s'améliorer, au contraire, le système du jeu fait que si vous n'arriver pas à faire assez de points, votre rang régresse. Donc, les forts restent avec les forts ou écrasent les plus faibles et ces derniers, en patissent.\nOu trouver le plaisir dedans ? On se fait \"rouler dessus\" j'ignore si d'autres ces pareils, mais c'est constant de mon côté et retire tout le plaisir de la game. Rajouter donc des adversaires aux level et toxic. \nJ'espère que ce commentaire avec un peu de chance, alertera et fera qu'un correctif soit proposer. Mais bon, je dois me faire des illusions sans doute.\n\nEDIT : J'ai étais patient, j'ai bien voulu donner une chance assez souvent à ce jeu. J'ai même étais STUPIDE !!! D'y mettre de l'argent. Mais la, ma patience est à bout. Les dévelopeurs n'ont rien à faire des joueurs, on est que des portes monnaies pour eux. Rien contre la toxicité, rien contre les cheaters, le plaisir et mort. Ils ne pensent qu'à sortir des DCL des skins payants et prennent des directions qui n'ont autre but que le pognon et non le bien être de leur joueur.
