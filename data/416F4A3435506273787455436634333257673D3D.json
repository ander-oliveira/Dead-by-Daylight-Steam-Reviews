The matchmaking is poor. People can leave when ever they want with no consequences. You can not be a lobby with friends unless you the friend are lucky enough to get into a lobby with them, the only way to be in a match with them is to create a private match. Because of this people lobby hop a lot and its very annoying. How the servers are set up. They are Peer to Peer servers which means that a player is hosting the server and that can cause poor connections. My main issue is balancing between the survivors and killer. The survivors can get really overpowered perks and the killer does not but that really does not matter when it is literately impossible to get away from the killer unless you have a flashlight, a board to block him, or if you are lucky a window to jump through but that is extremely slow, but other then that you can not out run him at all no matter what you do. A killer you can choose from is called the wraith and he can become invisable and he can barely be seen with only a bell toll to tell if hes cloaking or uncloaking which is very broken because if he put someone on a hook and cloak and uncloak repeatedly and that makes it impossible for anyone to unhook the person. The killer has a attack range much larger then he should, and can hit you much farther then he should and he can hit you through a window when you are not even close to the window. This game is a mess of bugs as well for the survivors and killer. The developers have not updated the game to fix issues like these for sometime which is a disappointment. Unless the developers fix these bugs and issues and it is well known that they are fixed. I would not recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1466984992,"timestamp_updated":1466984992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23845861","author":{"steamid":"76561198061668374","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":8724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":185,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1660526722},"language":"english","review":"It's a super fun game to play but it fails at what it's trying to do, you can't play with your friends unless you go into a private lobby and you earn nothing out of it.

a Jugarlo y con esta primera impresion, simplemente excelente, el juego clasico del gato y el raton, pero con un toque de terror como en las peliculas en donde te puedes sentir como aquel humano comun y corriente que busca escapar de un maniatico psicopata asesino, en donde basicamente es correr correr y correr para salvar tu vida en ese momento en el que tienes al asesino detras de ti, una parte fundamental que considero es que de preferencia debes de jugarlo con amigos, por cuestiones de lag, ya que al ser tu el asesino, en esta primera impresion que me dio es que tu mismo haces de host de la partida y si los demas jugadores no tienen una buena conexion o tu mismo, pues realmente no disfrutaras mucho la partida y la tematica de la misma, el mapa cambia aunque sean los mismos escenarios, es decir al parecer te cambian donde aparecen los generadores y donde aparecen los dichosos ganchos para colgar a los supervivientes, lo cual le a√±ade un punto a su favor ya que los mapas asi no se volveran monotonos y tendras como superviviente que explorar todo o la mayor parte del mapa para poder escapar y como asesino, tendras que estar en constante movimiento para estar al pendiente de los generadores y poder cazar a los supervivientes.\n\nAlgo que no me gusto en esta primera impresion del juego es que cuando derribas a los supervivientes y los cuelgas practicamente se pueden poner de acuerdo todos los supervivientes para aplicar por ejemplo lo siguiente, son 4 supervivientes, mientras uno quiza pueda estar buscando los generadores, los otros 3 te pueden trollear  en el sentido de que si tu como asesino derribas a uno, otro superviviente llega y se queda cerca donde tu puedes verlo y como asesino optas por ir tras el para derribarlo pero en ese tiempo, el tercer superviviente puede ayudar al que ya has derribado o al que ya hayas colgado en el gancho en un inicio y asi puedes estar dando vueltas y vueltas, correteando a cada superviviente que ves, ahi creo que quiza se pueda agregar algo para que los supervivientes tengan alguna limitacion en caso de optar por ese tipo de estrategia, ya que seria engorroso, aunque reitero aun es muy poco tiempo de jugarlo quiza si la tenga y necesite jugarlo mas para conocerla bien, bueno ya sin tanto rollo...\n\n*Graficos: Aceptables, realmente mantiene el concepto de un escenario de terror y el titulo cumple con ello.\n\n*Sonido: Acorde a la Tematica de Terror, similar a las peliculas de terror cuando los protagonistas tratan de escapar del asesino XD.\n\n*Multijugador: Ahi creo que pueden mejorar el tema de buscar partidas, insisto el ping de cada jugador es crucial para tener una buena partida, una partida que llene nuestras espectativas, si tienen algunos jugadores un ping malo, pues basicamente es partida ganada para el bando contrario es por ello que considero que el matchmaking tendria que contar con algunas caracteristicas mas para poder encontrar jugadores que tengan un buen ping y con ello todos los jugadores tanto asesinos como supervivientes puedan jugar sin ningun problema \"en pocas palabras\" que cuente con mas opciones para personalizar las partidas ya sea para unirte a una como superviviente o de igual manera para crearla siendo tu el asesino.\n\n*Jugabilidad: Sin duda alguna la jugabilidad es aceptable, tendras pocos botones para realizar las actividades ya sea como Superviviente o Asesino pero en termino general no tendras ningun problema con el movimiento e interaccion de las diferentes actividades que brinda el juego.\n\nMi Calificiacion que le doy al titulo lo Considero en 8.5/10, asi que lo recomiendo para que lo tengas en tu biblioteca y puedas viciar con tus amigos y demas personas a este titulo en linea y mas el que lo puedas aprovechar dentro de este periodo de ofertas de verano 2016.\n\nBueno eso es todo, lo seguire viciando y ahi veremos que tanto cambia mi percepsion y analisis del juego,

However, some issues that REALLY need addressing. Starting with getting your survivor higher than the starting rank which starts at 20 is nigh impossible. You have to get some really good luck or hope matchmaking pairs you with a bunch of low levels who don't know what they are doing. On the flipside of that as a killer it is REALLY easy to gain ranks as within a few days my killer had jumped from 20 to 15. \n\nAs soon as my killer hit 15 this is where it all went wrong. Mind you I had been grinding my killer as best as I could and still did not get any \"ultra rare\" perks. While matchmaking decided \"Hey you should have an entire team of survivors that have all of the ultra rare perks, start with toolkits specced for fixing generators and while were at it they really end every match by telling you how you are a noob or saying 'gg ez' \" you know because only the classiest of individuals use that kind of language.\n\nAlso, apparently my rank fifteen killer (with only two perk slots unlocked) should definitely be paired with Rank 7 - 13 ' s who clearly have played the ever living shit out of this game so they make it SUPER easy to just outmaneuver you at every turn. Especially because I wasn't given the opportunity for a perk that LITERALLY would make it so I could break through crates so fast they couldn't really use them for the ever infamous back and forth. Because nothing says balanced like \"unless you have this perk the player will literally slide back and forth over this crate until you try to smash it, then run away because they have a speed boost perk and you'll never find them.\"\n\nSeriously this game was kind of fun but the matchmaking is the WORST. THE WORST. They could do some stuff to balance it but instead of properly balancing it so that you don't sit at Rank 20 as a survivor until you get enough ultra rare perks you could juke the killer like he was an out of shape fat guy. The sad part is that one of the players who decided to tell me how \"he so easily beat me\" also wanted to talk about \"oh yeah I would have beat you without my perks.\" I am sorry but no. The game is defined by random luck and also whether or not you have grinded enough of getting your ass beat to FINALLY get the ability to just hopefully maybe have something decent enough to be one of the killers who just mobs a whole room and makes short work of them.\n\n\"Now Fen\" I hear some of you already typing in the comments \"there are daily missions to adjust for this.\"\n\nNormally, I agree the daily missions do adjust, unless of course you get some of the incredibly hard to get ones for instance, I have been sitting on a quest that requires me to kill a survivor by hand. Normally not a problem UNTIL you realize that in order to kill a survivor by hand you have to get an offering.

However, because of the matchmaking system, you can only play with friends in a private match, which is absoultely ridiculous. In private matches you do not gain XP, and unless you have four friends to play with, the team of survivors will be at a tremendous disadvantage.\n\nThere is really no reason for the game to keep you from playing with friends. If they want to prevent grinding, they could simply only let parties of friends play as survivors, with a completely different player as the killer. I will gladly change my review as soon as I am allowed to play with my friends in non-private parties, but until then I will not recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1466973197,"timestamp_updated":1466973197,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23840790","author":{"steamid":"76561198088695833","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1493649292},"language":"english","review":"Is not bad, but you guys need to create new mode so that its not getting boring.

Playing multiplayer with friends is now somewhat achievable most of the time. The lobby system is still flawed and the developers should look at the way player/killer allocation is dealt with in Evolve in stead of the current system of lobbys only being created by the killer. The game itself is tremendous fun and still manages to give me a fright when I've been careless.\n\nThis game deserves a positive rating. Unfortumately, in its current state, I'm giving a negative one. Why they would release a miltipayer game without the ability to join your friends is ludicrous. I'd love to know the thinking behind that one. Apparantly a fix for that is on its way so I will likely revisit and change my review when it does. If joining your friends isn't an issue then you will have a lot of (repetitive) fun.","timestamp_created":1466972018,"timestamp_updated":1471502877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23840188","author":{"steamid":"76561198079381190","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1056,"last_played":1649046151},"language":"english","review":"An overall great game, \n\nYes there are some bug fixes and things that they need to add but just give it time and they will fix it.\n\nMajor complaint is that the ranking system is broken, I play as the killer whenever I can and it is the worst when i'm about to hook someone and they just disconnect, keeping their rank.

those that are into the online multiplayer horror genre based on possibly film such as Nightmare on Elm Street (Although, it appears to be set in real location, it could be mistaken for some nightmare realm & those things that appear around the hanging hooks remind me of Feddy's razor fingered gloves!),  Friday the 13th/Texas Chainsaw Massacre /Halloween, (Just look at who the killers almost appear to be....) \n\nI could almsot right off my impression of playing this game as cheesy, because each level is retricted to some locality (Familar looking if your familar with any of thos films above. ) that are all diffrent, but lokced within this decrepit brick wall that can only be breahced at either one of the three elctronic contrlled gates. That only open after four to five of the engine generators  powered lights have repired and switched on.\n\nNot as easy asi it sounds, but very simple. It's the same at each location, there is useally a building in the centre, with a basment where box filed with useful tools (Flashlighht, Tool kits, med kits...) can found and sometimes they can found in other parts outside. amongst oversized debris, or brick wals often arranged to almost shelter those that are unlucky enough to be running from the killer. Four young pople, two guys, two girls & one killer hunting down & sometimes assisted by some suprenatural means, artifact anfd there is kore to know.....\n\nI thought it could be way better, like put in bigger setting with more things to do before they are allowe to go.

RIP\n\n-i also found an exploit that has since been patched, but might also lead to other exploits being found. i was the last alive, eevrybody had escaped, i was just trolling the trapper killer at the exit by teasing him, he would just sit away and watch me run in and out of the exit gate doorway, and each time i crossed the threshold, since he was so close to me just chilling, i would get 250xp for escaping, i did this a few times before i had noticed what was going on, idk if the killer was aware and just letting me farm it, but when i realized it i finished the game and stopped exploiting it, i tried this again after i had seen them update it for the first time and it has since been fixed, so i cant be the only one who found this out\n\n-i honestly have only played 2 gamnes as the killer, just as the lobbys sometimes can take a while to find people, i personally like the survivor, but the killer is very fun too, i just enjoy the rush i get from a survival horror game with almost no offensive moves (i loved alien isolation) and the feeling of you have to work swift, in a uniformed order to achieve and get out, i love helping people off hooks and just reverse stalking the killer.\n\n-lastly, the wraith killer. he is imo head and shoulders above the others as far as how good and useful he is. he can track better, and he can go predator style and use an invisibility cloak for an unlimited time to not be seen, but whats worse is unless you have certain perks equipped, youre heartbeat wont inform you of him being close, meaning he can literally sit right behind you, and unless you see that invisible shadow figure he emits during invisibility, than he can turn visible in about 2.5 secs and rape you, to me that seems a little much, as they just go invisible and sit gens and reappear to fuck somebody up, just to go invisible again, and perks that can trump cloaking abilities are useless as fuck, an aura mist appears in a 45 degree cone when looking within 12 meters of the killer? dafuq? that tells me useless info especially since they can move EVEN FASTER in cloaking ability, about 1.5x faster, but cannot attack or perform any actions, so they cant hit you, but are alot faster and can just run behind you and uncloak to swing at you. \n\n\nall in all, get this game, its alot of fun for its price, and hopefully they will allow party systems and whatnot to be implemented","timestamp_created":1466964892,"timestamp_updated":1466964892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23836635","author":{"steamid":"76561198238980444","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2708,"last_played":1636503612},"language":"english","review":"Really awesome Game!

Add a Zone where the Killer has to stay like 10 - 20 m away from the Trap because most of the People (Killers) always waiting infront of me untill i die so the others could not help me.\n3. Add more Clothes for the Skins.\n4. Add the option for a Party so you can play with Online with Friends and some Strangers.\n5. Add more Skins for the Killer and the Survivors. \n6.
