The matchmaking is poor. People can leave when ever they want with no consequences. You can not be a lobby with friends unless you the friend are lucky enough to get into a lobby with them, the only way to be in a match with them is to create a private match. Because of this people lobby hop a lot and its very annoying. How the servers are set up. They are Peer to Peer servers which means that a player is hosting the server and that can cause poor connections. My main issue is balancing between the survivors and killer. The survivors can get really overpowered perks and the killer does not but that really does not matter when it is literately impossible to get away from the killer unless you have a flashlight, a board to block him, or if you are lucky a window to jump through but that is extremely slow, but other then that you can not out run him at all no matter what you do. A killer you can choose from is called the wraith and he can become invisable and he can barely be seen with only a bell toll to tell if hes cloaking or uncloaking which is very broken because if he put someone on a hook and cloak and uncloak repeatedly and that makes it impossible for anyone to unhook the person. The killer has a attack range much larger then he should, and can hit you much farther then he should and he can hit you through a window when you are not even close to the window. This game is a mess of bugs as well for the survivors and killer. The developers have not updated the game to fix issues like these for sometime which is a disappointment. Unless the developers fix these bugs and issues and it is well known that they are fixed. I would not recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1466984992,"timestamp_updated":1466984992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23845861","author":{"steamid":"76561198061668374","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":8724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":185,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1660526722},"language":"english","review":"It's a super fun game to play but it fails at what it's trying to do, you can't play with your friends unless you go into a private lobby and you earn nothing out of it.

a Jugarlo y con esta primera impresion, simplemente excelente, el juego clasico del gato y el raton, pero con un toque de terror como en las peliculas en donde te puedes sentir como aquel humano comun y corriente que busca escapar de un maniatico psicopata asesino, en donde basicamente es correr correr y correr para salvar tu vida en ese momento en el que tienes al asesino detras de ti, una parte fundamental que considero es que de preferencia debes de jugarlo con amigos, por cuestiones de lag, ya que al ser tu el asesino, en esta primera impresion que me dio es que tu mismo haces de host de la partida y si los demas jugadores no tienen una buena conexion o tu mismo, pues realmente no disfrutaras mucho la partida y la tematica de la misma, el mapa cambia aunque sean los mismos escenarios, es decir al parecer te cambian donde aparecen los generadores y donde aparecen los dichosos ganchos para colgar a los supervivientes, lo cual le añade un punto a su favor ya que los mapas asi no se volveran monotonos y tendras como superviviente que explorar todo o la mayor parte del mapa para poder escapar y como asesino, tendras que estar en constante movimiento para estar al pendiente de los generadores y poder cazar a los supervivientes.\n\nAlgo que no me gusto en esta primera impresion del juego es que cuando derribas a los supervivientes y los cuelgas practicamente se pueden poner de acuerdo todos los supervivientes para aplicar por ejemplo lo siguiente, son 4 supervivientes, mientras uno quiza pueda estar buscando los generadores, los otros 3 te pueden trollear  en el sentido de que si tu como asesino derribas a uno, otro superviviente llega y se queda cerca donde tu puedes verlo y como asesino optas por ir tras el para derribarlo pero en ese tiempo, el tercer superviviente puede ayudar al que ya has derribado o al que ya hayas colgado en el gancho en un inicio y asi puedes estar dando vueltas y vueltas, correteando a cada superviviente que ves, ahi creo que quiza se pueda agregar algo para que los supervivientes tengan alguna limitacion en caso de optar por ese tipo de estrategia, ya que seria engorroso, aunque reitero aun es muy poco tiempo de jugarlo quiza si la tenga y necesite jugarlo mas para conocerla bien, bueno ya sin tanto rollo...\n\n*Graficos: Aceptables, realmente mantiene el concepto de un escenario de terror y el titulo cumple con ello.\n\n*Sonido: Acorde a la Tematica de Terror, similar a las peliculas de terror cuando los protagonistas tratan de escapar del asesino XD.\n\n*Multijugador: Ahi creo que pueden mejorar el tema de buscar partidas, insisto el ping de cada jugador es crucial para tener una buena partida, una partida que llene nuestras espectativas, si tienen algunos jugadores un ping malo, pues basicamente es partida ganada para el bando contrario es por ello que considero que el matchmaking tendria que contar con algunas caracteristicas mas para poder encontrar jugadores que tengan un buen ping y con ello todos los jugadores tanto asesinos como supervivientes puedan jugar sin ningun problema \"en pocas palabras\" que cuente con mas opciones para personalizar las partidas ya sea para unirte a una como superviviente o de igual manera para crearla siendo tu el asesino.\n\n*Jugabilidad: Sin duda alguna la jugabilidad es aceptable, tendras pocos botones para realizar las actividades ya sea como Superviviente o Asesino pero en termino general no tendras ningun problema con el movimiento e interaccion de las diferentes actividades que brinda el juego.\n\nMi Calificiacion que le doy al titulo lo Considero en 8.5/10, asi que lo recomiendo para que lo tengas en tu biblioteca y puedas viciar con tus amigos y demas personas a este titulo en linea y mas el que lo puedas aprovechar dentro de este periodo de ofertas de verano 2016.\n\nBueno eso es todo, lo seguire viciando y ahi veremos que tanto cambia mi percepsion y analisis del juego,

However, some issues that REALLY need addressing. Starting with getting your survivor higher than the starting rank which starts at 20 is nigh impossible. You have to get some really good luck or hope matchmaking pairs you with a bunch of low levels who don't know what they are doing. On the flipside of that as a killer it is REALLY easy to gain ranks as within a few days my killer had jumped from 20 to 15. \n\nAs soon as my killer hit 15 this is where it all went wrong. Mind you I had been grinding my killer as best as I could and still did not get any \"ultra rare\" perks. While matchmaking decided \"Hey you should have an entire team of survivors that have all of the ultra rare perks, start with toolkits specced for fixing generators and while were at it they really end every match by telling you how you are a noob or saying 'gg ez' \" you know because only the classiest of individuals use that kind of language.\n\nAlso, apparently my rank fifteen killer (with only two perk slots unlocked) should definitely be paired with Rank 7 - 13 ' s who clearly have played the ever living shit out of this game so they make it SUPER easy to just outmaneuver you at every turn. Especially because I wasn't given the opportunity for a perk that LITERALLY would make it so I could break through crates so fast they couldn't really use them for the ever infamous back and forth. Because nothing says balanced like \"unless you have this perk the player will literally slide back and forth over this crate until you try to smash it, then run away because they have a speed boost perk and you'll never find them.\"\n\nSeriously this game was kind of fun but the matchmaking is the WORST. THE WORST. They could do some stuff to balance it but instead of properly balancing it so that you don't sit at Rank 20 as a survivor until you get enough ultra rare perks you could juke the killer like he was an out of shape fat guy. The sad part is that one of the players who decided to tell me how \"he so easily beat me\" also wanted to talk about \"oh yeah I would have beat you without my perks.\" I am sorry but no. The game is defined by random luck and also whether or not you have grinded enough of getting your ass beat to FINALLY get the ability to just hopefully maybe have something decent enough to be one of the killers who just mobs a whole room and makes short work of them.\n\n\"Now Fen\" I hear some of you already typing in the comments \"there are daily missions to adjust for this.\"\n\nNormally, I agree the daily missions do adjust, unless of course you get some of the incredibly hard to get ones for instance, I have been sitting on a quest that requires me to kill a survivor by hand. Normally not a problem UNTIL you realize that in order to kill a survivor by hand you have to get an offering. WHICH you can only get that offering if it HAPPENS to show up in your 'blood weave'\n\nFrankly, I bought this game to tide me over until Friday the 13th is a reasonable price and honestly I am starting to regret it. I mean in order to make my Killer have not perfect enemies I had to intentionally throw several matches to lose enough ranks that I was back to playing against people that had a few perks and didn't have a perfect set of ultra rare's with perfect items and equipments.","timestamp_created":1466977847,"timestamp_updated":1498328438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508586525917053223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23842982","author":{"steamid":"76561198133649965","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1594483632},"language":"english","review":"I like the game overall.\nBut the biggest issue with it so far, is that if you want tp play with only one friend, you can't have a party queue.

The game itself is tremendous fun and still manages to give me a fright when I've been careless.\n\nThis game deserves a positive rating. Unfortumately, in its current state, I'm giving a negative one. Why they would release a miltipayer game without the ability to join your friends is ludicrous.

Access而不是北美那家著名的发行商，意为抢先体验。代表作：《DayZ》或《方舟：生存进化》。不过今天要说的这款游戏《黎明杀机》却与上述游戏不尽相同。《黎明杀机》在6月份突然杀出，并且在各大直播网站迅速蹿红。甚至在欧美最大的直播网站Twitch热度一度紧逼《反恐精英：全球攻势》、《Dota 2》等热门电子竞技游戏。这款乍看之下小成本也没有雄厚背景的游戏究竟有什么魔力激起如此的波澜呢？\n\n\n[h1]画面与表现力[/h1]\n\n暗夜心慌，杀机四伏。\n\n虽然本作是一个小成本游戏，不过采用了著名的虚幻4引擎。因此本作在部分视觉效果上的造诣还是值得肯定的。游戏所有的地图均设定在可见度极低的深夜时刻，游戏环境里散布着各式各样堆砌的小件杂物、半身高的杂草丛与玉米堆、破落的农舍。略显破落感的场景也给游戏平添了一份压抑与神秘感。加上零星闪烁的摇曳灯光与浓雾弥漫的环境特效，可以说《黎明杀机》在刻画环境气氛上下的功夫十分到位。不过如果要是细看，会发现许多农舍和杂物的建模显得十分粗糙，此外本作的帧率表现也谈不上有多稳定，算是这些小成本制作游戏的通病吧。\n\n除了画面方面，音效同样是提升环境气氛的重要一环，某种意义上本作的音效比起画面更为到位。幽寂月光投射过林间迷雾，看似宁静的表象之下却暗流涌动。林间细碎的微弱风声，吱吱转动的发电机，受到惊讶发出不详叫声的乌鸦。这些微弱的音效提示着暗藏的杀机逐渐显现——最终引出那令人不安的脚步声，宛若无情的死神敲响收割生命的丧钟，又或是加速转动的嘈杂电锯声，这些逐渐逼近的恐惧与压迫感让幸存者能听见自己心脏加速跳动的声音，甚至是躲藏时微弱的喘息声也让你紧张无比。而这正是《黎明杀机》时刻不在演绎的恐惧重奏。\n\n[h1]可玩性[/h1]\n\n恐惧与压抑并存的“猫鼠”游戏\n\n本作提供的游玩模式可谓单一，仅有一种。因此专注于这方面的体验也是制作组的首要目标之一。游戏提供的主要模式为1杀手VS 4位人类生存者，杀手的目标是献祭所有的人类，人类唯一的目的则是逃出生天，目标相当简单易懂，不过要向玩家阐述本作最像什么，那必然是著名的恐怖片系列《13号星期5（也被称为黑色星期五）》，游戏阴森的环境，目标以及杀手的面具外观也很容易让人联想起片中恶名昭彰的杀手杰森。（不过本作并不是该电影的游戏版，实际上《13号星期5》另有一个众筹游戏存在）\n\n不过要从游戏机制说起的话，这种非对称式的对抗设计，4V1的规模和捉迷藏似的游戏模式也许会让人想起之前2K Games的《进化》。只不过在本作中，攻防的立场是不会变化的，幸存者无法反客为主攻击杀手，这也让比赛中可能存在的变数被缩小了，不过这也方便于官方调控比赛的平衡数据走向。不过实际上，本作的游戏规则在很多地方还是值得深究的，并且杀手与幸存者的游戏体验可以说是大相径庭，因此也需要分开来说。\n\n\n\n幸存者的最终目标仅有一个，逃离追杀。而实现这个目标的手段也很简单，玩家必须激活地图上各处的发电机来打开紧闭的大门并逃脱（当然，只剩一个人的时候有地窖可以选择）。而这些发电机的位置通常比较分散，而要完全修复一个发电机也需要一定的时间，在修复发电机的时候玩家处于一个没有防备并且比较暴露的状态。于是出于本能，玩家通常会处于高度精神集中状态，一边观察周遭环境一般祈祷杀手并不在附近，然而修发电机的过程并不是那么一帆风顺。在修的过程中，会不时的在小屏幕上随机出现快速的QTE转盘，如果你按错了，发电机则会发生一次小型爆炸（玩家俗称爆米花）。除了让你的修复条倒退一截外，巨大的声响还会给杀手标出发电机爆炸的具体位置。这种平常被玩家当作过街老鼠骂的QTE系统却与本作契合的非常好，正因为玩家需要花费大量精力观察环境的同时，你又不得不分神来注意屏幕上时刻出现的QTE条，一心难以二用。加上不知道杀手具体在何方的恐惧，而人在高度精神集中的情况下受到的突然惊吓与恐惧也会增幅，这个设计就显得十分巧妙。\n\n（剩余部分限于字数限制在完整版中）\n\n\n[h1]一款真正应该打上Early Access标签的半成品[/h1]\n\n坦白的说，像《黎明杀机》这种打着恐怖生存旗号的捉迷藏游戏在Steam上并不是唯一的，在此之前也有一些像是《Dead Realm（死亡境界）》、《Damned(诅咒)》之类的游戏。但与它们不同的是，《黎明杀机》虽然有过一次Beta测试，但相距正式发售时间并不长，而前者们则经过了相当长的Alpha阶段测试或者说Early Access阶段。\n\n这里不得不提Early Access这个标签，也就是抢先体验。这个标签在近年来如同雨后春笋一般冒出来的生存游戏身上时常可见，如同抢先体验的字面意思一样：这类游戏通常处于一个较低的完整度，但游戏开发者通常会在这个阶段抛出游戏的核心玩法，满足那些迫不及待想要玩到游戏的玩家，同时官方也可以针对早期的评价和玩家反馈来进一步改进游戏质量，直到其正式上市。也就是说，这类游戏虽然能用来尝鲜体验，但整体素质尚存在许多未打磨过的瑕疵。\n\n\n\n[h1]总结[/h1]\n\n《黎明杀机》是一款小格局，低成本的恐怖生存多人对抗游戏，但制作商Behaviour巧妙的利用并不宽裕的资源将多种元素融合在一起，制造出了规则简单却令人肾上腺素飙升，心跳加快的恐怖生存竞赛体验。不论是化身嗜血杀手独自追捕手无寸铁的生存者，还是作为生存者在黑暗压抑的环境氛围下小心翼翼躲开杀手逃出生天，两者之间独特的体验都令人难忘。但同时与那些其他小制作游戏一样，在平衡性、BUG、系统机制、优化以及其他一些细枝末节的地方上来说，本作缺乏足够的打磨。《黎明杀机》相比那些挂着抢先体验的游戏来说，半成品感更胜一筹。游戏体验虽然刺激但是模式单一缺乏变化，如果制作组能给予该作更多的打磨时间会更好，但如今只能期待制作商能保持不断后续更新，让本作不至于和其他小众生存类游戏一样“昙花一现”。","timestamp_created":1466970781,"timestamp_updated":1467286985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":49,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.823534786701202393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23839690","author":{"steamid":"76561198101361876","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":15182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3449,"last_played":1656356546},"language":"russian","review":"10

RIP\n\n-i also found an exploit that has since been patched, but might also lead to other exploits being found. i was the last alive, eevrybody had escaped, i was just trolling the trapper killer at the exit by teasing him, he would just sit away and watch me run in and out of the exit gate doorway, and each time i crossed the threshold, since he was so close to me just chilling, i would get 250xp for escaping, i did this a few times before i had noticed what was going on, idk if the killer was aware and just letting me farm it, but when i realized it i finished the game and stopped exploiting it, i tried this again after i had seen them update it for the first time and it has since been fixed, so i cant be the only one who found this out\n\n-i honestly have only played 2 gamnes as the killer, just as the lobbys sometimes can take a while to find people, i personally like the survivor, but the killer is very fun too, i just enjoy the rush i get from a survival horror game with almost no offensive moves (i loved alien isolation) and the feeling of you have to work swift, in a uniformed order to achieve and get out, i love helping people off hooks and just reverse stalking the killer.\n\n-lastly, the wraith killer. he is imo head and shoulders above the others as far as how good and useful he is. he can track better, and he can go predator style and use an invisibility cloak for an unlimited time to not be seen, but whats worse is unless you have certain perks equipped, youre heartbeat wont inform you of him being close, meaning he can literally sit right behind you, and unless you see that invisible shadow figure he emits during invisibility, than he can turn visible in about 2.5 secs and rape you, to me that seems a little much, as they just go invisible and sit gens and reappear to fuck somebody up, just to go invisible again, and perks that can trump cloaking abilities are useless as fuck, an aura mist appears in a 45 degree cone when looking within 12 meters of the killer? dafuq? that tells me useless info especially since they can move EVEN FASTER in cloaking ability, about 1.5x faster, but cannot attack or perform any actions, so they cant hit you, but are alot faster and can just run behind you and uncloak to swing at you. \n\n\nall in all, get this game, its alot of fun for its price, and hopefully they will allow party systems and whatnot to be implemented","timestamp_created":1466964892,"timestamp_updated":1466964892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23836635","author":{"steamid":"76561198238980444","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2708,"last_played":1636503612},"language":"english","review":"Really awesome Game!

Add more Traps for the Killer everytime i catch someone i need to find a Trap that is too far away from me so the Survivor can Wiggle and run away.\n2. Add a Zone where the Killer has to stay like 10 - 20 m away from the Trap because most of the People (Killers) always waiting infront of me untill i die so the others could not help me.\n3. Add more Clothes for the Skins.\n4. Add the option for a Party so you can play with Online with Friends and some Strangers.\n5. Add more Skins for the Killer and the Survivors. \n6. Add the option for the First-Person mode.\n7. I found a Bug that makes Survivors Invisible. It happens when you are on a chop and its 1 sec left untill you die and a Survivor comes to help you.\n\nI have some more but just make sure you add this please!
