Il se joue uniquement en multi online, ce qui implique une certaine exigence quant à la stabilité du jeu. \nJ'avais lancé une première évaluation au bout de 150 heures de jeu, déconseillant l'achat, mais les mois ont passé, et à force de mises à jour et de corrections, d'optimisation et de renouvellement de contenu, aujourd'hui j'approche des 650 heures et je vais tendre le pouce vers le haut et vous expliquer pourquoi.\n\nPetit explicatif du jeu :\nVous incarnez un survivant parmi plusieurs personnages disponibles (actuellement au nombre de 10, incluant les 3 personnages issus de dlc payants), qui se retrouve, en compagnie de 3 acolytes inconnus, dans un environnement désolé, hostile, avec la désagréable sensation que quelque chose leur veut du mal, et pas qu'un peu. Vous explorez les lieux et découvrez que vous êtes enfermés dans un petit morceau d'univers macabre, et que deux portes de sortie ont besoin d'être alimentées en courant pour pouvoir les emprunter, et se tirer d'ici le plus vite possible. Vous rencontrez vos camarades (des autres joueurs) tous aussi perdus que vous, mais avec l'envie débordante de rester en vie. Vous découvrez des générateurs (appelés parfois moteurs ou \"gen\") désactivés qu'il faut réparer pour pouvoir alimenter les portes de sortie. Vous devrez en réparer 5 pour vous assurer que le courant généré soit suffisant. Mais, alors que vous commencez à bidouiller les câbles, vous frissonnez, votre coeur se met à battre de plus en plus vite, quelque chose ne va pas...\nVous vous retournez, et voilà que s'abat sur vous une machette, une hache, ou pire encore, la chaîne enragée d'une tronçonneuse. Quelqu'un tient absolument à ce que vous restiez là, et que vous souffriez le plus possible. Le tueur (également un joueur) est aussi motivé que vous à en découdre. Et il va vous en faire baver à travers ses différents et effroyables pouvoirs.\n\nPetit récapitualitf du mode survivant :\n- vous êtes 4 joueurs contre 1 tueur\n- vous devez réparer des générateurs pour pouvoir activer les portes de sortie et vous enfuir\n- vous disposez de compétences uniques et de compétences partagées pour vous aider dans vos actions\n- soyez discrets, le sprint, les cris, les actions réalisées trop fortement ou maladroitement avertissent le tueur de votre présence avec une effrayante précision\n- vous pouvez sauver des survivants mis à terre, ou suspendus au crochet, ce qui vous donne des points bonus et permet de rester en nombre pour s'enfuir au plus vite\n- les points gagnés en partie servent à améliorer votre personnage, à travers un arbre de compétences appelée Toile. La toile vous permettra l'apprentissage et la transmission de compétences d'un survivant à l'autre, mais aussi l'acquisition d'objets et d'offrandes qui faciliteront votre survie.\n\n\nPetit récapitulatif du mode Tueur\n- 9 tueurs disponibles (dont 4 en dlc payants)\n- vous êtes seul contre 4 survivants\n- votre but est de tous les tuer, pour satisfaire l'Entité démoniaque qui contrôle l'environnement, et dévorera leurs âmes.\n- vos pouvoirs permettront de piéger les lieux, tendre des traquenards en vous téléportant, balancer des hachettes à distance... bref... utilisez-les pour malmener vos proies et maximiser vos opportunités de meurtre\n- tout comme les survivants, vous avez la Toile qui vous permettra d'apprendre et de transmettre vos compétences à d'autres tueurs.\n\n----- Ambiance ------\nLe jeu bénéficie d'une ambiance sonore extraordinaire, pour ne pas dire délicieuse. Les effets sonores, et les musiques sont très prenantes, immersives. Le jeu peut faire très peur lorsqu'on le découvre, car tout tourne autour de la poursuite et du cache-cache, on est très vite sous pression. Avec le temps on se relâche bien, mais le jeu réussit à nous captiver suffisamment pour bien s'ancrer dans les parties, et éveiller nos sens autour de la survie / chasse. Dans mon expérience de joueuse, j'ai rarement goûté à quelque chose d'aussi raffiné. Un grand bravo à l'équipe, ainsi qu'au compositeur Michel F. April pour la soundtrack du jeu, également disponible dans le magasin Steam.\n\nCôté graphisme, il y a du caractère, sans que cela soit trop poussé (en terme de texture). Les jeux de lumière et les couleurs me semblent intelligemment travaillés pour renforcer l'immersion. En fait, je ne trouve pas que le jeu ait besoin de graphismes ultra réalistes, mais ne nous leurrons pas, il est quand même joli. Les expressions des survivants apeurés sont parfois hilarantes et font l'objet de beaucoup de captures d'écran dans le hub de la communauté du jeu. Il y a encore des bugs graphiques qui persistent, notamment dans l'animation des cheveux des survivants. Mais le tout tient plutôt bien la route. Les tueurs ont des looks effrayants.\n\nPar ailleurs (petit aparté), Dead By Daylight met à l'honneur deux tueurs célèbres dans le milieu cinématographique : Michael Myers (Halloween) et Leatherface (Massacre à la tronçonneuse).\nCette évaluation est écrite au lendemain de la sortie de Leatherface (15/09/2017), et je peux vous dire que ce dernier ne donne pas envie de lui faire des câlins !\nDans les dlc payants, il y a des tenues supplémentaires pour les personnages, mais aussi des survivants et des tueurs additionnels. Comme c'est un jeu purement multi et qu'il ne nécessite pas d'abonnement, les dlc payants sont un moyen pour les développeurs de continuer d'être rémunérés. Les joueurs sans dlc et avec dlc payants peuvent jouer ensemble sans souci.\n\n--- Communauté ---\nComme tout jeu exclusivement online, on y trouve de tout. Globalement les gens aiment beaucoup le jeu et font leur maximum pour bien s'amuser ensemble. Il y aura toujours des individus pour pleurer et hurler, des gens qui trollent, quelques-uns qui trichent, mais depuis peu, les développeurs ont instauré le bannissement, ce qui réduit tout doucement l'envie de transgresser les règles fondamentales. \nNe vous inquiètez pas, si vous débutez, vous allez mourir, ou vous n'allez tuer personne. Il va falloir vous entraîner, n'hésitez pas à rechercher des teamspeak ou discord communautaires pour progresser rapidement, il y en a pour chaque pays en farfouillant un peu. Le hub steam de la communauté est très fourni également, et ceux qui aiment les fan-arts vont se régaler. Bref, la communauté est très active, et ça fait plaisir !\n\nDead By Daylight est simple à jouer dans le principe, mais comme il s'agit de parties à 5 joueurs dans des environnements générés en semi-procédural, et avec des builds de personnages différents, la rejouabilité est énorme et l'adaptation n'est pas toujours évidente. N'ayez pas peur de perdre, voyez cela comme un apprentissage et tout ira vite mieux dans votre progression et votre plaisir de jeu. Si vous êtes d'un tempérament très susceptible, je vais être claire avec vous : Ce jeu va être un vrai cancer ! ;-p\n\n\nConclusion\nDead By Daylight est un jeu vraiment vraiment fun pour ceux qui aiment les ambiances slasher ou bon film d'horreur bien gore, c'est très nerveux, aussi bien en survivant qu'en tueur, et la bande-son bien travaillée accentue l'immersion. Il y a une bonne rejouabilité, ce qui est essentiel pour un jeu qui ne fait que du multi-online. Je trouve la communauté (anglophone et francophone tout du moins) très intéressante, et souvent bienveillante.\nIl ne faut cependant pas oublier que le jeu a récemment soufflé sa première bougie, et qu'il a beaucoup évolué par rapport à ses débuts. Et heureusement ! Le jeu a longtemps souffert de bugs catastrophiques empêchant la connexion aux lobbys, les déconnexions brutales en pleine partie, les safe-spots de survivants etc... Cela a longtemps nui à l'image du jeu, d'ailleurs ma première évaluation était teintée de ces dysfonctionnements. Les développeurs continuent à beaucoup travailler là-dessus, et petit à petit, le jeu s'assainit. C'est une bonne chose.\n\nÀ découvrir et déguster, donc ;)","timestamp_created":1481663906,"timestamp_updated":1505465330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540720760822296143","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28350163","author":{"steamid":"76561198074979056","num_games_owned":865,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":41535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":274,"playtime_at_review":20349,"last_played":1660472293},"language":"italian","review":"É dai tempi di League Of Legends che non assistevo ad un fenomeno del genere, davvero.

I'll be hitting the game more heavily. As I only have 4 hours of play at the writing of this, take my review as you will.\n\nA key hallmark of Horror movies is the bad guy doesn't always win. In fact, the bad guy seldom wins. Sure they kill a few people but in the end the plucky heroes usually manage to down the adversary. I recognize this and find it to hold true in this game.\n\nSo far I've played one game as a survivor and a lot as a killer. I tried out a few of the killers and at low levels they are all kind of samey and lackluster. The game uses a leveling based system and as you level you will open up perks. As with any game with a leveling system, this means the opening bits of the game are often a bit grindy. Was that the case here? So far, most definitely.\n\nI bought the Halloween Update with the game as honestly I just wanted to play out being Michael Myers. So I haven't experienced much of what others are claiming about the game so far.  The Shape, as he is known, is a power house in the game just as he was in his own movie title.\n\nSo far I've had a lot of fun and intend to keep playing. I'll update this review if my opinion changes but as of now I think it is a great game that captures a lot of the feel of a horror movie.\n\nThere will be people complaining about \"not winning\" but... Bad guys usually don't win. That's just the nature of the beast. The killer is scary one on one, but if you all gather round and confront him you'll start to see the killer is usually just some jerk in a mask.\n\nSo the key to having fun as a killer, from my perspective so far, is to not hinge your entire skill advancement or joy on ONLY winning. The game gives you points on how well you stalk your prey, how often you chase the survivors, how often you hit them only to retreat. Make it dramatic. Go win a movie award for best on screen killer. I dig it. But I'm also a child of the late 80's/early 90's, I grew up watching Freddie Kruger stabbing Johnny Depp through a waterbed. I might be the target audience here.","timestamp_created":1481639404,"timestamp_updated":1481639404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28344019","author":{"steamid":"76561198029739609","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":8721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4906,"last_played":1608888616},"language":"german","review":"Gruselhorror im COOP Verkleidung\nAdrenalinbrunnen für zwischendurch : )","timestamp_created":1481639019,"timestamp_updated":1481639019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28343744","author":{"steamid":"76561198322950600","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":68285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66827,"last_played":1642388041},"language":"thai","review":"กูเล่นเก่งเกินหรอถึงโดน...","timestamp_created":1481637837,"timestamp_updated":1558004023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502486705780029297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28343429","author":{"steamid":"76561198287803878","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1640549648},"language":"russian","review":"Раньше всё было нормально , но теперь мне пишет что нету dx 11 хоя он есть и видеокарта всё поддерживает","timestamp_created":1481636487,"timestamp_updated":1481636487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28343397","author":{"steamid":"76561198010401772","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1608433675},"language":"koreana","review":"이 게임 밸런스가 썩 좋은편이 아님. 맵디자인도 좀 엉망임.\n넘어뜨리는 장애물이 워낙 많아 잘만 이용하고 도망만 잘 다니면 \n다른 3명이 발전기 다 돌릴동안 안잡힐수도 있음. . \n게임에 능숙해지면 살인마 데리고 놈.","timestamp_created":1481636364,"timestamp_updated":1481636364,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28343355","author":{"steamid":"76561198251173870","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7487,"last_played":1658312058},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏在慢慢变好，希望官方能架设一个延迟低点的国服吧，求求了~","timestamp_created":1481636205,"timestamp_updated":1620747570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53313744068145752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28343347","author":{"steamid":"76561198085536375","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1088,"playtime_at_review":5228,"last_played":1660419314},"language":"english","review":"Great game, investested 100 hours until this very moment and will keep going.

I was really hyped -at the beginning. now it's sadly just new, over prized content every now and then without fixing the old known bugs. This whole shrine thing is complete nonsense and the perks you can \"buy\" there are ridiculously expensive as well. you guys better should be working on letting the players choose the maps on their own when they're on a private match. because right now it's like a chance 1 out of 100 times to get the new map. And we had to pay more than 6 bucks for it. not cool. plus.. why the hell can't you disarm traps anymore when they're in front of a hook? I mean, c'mon, I accept the fact that you can't punch the shit outta the killers, and just have to run away and hide (that's what makes this game kinda cool) but leaving the survivors almost no chance from escaping after they got catched (especially by the trapper) is just not cool. then at least make it possible to escape faster from the hook on our own, or add the ability to open chests while you're on the ground and to heals yourself with a medkit^^ that would make it all much more fair. \nI still recommend this game. cause it is fun. and it's different from all those killer online games out there.
