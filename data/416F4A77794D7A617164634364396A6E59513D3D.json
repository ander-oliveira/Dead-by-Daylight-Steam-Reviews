Even during beta it was 75% of the game, and after initial release remained so. The Devs definitely told us it was being worked on so that a thing?\n\nOnce you do find a game it has many interesting strategies. Let me show you the progression and types of strategies held within this game.\n\nSurvivor\n----------\nBeginning Player:\nConstantly causes the generator to blow up by missing Skill Checks. Then likes to run everywhere as it is definitely the quickest means to go from generator to generator. Also seeing teammates get hooked means killer is over there and well, no thanks. Also when you are hooked there tends to be more rage for teammates not helping you.\n\nIntermediate Player:\nYou learn running leaves scratch marks so you walk around the outside the map to avoid detection. You learn there are jukes spots and infinites and utilities them all to make sure you don't get hooked. At this points you have semi-decent perks so use them for a little extra point generation and focus on doing generators and getting out. Anyone getting hooked is their fault, and unless the killer goes across the map really determines if you will help. If you do help anyone then any exit windows/pallets are your property. Self preservation is the main focus as you want to reach Rank 1.\n\nExperienced Player:\nYou know a majority of the maps and know where to run the killer to avoid being hit for an extended period of time. You learn to utilize your items and addons to benefit yourself and the team, and you work majority of the generators while remaining unseen by the killers. Saving people depends on how close you are, but within sprinting distance usually will help everything short of facecamping. You also accept taking a hit from the killer really isn't the end of the world.\n\nVeteran Player (200-300+ hours):\nRank 1 means nothing. You know all the maps very well, and tend to farm killers for boldness points. Using a flashlight pretty much guarantees you full boldness, and you don't use every single pallet knowing you may need it later. Saving people becomes much more fluid and means more points so you tend to contribute to most of the saves. You also tend to lose killers very well by hiding or using juke points along with a sprint burst to escape without to much hassle most of the time. You also learn that tanking hits is a very good strategy to ensure survival of your teammates. Being one hit just means less taunting or downtime between kiting the killer. Also every item can be used effectively (medkit - healing yourself quickly to jump back into action, toolkit to help get the others out quicker, map to not worry so much about gennys but to keep the killer busy).\n\nKiller\n----------\nBaseline is so variant as a killer let me just express the details of what it means to be a killer in this game.\n\nThe survivors will infinite you. \n-Atleast 1 will do it all game.\n\nSurvive with Friends will be a pain in the ass because they will constantly be telling each other where you are and going for saves as soon as you turn your back.\n-You will eventually learn to use this against them and get all the friends waiting for a save, as they are always obligated to help.\n\nThere will be trashtalk from any survivor who doesn't atleast black PIP, and if you kill all of them before black PIP will be called a cheater/hacker or an OP killer.\n-Every perk you use will be stated OP on your class, and NOED with any class will be called a skilless perk.\n\nOnce you becomes very good at getting 3/4 or 4/4 survivors each game you learn that most survivors go to the same spots constantly, and that it isn't admitting defeat when you stop chasing one survivor after constantly being kited when multiple generators are already done. \n-Winning doesn't have to be quick, but just play smart and know how to keep them busy. Always apply pressure.\n\nThe game is very heavy survivor focused, and killers are becoming sparse, but to be honest it is the easiest way to Rank 1 and easiest point generation.\n-Devs will eventually learn to stop nerfing everything and realize this is a 1v4.. this isn't supposed to be a in and out game every match.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nYou learn this game is a grind, but very fun. You only play about 60% of the time as the other 40% is waiting for a game or being dodged. It's better to say GG then trashtalk as both sides can be very whiny and no need to fuel the fire.. especially when you have another 5 minute wait for a lobby ahead of you.\n\nRank means nothing, and prestiging just means you play a lot.\nDevs will constantly be promising improvements, but sidetracking with content, which is good content but obvious diversion.\n\nI love this game and will continue to play it but even so I would only give it a 4/5 as there could be a real chance at an everlasting game if they committed more work and charged more for the game to help fund resources for improvement.\n\n2021 UPDATE: This game is a joke. The DEVS don't care about the player experience, and instead only do one small fix each month... which is just enough to last until their next killer and/or cosmetic release. They have no sense of how to fix bugs or what a good turnaround time is even when things seriously break. They take no accountability and instead of apologizing, make jokes and say the players complain too much. We complained because we loved the game, we leave though because you do the bare minimum to collect your paycheck and then go home. Honest opinion of someone who has played since beta... don't waste your money. BHVR doesn't care, so neither should you.","timestamp_created":1474657749,"timestamp_updated":1632790254,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502420008182525635","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25655731","author":{"steamid":"76561198043960267","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":39359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13900,"last_played":1656320612},"language":"russian","review":"Игра 10/10, каждое второе обновление получается большим.

Whether people complain about \"KILLERS ARE OP AND CAMP\" or \"SURVIVORS ARE SO OP WITH INFINITES\" nobody ever gets anywhere constructively, and the Devs are too out of touch to fix their shit.

If you don't get into the game, the system will kick you out and make you queue up again.  Queue should not have to be entered multiple times, the player should remain in the queue until he or she finds a game.\n- Easy ways to exploit the blood system in multiplayer\n- No blood given for playing with friends as the killer.  (And while I realize that allowing this would allow some serious exploits, they could have given a seperate bloodpool for offline play so you and your friends can still play together and level up in a different manner.)\n\nOverall, I think this is a great game, but certainly not for everyone.  I'd recommend watching some videos before you get it, just to make sure it boasts the type of gameplay you're looking for.

Lots of fun playing killer AND survivor, although it has its bugs (which hopefully will be patched sooner than later) - 100% buy worthy\n\nMy experience with DBD is (for the most part) great! It has its up- and its downsides. Sometimes you'll get angry at the game for dumb bugs, but I'd say no game is perfect and the devs are working on it constantly (heads up to the dev team!).\n\n\nThe gameplay from killer perspective is great. You are the one who is feared by the survivors and they try their best to hide from you while repairing generators to get away from you! For the most part, the map design is great, sometimes though it's a little survivor heavy with more juke points (\"jungle gyms\", \"infiners\"..) bunched together in too small areas.\nNevertheless I've been able to get almost any survivor who tries to abuse those spots (as long as its not a 100% infiner).\n\n\nLooking at the game from a survivors perspective, you'll get a lot of fun out of it, if you aren't scared that quickly! Although.. after playing like 30 to 50ish hours, you'll not be scared by the look of the killer anymore which makes it a little easier to run, juke and get away from killers. The most notable difference between killer and survivor is the skill check mechanic on the survivors side which cause a visual and hearable feedback for the killer if they're failed.\n\n\nPositive: \n+ lots of variety in builds / perks / items with addon combos\n+ getting to play both perspectives is lots of fun\n+ ability to play with / against friends\n+ good game to play a few hours every now and then\n+ free new content\n\nNegatives:\n- not the best matchmaking (yet, getting fixed soon)\n- no real punishment for dc'ing (only killer benefits from dc'ing survivors)\n\nAll in all: 100% buy worthy, would reccomend","timestamp_created":1474625588,"timestamp_updated":1474625588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25647596","author":{"steamid":"76561198195585639","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1616426852},"language":"thai","review":"SO FUN","timestamp_created":1474622229,"timestamp_updated":1474622229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25647473","author":{"steamid":"76561198275268768","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1635860564},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩，就是匹配系统有点渣","timestamp_created":1474621364,"timestamp_updated":1474621364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513888895511627197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25647445","author":{"steamid":"76561198114401384","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1588,"last_played":1645599248},"language":"koreana","review":"살인마 : 생존마 개년","timestamp_created":1474621160,"timestamp_updated":1474621160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25646465","author":{"steamid":"76561198172919265","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":213690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10930,"last_played":1649252820},"language":"russian","review":"идея онлайновой игры  интересная, может здорово порадовать тех, кто ищет новых впечатлений.","timestamp_created":1474613652,"timestamp_updated":1474613652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500831961631774902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25645874","author":{"steamid":"76561198128251739","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6911,"last_played":1622434388},"language":"english","review":"[EDIT] THE QUEUE HAS BEEN FIXED!\n\nWell, now that the queueing system works propperly for the most part, this game is actually very enjoyable to play.

I no longer have real friends as I murdered them all, over and over again. \n\nI really only play killer at this moment, but I have played as a survivor as well. They're two completely different ends of the playability spectrum as they vary in difficulty. I will definitely play more of each \"class\" when I can. Until then, I feel like it's a good buy. \n\nThe only thing I have an issue with right now, is the server load time when you try to join a game as a survivor. You don't really get that issue though as a killer because you actually create the lobby and people join in on you. When you're a survior though, it can be a bit tedious to find a game, and all I can suggest is that if you're adamant on playing as a survivor, just keep trying. Eventually you're going to find a game, and hopefully the killer is a good guy in regards to not camping.","timestamp_created":1474607820,"timestamp_updated":1474607820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25644896","author":{"steamid":"76561198073441932","num_games_owned":613,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":29534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3191,"last_played":1640728959},"language":"english","review":"dank","timestamp_created":1474601445,"timestamp_updated":1474601445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25644890","author":{"steamid":"76561197962965174","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1517723119},"language":"english","review":"worst queue i have ever experienced ever servers might as well be down for real\n\notherwise game is pretty fun when people are not laggin","timestamp_created":1474601412,"timestamp_updated":1474601412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25644682","author":{"steamid":"76561198032290046","num_games_owned":496,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1300,"last_played":1639986474},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is an honestly great idea and a game, it emphaisizes teamwork and the thing about matchmaking is that the surivors are woefully overpowered in later levels hence why no one plays killer and usually camps as killer.

Every single survivor has saboteur, sprint boost and self care. These should be ITEMS (selfcare replaces first aid kits and sabotage the toolbox). Its hard enough to find and injure survivors but if you dont focus on one survivor at a time - and i mean untill he is dead - you have no chance! I have Iron grasp only on 2 killers yet and its lvl 1. If i go against 2 or 3 guys with sabotage i simply CAN NOT win. Because there are no hooks left on the map except the ones in the basement, but the way is too far most of the time.\n\nSurvivors are so much more powerful and easier to play than the killers and the killers will get nerfed in the next patch!!! Why? Because they are strong when they use Add ons? Survivors can use those too! And they can even find additional stuff in chests - killers only got what they \"payed\" for with collected Add-ons. I never use anything - neither item nor Add-on as a survivor because i don´t need to! If you have a good team the killer stands no chance!\n\nSo here my plead - REMOVE ALL TEACHABLE PERKS! - so every Survivor has his unique role to play! Each killer does and their perks are far inferior to the ones the survivors share!\n\nRight now the game is just frustrating as a killer and no challenge at all as a survivor.\n\nBtw. this is my first review i have ever written. I love this game, i really do but right now its on a bad path. I fear its going to disapear as quickly as it rose.\nSo please Behaviour - please give the survivors their unique roles back and even the odds between both sides again! The game should be decided by skill and strength of nerve and not just \"who has farmed all perks yet\".\n\nEdit: The Developers worked hard on the balancing and have brought some new features in the game wich changed the meta. Now it´s fun to play and I can finally recomend it.

Wenn man vom Killer gejagt wird können desöfteren schon mal sehr atemraubende Momente entstehen. Wer also gerne mal kurze knackige Spiele mag dem ist dies nur zu empfehlen. Auf jeden Fall ist es hilfreich das movement zu lernen...bei der Flucht als auch beim aufsuchen der generatoren, die man benötigt um die Ausgangstore zu öffnen und somit dem Killer zu entkommen. Ich pers. schaue gerne YouTube oder Twitch um mir ein paar Sachen abzuschauen ;-)\nAuch sehr hilfreich ist es beide Varianten zu spielen - als Killer sowie als Überlebender. Denn die Spielweise wie man die maps am besten spielt sind sehr unterschiedlich. So lernt man als Killer gern genutze Spots kennen die von Überlebenden genutzt werden - und es als Killer einem schwer macht sein Opfer zu erreichen. Genau auch andersrum, auf der Seite der Überlebenden. Ganz nach dem Motto -Kenne deinen Feind-\nWer also über zahlreiche kleine Bugs hinwegsehen kann (Stand jetzt) kann zuschlagen.
