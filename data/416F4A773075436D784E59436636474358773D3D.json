muss meine alte Review bearbeiten, da die Entwickler mitlerweile eines der großen Hauptprobleme behoben haben, so das man zumindest schonmal ohne Probleme mit seinen Freunden oder alleine spielen kann.\n\nIch fass mich kurz:\n\nDer Anfang von DbD ist sehr schwer, da einem viele Hilfsmittel (Perks - das sind die Fähigkeiten des Spiels) noch fehlen. Aber wenn man einfach weiter spielt und sich nicht aufregt, vielleicht hier und da mal in Youtube reinschaut wie die \"high rank\" Spieler spielen um sich selber zu verbessern, dann wird das schon.\nSobald man erstmal die ersten Perks erspielt hat, die einem Info geben ob der Killer in der nähe ist oder nicht, geht das ganze schon viel einfacher.\n\nNoch ein ganz wichtiger Tipp für die Anfänger - die größte Schwierigkeit für mich waren damals die \"Skill-Checks\" wo man Leertaste drücken muss. Macht euren Sound an und hört genau hin, denn kurz bevor so ein \"Skill-Check\" auftaucht, gibt es einen kurzen Sound der euch vorwarnt. Wenn man darauf achtet geht das schon 100x leichter.\nAusserdem empfehle ich Anfangs nicht die Generatoren ganz zu Ende zu machen, sondern kurz vor Schluss den Generator einfach stehen lassen und den nächsten suchen. Das hat den Vorteil das der Killer keine Info kriegt das ihr da seid und das der Killer ein größeres Gebiet absuchen muss, weil Ihm noch alle Generatoren angezeigt werden.\n\n\nMeine einzigen Negativen Punkte zur Zeit:\n\n- Matchmaking würfelt leider völlig Zufällig zusammen, so das \"High-Rank\" Killer/Survivor mit \"Low-Rank\" Killer/Survivor zusammen kommen, was sehr oft doch ziemlich Unfair gerade für die Neueinsteiger ist. Dies sollte noch optimiert werden, aber Ich bin mir sicher das es früher oder später bald soweit sein wird.\n\n- Aktuell haben die Killer eine Zielhilfe die etwas zu stark eingestellt ist, diese sollte auf jedenfall abgeschwächt werden. Da auf reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight und im Steam Community Forum sich schon viele Leute darüber beschweren, denke Ich das die Entwickler dort den Fehler einsehen werden.\n\n- Meiner persönlichen Meinung nach dauert es leider viel zu lange um zu Leveln bzw. die Skills und Items die man sich mit den erspielten Punkten kaufen kann, sind viel zu teuer. Das macht das ganze nach einer Zeit zu einem ziemlichen \"Grind-Fest\", soll heißen man muss viel spielen um kleine Fortschritte im Level und den Skills zu machen.\n\nAnsonsten macht das Spiel sehr Spaß, vorallem mit Freunden zusammen.\n\nKann es jetzt nur empfehlen!","timestamp_created":1471232550,"timestamp_updated":1471767536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24926263","author":{"steamid":"76561198121786246","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1636170505},"language":"english","review":"So far I really enjoy the game.

For the Survivors' glitch: occasionally when a survivor is \"downed\" to where they can't get up without help, neither the killer nor friendly survivors can interact with them.

Dabei werden sie von einem Killer gejagt, der versucht sie an Haken aufzuhängen, damit sie, wenn die anderen ihn nicht retten, sterben. Dieses Spielprinzip klingt danach, dass es nach kurzer Zeit langweilig wäre. Dies ist es aber nicht. Man hat immer einen Nervenkitzel, selbst wenn man mehr als ein paar Dutzend Stunden hinter sich hat. Wenn man von dem Killer verfolgt wird, wenn der Killer die Schranktür neben dir öffnet, wenn der Killer genau in deine Richtung schaut ohne das er dich entdeckt oder wenn du mit letzter Kraft zur Luke kriechst und entkommst, ist das Spannung pur. Diese geht nie verloren. Genauso wenig wie das Gefühl der Hilflosigkeit und Einsamkeit, weil man sich nur durch zwei Gesten verständigen kann. Diese beiden reichen aber auch, da ansonsten diese Gefühl sonst zerstört werden würde und das Gleichgewicht zu den Überlebenden schieben würde.\n\nAußerdem wartet das Spiel mit einem Levelsystem auf: Die Punkte, die man in den Online-Runden gewinnt werden gesammelt, die man dann für jeden beliebigen Charakter im Blutnetz ausgeben kann. Im Blutnetz kann man Perks, Opfergaben, Items und Add-ons für die Items. Alle diese Dinge helfen beim Überleben oder beim Töten: Perks sind dauerhaft, verwechselbar und verbessern Eigenschaften, ersetzen Items oder geben dir Hinweise, Opfergaben sind einmalig und verändern die Umgebung, Items helfen dir und deinen Mitspielern zu überleben, während Add-ons die Eigenschaften der Items verändern oder neue hinzufügen. Dennoch sind alle diese Sachen so gewählt, dass sie stark sind, aber nicht so stark, dass es für den Gegner nicht unmöglich ist zu gewinnen. Trotzdem geht die taktische Komponente des Spiels nicht verloren: Man muss sich in den Gegner versuchen sich in dem Gegner hineinzuversetzen: wo muss ich suchen, wo geht er hin, wie kann ich schnell entkommen, wo kann ich ihn abfangen, wie lenke ich ihn weg, ...\n\nEin weiterer Aspekt ist das Rank-System: Wenn man im Online-Runde insgesamt zwei Abschüsse in den vier Punktekategorien hat, bekommt man einen Rank-Punkt. Hat man genügend Rank-Punkte, steigt man einen Rang auf. Seit dem neuesten Patch ist es so, dass wenn man mindestens 7.000 Punkte bekommt, verfällt der Rank-Punkt aber nicht, auch wenn man die 10.000 Punkte-Hürde nicht erreicht.\n\nDie Story ist leider nur ein Nebenpunkt des Spiels, aber sie ist dennoch interessant und erfordert eine gute Kombinationsfähigkeit: Wenn man die Zitate der Gegenstände im Blutnetz mit Bezeichnungen der Karten und Waffen miteinander vergleicht, kann man daraus seine Schlüsse zieht. Mehr sei hier nicht gesagt.\n\nZusätzlich zu dem Online-Modus gibt es noch zwei weitere Spielmodi: Überleben mit Freunden und Töte deine Freunde. Bei Töte deine Freunde ist Einer der Killer, während die Anderen in die Rolle der Überlebenden schlüpfen. Weil man sich absprechen kann und unglaubliche lustige Gespräche führen kann und dies nicht zur Atmosphäre passt, ist dieser Modus sehr lustig. Überleben mit Freunden ist dagegen viel spannender, weil man in den Online-Runden nun auch um Ränge und Punkte kämpft.\n\nAußerdem sollte man bedenken, dass die Entwickler sehr stark an Patches und neuem Kontent arbeiten. Dies belegen die ganzen Bugfixes und die Stabilisierungen beim Match-Making. Ob der neue Kontent auf fruchtbaren Boden trifft, wird sich diesen Monat (August 2016) zeigen, denn es soll ein neues Chapter dem Spiel hinzugefügt werden.\n\nAlles in allem kann man sagen, dass im Moment Dead by Daylight ein tolles Spiel ist, dass das Potential hat, um ein hervorragendes Spiel zu werden.","timestamp_created":1471215533,"timestamp_updated":1479968866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.648999333381652832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24922444","author":{"steamid":"76561198161857637","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1495931941},"language":"english","review":"Too realistic","timestamp_created":1471215507,"timestamp_updated":1471215507,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440342485904693604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24922333","author":{"steamid":"76561198034390284","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7483,"last_played":1618032679},"language":"english","review":"I am really impressed with how connected the dev team is to the players.

While I truly want to give this game a positive rating as its super fun and looks graphically alright. It can take with friends of 2 or more up to 30 minutes to get into a match. Even solo it can take a few minutes to get in which really is an annoyance. Lag is also noticable which brings down the server quality even more. Can't recomend as 90 percent of the game is a stupid screen notifying the user that \"no game has been found\" Not only this but many other issues since bugs/glitches can occur very often and at times can even ruin the match which forces you to disconect and wait another 10 minutes of que to get into a new match. I have played the game since release and can say that many issues in terms of balance have also not been solved. Many of these problems can include hook camping, and abusive juking along with many unbalanced perks. Optimization is mediocre at best and even on a 970 with its okay graphics the game tends to dip from 60 more then occasionally. While the game itself is fun many of these outer issues can ruin the gameplay and I hope they patch up these bugs and later on in the future can even add more maps, killers, and survivors along with new perks. If its on a sale MAYBE pick it up but I would wait until many of these issues are patched up.","timestamp_created":1471204473,"timestamp_updated":1471217308,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541931748390197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24918621","author":{"steamid":"76561198011075162","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1412,"last_played":1471765194},"language":"german","review":"Hab das jetzt mal eine weile gespielt, um mir eine Meinung machen zu können was denn (auch) die Negativen Aspekte vom Game sind. Zu aller Erst: Das Spiel macht einen riesen Spaß. Es geht darum mit 4 Überlebenden aus einer Arena vor einem Killer zu entkommen, indem man (4?) Generatoren anschmeißt. und dann den Ausgang sucht. So weit so gut . Was mir aber Sauer aufstößt; Es gibt ein zu schlechtes oder bzw gar kein Matchmaking System, man wird Beispielsweise mit Überlebenden zusammen geschmissen die viel schlechter als einer selbst sind, oder ein Killer der das Spiel viel besser kennt als die Überlebenden. es kann auch vorkommen das man 5 Minuten Mit Lobby suchen beschäftigt ist, und dann nach 10 Sekunden draufgeht weil die besagten Killer (es gibt verschiedene) alle zu Overpowered sind. man sollte wenn möglich die Renngeschwindigkeit der Überlebenden erhöhen und/oder die der Killer verlangsamen. in 9 von 10 Fällen gewinnt nämlich immer der Mörder. Dafür das das Spiel in Steam nicht als early access gekennzeichnet ist, Hat das Game noch eine Menge Bugs. Grafik und Sound sind zu Loben (!!)

Many of my caveats may have been fixed already in whatever version the game is currently on.[/i]\n\n[i]Editted for errors and an addition that didn't get saved in the final cut.[/i]\n\nI would really love to recommend this game. The overall gameplay, the atmosphere, and the genre all make this game highly appealing. It is the recent changes and patches make this game damn near unplayable for anyone but the killer (much more-so now than before). Lots of things were promised and still not delivered, some not at all and others we got partially working (if you're lucky). \n\nPros:\n-----------------\n- Great concept and over-all gameplay\n- Very atmospheric\n- Great replay Value (when it works)\n- Very entertaining (when it works)\n- Highly competitive\n\nCons:\n-----------------\n- No centralized server hosting (client-side with the killer as host)\n- The matchmaking system is horrid [b]at best[/b]\n- Not polished in any way. Game still feels like an early alpha.\n- Ranked \"Seasons\" are monthly, not seasonally.  Which seems a bit rushed.\n- Buggy mechanics that sometimes just don't work as intended.\n\nThe queuing system, if you can call it that, is a joke. If it doesn't find a game or you get a failed to join game message you have to requeue again. In survive with friends mode, everyone has to queue (not just the leader) and if for some reason you join and are forced back to the lobby the party is disbanded. Currently it's nearly impossible to join as party, and depending on what time it is, it's pretty hard to even join games solo. The party system is clearly still broken and works maybe once in every 20 tries if my party is lucky. Even if it's just 2 people.\n\nThe buggy mechanics come form of pallets not working as intended and putting you in front of the killer to have his way with you. Some perks and kits pretty much prevent survivors from rescuing one another. Jake's sabotage perk or toolbox vs Trappers comes to mind here, as it will often force you to sabotage the hook to rescue someone. Also lag can pretty much prevent you from activating generators especially when a \"check\" comes up.","timestamp_created":1471196402,"timestamp_updated":1471411724,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53586500883102417","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24916263","author":{"steamid":"76561198073384012","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4310,"last_played":1609935348},"language":"russian","review":"БАГОВ МНОГО","timestamp_created":1471196182,"timestamp_updated":1471196182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24916209","author":{"steamid":"76561197974069459","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":28012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11153,"last_played":1656818340},"language":"english","review":"May as well quit whenever a new killer is released. broken as hell for a week or two before the massive nerf.","timestamp_created":1471196028,"timestamp_updated":1647106838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24915984","author":{"steamid":"76561198263550500","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9485,"last_played":1594031707},"language":"german","review":"An sich ein prima spiel ds einzige manko ist meiner meinung nach wenn man mit freunden spielt dass man mit freunden lange auf eine lobby warten muss und immer und immer wieder bestätigen muss statt die suche laufen zu lassen. \nABER es macht viel spaß und hat viel spannung :D\n","timestamp_created":1471195431,"timestamp_updated":1471195431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24915904","author":{"steamid":"76561198103594505","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2926,"last_played":1606840688},"language":"tchinese","review":"Very bad join game system.

Et bien même si le jeu est plutôt bancal dans l'ensemble il a au moins le mérite d'être original et les développeurs le mettent régulièrement à jour, mais pourtant de nombreux problèmes existent depuis le début du jeu ( comme le camping des tueurs) et si certaines solutions ont été trouvées cela est à mon gout pas suffisant, de plus vous vous amuserez plus dans les bas rangs du jeu ( du 20 au 15) que dans les hauts rangs.\n\nPour conclure, Dead By Daylight a ce petit quelque chose qui permet d'entrer de suite dans l'ambiance du jeu, mais il souffre également de nombreux bugs et d'une communauté parfois toxique.","timestamp_created":1471170676,"timestamp_updated":1554712757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0uCmxNYCf6GCXw=="}
