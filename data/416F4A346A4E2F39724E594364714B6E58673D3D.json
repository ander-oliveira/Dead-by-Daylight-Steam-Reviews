It can be fun to play but some of the bugs and issues do take away from this enjoyment. If the matchmaking system is fixed, then I will probably enjoy it a lot more. \n\nIts not very fun to be a rank 20 survivor, playing against a rank 1 killer. Noris it fun to play as a rank 20, level 1 killer against rank 1 survivors. The lag issue is also a problem.

Its such a shame because it can be so fun, but when the survivor meta involves running around in circles all day to stall the killer the game just gets reduced to this dogshit game of redundancy. For real all I do all day as a killer is run in circles trying to get JUST ONE HOOK and meanwhile one gen is already done and another one is probably more then halfway done. To put this into perspective: Killer needs to hook each survivor 3 times total to kill them with 3 more of them you need a total of 12 hooks to kill all of them. If I need to get 12 hooks and they need to finish only 5 gens to win you would think it would be very hard to do a gen. Nope super EZ to finish a gen even with only one survivor.

The developers are extremely transparent with their patches and future plans and are clearly learning from past mistakes and very much so improving as a company with their game. \n\nThe game itself is fantastic, if I say so myself. The core gameplay loop can almost feel repetitive, but the progression and nearly perfect level of content keep it somehow feeling fresh again. The regular 3-month updates always bring something new, be it new characters, maps, perks, or simply bug fixes, help keep the game refreshing and bringing you back.

There's a nutso killer, 4 survivors, and you're one or the other. The killer chases people, tries to stop them from escaping, and hangs them on hooks to let a freaky satan spider rise up from the ground and kill them. \n\nThe complexity and replayability is found in the level-up system. For each 4 playable survivors and 3 playable killers (as of patch 1.0.5), there are 50 levels for each 3 prestiges, meaning a total of 200 levels for each of the 7 characters. Also, once you reach level 50, you can keep spending points on the player to get more stuff if that's what you're into.\n\nYou'll notice pretty quickly when you get this game that people complain on the Steam discussions page and complain a lot. Most of the trouble comes from the misperceptions about the way the balance is supposed to work. It is an asymmetrical game, meaning that the killer has to be inherently more powerful than survivors. Strength in numbers is the best natural advantage survivors have, and making use of that is vital.\n\nThe game is hard. You'll likely suck at the beginning. But learning not to suck is an expereience and a journey that makes this game worth any and all frustration undergone.","timestamp_created":1470428551,"timestamp_updated":1470428551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527732014656066895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24730828","author":{"steamid":"76561197965273943","num_games_owned":389,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":38789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6968,"last_played":1642708108},"language":"english","review":"AÃ∂mÃ∂aÃ∂zÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂sÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂gÃ∂aÃ∂mÃ∂eÃ∂!Ã∂ Ã∂AÃ∂ Ã∂fÃ∂eÃ∂wÃ∂ Ã∂bÃ∂uÃ∂gÃ∂sÃ∂,Ã∂ Ã∂bÃ∂uÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂nÃ∂oÃ∂tÃ∂hÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂hÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂dÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂tÃ∂rÃ∂oÃ∂yÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂gÃ∂aÃ∂mÃ∂eÃ∂,Ã∂ Ã∂nÃ∂oÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂tÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂ Ã∂hÃ∂oÃ∂wÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂uÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂vÃ∂oÃ∂cÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂tÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂oÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂aÃ∂kÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂iÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂eÃ∂eÃ∂mÃ∂\n\nThey fucked it up 4 years later.\n\nBalancing for new players and removing mechanics that made matches last longer.

Less people are playing Killers (for stupid reasons I'll debunk below).\n2) There are still issues with Killer-Bots who are just scripted to stand in place and keep swinging their weapon. Sure, it's free and easy blood points; but it ruins the point of the game.\n3) Human's online are just stupid. Like, literally, why would you start to heal me when the killer is coming at us?! (Please add a feature where we can shake off other survivors and run. Just make it a noise trigger for the killer to see).\n\n- - - - -\n\nDebunking some of the bad reviews:\n\n- \"The game favors surivors and playing killer is just a joke now! You can't win!\"\n>>> This is nonsense. This is literally just a cry from people who aren't as good of a killer as they think they are. Put on the right perks to make finding and handling survivors easier. Be more creative and strategic with the way you chase and capture. Think ahead. I've honestly had NO trouble as the killer; and I very rarely play the killer!\n\n- \"The survivors perks are over powered compared to the killers!\"\n>>> To a small extent I would agree; but not enough to where killing all of the survivors is hard, by any means. \nSelf Heal: Stay on their tracks and they wont have time for it. \nSabatour: Can be a massive issue, but at the pre-game screen you can SEE how many survivors might have this perk (or a toolbox). Adjust your perks so that once you catch them, you can take them to where YOU want to hang them (i.e. The Basement where they CAN'T undo hooks). And be more aggressive and relentless towards Jake's when you spot them.\n\n- \"Survivors aren't afraid of the killer anymore! They just toy with him and win!\"\n>>> Again, nonsense. It's true, there are survivors who try to 'Toy' with the killer by body blocking, instantly unhooking people while you're finishing your hooking animation, acting as a decoy, etc. But those survivors are the easiest to catch! They literally bring themselves TO YOU!\nBody Blocking: Hit them while carrying your victim. It's not hard. It will get them out of your way. Duh.\nInstant Unhooking: You have plenty of time to either 1) Hit the survivor they just took off the hook (and they'll sacrifice faster once you place them back on! GASP!) or 2) Get a hit on the cocky survivor. Chase either one of them down, and put them on the hook. They can only use that tactic like 2 times before they're instantly sacrificed when hooked. \nDecoy: They've PRESENTED themself to you. Accept the offering. If they're avoiding you in a troublesome area, leave them and search for the others. You'll either 1) Find a new survivor in a more favorable place for you. or 2) The decoy will follow you and likely be in a place more favorable for you. Just because someone's present before you doesn't mean they're the one you HAVE to go after, right at that moment. Think and stop being so simple minded.\n\n- \"The dev's don't listen to the community!\"\n>>> Most of the things you're crying about are personal 'Can't think for myself' problems. You have the solution to most problems as the killer. Adjust your perks and add-ons at the pre-game screen, think outside your simple 'Follow and Hit' methods, and put in actual effort. It's not hard catching survivors.","timestamp_created":1470424296,"timestamp_updated":1475744477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24729517","author":{"steamid":"76561198047295926","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":28,"playtime_at_review":2147,"last_played":1660169654},"language":"turkish","review":"kesinlikle alƒ±nmasƒ± gereken bir oyun","timestamp_created":1470422884,"timestamp_updated":1470422884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24729020","author":{"steamid":"76561198044558359","num_games_owned":906,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":25562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17831,"last_played":1640573346},"language":"english","review":"great game that has very annoying bugs that have been in it too long. all of which ruin either the whole game or the individual game your in completly\n\n-killer dcs at start, all survivors depip\n-game crashes at loading screen you depip 3 pips.

I spend atleast 5-15 minutes trying to find a match and then when I do theres a chance the killer rage quits.\n\nRank rewards and detractors\nI like the rank aspect of the game you get to flash your skill with those amazing colors in the game which I love its funny but....not that great for me. I tampered with the files to see which rewards i get and well....they dont look all that great to me. The comsetics are just yucky and the blood looks better on the game then the characters. It was this is what made going for pips less and less enticing. \n\nIt gets worse as the devs do punish qutting survivors by removing a pip and giving the killer points which is great and all but the killers doing the same they seem to get a free pass. The survivor isnt even rewarded on that aspect of the game.\n\nThe terrible net code and lag outs and lag deaths as well as Albert Wesker in my lobby really makes me want to play competetively less and less. WHich has lead to my own disconnections, both intentional and untintentional.\n\nKiller bias's\nAs the patches grew so did the potency of the killers, they have recieved buffs and buffs, while the survivor gets jack squat.\n\nTh removal of the \"juking\" was a huge mistake in my opinion as it added some mind games with the killer, because for one the killer moves faster than the survivor so...yeah I felt the juke was fair game for me. Unless killer mains cant handle mind games and want survivors to run in a straight line for a quick and easy kill SURE SURE...\n\nThey made the game much harder for the survivor by removing some hopping spots, which add more mind games for survivors to use against an obviously faster opponent.\n\nThe patches have been nothing more than feeding the killers game, both in and out the game.\nThey have better perks, better ways to catch hell when I played as the killer it was WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too easy to kill alot of players. TO a point of derp skill, there was a point where I missed players juking me, as i needed to use my brin and think on how to unwit them.\n\nAlso if a killer quits because a teem iz tu gud the survivors get punished for it (unless your in lvl 20 ception) than you have nothing to worry about.\n\nOverall this game for me was good when it was released but these devs obviously hve dropped the ball numerous upon numerous times. With killer bia's, bad internet servers, and overall a bad package from what was a good 8-10\nto 4-10.\n\nSo when they \"update\" the game in about half a year Ill give this another look, but for now ill either play like a moron from time to time. Derp quit cuz I can at this point or play something else.","timestamp_created":1470418467,"timestamp_updated":1470418467,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.411022871732711792","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24728319","author":{"steamid":"76561198094075238","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":45517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":267,"playtime_at_review":4789,"last_played":1660334515},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight -

Idea of the game is fine but there are 3 major flaws. \n\n1.My biggest issue is what a \"pro\" survivor for this game is. A \"pro survivor\" is a player that has a sprint boost and keeps circling the objects around a pallet until a killer finaly manages to catch up and then the survivor drops the pallet and goes for the next one. After you as a killer severly injure such survivor and grab him he uses another ability to fill up escape meter so you have to do the palet dance again. While doing this the rest of the team can get the generators easily but when you finaly manage to get 1 \"pro player/palet dancer\" then you are onto the next palet dance with the next player. This is the definition of a \"pro\" survivors. There are some killers that do wonders for palet dancing but I generaly don't like them. A pro player is basicaly little to do with skill but over 70% to do with perks.\n\n2.Many times you will get survivors that play together while using voice chat. The game is kinda balanced for killer vs. 4 random survivors that have no real ability to communicate so voice chat does ruin the balance a lot.\n\n3.The community has become very toxic. You are either a camper ( for chasing down a survivor going for the hooked buddy ), noob ( even when you have much more points that whoever called you noob ) or you get a silent treatment. On a few ocasions the survivors are nice but sadly its not that often.\n\nI play games for fun and when you combine all these things together it becomes clear that this game is far from perfect since when playing against good survivors or doing the palet dancing with the right perks yourself as a survivor it becomes perfectly clear that this is not such a fun thing to play compared to the rest of the games in my library.","timestamp_created":1470401366,"timestamp_updated":1534204740,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525139689445495605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24724479","author":{"steamid":"76561198025174987","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2121,"last_played":1594999834},"language":"english","review":"The game's atmosphere is very immersive when you begin playing the game, but the fear of being chased does lose its novalty to some degree. There are issues with bugs which are slowly being addressed with each patch, but don't be suprised about being hit by wild misses occasionally, or dropping a pallet and ending up on the wrong side. The rank system isn't terrible, but when playing solo there is little incentive when the gates are open to actually help others (easy to get one pip, and have to do a lot more for two). The game is definitely more enjoyable as a group of survivors but the killer is a lot of fun too (solo play). Perks are decently diverse and are continouesly being balanced (e.g. no one escapes death) but there are some clear cookie cutter perks if you can obtain them from the blood webs, espeically when all teachables are unlocked.  The killers are reasonably balanced and all have their own nich√©. However, current game (05/08/2016) the wraith obtains points are a faster rate/easier and there is some problems with \"nice/meme/friendly etc.\" wraiths who don't actually try to kill anyone.\n\nWith all this being said, the game is very addictive and you will find yourself coming back to play even after frustrating games. There is a lot of replayability and depending on your opinion on prestige systems, there are non-game changing appearance alterations.","timestamp_created":1470400901,"timestamp_updated":1470400901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24724424","author":{"steamid":"76561198318112779","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5849,"last_played":1475666862},"language":"koreana","review":"Îò•Í≤ú Î≤ÑÍ∑∏ ÎÑàÎ¨¥ ÎßéÏùå","timestamp_created":1470400641,"timestamp_updated":1470400641,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24724254","author":{"steamid":"76561198272575441","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2421,"last_played":1520423374},"language":"schinese","review":"Âæà‰∏çÈîôÁöÑ Áå´Èº†Ê∏∏ÊàèÔºåÂæàÊé®ËçêÂ§ßÂÆ∂ÂéªÁé©   „ÄÇ","timestamp_created":1470399744,"timestamp_updated":1470399744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24724237","author":{"steamid":"76561198039052462","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1644098528},"language":"english","review":"The game is quite fun to play solo or with friends.\n\nIt is just sooooo buggy.
