When you get hooked playing with random people you will see your teamates hiding in a locker, self-healing miles away from you, or spinning in circles while crouching. \n\nOn high levels of survivor play you just slam gens and if a killer chases you then just run from tile to tile knowing that for a killer to commit to downing you it will cost them at least 2 gens. That is for one hook. It takes 3 hooks to kill a survivor and more catches considering the second chance perks. 5 gens and the game is over and there are 4 survivors. If that doesn't seem like it maths out right it is because it doesn't.  \n\nThe DEVs (being the coke fiends they are) only care about collecting IPs to draw in new player$. Therefor they balance the game on making it \"fun\" for them. \n\nThe effect of this \"balancing\" is that the veteran survivors get to dance all over killers. Whilst the veteran killers get to just bite down and eat it. I think veteran survivors mains do not even comprehend the skill differential. They think \"oh I am really good look how easy this is\" not \"the game has clearly been babyfied for new players making this game functionally one-sided on upper level play\". \n\nThere are no killer sided maps (depending on who you play), two thirds of the maps are survivor biased and the remaining could be called fair. If you disagree with this you are wrong full stop. You might be thinking \"oh I see the numbers from XXX and it looks fair to me\". Those numbers are mostly new players who skew the results to make this look like a balanced game.\n\nAdditionally, there is a chat filter that has gone far and away from anything anyone would call appropriate. Common (non-inflammatory) words are blocked from chat. \"You **** ****** me\" instead of \"You face camped me\". How many 8-balls do you need to do for this to seem like a competent decision?  \n\nTLDR the DEVs are so comically incompetent that this game would not be profitable if it were not for the fact it has cool IPs, and the fact that it is the only one of it's kind (RIP F13).","timestamp_created":1503044107,"timestamp_updated":1632105817,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34323484","author":{"steamid":"76561198391428711","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":191748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131220,"last_played":1631962513},"language":"schinese","review":"回档3次，《我玩的很开心》","timestamp_created":1503044063,"timestamp_updated":1632137814,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34323271","author":{"steamid":"76561198287502929","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1560237674},"language":"schinese","review":"本想买来跟朋友一起玩，结果被鸽了。\n\n心跳girl","timestamp_created":1503043181,"timestamp_updated":1503043181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34323239","author":{"steamid":"76561198005519601","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":18908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7995,"last_played":1645343970},"language":"english","review":"I felt compelled to write a review simply because the devs are always getting dumped on by the playbase in spite of constantly providing free updates and fixes.\n\nAs other reviews allude to, the community is pretty toxic. Both in terms of survivor mains and killer mains griping about one another, and in terms of the playerbase flipping out about every change that's made and complaining about the devs constantly. But you know what's hilarious? The number of people giving negative reviews and citing these things who have over 1000 hours in game and are still playing it.\n\nGood value for money, it's fun for streamers/competitive types as well as casuals and party gamers. A great mix of stealth, hide and seek, and actions/chasing. It is still actively updated, and the developers regularly put on community events to keep things interesting and attract players, and they even recently released free full DLC with a new killer, survivor and map for a year old game (that of course the ungrateful playerbase complained about, not cognizant of the fact that it's new and will require some patching to be balanced after seeing how things play out).\n\nThis is survivor-specific, but I also love the teamwork, alturism and moral choices that arise organically. Even without any in game chat function (during the rounds themselves), I feel a sense of obligation to help people who saved me earlier even when I have the opportunity to make a clean break and trying to assist them is very dangerous. I love that the game makes me feel that way, and there are times I actually agonize a bit about whether to go on a suicidal rescue mission to save someone out of gratitude or bail on them with a rare item I want to keep.\n\nOh, and since everyone complains about killers camping: as a survivor main, I just wanted to say that's a suboptimal strategy for killers. Don't sweat it, just punish the killers by getting some generators done while they waste their time standing by the hook.","timestamp_created":1503043067,"timestamp_updated":1503043067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34323130","author":{"steamid":"76561198258571549","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1626393180},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom o jogo","timestamp_created":1503042616,"timestamp_updated":1503042616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34323104","author":{"steamid":"76561198131899726","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":42472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20164,"last_played":1659156993},"language":"english","review":"Game itself is fun and fairly balanced.

Para tener una mayor sensación de inmersión es muy recomendable jugar con auriculares para una mayor experiencia en el juego. En más de una ocasión apretaremos los dientes y el mando entre nuestras manos al saber que nos acecha un asesino invencible.\n\nEn la mayoría de juegos online es habitual que un usuario se desconecte cuando va perdiendo para no perder puntos, y así nosotros tampoco los ganamos. En Dead by Daylight esto se ve paliado con una puntuación a modo de Bonificación por desconexión. Algo que la mayoría de los jugadores de Dead by Daylight lo agradecerán.\n\nEn resumen, nos encontramos ante un título original y diferente a lo que hemos visto hasta la fecha, que quizá pueda parecer que se haga repetitivo pero que genera esa necesidad de echar algunas partidas antes de jugar a otro juego. Todos sus componentes, el equilibrio entre los jugadores de ambos bandos y la dinámica del juego hace de Dead by Daylight un juego francamente divertido, que tardará bastante en cansarnos, asegurándonos muchas horas de juego. Una muy buena inversión a un buen precio, \n\nPros:\nJuego original y divertido.\nLa variedad de asesinos y sus habilidades únicas.\nRecoge la esencia de las películas slashers.\n\nContras:\nEl apartado gráfico no es de lo más puntero\nEl campeo está muy presente en este juego.\nPuede ser difícil subir porque podemos perder experiencia según la partida.\n\nPodéis leer mi análisis completo en http://generacionxbox.com/analisis-dead-by-daylight/\n\n¡A disfrutarlo!","timestamp_created":1503007958,"timestamp_updated":1503007958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34315613","author":{"steamid":"76561198333760844","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12831,"last_played":1545424420},"language":"russian","review":"ЧИСТЯТ АККАУНТ НЕ ПОКУПАЙТЕ АКТИВНО ЧИСТЯТ АККАУНТЫ!!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1503005369,"timestamp_updated":1503005369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483336716890335083","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34315542","author":{"steamid":"76561198220259321","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":46445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":987,"last_played":1659322791},"language":"spanish","review":"Paren con las actualizaciones ;-; eso es kk las odio\n","timestamp_created":1503005113,"timestamp_updated":1503005113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34315441","author":{"steamid":"76561198122314172","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":106376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30494,"last_played":1596188048},"language":"english","review":"camper everywhere","timestamp_created":1503004673,"timestamp_updated":1503004673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34315401","author":{"steamid":"76561198124429182","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1205,"last_played":1558560838},"language":"english","review":"This game is ALWAYS updating.

Lots.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay in dead by daylight is fun, and has well thought out mechanics and balances. First of all, perks are very balanced, making the Pros of the perks good enought to be used and the Cons of the perk strong enough to make it a fair fight.\n\n[h1]Playing as a survivor[/h1]\nPlaying a survivor in this game is incredibly scary, to start off with, but as soon as you get to know the game better the fear turns into adrenaline, which is what i love about this game. Trust me, it's a lot scarier when you know what you [b]Should[/b] be doing, but can't. The perks make it hell for the killer to catch you but yet every match i still seem to die. Maybe the game is killer sided? Or maybe im just shit. you will never know. (unless you play with me, then you will know its definatly because im shit)\n\n[h1]Playing as the killer[/h1]\nPlaying as the killer at first is very frustrating as it seems like everyone is better than you. but when you get used to the mechanics, things become a lot easier. Bloodlust is by far the most amazing thing in this game. (bloodlust is when if you are chasing a survivor for a long period of time, you slowly start to increase in speed.) This makes sure that the survivors have to use their surroundings as they cant just out run you. The various killers have different abilities which allow them to kill the survivors in creative ways.\n\nOver all the game is very buggy, but the authors are releasing patches nearly every week. a lot of content is added regularilly and i really do believe this could become an E-Sport.\n\nI would gladly pay £30 for this game, in it's current state, so being able to buy it for 15 quid really is a steal. I would reccomend this game for anyone who loves slash em up games, and strategy/skill based survival.\n\n9.8/10","timestamp_created":1502986045,"timestamp_updated":1502988084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190507411956787","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34310018","author":{"steamid":"76561198084196498","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1498805447},"language":"schinese","review":"不错的游戏，还照顾到中国玩家","timestamp_created":1502985675,"timestamp_updated":1502985675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34309939","author":{"steamid":"76561198009531542","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9016,"last_played":1631468976},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego simple pero entretenido","timestamp_created":1502985406,"timestamp_updated":1594964148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34309929","author":{"steamid":"76561198149571108","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":37515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11555,"last_played":1628797253},"language":"german","review":"das spiel hat zwar ein paar lücken das weiß ich aber die ständigen updates lassen das spiel immer besser aussehen also daumen hoch","timestamp_created":1502985369,"timestamp_updated":1511529260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472826093435287476","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34309556","author":{"steamid":"76561198117714618","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7993,"last_played":1639135669},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾游戏，各种帖脸鞭尸，游戏体验极差。","timestamp_created":1502984075,"timestamp_updated":1502984075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34309138","author":{"steamid":"76561198302591051","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":80085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46231,"last_played":1645501761},"language":"latam","review":"Don't buy this game at this time of year, the killers are all over the survivors.  The fun of this game that I had before disappeared, thanks to that they are giving attention only to the killers. Their perks surpass those of the survivors practically have a GPS, combined with other perks it is almost impossible to hide from a killers and get out of a game. And now killers with infinite death.  I've been playing this game since it came out and today it's shit.

A highly addictive multiplayer game makes this a great entry to any horror gamer's library. But please be aware that is all this game is - multiplayer. Characters are fleshed out a little in their backstories you can read, however there is no single player plot.\n\nInstead, the aim of the game is to simply a) escape the killing ground as a survivor by powering up generators to open the gates or b) as the killer, put the survivors in the dying state and then 'hook' them onto sacrificial meat hooks for the entity. Every character has their own perks that you can choose along with individual items which will enhance your character.  While the objectives sound simple every game changes based on the random teammates you have, player experience level as that killer, items attached/perks active,  etc. etc. \n\nWhile I recommend this game, this game is not for the faint of heart or anyone squeamish towards blood. It will leave you chilled at times after seeing fellow survivors sacrificed or the killer hunting relentlessly for you. Both being the killer and survivor offer their own unique expereince that encourages high replay value of this title to perfect your approach with each character. The variety of characters, environments, and varying conditions for each game are simply amazing. Hunt on my friends and watch out - the entity knows you're here.","timestamp_created":1502944187,"timestamp_updated":1502944187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34299486","author":{"steamid":"76561198173911965","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":220153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43435,"last_played":1656168274},"language":"koreana","review":"임","timestamp_created":1502942375,"timestamp_updated":1502942375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34299199","author":{"steamid":"76561198272039958","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1326,"last_played":1649304600},"language":"english","review":"I Really like this game, but the pay to win killers are kinda crap, every killer should be playable, so its a balance.","timestamp_created":1502940853,"timestamp_updated":1502940853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34298800","author":{"steamid":"76561198749074648","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":44274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":716,"playtime_at_review":30418,"last_played":1660127415},"language":"schinese","review":"伞兵游戏越做越垃圾","timestamp_created":1502939094,"timestamp_updated":1628158390,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34298663","author":{"steamid":"76561198372385905","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1533982938},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏非常不错 但是  黑水沼泽被屠夫追了半个地图一块木板也没有这就很气人了 这让人类怎么逃生","timestamp_created":1502938382,"timestamp_updated":1502938382,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492424249649047852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34298370","author":{"steamid":"76561198367668432","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":55319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38140,"last_played":1638271359},"language":"japanese","review":"Worst Experience of Human Being.\nLife Is Too Short to Waste.\nDo Not Play. \nI Am Telling You Straight, Just for Your Benefit.","timestamp_created":1502937091,"timestamp_updated":1590336217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34298007","author":{"steamid":"76561198311113629","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":83395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":3765,"last_played":1660125907},"language":"english","review":"Game is  good.

is a great game, even after 700 hours it can still suprise, excite and terrify you. The game play is different depending on which side (killer/survivour) you play as. Survivour gameplay tends to be smoother with moments of extreme pressure, while killer gameplay is a steady amount of pressure. In short survivour has more highs and lows and killer is more balanced. Playing survivour you never know whether or not you'll survive until the last second, but for killer you can usually tell if your winning or losing half way in the game. The feeling of juking a killer, getting a close save, and downing a survivour is an amazing feeling.","timestamp_created":1502927677,"timestamp_updated":1502927677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34296001","author":{"steamid":"76561198206583219","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4624,"last_played":1653338545},"language":"italian","review":"dopo l aggiornamento ultimo,ho perso tutti i salvataggi.\npassati 4 giorni dall invio al supporto della mia richiesta,ancora nessuna risposta.\ngioco poco bilanciato.","timestamp_created":1502925525,"timestamp_updated":1502925525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490700453519821167","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gPLV9t0CcYzqggE="}
