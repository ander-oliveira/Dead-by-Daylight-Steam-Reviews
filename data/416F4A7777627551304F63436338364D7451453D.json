In fact, the only reason I chose to not recommend this game is because there's no option to sit on the fence.\n\nDBD is an asymmetrical survival horror game, like many other multiplayer games of the same genre.\nAlso known as a glorified game of hide and seek.\n\nSimply, the reason I dislike this game is its ostentatious sense of repetitiveness. Now, you could argue that all multiplayer games are repetitive; DBD's core objective involves restoring generators to a working state by completing skill checks; such as the objective of a multiplayer shooter is to fend for your character's life.\n\nHowever, I find that the repetiveness of other games can be overshadowed by constant action. DBD's action virtually only consists of Killer/Survivor chases; but even then, it feels like there's something lacking. The chases are not exciting, just as much as sitting on a generator for five minutes pressing SPACE occasionally is not exciting. I believe this game is tedious, and requires a developed virtue complex. Maybe the only reason I can't enjoy this game is because I'm not patient enough.\n\nNow, I'm writing this review from the perspective of the Survivor. I cannot comment on Killer, since the few matches I played I was horrible, and could not truly apprehend the fullness of the gameplay.  But even as the 60 or so hours I have on Survivor, I cannot recommend it.\n\nOf course, I cannot say whether you would like this game. DBD has its flaws, but as I said when I started the review, this is not a terrible game. It's enjoyable enough for a cheap thrill.","timestamp_created":1544656664,"timestamp_updated":1626581291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47492443","author":{"steamid":"76561198874472084","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1553778850},"language":"english","review":"the

Затем,взяв на 80 часу ранг 1,я понял,что могу в это играть.Хочу подчеркнуть слово могу, а не умею. Так вот, затем вышли патчи с Фредди и Свинкой, а затем уже с Клоуном,Духом и Легой. И эта игра начала меняться уже после патча \"Кошмар на улице Вязов\". Почти в каждой игре,вернее сказать в 4 играх из 5 стали появляться кемперы и туннелеры,которые здорово умеют бесить. Это было более-менее терпимо,особенно если играть в пати,как я и делал. Но потом произошел поворот,который начал убивать,и помяните моё слово убьёт эту игру. Дело в том что разрабы Dead by Daylight выкупились у компании Starbezee,которая была их так сказать фундаментом и опорой,и эти парни начали развивать игру сами. И все бы ничего ,если бы не огромный долг студии Starbezee,который теперь уже хозяева DbD должны выплатить в течение нескольких лет,как штраф за выход из-под их попечительского крыла. И тут понеслось самое интересное.Во-первых,создатели игры ввели донат на скины(я против визуализации ничего не имею),причем некоторые выходили из рамок Horror жанра игры(например полярный скин на Кейт Денсон.Серъезно?Скин полярника?!). Во-вторых, разрабы перестали совершенно,от слова СОВСЕМ, исправлять баги,которых огромное количество в игре. В-третьих, имея за спиной якорь под названием долг другой студии ,разрабам необходимо было решить проблему выплат,и тут они решили ввести донат не только на скины,но и на персов, отменили скидки на игру(их нет ни на одной распродаже Steam) и полностью поставили перед собой цель выплатить Starbezee долги,забив на разработку проекта и уйдя в сторону политики монетизации. Поэтому из всех этих трех пунктов вытекает один-игра сгнила,поскольку разрабы начали делать скины,которые не попадают в жанр Horror,стали они также клепать как конвеер новых манов и сурвов(причем это самая главная причина слива игры-новые карты,маны,перки и сурвы появляются,но вместе с ними и баги,которые плюсуются с багами старых версий и из-за этого их с каждым патчем все больше),при этом,не исправляя старые ошибки.Вдобавок, в каждой же катке,ну ок,не в каждой,но в 8 катках из 10 вам будут попадаться кемперы и туннелеры,которые покромсают вашу незаурядную команду и вас на десерт. Вы сгорите от дебильных паллет,которые стали просто невыносимыми,от тупого движка,из-за недоработки которого вы иногда просто застрянете в текстурах став изичайшей жертвой для даже самого тупого мана, из-за убогой механики повреждения вашего сурва маньяком, из-за кемперов и туннелеров, из-за баранов-тиммейтов,которые сливаются на 5-10 рангах за сука мать его 5 минут. И самое главное,однажды вы сгорите как я и просто удалите эту игру и не будете тратить на нее свои нервные клетки. Я не против этой игры,отнюдь,я против пути,который избрали разрабы Dbd. И если они с него не свернут,игра просто умрет,через года 3,4,можете не сомневаться. Решать конечно же вам,покупать или играть в это,но свое мнение я высказал,надеюсь оно будет кому-нибудь полезно.","timestamp_created":1544635560,"timestamp_updated":1544635560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55746161937713623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47486730","author":{"steamid":"76561198309205047","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":27209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11302,"last_played":1656470950},"language":"english","review":"Its a very good game and it's absolutely worth the money as a killer main (i only play killer) i can still do a lot of things and it is still fun to play.

However, the biggest problem is the developers though, as they are keen to churn out new paid dlc and reskins of survivors (seriously?) rather than fix the numerous bugs, glitches, and problems which plague the game, years after release (of the last 5 games played, three crashed, one was a three man and one was a 1v1 against the killer, who was, incidentally, the

view on DbD hasn’t changed much at all, TL;DR below. This finally isn't my most played game on steam so thank goodness for being able to celebrate a better game being the most played one.\n\nThe entire point of DbD now is for there to be many chases and chases to be fun and exciting, however many chases aren’t like that. Most chases in the game end up being the same loops and without much variation. Which maybe wouldn’t be so bad if there was fun in the chase. A hunt is only fun when the person being hunted is actively trying to run away or hide. However, most chases don’t end up like that at all.\n\nSurvivors have the ability to make themselves able chased actively if they equip Object of Obsession. You chase them and you’re giving them what they want, and they probably know how to loop if they’re using it and not going for the Laurie achievement. If you don’t chase them they actively know wherever you move within 72m, meaning trapper and hag have no power (you know when and where they’re planting their trap) and you can actively evade them with double/triple the TR of the killer. If you chase someone like this, they are either going to loop you for days around every pallet or are going to be the cocky survivor that you down instantly and then they instantly DC. While them DCing is enjoyable the first few times after the 100th or so DC from you just downing them once and them DCing, it just becomes \"wow\".\n\nThe only killers this helps really is Nurse, Spirit and maybe Hillbilly (if they can cross map snipe) and Huntress (if she can nail good snipes). Every other killer doesn’t really get much advantage or a disadvantage.\n\nThen you have the other perks that make survivors basically ignore any fear of you. Decisive Strike was changed to be “anti-tunnel” but it’s really not. Keeping track of 60 seconds in your head is really difficult unless you decide to bring MYC. Borrowed time is a free unhook with almost no downside. Adrenaline is still really strong as hell and given the current meta basically makes anything a joke if you just rush generators. And you still gain a lot of good perks.\n\nAs a survivor, there is no fear of being chased if you are even semi-confident at being chased. Therefore the chase becomes boring.\n\nAs a killer, unless you’re playing a certain few killers (Hag, Spirit, Nurse(recently nerfed), etc) The chase becomes a boring follow the survivor while the rest of the survivors are working away at the 5 generators. Therefore, there is no fun in the hunt if the survivors focus on their objective.\n\nIf survivors even slightly focus on gens and not chasing the killer, the killer can’t really do much unless the person they chase is really bad at being chased and runs around like a headless chicken in a straight line.\n\nIs this supposed to be fun? Playing a few killers to have a chance? Playing survivor and either playing loop simulator or skillcheck simulator? Neither are difficult. It’s boring as hell to play DbD if you know what you’re doing. There is no “thrill” of the hunt. Nor the “thrill” of being chased. I was scared of two things in DbD, Spirit yoinking me off a gen or a hag trap in the middle of nowhere. Nothing else is scary except for the goddamn grind you have to do to get anything done.\n\nEdit: \"Recent data show that Hex: Ruin is used in over 80% of all games in the red ranks, and across the entire userbase it appears in about 45% of all games. We took a close look at the perk to identify what makes it so frustrating to play against. Three key issues were identified.\"\n\nMight as well get to balancing us around that then, that'll kill all the problems because we'll be down to perks like We're Gonna Live Forever and No Mither.\n\nHonestly it's not even the change to ruin that's annoying, it's not even that bad (except the fact it's a bloody hex perk still) it's the reasoning basically being \"Skillchecks are frustrating\" (well there's 3 but they're all stupid)\n\n\"Reason 1. Its punishment of new players or those who can't hit Great Skill Checks. Newer players trying to help veterans with generator repairs tend to make the situation worse rather than better.\"\n\nThere are two main problems with this. First off is the fact it's a punishment. The punishment has many ways to avoid it (gen tapping, waiting for 2 seconds after good skill checks, cleaning the totem, learning to hit greats. Survivors only have to learn 3 major things, skill checks, game awareness, and looping. Skill checks are a part of the game you have to LEARN.\n\nThe second is \"Newer players trying to help veterans with generator repairs tend to make the situation worse rather than better.\", that's not the killers fault, that's matchmaking. There's only two reasons this SHOULD ever occur. 1: It's a SWF group (in that case they know they're working with new players) 2: Matchmaking throws new players and veteran players together. Killers have NO control over which players they get, so that's a problem with matchmaking, not ruin or killers. Fix matchmaking so that doesn't happen, the way the ranking system works is that it's really easy to rank up in the earlier ranks so you can easily get to veteran ranks.\n\n\"2. The passive nature of the gameplay pressure it provides means that there is a huge amount of potential with very little effort or risk on behalf of The Killer. \"\n\nSo I suppose perks like Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, DS, Balanced Landing and perks like that don't exist? Lots of perks give a ton of possible potential with very little effort or risk on the user. Also ruin comes with a huge risk. Ruin is a Hex Perk, which means if Ruin pops I'm down to 3 perks against 16 survivor perks. The quicker it pops the more of an advantage survivors get.\n\n\"3. Its inconsistency due to the random nature of the appearance interval of skill checks.\"\n\nThis is sort of true, the skill checks are based on RNG, but you wanna know what you can do against RNG? Manipulate it. Wait after hitting a good so you don't hit another, work on other gens, gen tap, use your hands instead of a toolbox. All these significantly reduce the rate of skillchecks.\n\nGames shouldn't be balanced around the lower ranks, so stop making it easier for new players. Players learn how to react to stuff naturally, you don't learn stuff instantly. It's the same as playing an instrument, playing sports, almost anything. Matchmaking in general will give newer players a difficult time, as they get thrown up to more veteran players quickly. If DbD was not made by people who's collective braincells are not centered around a bowl of oatmeal, they might actually be able to realize that and the other problems in the game. Which ironically is a cycle because they're trying to balance the game to new players, but veteran players will tell new players not to join the game because \"wtf are devs doing\".\n\nStop trying to baby the new players, Youtube tried something similar to this by making their platform \"more child friendly\", what happened to the youtubers? They're dealing with a hellfire like in Australia. Just like DbD players having to deal with more toxic stuff because they need to do something to actually delay the game so they can actually get more game time than lobby time.\n\nOther stuff:\n\nOtz, 3000+ hours in DbD, mainly killer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0XOSYLCTc4\n\nTL;DR: DbD is a home that has a nice foundation and furniture... until you pull back the rug or look under the couch cushions and you’ll find a lot of dust, rust, bugs, glitchy and broken parts made by a joke of a balancing and developing team that makes their game around newer players rather than experienced players that want to stay for a long time. Follow McCote’s advice and play something else like Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, or any game that balances around experience and long time play rather than a quick dump truck.","timestamp_created":1544598695,"timestamp_updated":1632282225,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":35,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47477068","author":{"steamid":"76561198429109156","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":254,"playtime_at_review":6007,"last_played":1660118215},"language":"schinese","review":"8102年了  我还进不去杀机  三分之一的时间在进游戏和匹配等待","timestamp_created":1544598556,"timestamp_updated":1544598556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.644569098949432373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47476899","author":{"steamid":"76561198027074236","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1553710600},"language":"koreana","review":"와하핳하하하하 이런 무서운 고인물녀석들!!
