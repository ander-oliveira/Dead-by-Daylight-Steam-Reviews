However, I can't recommend playing it for more than  a match or two at a time.  It might just be me, but the gameplay becomes a bit stagnant after this.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but there are only so many times a day that I can be hung on meat hooks by total strangers.  I love the game, but it's at its best for the first match or two of any given session.  This issue, along with the current (June 17) lack of a party system lead me to this conclusion:\n\nBuy it, and enjoy it.  It's good.  But wait until a sale.","timestamp_created":1466189812,"timestamp_updated":1466189812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502385556697845459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23618902","author":{"steamid":"76561198281375998","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1506357224},"language":"hungarian","review":"Grafika szép.Játék élmény jó!Ha csapatban játszátok biztositott a móka-kacagás!","timestamp_created":1466189650,"timestamp_updated":1466189650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23618771","author":{"steamid":"76561198053648927","num_games_owned":661,"num_reviews":112,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1466014775},"language":"english","review":"wow this game sure is spooky look at the killer\nif he gets too close to me he could hurt me\njust kidding i can vault back and forth while the rest of my teammates start the generators","timestamp_created":1466189101,"timestamp_updated":1466189101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494053930044174194","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23618766","author":{"steamid":"76561198014872923","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1466203293},"language":"english","review":"There are a lot of great things going for this game.

It will sometimes place you in a bad lobby with a horrible connection, or just simply refuse to find a match at all.  And the lag always works in the killer's favor. Playing ranked P2P kinda sucks.\n\nThe only common complaint that I see for this game that I will not defend is the ability to play with your friends against other people. This would be very hard to balance. Having a team full of coordinated individuals against one killer would be broken. You would always know where the killer is, and there would be no risk. Blocking communication between the survivors is the only way to ensure the survivors don't have an advantage.\n\n\nAll in all, I think it is a great value for a $20 game.

I really loved and enjoyed playing this game once, but i've lost all my respect. I'm sorry but fuck EAC and fuck devs for not doing their jobs to help their customers.\nIt's a good game, I love everything about it. But it sucks that you won't get any help if anything happens with their anti-cheat.\n\n\n\nSorry for my bad english, I'm trying to write as good as I can..\n\nAfter playing this game for 100+ hours I'm happy to say that i highly recommend this game if you're into horror games and teaming up against a bloodthirsty murderer. \n\nWhy? Because it's fun to play with, yes it's a new game and it need some bugs to be fixed and especially the matchmaking. However, I think this game is a really good game, I like the concept and I really like the design. \n\nWhy you don't recommend this understandable and not understandable at the same time, this is a new game, it's gonna get some updates soon, I've already seen a few ones that have fixed the loading screen etc. If you wanna play this game, then team up with eachother for gods sake. If you play as a survivor of course. If you play as the killer then play smart.\n\nThe devs are currently working on patch 2.0 which is going to do a lot of fixes and the patch even got a \"play with friends\" function in it. The release for this patch is unkown but if you wanna take a closer look then go to the forums and you'll see it there. I really enjoy this game, it's frustrating, scary and funny at the same time. The rankup system is a bit buggy, but as I mentioned before, they are working on a patch that will fix the most common bugs in the game.\n\nI'll edit my review as soon as the new patch comes out and after a few games.\n______________________________________________________________\n\n1.0.2\nFinally, the new patch has come out and yet it's no \"play with friends\" online function in the game. They fixed some issues but screw a lot of other things up.. Now it's even more harder to play as a survivor and easier to kill if you're a killer, reviving yourself takes longer time. Since they set a max for blood points to 500,000 i've lost my interest in playing this game, now that I've almost spent 200 hours on this game by saving a lot of points for the new survivors and killers to come is all worthless. If you have 500,000 and play a game you will no longer earn points, you need to spend your points if you want to earn more, why whould you set a max for blood points devs? This is totally ridiculous. If you want this game to keep on going you have to deal with the cheaters and patch this saving file cheating, but instead you punish everyone by simply deleting our points down to 500,000? \n\nI'm sorry but I no longer highly recommend you to play this game anymore. It's just not worth the time anymore, if you wanna play this game then please wait till they let you actually play with your friends online and not fuck up your points like they did with mine.\n\nAs soon as a more better update comes out I'll edit my review for this game.\n______________________________________________________________\n\n1.0.5\n\nNew patches, finally. A couple of weeks ago we finally got a new function called \"survive with friends\", I am very happy for that and I've spent even more hours playing this game. 600 hours overall now and the game is starting to be a funny game to play again. I like the new changes, we have got new outfits and devs finally nerfed NOED (No one escapes death) which is great, For those who don't know what kind of perk that is, the NOED perk is a overpowered perk that allows the killer to kill you or hit you down in ONE HIT. Now the perk got a timer which is 2 mins which is good. Everything is good now, but they have still not fixed the matchmaking and the stupid \"no matches found\" issue. Everytime this comes up, every single person in the lobby have to click ready again. \n\nThis is really annoying and stupid time waste. The other issue is killer leaving the lobby which is even more annoying, you're a rank 1 survivor, your friends are rank 1, rank 10 and 20. It takes about 10 mins for us to actually join a lobby. When we finally join a lobby it's 50% chance the host will stay and 50% chance the host will leave which happens a lot.. Devs have already comfirmed that they will hide our ranks from the killer, so I guess the killer will only look for a bloody outfit (prestige outfits are bloody). Great job devs for fixing this! I look forward for new updates and I'll see you againg.","timestamp_created":1466184491,"timestamp_updated":1479928006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.63213270902633667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23617522","author":{"steamid":"76561198159216594","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1617,"last_played":1594641335},"language":"koreana","review":"ggul jam","timestamp_created":1466184438,"timestamp_updated":1466184438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23617387","author":{"steamid":"76561198053500963","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":5198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2123,"last_played":1558981795},"language":"english","review":"Im sure the devs will see the party system issue, aside from this its a fun game! \n\nEDIT: Few months down the line and we have seem massive improvements to the game as a whole, Im seeing a lot of petty reviews about the gameplay being unbalanced.

I can still remember the feeling I had playing that first match. It was a feeling of euphoric terror that I am rarely able to feel. The reason I still remember it so vividly is that almost every single match out of my 40+ hours in the last 2 weeks have had that feeling. The game had a rough start and I was ready to get rid of it, but I didn't, and now we're here, with me telling you to go buy this game.\n\nThis game has come a long way from where it started, there are people constantly bitching about the killers camping them and the fact that there still is no \"Survive with Friends\" mode, as well as various other petty complaints. I do share in some of them, but at the same time, I am loving this game. I'll refuse to go play CS:GO or DayZ with my friends because I want to climb up the rank system a little further, or I'm a few Bloodpoints away from the next level of a character. It's this type of game that is so intertwined that I just can't seem to want to put it down.\n\nThe devs have released two patches since the game was released, each with a hearty supply of updates, bug fixes, balances, reworks, graphical improvements, and so much more. I have a feeling that this will continue. So you came to the reviews to see if you should buy the game or not, you should, because it is easily in my top ten all time at this point and I've owned and played well over 1000 separate titles.

There is no party-system for you and your friends which means if you want to play together you either create a private game or join and leave multiple lobbies until you find your companion. This results in waiting and frustrating other players who wait in a lobby. It is pure luck to get into the same lobby. Personally I think in a multiplayer-game which is based on co-op it is just plain stupid not to include that, anyway they are working on it.\n\n2. Some people mentioned big problems with latency and diverse connection problems. As it is right now I can not agree with these statements, but I think it is an issue for many players that should be fixed.\n\n3. A server-browser would be nice or some kind of lobby-browser. \n\n4. Sometimes you click on \"join a lobby\" and it instantly failed. Why? I mean there should not be an issue with players right?\n\nAdditionally other players have problems with matchmaking, too few configuration options, framerate-issues etc.\nI never experienced these points, nevertheless I think it is worth mentioning.\n\nTL;DR Shall I buy it? Not yet. Just wait a few weeks - then it is hopefully enjoyable.\n\nIf the main points are fixed, I will happily change this into a positive review.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. Survive with friends is finally in the game! You are now able to build groups and search for games. Although it takes some time depending on the numbers of players in the group, it is much more enjoyable right now.\n\n2. I experienced in my playtime just once a steam disconnect. The latency of each game depends on the killer - if you play in Vietnam, you will most likely get a killer from there.\n\n3. If they improve the lobby-finding, a lobby-browser is not needed, but would be a nice thing.\n\n4. This point remains, but also depends on download-region.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI think, as it is right now, you can purchase this game. It makes a lot of fun, especially with friends.
