With the latest update, Behavior studios tried to \"mix up the meta\" by changing the way perks work and making it take overall longer to complete a generator. Did this patch do that? Sure it changed what perks are being used. Does that make the game better? In 0 ways. Generators still get done very quickly and survivors can still easily get away and loop killers. The only thing this patch changed was how great tunneling is.\n\nBefore, tunneling used to be not so common due to borrowed time, dead hard, and decisive strike unless you were bubba. Now? Borrowed time is baseline! Great right!? No. Not at all. If you do not run borrowed time as a survivor, you are killing whoever is on hook. Killers easily can catch up and wait 5 seconds to get a free hook off the survivor you just \"rescued\".\n\nAs a killer, I only tunnel now. You are guaranteed 2 free kills. Why would you go through the trouble of not tunneling/camping when it's more efficient to camp and tunnel? As a survivor if I get downed, I accept I'm dead and stay on hook to let my teammates get more generators done. That's what the game has turned to.\n\nMy recommendation, never buy this game or waste your time trying the new patch. My advice for Behavior studios is to stop whoever decided on these changes, look at the feedback given by the community and hire a proper balancing team. Because it is obvious you do not current have a team that does this.","timestamp_created":1500070802,"timestamp_updated":1658302043,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33545829","author":{"steamid":"76561198159740541","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1629835092},"language":"german","review":"ist ein richtig geiles game","timestamp_created":1500069599,"timestamp_updated":1500069599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33545753","author":{"steamid":"76561197973371936","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1622437194},"language":"english","review":"Maybe there's a good game in here somewhere, but the beginning slog is frustrating and not worth the effort.  This is literally the only game I've refunded through Steam.\n\nThere is no in-game tutorial.  You get a few text based screens on what is going on, but without context it doesn't mean much.  The only mode is to jump in a lobby with other players.  You spawn in a map that contains almost no visual cues to help point a player in the right direction.  \n\nSo, the point is to find some generators and get them working.  It takes a pretty long time to get one working, so you are immoble during this time.  The killer knows where the generators are, and cycles through them.  Pretty quickly, you start to hear heart beats indicating the killer is getting close.  Once that starts, I'd try to move silently to a hiding spot, but always get spotted.\n\nReading tutorials on the web, there's a whole chase sub-game that's suppose to happen at this point, where you have to run through obsticles to slow the killer down, otherwise the killer is much faster and will just run you down in seconds.  Within the map, the color scheme is very monocrome and everything looks similar to everything else.  There's no context cues to point out where ledges or barricades are located, you just have to know where there are.  As a completely new player, and no tutorial, this of course leads to being instantly caught within moments of the game starting.  \n\nAt this point, it doesn't matter if anyone comes to save me or not.  I don't know enough about the map or the patterns of getaway paths, so even if I've been saved, I'm just ran down within seconds and put back on the hook.\n\nI can undestand that the game probably gets much better with hours of experience, but the early learning curve is brutal (which isn't helped by the *awesome* community mocking you the whole time for being a noob).  Of course I'm a noob, I'm rank 2 and have had the game for 50 minutes ... 45 of which has been spent specating.  I guess you could consider the in-game tutorial to be the time you watch other people playing after you've died.  You'll get a lot of time to watch.\n\nUninstall.  Refund.  Your experience may be better with a higher tolerance for making it through the steep learning curve while being mocked for not having made it through the curve yet.","timestamp_created":1500069351,"timestamp_updated":1500069351,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33545251","author":{"steamid":"76561198133688734","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":17148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5858,"last_played":1612984117},"language":"russian","review":"В основном игра отличная!

You are able to choose from being a survivor or a killer. The game styles are very different between the two, and honestly feels like a whole other game. As a survivor, you mainly have one objective- turn on power generators situated around the map to open the doors of escape. However, many things will happen during the game that will challenge you in trying to accomplish this goal. Other survivors can be taken by the killer and placed on meat hooks to die, or may be injured by the killer before escaping his gaze. In both scenarios, you have to decide if it's worth trying to help your team, or continuing on with the objective.\n\nBalance-wise there are definitely still some issues. One killer, called the Nurse, is able to teleport. This basically allows her to bypass every obstacle other killers face, and she is very strong because of it. Killers who camp the hook are also a problem, but mostly for new players. Once you gain experience, you realize they are actually giving you time to repiar generators when the killer chooses to camp one player.\n\nOverall, a fun game that isn't near as repetitive as I thought it would be.","timestamp_created":1500060415,"timestamp_updated":1500101600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33542577","author":{"steamid":"76561198363767229","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":39381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":53,"playtime_at_review":12293,"last_played":1660590476},"language":"english","review":"Rank 20s gen rushing ...","timestamp_created":1500059320,"timestamp_updated":1511442339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33542483","author":{"steamid":"76561198123770139","num_games_owned":966,"num_reviews":411,"playtime_forever":7158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1659128214},"language":"english","review":"It's the beginning of the 4v1 era... now I think this game like a roguelike will lead to a genre name.","timestamp_created":1500059056,"timestamp_updated":1639391332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462304413318634033","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33542314","author":{"steamid":"76561198387903586","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4935,"last_played":1587796570},"language":"schinese","review":"跟小伙伴挺喜欢玩的，就是服务器可能不稳定，老卡。","timestamp_created":1500058569,"timestamp_updated":1500058569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33541996","author":{"steamid":"76561198216466931","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19915,"last_played":1620068961},"language":"russian","review":"Наиграл уже 500 часов,лично мне игра нравится,но маньяки стали слишком сильные оссобенно Медсестра","timestamp_created":1500057662,"timestamp_updated":1500057662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53180396556854248","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33541765","author":{"steamid":"76561198169675477","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1955,"last_played":1574321573},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen Juego solo que me va pesimo por la compatibilidad ya que tengo windows 10 y no puedo disfrutar el juego a gusto Recomendado 10/10","timestamp_created":1500056883,"timestamp_updated":1500056883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33541758","author":{"steamid":"76561198140029668","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":114925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1136,"playtime_at_review":24304,"last_played":1660321795},"language":"schinese","review":"不说了，这款游戏有好有坏，陪我 度过了无数的夜晚","timestamp_created":1500056859,"timestamp_updated":1500056859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33541492","author":{"steamid":"76561198296436635","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":85225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":379,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1660428545},"language":"italian","review":"Gran gioco, dal punto di vista grafico è ottimo, non chiedo di meglio. Il gameplay è carino e divertente, ma con alcune pecche, come il matchmaking lungo e vomitevole e la scelta degli avversari davvero sbilanciata (mette spesso i giocatori di livello molto basso con/contro quelli di livello molto alto). Mi sorprende come il fatto che giocare a questo gioco online sia molto divertente, quasi come giocare con gli amici. Il gioco è molto bilanciato e mi fa piacere che il team di sviluppo faccia così attenzione a questa cosa, che è tralaltro essenziale in questi tipi di giochi. Non so voi, ma a me non fa tanta paura, e la causa è sicuramente il battito cardiaco, che è una cosa essenziale per cui non ci si può fare niente ma non la trovo neanche una pecca. Purtroppo non è un gioco a portata di tutti, perchè se è la prima volta che giocate non capirete niente e sarà tutto difficilissimo e vi verrà voglia di chiedere il rimborso perchè non vi credete adatti. Io ho pensato la stessa cosa all'inizio, ma vi dico solo una cosa: giocate. Continuate a giocare. Perchè più si gioca, più si diventa bravi. E se siete così scarsi, perchè avete paura di perdere?  Tanto non potrete andare all'indietro del livello 20. Un altro fatto di questo gioco che mi sorprende è il bilanciamento del sistema di ranking, che non ho mai visto in nessun altro gioco. Il fatto che tornare indietro di rank sia possibile rende il gioco ancora più difficile per i giocatori nuovi, dato che se hanno un colpo di fortuna a fare molti punti e ad avanzare di rank poi torneranno presto al livello 20, cosa che a me capita spesso, perchè sono oggettivamente scarso. Essere bravi su questo gioco richiede un livello di abilità e di conoscenza delle mappe molto alto e per questo non ci possono giocare tutti. \n\nLo consiglio a tutti quelle persone con poca abilità

game was one of the best PvP Horror games out there. Now it just has turned into a seriously broken and unbalanced game in every way possible.\n\nWhat's wrong with the game right now? See;\n\nThe so called \"Skill based Matchmaking\" is a laughable piece of not-working junk. It should prevent experienced players from stomping noobs. So the newer players can actually learn the game with newer ppl aswell and the pro's can play with each other. But what really happens is, that you get as a beginner top tier sweatshop action against 1300 hour-players. Great way to greet new players.\n\nCheaters. It has been NEVER this worse. There are obvious Cheaters, which are sometimes kind of funny and then there are the ones who just give themselfes a 10% speedbuff and outrun you. Actually you see Cheaters rarly and thats it. But in the past months they literally doubled, and nothing happens. It's insane.\n\nBugs. There are a literal TON of bugs. From stucking into the ground, bluescreening, dc'ing, or even teleporting behind the closed exit gates, everything happens. The amount of bugs fixed is very low and with each chapter(DLC) they release, the amount of bugs rise again.\n\nBalancing skills or Items. BHVR don't know how to do that. Best example was when they tried to break the survivor perk meta. they thought it would be a great idea to bring out even more overpowered perks. And in the same breath, they nerfed some already underpowered killers even more. The result was that the amount of killer players reduced fast.\n\nMatchmaking... Don't get me started. It's worse. like... REALLY worse. When you try to play killer, you have to accept that the enemy team could be a 4-man premade team with voice chat. Since this is not even a single bit fair, you might think you'll get compensated or they'll have more objectives or some other disadvantages, right? WRONG. Except for getting your ass kicked, you won't get anything.\nSame happens on the other side. When you Solo Q as a survivor, prepare for Battle Royale instead of co-op. ppl rarly cooperate and teamwork as they should.\n\nThose were just a few points from a whole ocean of problems. So, I can't recommend the game at this time.","timestamp_created":1500048006,"timestamp_updated":1638906871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33538754","author":{"steamid":"76561197964621092","num_games_owned":516,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":127050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":74383,"last_played":1660129596},"language":"english","review":"Running from the killer as a female and not tripping over my own feet...

You can choose to be a \"You're on your own\" type of player or choose to take the \"One team, one fight\" approach.  Both playstyles have their advantages and disadvantages that you'll have to try for yourself.\n\nOutside of actual gameplay, players have the opportunity to develop multiple characters blood-webs, similar to a skill tree, in order to assist them in game.  It offers players an upper hand while surviving that won't unfairly tip the odds.\n\nAs the killer, it's a little bit more simple; you. just. kill.  Multiple killers give players a diverse number of choices on how the want to defeat players.  Some may choose to cause terror as the doctor, others may choose to hunt players as the trapper.  Each antagonist has their own learning curve to it so it's important to be versatile and try them all.\n\nAs far as the gameplay mechanics go?  You get what you pay for.  The game is by no means an A++ title, but for the price you pay, you shouldn't expect it to be.  The animations can be a little quirky and awkward and getting stuck on objects can be frustating at times, but everything is tolerable.  The maps are randomly generated so you're kind of always playing on a different map but the feeling of repetition is still there.  The fact that the game doesn't include ANY kind of in-game communication is absolultey astonishing seeing as teamwork is THE MOST vital aspect of survival in this game and it can be very hard to do that with no VOIP or text chat.\n\nNetwork interface for this game could use some work as well, seeing as sometimes matchmaking times can linger or just completely hang altogether.  \n\nTLDR; The game is worth the price but be realistic about what to expect for what you're paying.  The dev team seems to be listening to the people, so I would expect more promising improvements and updates in the future.  7/10","timestamp_created":1500017147,"timestamp_updated":1500017147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33530137","author":{"steamid":"76561198101584238","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":16622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3338,"last_played":1641713325},"language":"schinese","review":"玩人好玩哦，刺激的一笔，好游戏，推荐。来，让我们围着圣光庆祝逃生","timestamp_created":1500015784,"timestamp_updated":1500015784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33529634","author":{"steamid":"76561198119301848","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15324,"last_played":1597071860},"language":"thai","review":"ggwp","timestamp_created":1500013518,"timestamp_updated":1500013518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33529534","author":{"steamid":"76561198164358682","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":68738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":332,"playtime_at_review":8684,"last_played":1660486339},"language":"koreana","review":"데바데... 말 많은 게임입니다.이 게임은 정말 어떻게 보면 플레이어와 소통을 안하고 자기 멋대로 업뎃을 한다고 보시면 됩니다.\n사람 플레이에 따라 판이 더러워 지거나 모두가 행복해 하는 게임의 변수가 있습니다.\n업뎃마저 새로운 기능이나 추가적인 기능이 아니라 다른게임에서 볼 수 있듯이 기본적인걸 표시하고 색깔놀이라고 볼 수 있습니다. \n\n그만큼 이 게임은 기본이 안되어있습니다.\n\n총 5점 만점으로 평가를 해보자면;\nㅈ 같은 비매너 트롤 유저관리(절대 제제 안함 신고해도 무쓸모) -1, \n더러운 키스캠핑 (생존자를 살릴 수 있는 기회가 없음, 절대로 못살림) -1\n방송출현? +0.5(비제이가 많음)\n괜찮은 그래픽 및 최적화 +1\n이따끔씩 하는 이벤트 +0.5\n높은 진입장벽 -1, 서버관리 -0.5, \n가격대 +0.5 괜찮은 밸런스와 아이템 +1\n\n이 더러운 게임의 평점은 0점 입니다. \n\nP.S 제발 친구들이랑 게임 끝나면 또 친구랑 같이하기 눌러서 초대하는 것 쫌 고칩시다. \n뭐 보지도 않겠지 ㅈ 같은 운영에다가 플레이어 의견 안듣는 걸로 유명하니 ㅉ\n\n1점대가 비추천이고 5점대가 좋은건아닙니다. 그냥 0-5 만족도를 표한겁니다,","timestamp_created":1500013160,"timestamp_updated":1500013160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479886680841445923","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33529492","author":{"steamid":"76561198186595458","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":13,"playtime_at_review":2461,"last_played":1659614384},"language":"russian","review":"Затягивает.\n10 акамуляторов из 10","timestamp_created":1500012991,"timestamp_updated":1500012991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33529379","author":{"steamid":"76561198336197460","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":60965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9005,"last_played":1578979679},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego","timestamp_created":1500012353,"timestamp_updated":1502992428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33529355","author":{"steamid":"76561198275300631","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1508775104},"language":"russian","review":"Четыре ребенка не хотят спать и пьяный батя пытается уложить их как может. \n10 ног в капкане из 10","timestamp_created":1500012243,"timestamp_updated":1500012243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33529226","author":{"steamid":"76561197970703603","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":2647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2612,"last_played":1559502553},"language":"german","review":"Zu Release wars ein geiles Spiel.

Then I got good with the hooks, and realized that nearly everyone tries to save their friends. Some folks call it camping, I call it a sure way to win if you are playing with scrub survivors or altruistic high ranks. This game is awesome, and I also have a great time as a survivor, escaped for the first time yesterday (got 2 gens on myself too). You can hate on the Killer for camping, or you can not get caught in the first place, don't be stupid and try to save your friends, and if you are still butt hurt take it up with the DEVS.

Il Matchmaking fa S C H I F O sembra non essere basato su rank o altre regole a volte ti capita di giocare in una squadra composta da ranghi 1 e 20, uno con 1000 ore di gioco e l'altro con 3 ore di gioco. Ma fosse solo questo il problema ci starebbe anche giocare. Il problema sono i BUG! Cazzo il gioco e pieno di bug e incredibile non ho mai visto un gioco cosi pieno. Giochi senza team e a volte ti fa la ricerca della squadra all'infinito; giochi col team o con amici e o ti carica all'infinito oppure si bugga e fa tornare al menu principale tutti tranne il creatore della lobby che poverino si vede costretto ad uscire dal gioco... ( trucchetto per evitare di tornare al desktop e fare la combinazione alt+f4 cosi potrete schiacciare annulla e tornare al menu principale come tutti gli altri). Per non parlare dei bug durante la partita: a volte quando il killer ti porta in spalla voli letteralmente e ti aggancia all'uncino a modi teletrasporto oppure i bancali messi in verticale cosi se hai il killer dietro al culo lo prendi dove non batte il sole. E non e ancora finita! se trovi la partita e il killer vede che il team ha tante ore o ha tanti prestigi oppure per qualche altro motivo esce ti tocca cercarne un altra! ovvero stare li ad aspettare altro tempo...\nInoltre continuano a fare patch dove aggiungono cagate e non risolvono i bug che oscurano il potenziale di questo gioco.\nDetto questo il gioco in se e carino e divertente e purtroop
