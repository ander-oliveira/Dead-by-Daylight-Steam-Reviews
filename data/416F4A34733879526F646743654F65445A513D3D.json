game can be fun to play, but the difficulty of learning to do so can be steep, and not always rewarding. That isn't to say that the game is bad. You can get a lot of enjoyment from this game, and I myself have gotten a lot of enjoyment, and still go back to play it once in a while.\nThere are problems(?) with the game that I think you should be aware of.\nI have nothing against the community as a whole, but like any game, you have individuals who go in to have fun at the expense of others, and (at least for the longest time) there was no downside for those who did things like that. You will have people who would rather blame others for their loss, make fun of others, or generally troll. Both survivor and killer. There is a bit of divide in the community between the two sides, which I honestly don't know why. Certain perks are certainly stronger than others, yes I agree, but it's true for both sides. I have no idea how many I have been screwed by borrowed time, iron will, and so on as a killer. But I have also been screwed by hex: no one escapes death, rancor, and hex: ruin. Though the objectives are different, both sides are people trying to achieve those goals, the perks they have might annoy you, but you might have perks that annoy them. Please remember this going in.\nThe anti cheat system the game uses sometimes kicks you, or friends you want to play with, out of the game for no real reason. I understand using something to keep people from cheating is important, but I have seen cheaters still manage to get into games and use speed cheats, or attack rate cheats, while me or my friends who don't are constantly removed from lobbies and the game itself on a false positive.\nSometimes the characters aren't really balanced. you have killers who's ability can break the game from what was promised. The nurse was particularly bad for this for a long time, though she has been nerfed recently, and now requires real skill to play in middle to higher tiers (I don't have that skill btw). While survivors you will likely only get their perks for all survivors, then choose one specific survivor. All survivors have different voices, and different voice levels. Some survivors seem to be extremely loud, even when they aren't injured, while others are hard to hear even when injured. (You can see where this is going).\nI wrote not recommended, not because I dislike it, but because there isn't a neutral option. A lot of people might not like this game for the things listed above, or something that isn't even mentioned. You wont have all killers unlocked with the base game, which is fine.

Konzept an sich ist super, allerdings ist das Spiel nicht für Anfänger. Entweder man muss es erdulden, dass man schnell und super leicht getötet wird, bis man (irgendwie?) besser wird oder wartet, bis die Spielhersteller das Spiel balancieren. Ich habe 7 meiner ersten Spiele innerhalb von 2-3 Minuten verloren und nur zwei gewonnen (welche auch über 10 Minuten gedauert haben). Das Spiel als Killer ist super leicht, diese werden auch von den meisten gespielt, als Überlebender jedoch ist das Spiel wirklich sehr schwierig am Anfang, da es praktisch kein Matchmaking-System gibt.

MM esta rotisimo y es cierto, siendo asesino rango 17 al principio de esta season todas las partidas con MM fueron plenos, y apenas solia jugar de asesino.\nAparte de esto, y lo que mas asco da desde el ultimo parche es el matchmaking, ya que si sueles jugar solo de superviviente como es mi caso la mayoria de las veces el asesino va desde rango 10 a rango 1, yo soy rango 7 lo cual entiendo sin embargo el resto de mi equipo son rangos 18 como muchisimo, que la mayoria de veces son rangos 20 con 1 habilidad a nivel 1... estas partidas se hacen infumables. Sumado a esto, las partidas estan llenas de lag, caidas de conexion de supervivientes y partidas en las que entras solo o con otro superviviente más (que por supuesto es rango 20). \nSumado a todo esto estan los bugs de tablas que no se pueden saltar ni romper por el asesino, zonas del mapa que te bloquea el propio suelo y ya algo que han metido en el nuevo parche y es que las trampas del trampero de repente se ¨teleportan¨ y estando en frente de repente se ponen en tus pies lo cual hace imposible salvar a nadie del gancho si tiene una trampa debajo.\nCuantos mas parches han sacado peor va la cosa, si es cierto que han arreglado algunos bugs, se estan cargando el juego de igual manera. Yo que siempre jugaba de survivor he pasado a jugar de asesino tan solo por el matchmaking, y de asesino rango 17 he bajado a asesino rango 1 sacando 1 o 2 esquirlas en cada partida sin perder ninguna partida, y tan solo e jugado al trampero y al wraith porque MM me da mucho asco lo roto que esta y no quiero abusar de la mierda que han echo. \nVa siendo hora de que arreglen su juego, dejen de sacar dlcs y piensen porque hay casi un 50% de asesinos o mas dependiendo la franja horaria. No compreis el juego si no estais seguros porque hasta que no arreglen lo que deben, no se merecen un duro más.","timestamp_created":1478598352,"timestamp_updated":1478598352,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537572264671325684","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26486441","author":{"steamid":"76561198265432829","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":51377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1642778285},"language":"russian","review":"Очень  клаccная игра мне нравится .","timestamp_created":1478597655,"timestamp_updated":1574957084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50260084867477417","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26486427","author":{"steamid":"76561198341583807","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1340,"last_played":1550330666},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏挺不错的 就是对于新手来说感觉都是被虐的","timestamp_created":1478597514,"timestamp_updated":1478597514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26486299","author":{"steamid":"76561198282677826","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":111897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":17732,"last_played":1660544152},"language":"english","review":"very nice games her","timestamp_created":1478596524,"timestamp_updated":1478596524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26486061","author":{"steamid":"76561198294292694","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":30512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1940,"last_played":1598182105},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏不错 ，碰到屠夫的时侯躲避好刺激","timestamp_created":1478594815,"timestamp_updated":1478594815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26486023","author":{"steamid":"76561198243938562","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1586366243},"language":"russian","review":"норм","timestamp_created":1478594489,"timestamp_updated":1478594489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26485925","author":{"steamid":"76561198224859692","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":30,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1480174842},"language":"french","review":"pas mal du tout a tester","timestamp_created":1478593692,"timestamp_updated":1478593692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26485811","author":{"steamid":"76561198341183427","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2441,"last_played":1655654361},"language":"schinese","review":"感觉新手指导太少了，游戏内好多东西都不懂，对于新手玩家来说我感觉很难，包括技能方面，探索方面，以及技能，等级及排位你可能30级了还不一定能懂，因为游戏交流太少，对于新手来说很难交流，因为你基本上没法交流，除了在游戏开始和游戏结束，加好友也比较麻烦以及诉请好友等不能在游戏内进行，另外不知道为什么更新后老是提示有外挂，可是我什么外挂都没有用！我感觉游戏做的不人性化。关于游戏上我感觉只能说还行吧，游戏比较新颖，虽然人类很弱，但也有高手，应该搞些菜鸟房！","timestamp_created":1478592917,"timestamp_updated":1478592917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26485723","author":{"steamid":"76561198134283901","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":57511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3343,"last_played":1649745956},"language":"english","review":"It is gud but there should be more potada's and less corn.\n(Yey) <-- Much Useful","timestamp_created":1478592199,"timestamp_updated":1478592199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26485692","author":{"steamid":"76561198147872155","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":80,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80,"last_played":1477770435},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

Il y a assez souvent des maj, qui ajoutent des nouvelles maps, de nouveaux tueurs et de nouveaux survivants et les joueurs sont assez roleplays, peu de kikoos qui ont pas compris que c'était un jeu de coopération (ça arrive d'en croiser, mais c'est rare). \n\nBon, maintenant les côtés négatifs, même s'ils sont peu nombreux.
