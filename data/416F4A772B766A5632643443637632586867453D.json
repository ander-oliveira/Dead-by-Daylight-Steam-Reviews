The storyline is solid and the 4v1 realistic.  The additional content packs are good as well.  \n\nThey have recently changed their content system and added in a \"store\" feature with TONS of cosmetics.  Some you can only buy with real currency, but many can be acquired through in-game play.\n\nIn general I really enjoy the game.  It's challenging at times, frustrating at times, and genuinely terrifying often.  It's also a very new interesting way to game.  This is the first time I have seen assymetrical gameplay done this way.\n\nIf you are on the fence about the game go check out the twitch.tv streamers play.

que llevo más horas puedo decir:\n\nSi eres un jugador común y corriente como yo, que no le dedica mil horas al juego para ser un \"pro\", sentirás que el juego tiene mucho a favor de los asesinos, es bastante complejo sobre todo si juegas con desconocidos porque muchos juegan para salvarse sólos, no juegan en equipo, así que mantengo mi idea de que esto se disfruta con amigos de forma más organizada.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nUn juego con varios pro y contra pero lo resumiré de la siguiente forma desde mi perspectiva:\n\n- El juego lo jugamos siempre en grupo de amigos, todos siempre como sobrevivientes, me parece que es la forma ideal para disfrutar el juego.\n\n- Están bastante desbalanceados los asesinos, cuando aparece uno que juega relativamente es muy dificil escapar, por lo que el trabajo en equipo es fundamental, dicho esto, si juegan sólos como sobrvivientes con gente desconocida, será dificil escapar si no hay comunicación o si cada uno anda por su lado.\n\n- Quizá no supimos como, pero después de armar una party y terminar de jugar una partida, se disuelve y hay que volver a invitar a todos, es un poco molesto que no esté esa opción, a no ser que no la hayamos visto.\n\n- La conexión por momentos es bastante inestable, muchas veces armas la party y cuando todos ponen ready, se cancela y hay que volver a armar todo, y durante la partida pueden haber momentos de harto lag que te pueden echar a perder todo (como no poder ayudar a un compañero colgado porque el lag no te deja).\n\n- El modo de ir subiendo de nivel e ir comprando los perks, items y add-ons está bastante entretenido, todos los personajes tienen sus habilidades únicas por lo que los hace interesante ir probandolos todos, asi como los asesinos.\n\n- Los modos de juegos son los justos y necesarios, jugar como sobreviviente o como asesino, y luego los modos coop que son sobrevivir con amigos y matar a los amigos.\n\n- ¿No hay opción para ajustar el brillo del juego?\n\nEn general este juego lo recomiendo si tienen amigos con quien jugarlo, sólo me imagino que no debe ser lo mismo.","timestamp_created":1506314660,"timestamp_updated":1514676674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502412974834442139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35196359","author":{"steamid":"76561198370000489","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10495,"last_played":1602683692},"language":"english","review":"不错

This game is very fun and keeps you on edge. It's fun to play the many different survivors and killers and experiment with their perks and addons during the game. Now I'm by no means and expert at the game but I can say it is worth buying. However I cannot give it a recommendation for one reason. The game focuses on the killer capturing the survivors and placing them on hooks to sacrifice the survivors to an creature called the Entity. This is a cool concept as you have a limited number of times you can be hooked (Or how long you can be on the hook) before you are emanated. The problem with this is in a 4v1 game this is taken advantage of by killers who camp survivors. Because survivors can get each other off the hooks easily they find it easier to simply camp and bait than to use their killers perks and a bit of skill to find survivors. \n\nDepending on the level of camping it makes it very difficult to near impossible to save your fellow players and results in the killer having an unfair advantage even with perks like Barowed Time (Which allows you to take an extra hit of damage before going down after a short period). I tend to see a lot of this in my games and in games on youtube and it's a very serious problem and needs to be addressed by the Devs now. They fixed all of the other issues that put killers at a disadvantage so how hard is it to program a system to punish a killer for camping? And I'm not alone in this matter as other fair players have pointed out these flaws. Worst the community has become quite bad to interact with because if players aren't looking out for themselves in the game then in the after game chat things can get quite heated and toxic.\n\nI have not experienced the dreaded progress wipe bug I see everyone talking about but I do have some issue with losing my progress. Especially if this bug has been around since the game launched and hasn't been fixed yet with over a year of time after launch. Also issues with lag, losing rank when your internet crashes (Even though you didn't quit) and glitches in the system are among several other mounting issues.\n\nRING RING RING said in his review quote: “ Don't buy., or if you do, only do so for fun, not to actually play \"competitively\" \" and I whole heartily agree with him. To be fair I intend to keep playing the game but I'm not supporting it any further than I already have.\n\n\n\nAlso a message to the developers if your reading this. I love playing this game, but I've seen and read about so many problems the game has that have not been fixed or addressed. Some of which I have experienced first and often. The rest such as the progress loss and your bad customer support center I hope I never have to experience as that would be a full deal breaker for me. I had planed to buy all of the DLC but until the game sees some improvement I'll not sink any more of my money, not one more cent, into the game until at least some of these issues are fixed.","timestamp_created":1506297754,"timestamp_updated":1506297754,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485107421875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35192934","author":{"steamid":"76561198235857328","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":47570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36972,"last_played":1572954442},"language":"koreana","review":"매튜야 이게 게임이냐? \n살인마 해도 짜증 생존자 해도 짜증 존나 스트레스 받는 게임을 만들어 놨냐?","timestamp_created":1506296439,"timestamp_updated":1572537660,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35192845","author":{"steamid":"76561198057978946","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":17566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":775,"last_played":1598645177},"language":"english","review":"I love this game, however I dont recommend if you dont have friends with this game.","timestamp_created":1506295965,"timestamp_updated":1506295965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35192564","author":{"steamid":"76561198096876929","num_games_owned":653,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":105606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14566,"last_played":1659301476},"language":"english","review":"I've played this game on and off since launch.

The only reason this gets a negative is because of the ridiculously skewed balance issues and gamebreaking SWF + VOIP.\n\n[u]Playing as Killer[/u]\nThanks to SWF (Survive with Friends), games quickly become lessons in futility when you are matched against them.\n[list]\n[*] There is no clear way to see when you are against SWF.  You can assume if 2+ pop up simultaneously, but confirming is a time consuming and tedious task because you have to look up every single players profile to confirm they are together (if their profiles are not private).\n[*] Using outside VOIP, they're easily able to communicate where you are at all times and coordinate positioning anywhere on the map.\n[*] Able to coordinate perks/addons/offerings to completely screw the killer.  I personally had a game where a confirmed SWF walked in where every single survivor had a yellow [b]Toolbox + addons[/b], all had [b]Saboteur + Borrowed Time + Sprint Burst + Self Care[/b] perks, and all used [b]Petrified Oak[/b] offerings (-1 hook on map).  It was quite clear what their strategy was.  Even with hooks respawning after 3 minutes, they were still pretty much assured the win thanks to VOIP comms.\n[*] Flashlights are a constant issue in the hands of good survivors.  A single survivor can stall you out repeatedly with a Yellow+ grade when you try to do just about anything.  Want to break that pallet?  Get stunned by flashlight.  Go around the wall?  Get stunned coming around corner.  Wanna hang that survivor?  Buddy runs ahead and body blocks hook and stuns.  Follow through a window?  Nope, stunned as soon as animation ends.  Personally, I find it to be the most \"overpowered\" item when used correctly.\n[*] Hexs are pretty much only useful against \"newbie\" survivors who ignore totems.  Otherwise, kiss your hexes goodbye in the first minute.\n[*] Pallet loops.  Enough said.\n[*] Hatch escapes.  Unless you camp the hatch, it's 100% escape for a survivor.  And if you do, smart survivors will go and finish generators.  It's my opinion that if you are a good survivor, escape becomes EASIER when you are last one standing.\n[*] \"Teabagging\" at exits can get tiresome, especially when survivors go out of their way to do it.  10x worse when it's SWF do it as a group because clearly they had \"superior skill\" over you with their VOIP and preconstructed strats.  Try not to let it get to you too much.\n[/list]\n\nIf you want to avoid a bad experience as killer, dodge every SWF you come across because it's just not worth the hassle.  Playing against 4 randoms (again, as the game was originally intended) will lead to far more fun games for you.\n\n[u]Playing as Survivor[/u]\nStarting out, expect to die.  A LOT.  A lot of killers lower their ranks purposely to \"farm easy BP\" with their fully decked T3 perks and purple addons/offerings against newbie survivors.  Other killers are actually pretty decent, but are low because of SWF matches.  However, once you start collecting your \"best\" perk combos (such as [b]Decisive Strike + Borrowed Time + Sprint Burst + Premonition[/b]) and some practice in, escaping becomes EZMODE against just about any killer.  Until that point, however, each killer has their own annoyance to deal with.\n\n[u]Trapper[/u]\nIf you're not paying attention, it's easy to miss the traps on the ground, especially in tall grass.  However, if you happen to have the perk, these get highlighted for you so you never have to step on one again. But that requires a bit of luck of you having the perk equipped and get a Trapper for a killer.\n\n[u]Wraith[/u]\nCurrently the worst killer.  Thanks to the perk [b]Premonition[/b], this guy is completely negated.  You shouldn't come across him too often.\n\n[u]Hillbilly[/u]\nAs long as you don't run in a straight line while he chainsaw charges, he's easily avoidable.  Stay out of sight until he charges away, then do generators.  He's supposedly \"one of the best\", but I just don't see it.  Then again I am terrible playing him as killer.\n\n[u]Nurse[/u]\nNot even an argument, currently \"one of the best\".  A good nurse is a nightmare to play against thanks to her blink.  Want to escape through that window?  Blinks to the other side.  Want to pallet loop?  Think again!  That combined with the ability to patrol generators quickly can make her quite difficult to escape from.\n\n[u]Shape[/u]\nMyers' Evil Within is a good/bad mechanic, all dependent on survivor gameplay.  Be vigilant of your surrounds to make sure he's not staring at you.  Once he hits EW3, avoid him at all costs.  Overall, he is far too dependent on being close range to be effective, so if you're good at running around and pallet looping, this guy is an easy win.\n\n[u]Hag[/u]\nGrossly underestimated killer and my current highest winrate.  Good Hags will [b]NOT[/b] place traps near objectives, but instead in pinch points and escape routes to prohibit long chases.  Traps can be negated by flashlights, but you'd have to be actively searching for them, which wastes charges, and you're just better off saving that for the stun saves.  Escape and rescues are difficult against a good Hag (be sure to ready up your \"GG CAMPER!!!\" in post game chat) who plans ahead.\n\n[u]Doctor[/u]\nReally a \"hit or miss\" killer, by that I mean he's either going to completely stomp the survivors or be lucky to even kill one of them.  The Madness is an inconvience at best when you get used to it.  The hallucinations are static so they're easily ignored.  Madness tier changes give off your location because of your scream, just make sure to move somewhere else. \n However, if the Doc is using some high tier addons, generators become a real pain in the ass to complete.  Intelligent play makes his entire kit underwhelming.\n\n[u]Huntress[/u]\nHer song/terror radius is astronomically huge, which is a benefit for survivors to which you can hear her coming a mile away.  However, practiced Huntress players can take down survivors easily with hit + axe throw.  If you are dependent on hiding in cabinets, kiss that strat goodbye since those are where she restocks axes.  Newbie Huntress players are easy wins as long as you remember to not run in straight lines.\n\n[u]Cannibal[/u]\nMost current and controversial as far as if he's \"OP\" or not.  He has the benefit of full control of his one-shot chainsaw in close range, but lacks the ability to cover the entire map effectively.  Hook rushing is completely negated with his chainsaw being able to one-shot multiple survivors at once.  His perks are a bit on the ridiculous side, especially Barbecue and Chili.  IMO, it's really his perks that really put him over the edge and breaks the game against survivors who do not have the perks to counter his equipped.\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\nWhen I tried the game years before, it was heavily in the killer's favor.  Now, with the potential perk combinations that can competely screw killers before the game even starts, it's clearly tilted the other way.  Throw in SWF and it completely breaks the balance of the game in favor of survivors.\n\nIf you're a survivor main, have skills above a potato, and have friends with VOIP, congrats on your EZ wins.\nIf you're a killer main, dodge every SWF group you get until you get a randomized survivor group as the game was designed for and enjoy a \"fairer\" match.","timestamp_created":1506275359,"timestamp_updated":1506279650,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557862341403961182","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35186533","author":{"steamid":"76561198180112810","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2525,"last_played":1615662836},"language":"russian","review":"Баланс в игре отсуствует полностью!\nНачал играть!
