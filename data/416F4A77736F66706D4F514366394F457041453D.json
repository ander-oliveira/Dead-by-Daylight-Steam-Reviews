You can argue that certain map set ups dampen this but when a killer is near you start to feel a level of pressure. The heartbeat system, mixed with the red stain all coupled with the knowledge that once you're dead, you're dead really gives a sense of lethality to it all. \n\nHiding has the same effect. When you are hiding from an enemy in a game the AI is clear,. You get angry when they see you from a fluke or blatantly broken detection, yet they are sometimes supremely easy to walk past. On top of this an AI will leave after a set time...humans don't...you might hide away from a killer but if they know you MUST be around tree somewhere because they saw you scurry out of sight. It ups the ante-and tension- when something is truly looking for you.\n\n\nPERKS\n\nThe perk system is addicting and enthralling. Every match you get blood points and blood points allow you to buy both offerings, items, and perks. I played this game before the big buff where most perks weren't really that good but now perks are viable and stuff that you never considered before are even fun with certain mix up over the meta-choices. \n\nThere are many, many perks. Both in the base game but added over time from personal character perks. You won't have access to all perks due to unlocking  personal perks is needed by leveling up one character or by buying them in shrine of secrets with shards-in game currency you collect- Discovering perks is fun but due to the fast pace and extensive library this slow build up probably won't really be noticed by you yet so it's a good time to get the hang of this indepth choice.\n\nYou can set 4 perk slots, allowing for odd themes and approaches.\n\n\nConstant Dev Support\n\n\nWhen I first joined Dead by Daylight the game was not in a very good state. The killers actions were slow, the flash light blinding affect was so white it litterally hurt your eyes, and most perks were not even worth looking at outside of playing with gimmick builds. In the last few updates they have made very sensible but simple changes that stopped the game being a killer bullyfest.\n\nBefore as killer you had to eat pallets while groups of people shined flash lights in your eyes and then get DC'ed and hooked blocked. Effectively making it impossible to win or sometimes even get one kill by players that knew the meta. While some of this meta still exists the faster pace, quicker actions and buffs really show. Now it's very feasible to beat a group despite certain meta-peerks even at high levels.\n\nThey consistently add new killers and new survivors along with new perks for each-to buy but you can get these with shard grinds- along with seasonal events,new maps(free) and the occasional update changing things up. \n\nEven if you disagree or agree with the devs the last few updates really make me feel like the game is being treated with attention and its fan base listened into. Now if you think they heard the right things is up to you. \n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\nEnvriomental Stagnation\n\nThe game has many maps with many different layouts, this is true. But at its core all maps and all games consist of the same thing. Distilling the more thrilling diveristy of perks and killers with the same approaches. All survivors have to get a bunch of generators on map, all maps have 3 obstacles-survivor tools-\n\nCloset: you can hide in these but if caught are instant grabbed.\n\nPallets: you can drop these running, walking or standing infront of a killer to stop them. Most of these are in safe zones where you can both just run circles forever and the survivor can vault over it.\n\nor ontop of a killer to stun them. A killer can break a pallet with a 2/4 second breaking animation that slows them down and decreases blood lust.\n\nIn essence... a pallet is a safe zone or full stop which the killer must mind game you around or break-letting you escape-\n\nVaultable ledges: not much to say here. Except for one killer all other killers can only vault slowly. It's not really feasible to chase pass these.\n\nBecause there is only 1 type of objective and 3 type of obstacles the game turns down to meta really, really fast. Good players will always just avoid doing anything as long as possible, not committing to any action or direction. Typically this leads to a killer and survivors running round and round something like a scooby doo chase then them dropping a pallet last second to stun you. This tactic pretty much assures pallets don't get used up too quickly and the killer loses precious time while his team mates work on generators.\n\nHigh level survivors will get gens done very quickly and it's mostly high levels that will do this. One chase can cost you the game. It really boils down to killer leaving and the survivors not using this tactic out of boredom.\n\nBut is it survivors fault? \n\nI don't think so. Stuff like circle looping for a minute straight is more of a symptom that pallet tours exist to begin with-the map is filled with just pallets due to low obstacle options to place- Survivors use the only tool they have to max effectivenes and because pallets are almost cut off by large swarmths of unmovable props it means as killer you can only eat shit and get stunned or watch the survivor stand there and run around the pallet for 30 seconds or so.\n\nIt kind of kills the atmosphere. With games like Last Year coming out it really shows how little enviroment there is in dead by daylight. While it's not possible to translate some of those things over because of the vast difference in base style between them it does exaggerate it's staleness.\n\nWhile there are killers and survivors with plenty of perks to change themselves and killers with powers to change how things go.\n\nThere is virtually NO...none...added obtistacles or items to help this game health that I know of. Really, even 2 new obstacles that are generated at random to divide up the normal spawn numbers of stuff would help at this point.\n\n\nNo New Items\n\n\nItems are a thing in dead by daylight. As survivor they aid or allow certain actions. As killer they modify or change killers power.\n\n\nThe survivor items are: healing kits, mechanics boxes, flash lights, maps, and the very rare hatch keys.\n\nTwo of those items do something you already do but faster and the last one is a rare power item that lets you escape early if you can find the hatch. \n\nFlash lights can stun killer and mapss reveal aura after you scouted an area.\n\nMight got some details wrong there. There are a few seasonal items you can get but they are limited to seasonal events. I think that, in it's current state survivors almost rely more on perks than items which kind of reduces the need for them in terms of fun. They only serve a competitive purpose to escape quicker or heal.\n\nThe flash light is the only exception to this. This is strange because as killer you can get items-most of the time rare and specific to certain characters- that DO drastically alter the game. As the PIG you can reduce your head traps to 1 but see people in a radius when you're sneaking.\n\nAs Trap you can make equipped an item to your power that makes it so the random inactive traps open randomly.\n\nIt's strange that we haven't seen any updates that do add stranger game altering items to it-especially for survivors-like items that offer them different evasion, distraction or sneaking tools. \n\n\nDead by Daylight is a unique game with a lot to offer, a lot of care put into it, and lot of good ideas that sometimes struggle under needed growing pains.","timestamp_created":1529893859,"timestamp_updated":1546771280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43022981","author":{"steamid":"76561198227401236","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1659928744},"language":"spanish","review":"esta muy bueno, no es necesario comprar DLC´S pero si es verdad que agregan gran parte del juego.","timestamp_created":1529893787,"timestamp_updated":1529893787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43022567","author":{"steamid":"76561198415593818","num_games_owned":753,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":946,"last_played":1634730942},"language":"schinese","review":"是款好游戏，但进游戏的时候总要出点幺蛾子，要么连不上服务器，要么啥初始化错误，虽然玩游戏这么多年也不是说啥一帆风顺，出了问是大多也都是自己百度解决，但这款游戏的问题挣的是又多又难弄（这个凭良心讲有点看脸），希望制作者关心一下我们这些非洲人民","timestamp_created":1529892334,"timestamp_updated":1529892334,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43022246","author":{"steamid":"76561198049097453","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":82,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1530162133},"language":"english","review":"This game works great, does what its made it do.

Walked around to find out where the hell I was. Found a person. But not any normal person, someone rapidly squatting when they found me..? No idea why or how they could squat so fast but impressive nothing the less. We decided to walk around after I asked them where we were and they just gave me the silent treatment and we found a generator, my natural and their natural instinct kicked in and bam! It was up and running! But as soon as It was finished and I decided to rest for abit some random orchestra crowd or something started playing and behold some fucking 7 foot guy wrapped in thin ass dirty blankets slashed some weird shit at me and cut me pretty severely, I tried to run but no use, I fell to the ground and had him pick me up for some odd reason. After a few seconds of him carrying me around he tossed me like superman onto a damn hook, A DAMN HOOK? The guys got the strength of someone going out to a gym for 50 years I swear but I just hung there in shock. A few minutes pass by and another person just somehow yoinked me off the damn thing!

Да да, потом вы уже не будете испытывать страх. Это, безусловно, один из главных минусов данной игры. Хоррор на самом деле не такой уж и хоррор, разве, что вас не нанизывают всякий раз на крюк. Однако, эта игра игра заслуживает внимание. Опустим, что в игре игроки всякий раз должны выполнять одни и те же действия. Игра поглощает своей атмосферностью и великолепной графикой. И конечно, совершенно оригинальным сюжетом. Жаль, что каждый месяц ранг игрока падает до начального - 20, лично я за месяц смог дойти лишь до 15. Но, это безусловно является мотивацией - для опытных игроков снова занять свои позиции. К плюсам данного хоррора можно отнести и постоянные, но не бесконечные обновления. Таким образом, игра не надоедает, становится более лучше, увеличиваются возможнасти игрока и появляются новые персонажи. Но всё равно, какой бы не была Dead by Daylight динамичной игрой, сюжет на каждой орене один и тот же! Это надоедает, заставляет постоянно бросать игру.... и возвращаться к ней снова. Всякий раз, играя в роли выжившего, вы должны починить генераторы, стараясь не попасть в лапы убийцы, открыть ворота и сбежать. Все до боли просто, но одновременно сложно. Ведь так как данный хоррор многопользовательская онлайн игра, прятаться игроки должны от реального игрока. И тут, я подвожу вас к ещё одному минусу данной игры. Ранжирование игроков хоть и есть, начинающим игрокам частенько подсовывают опытного убийцу.... Также обращаю ваше внимание на то, что хоррор требует много оперативной памяти, и может лагать если у вас слабый ПК. Настоятельно не рекомендую устанавливать на слабый ноутбук, для этого должны быть железные нервы. А теперь давайте подведем итоги.\n\nПлюсы:\n+ атмосферность, графика\n+ оригинальный сюжет\n+ простота цели игры\n+ постоянная мотивация играть\n+ постоянное улучшение\n\nМинусы:\n- страх только в начале игры\n- надоедающий сюжет\n- некачественное ранжирование игроков\n- не подходит для слабых ПК \n\nНадеюсь, мой обзор по этой игре будет вам полезен.
