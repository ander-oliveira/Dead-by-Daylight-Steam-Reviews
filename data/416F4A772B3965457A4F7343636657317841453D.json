Playing on your own as a survivor can be a living hell against even just a mediocre killer because of how hard they've been nerfed, while as killer you can stand absolutely no chance against a 3/4 man Survive With Friends party. The game developers seemingly ignore the community's wishes as shown by the lack of changes made to updates after PTBs and some issues have still not been fixed over half a year's worth of waiting.\n\nOptimisation is absolutely terrible. The OPENING CINEMATIC (which you can't disable even in config files because EAC throws a fit) can lag your computer with a massive input lag that prevents you from skipping it quickly, even very good computers are unable to run the game at a high framerate on good graphics and you will always experience some sort of lag spike during your gameplay.\n\nThis game used to be fun but somehow with every update the optimisation gets worse, along with the gameplay, along with the countless bugs and exploits, along with pretty much everything even in the game and yet the developers do absolutely nothing.\n\nPS. They don't take responsibility for their own bugs and exploits, even going as far as to REVOKE OVER 800 HOURS WORTH OF PROGRESS as a 'punishment' for accidentally abusing a very small exploit that gave absolutely no advantage to any players in the actual gameplay itself. Instead of banning hackers and toxic players, BHVR spends their time making poor cosmetics and revoking progress from those unfortunate enough to stumble upon one of the game's many bugs and exploits. This game has turned into a complete and utter cash grab ever since the store came out pretty much exactly 1 year ago. I dont know if someone else was suddenly put in charge but this game has gone completely downhill.","timestamp_created":1561674653,"timestamp_updated":1561674653,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":164,"votes_funny":26,"weighted_vote_score":"0.690031766891479492","comment_count":75,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51509500","author":{"steamid":"76561198381522709","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":14762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1646948856},"language":"russian","review":"Ваще пушечка анигиляторная,нравки нравки,не особо хорор,но угарнаяя гыыыыы","timestamp_created":1561673537,"timestamp_updated":1561673537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51509473","author":{"steamid":"76561198331733685","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":46905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27035,"last_played":1639172952},"language":"english","review":"gg ez :)","timestamp_created":1561673446,"timestamp_updated":1561673446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51509292","author":{"steamid":"76561198403311384","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":64113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32242,"last_played":1655913296},"language":"thai","review":"pretty good job so far dudddddddddde","timestamp_created":1561672856,"timestamp_updated":1561672856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51509238","author":{"steamid":"76561198262492063","num_games_owned":947,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":109048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107183,"last_played":1641559136},"language":"russian","review":"Игра представляет собой каловую массу не иначе.

Team mates WANT to help you out when your a survivor, if you're hooked or wounded, your team mates seem to help you out like they are very desperate, which is nice because the game is designed to work in your favour if the survivors all remain alive, so you might as well help out, which makes a nice community appear in the game.\n\nThe game modes are super fun, level ups are so addictive and great to look forward to, playing with friends is so fun that it's so hard to stop playing the game - the list goes on, no 2 games are the same and every game tests your brain, forcing you to make the correct decisions and to think smart.\n\nhighly suggest playing this game, i rate it 10/10 of course. \n(i found the hatch by mistake on my first playthrough, still haven't actually won a game by using it - other than a private 1vs1 where someone dropped me there to get the achievement!)","timestamp_created":1561669796,"timestamp_updated":1561669796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477815687656402588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51507886","author":{"steamid":"76561198094988554","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":19089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":108,"playtime_at_review":13291,"last_played":1660513704},"language":"english","review":"Imagine being competitive in getting lucky","timestamp_created":1561668737,"timestamp_updated":1631742603,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506013751029968262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51507460","author":{"steamid":"76561198268733340","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1823,"last_played":1657395672},"language":"turkish","review":"it's a good game but its hard to find a game as a killer","timestamp_created":1561667551,"timestamp_updated":1561667551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51507263","author":{"steamid":"76561198928730110","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1593485806},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo otimo","timestamp_created":1561667038,"timestamp_updated":1561667038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51506300","author":{"steamid":"76561198931405420","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1641675270},"language":"russian","review":"DJasd]\n","timestamp_created":1561664414,"timestamp_updated":1561664414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479041904211044312","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51506240","author":{"steamid":"76561198208493663","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":46300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31011,"last_played":1656698426},"language":"english","review":"This game never balance killer is too useless every time patch bug?

It's a mash-up of hide-and-seek and the game of tag, set in a horror-esque environment and characters. There are many maps but not a whole lot of mechanics to this game. You can crouch, sprint,  hide in wardrobes, repair V8s and search crates for useful items and perform a few interactions with other survivors, i.e unhooking them, patching them up etc. There are also many perks for you to choose from that will either help you survive the ordeal or make more sacrifices. One could argue that the game seriously lacks mechanics, but you know that didn't stop us enjoying playing hide-and-seek when we were young, so why should it now?\n\nThe mind games are definitely engaging and fun, usually the team will be divided into those who spend their whole time on a hook and those that actually meticulously make progress, adapting to the kerfuffle caused by their team mates and making the most of it. \n\nThis isn't a game you will be playing match after match after match, it's more of something you play for the occasional fun time running around from the murderous b*stard, who is the killer. Well, I don't know, perhaps I shouldn't say that, maybe there are people who play this game religiously, who can say. \nAll in all, I definitely recommend this game on sale, if you need more convincing, have a look at other people's reviews, I am sure some delved in greater detail, but like I already mentioned, it's a very simple game.","timestamp_created":1561646689,"timestamp_updated":1561678663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513755500316619873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51498677","author":{"steamid":"76561198132492032","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":116393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21444,"last_played":1655863261},"language":"english","review":"kinda fun lol","timestamp_created":1561646429,"timestamp_updated":1575070501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51498397","author":{"steamid":"76561198873255143","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1418,"last_played":1563547301},"language":"schinese","review":"从前\n车马很慢\n书信很远\n一生只够爱一个人\n\n\n\n\n萌新买前必看，你看了后会感谢我，并且点个赞的。[spoiler] \n①关注黎明杀机社区，将会收到人类时装。\n②购买求生之路2，将会收到人类时装红色衣服，\n黑色爪子衣服，然后再点击求生之路2客服--随便选择一个原因-点击申请退款。\n这样你就白嫖了好几件时装\t[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1561645827,"timestamp_updated":1561886841,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455707371234893799","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51497927","author":{"steamid":"76561198964367918","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2279,"last_played":1640469407},"language":"english","review":"A nice game to play with friends but don't solo que as you will find very toxic pepole XD\n","timestamp_created":1561644769,"timestamp_updated":1561644769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51497762","author":{"steamid":"76561197964104173","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1562373226},"language":"english","review":"Great game, bit of a toxic community but the game is very well made.","timestamp_created":1561644456,"timestamp_updated":1561644456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51497728","author":{"steamid":"76561198875279374","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":77411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2536,"last_played":1649904088},"language":"english","review":"===[Público Alvo]===\n☐ Crianças\n☐ Todos\n☑ Jogadores casuais\n☑ Jogadores profissionais\n\n===[Gráficos]===\n☐ Ruim\n☑ Mediano\n☐ Bonito\n☐ Obra prima\n\n===[Preço/Qualidade]===\n☐ Gratuito\n☐ Justo\n☑ Espere por promoção\n☐ Não compre\n\n===[Requisitos do PC]===\n☐ Calculadora\n☑ Mínimo\n☑Médio\n☐ Rápido\n☐ High end\n☐ PC da NASA\n\n===[Dificuldade]===\n☐ Só precisa de 2 mãos\n☐ Fácil\n☑ Fácil de aprender / Difícil de dominar\n☐ Difícil\n☐ Difícil (nas primeiras horas)\n☐ Nível Dark Souls\n\n\n===[Tempo de Jogo da Campanha / Duração]===\n☐ Muito curto (0 -

i7-6700iq\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 950m\n\nAt the beginning, i can run the game menu on low at 60fps, around 30~32fps at ultra, but when i went from ultra back to low setting, sometimes i will only get 30fps, and then 40fps on high, and for some reasons, medium, puts me on 25fps. I still have around at least 50fps on both tutorials, but then when i tried to get into a game, i can't even reach 20fps, sometimes it drops down to 5fps, it's literally a slideshow when playing the game, as a survivor, i can't even move, the killer literally just showed up on my screen for 1 frame and the next time when my I can see myself again, i am already on the killer's shoulder, i haven't even played the game, i haven't even seen 75% of the map yet, not even exaggerating, the \"system requirements\" is probably referring to the menu, to actually play the game, you will need a much better PC, And why aren't there any sliders for individual settings like texture, AA, why is there only 4 graphic presets and that's it?\n\nIf you want to try to understand a certain game mechanic, status or whatever, you will never find your information in the game, most of the stuff is on the wiki, sometimes even wiki don't have the answer, so you have to go to the forum and see if anybody had asked the question before, or ask it yourself, so to start playing the game, you will be alt+tabing in and out of the game to look up what exhaustion is, what haste is, what is a totem, what is a token, what tokens have to do with the Hex totems, what crazed spirit for Hillbilly means, btw that's not even explained in the wiki, to find out what the things does, you'll have to use it yourself, or deliberated let a killer to use the thing on you. Another thing is that the states, sometimes in the description for the add-ons/perks or what not, tell you \"XXX will considerably decrease YYY cooldown\" or \"XXX will slightly reduce the noise made YYY\", funny enough, the description for another add-ons or perk, will actually tell you \"XXX will increase 50% of YYY\" something like that, and also numbers for increased range or something in meters like 6m or 8m, literally the game devs could have just turn everything into numbers, cuz the actual number of the \"slightly\" \"moderately\" \"considerably\" are known, they are on the wiki page, why you, the game devs, need to put a word for the numbers, and then explain the word's meaning on the wiki page? It gets worst if you are facing other killers that you are not familiar of, and all of a sudden you have even more game mechanics like doctor switching abilities, spirit world, dream world, jigsaw boxes, pool of devotion, all this game mechanics on the descriptions, you won't even know what they are until you got caught by the killer, and guess where all this infos are once again? The wiki page.\n\nThis is just stupid, and finally, it's not big of a deal, but i might as well point it out as well, the tutorial didn't even tell you half of everything, it just teach you how to win the game, but for example, afaik, it never tells you how to run, it never tells you how to use killer's power, until you check the control bindings and found out that you can do it, it also won't tell you how to use the pallets, if you are like me, playing under 20fps, at your screen you just blinked through it, i guess it will tell you when you walk near it, but for me it never told me cuz i just blinked through it, and i doubt if you are running to quickly when being chased by a killer, you'd also miss it and never know how to do it.\n\nAll in all, i will not recommend this game at
