Killers are a blast and love how unique each one is, along with the survivors have their own unique perks as well, making each and every killer & survivor 1 of a kind in the aspect of their character specific perks, and skins for their appearance. The grade rank progressing is nice, for survivors and killers has its own grade progression rank as well. I love that you can main survivor or killer or even both if you so choose, take your time or cram the hours to level up killers and survivors. I enjoy knowing all my blood points i gain whether be from playing my survivors or killers, these points may be spent on anyone i feel like and in any way i choose. The multiplayer online is a blast, even more with friends to fill your lobby vs randos who aren't always the best of teammates but its still a blast. I like most that this game gives me 2 feelings playing it based on whether i choose to play survivor for the thrills and chills, or play the killer for the adrenaline fueled enjoyment, either way i don't see anyone who tries this game to find themselves to be unhappy with it by any means. The mechanics, graphics, and all just work flawlessly, plus its cross platform (consoles, pc all play together), the game is inexpensive, has amazing dlc, and always having updated, survivors, killers, dlc added, plus has season passes you can choose to do the rift challenges (free or premium) and gain more blood points and rewards to unlock for your playing enjoyment. So i would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a 4 survivor VS 1 killer lobby challenge, best of both worlds to me all under 1 roof. (only negative to me is based on what times you play and how many people you got in your lobby starting to play, if playing survivor, to fill the slots can take a few (avg lobby times for me has been about 3-7 min generally) as for the killers (avg lobby times for me have been 30 seconds - 3 min. max)","timestamp_created":1638233946,"timestamp_updated":1640760271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104775237","author":{"steamid":"76561198821026813","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":184,"playtime_at_review":26036,"last_played":1660078948},"language":"english","review":"game is trash but kinda fun. would recommend :?","timestamp_created":1638233762,"timestamp_updated":1638233762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104775220","author":{"steamid":"76561198980079284","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":73213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":286,"playtime_at_review":60656,"last_played":1660410363},"language":"russian","review":"‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç—ã –≤ —Å–≤–æ—é –ø–µ—Ä–≤—É—é –∫–∞—Ç–∫—É –∑–∞ –º–∞–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª 4 —Ç–æ–∫—Å–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—É—Ä–≤–æ–≤ –≤ –ø–∞—Ç–∏|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç—ã –∑–∞ —Å—É—Ä–≤–∞ —Å–∫–∏–¥—ã–≤–∞–ª –≤—Å–µ –ø–∞–ª–µ—Ç—ã, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–ª –∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ç—å|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç–µ–±—è –∫–µ–º–ø–∏—Ç –∏ —Ç—É–Ω–Ω–µ–ª–∏—Ç –º–∞–Ω|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –î–±–¥ —ç—Ç–æ —Å–∏–º—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä –∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–µ–≤ –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª–µ|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç—ã –Ω–∞—É—á–∏–ª—Å—è –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å 360¬∞ –Ω–æ –æ–Ω–æ –Ω–µ –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∞–µ—Ç|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç—ã –≤—ã—É—á–∏–ª —Ç–∞–π–º–∏–Ω–≥ –∏ –æ—Å–ª–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ñ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä–∏–∫–æ–º, –Ω–∞—É—á–∏–ª—Å—è –±–µ–≥–∞—Ç—å –≤ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–∞–ª–µ—Ç–µ 3 000 –ª–µ—Ç|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ø–∏–Ω–≥ –∑–∞ 1000|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç–µ–±—è –ø—Ä–æ–±–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç –≤ –æ–∫–Ω–æ/–ø–∞–ª–µ—Ç—É –∑–∞ 3 –∫–º|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Å—É—Ä–≤ –ø—Ä–∏—Å–µ–¥–∞–µ—Ç —É –ø–∞–ª–µ—Ç—ã/–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Ç|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç—ã –ø–æ–¥–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –±—É–±–±–∞ —Å –∏–Ω—Å–∏–¥–∏—É—Å–æ–º|\n\n‚Ä¢–î–ë–î —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ \n[–°–û–ï–î–ò–ù–ï–ù–ò–ï –†–ê–ó–û–†–ê–í–ù–û]","timestamp_created":1638233750,"timestamp_updated":1638233750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104774405","author":{"steamid":"76561198340173687","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":69696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":60330,"last_played":1660397896},"language":"english","review":"=]","timestamp_created":1638233133,"timestamp_updated":1638233133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104773767","author":{"steamid":"76561198070518159","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":30931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30439,"last_played":1657738370},"language":"french","review":"Les gens n'ont pas √† jouer comme vous le voulez","timestamp_created":1638232651,"timestamp_updated":1638232651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104773489","author":{"steamid":"76561197976447352","num_games_owned":1469,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":104460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103810,"last_played":1653086598},"language":"english","review":"meh.","timestamp_created":1638232432,"timestamp_updated":1638232432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104773390","author":{"steamid":"76561198226039512","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1748,"last_played":1655273090},"language":"english","review":"kewl","timestamp_created":1638232356,"timestamp_updated":1638232356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104773269","author":{"steamid":"76561198123609493","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":21829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":16854,"last_played":1660176607},"language":"english","review":"Its one of those hate/love games where you can either have a lot of fun, or it ruins your night.

There are so many different overpowered perks, addons, items, survivor mechanics, and killers that it results in a never ending race to the bottom to see which survivor can flashlight stun a killer through every single unskippable animation and to see which killer can slug, tunnel, and facecamp their way to victory. As a survivor, I'm constantly finding killers with unbeatable ability and perk combos that completely snuff out my chance of getting anything done. Plague killer? Now I can either play the rest of the game injured or have to cleanse and let Plague get a beam of death to snipe me across the map with. Myers killer? Now I'm constantly exposed. Spirit killer? Now she can teleport right to me. And those are just their base abilities as well! Let alone the ridiculous addons and perks that completely throw off any kind of balance for survivors. As a killer, I'm constantly finding games where I feel weaker than the survivors. How is that possible? How am I an immortal knife wielding harbinger of death and the guy with the plank of wood and the clicky click flashlight is the one who's more powerful? Why do survivors get to evade attacks every 30 seconds? Why are survivors able to body block hooks so they wiggle out of my hands? Why can survivors just evade damage when I'm getting people off hook? And to add insult to injury, 99% of games I play as killer has survivors T-bagging and other toxic behaviors to make playing killer an absolutely miserable experience.\n\nThis isn't even going into how much grinding and money you have to put into actually getting a meta setup. In order to unlock survivor specific perks, you need to 1). buy the character and 2.) level them up to level 30 for the *chance* that it pops up in other character's bloodwebs. Just to even get to level 30, you need about a million bloodpoints. Considering that the max you can get each game is 32,000, that means that if you played perfectly every game, it'll take about 31 games to reach 1mil. If each game is 10 minutes, that means it will take 5.2 hours at the bare minimum to just get to the point where you can unlock teachable perks. FOR ONE CHARACTER! That's assuming you play every game perfectly, so if you don't, it'll take EVEN LONGER!\n\nThe skill based matchmaking is also broken. I am in Ash rank and I keep getting Iridescent rank people and I get dunked on because of it. I thought the entire point was that it was supposed to matchmake me with people around my skill level, not to just throw me into a game with Twitch tryhards despite not even moving out of the lowest rank.\n\nSo, in summary, this game is an unbalanced mess of broken abilities and items, most of which are gatekept through a paywall and dozens of hours worth of playtime, and even if you do have them, you'll get put up against sweats because this game will matchmake you with people that play this game religiously while you're just here for a quick game to relax. This game has a very \"destiny\" pull to it, as in it's a bad game, but the gameplay loop and general mechanics are just fun enough to keep you coming back to it only for it to bite you in the ass with its awful balancing. It's addictive, but boy does it have a catch...","timestamp_created":1638230697,"timestamp_updated":1638230697,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104770380","author":{"steamid":"76561199010530346","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":14448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13223,"last_played":1655706979},"language":"english","review":"shit game, no walter white or springtrap","timestamp_created":1638230093,"timestamp_updated":1650801149,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104770369","author":{"steamid":"76561198803421670","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":722,"playtime_at_review":4586,"last_played":1660543149},"language":"english","review":"i hate this game but atleast i look hot","timestamp_created":1638230086,"timestamp_updated":1638230086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104769835","author":{"steamid":"76561198240842006","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25979,"last_played":1644769733},"language":"polish","review":"W skr√≥cie gra warta hajsu (najlepiej je≈õli masz z kim graƒá) ale bez znajomych r√≥wnie≈º jest ok lecz nie na tyle jakby mog≈Çaby byƒá.\n\nA teraz bardziej szczeg√≥≈Çowo, jest to gra kt√≥ra jednak jest stale aktualizowana dodawani sƒÖ nowi mordercy, nowe perki, mapy, odnowione mapy, bardzo fajnie ≈ºe tw√≥rcy tej gry nie zaprzepaszczajƒÖ jej i starajƒÖ siƒô dalej jakkolwiek jƒÖ polepszaƒá ale jednak to wszystko zaczyna zataczaƒá krƒÖg.

have played this game for almost 150 hours and i think its really bad at this state since theres so many cheaters and trolls that body blocks or spam the unhook button or fails all your healing on purpose or they just run and hide far away from you and spam crouching and after hearing about the DDoS attacks and leaks of your info and location its scary to play this game now i woulnt recommend it anymore also it will be free on epic games (yay cant wait for more hackers and trolls) so lets see if bhvr will do anything after the game is dead and everyone can get their hands on any dlc or perks or rank etc without doing/paying anything maybe Bhvr will care? and the devs doesnt care about your opinion or the reported players its so sad i love this game but now its a mess of cheaters and trolls on consoles and pc\n\nedit: Today was my first game after a few months break and i was playing a game and the other survivors were helping the killer and i got hooked meanwhile these hackers crashing my game and my whole steam i coulnt reconnect and had to restart my pc and my steam to be able to log back in LMAO (i could still polay other games other than steam) they still havent fixed the DDOS AND HACKERS ISSUE GARBAGE GAME DONT BUY AND RECOMMEND!!!!!\n\nedit 6-13 \nAfter playing one game the game wopulnt close and somehow deleted its own files and its broken now i cant even open
