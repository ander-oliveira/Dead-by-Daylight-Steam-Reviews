The direction it's taking is more and more leaning into braindead gameplay wherein the only skillful interactions in the game are removed by certain killer's powers, which offer no alternative.\n\nTake the Trickster; he's basically the huntress but offers no outplay potential on his power. Where huntress replaced the usual looping gameplay with hatchet dodging, another skillful, if different gamplay, the Trickster is more like machinegun bullet dodging and about as fulfilling.\n\nSecond let's look at the newest map they've 'come out with' though 'shat out' might be a better way of putting it. The Raccoon Police Department has some pros and cons, let's look at them now:\n\nPros:\n-faithful to the game it came from\n-looks pwetty (for a ps3 game that is)\n\ncons\n-everything other possible bad thing one could nail to it, literally every problem that any indoor map has, RPD does it ten times worse.\n\nI keep the original review for posterity.\n\nTake this recommendation tepidly. I've played what I'd call a \"Stint\" of 100 Hours at this point, maybe not the vast quantity of time to qualify me as a Veteran of the game but enough to get a good feel for it.\n\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game, one person plays as a \"Killer\", four play as \"Survivors\". Survivors are played in Third person, and aim to repair generators to power and thereafter open exit gates through which they escape the match, all the while trying to avoid, evade, distract, defy and annoy the Killer, who has a first person view and whose job it is to make the Survivors not Survivors any more, by hitting them twice then hanging them up on a hook like a pig in a slaughterhouse and waiting for some being called \"The Entity\" to take their soul as some kind of ritual sacrifice. \n\nMaps are largely randomly generated with certain fixed features, mainstays are the Generator the survirors repair and the Hooks that they don't want to end up on. Most maps are fairly well balanced between allowing survivors some opportunity to escape and giving the killers a chance to catch them, but I'd say that some absolutely dumpster certain killers, the map most guilty of this is called Lery's Memorial Institute and is incredibly difficult for some killers that rely on line of sight and straight line/open areas. You can also get shafted by procedural generation either way, sometimes there won't be a vaultable obstacle/droppable barricade (pallet) in sight, other times it will seem like you're in the starter area of the first Pokemon Game.\n\nThere are a variety of Killers, who are for the most part, faster than survivors on the ground, but slower when traversing obstacles (All but one killer will outrun a survivor in a straight line but will lose considerable distance when climbing through a window) and all killers also possess a \"Power\" to provide an additional edge to catching people. For example the Flagship killer, the \"Trapper\" places beartraps that injure and ensare survivors until they are freed by an ally or are lucky enough to free themselves.\n\nSurvivors are not greatly varied; they possess different standard \"Perks\" which are unlocked through expending points you are awarded for your performance in game in the \"Bloodweb\" which is a randomly generated web which contains various consumable rewards and one or two perks to choose from. Killers also have their own perks and bloodweb as well and so have their own progression and both sides can build a loadout that suits their playstyle and/or needs in current Meta.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Survivors will play one of two ways; the cautious, high stealth objective focused ones, that logically would seem the more sensible option but doesn't get rewarded with points that well, and the brazen, overtly altruistic ones that will not attempt to escape the killer when they are found but would rather run them around the many obstacles dotted through the level and perform \"pallet loops\" which is where they run around the terrain near a droppable barricade called a pallet to try and waste as much of the killer's time as possible.\n\nThere are also Daily Rituals, which are a little mission given every 24 hours to the effect of doing something particular in game and being given a big Bloodpoint (in-game currency) reward. Sounds like a great idea and a way of getting people to play all the character to perhaps open their eyes to something they're missing out on, but in practice it will often mean you feel pressganged into playing a character that you otherwise wouldn't be, and when you find you don't like that character but the bloodpoint reward would be great for one that you do like, and seeing as you've already started the mission you might as well finish right? That's the kind of thing that will have you clawing at the walls for release. It's honestly hell to be given a quest with a killer that you don't play.\n\nA word on balance, from the perspective of a person who mostly plays survivor (me). Killer is the harder role to play, simpler (mostly, Nurse is not simple however) but almost certainly harder. Most survivors at any level higher than 18 (do bear in mind that Ranks count down from the start point of 20) are canny enough to be able to pallet loop effectively, and know that when a killer is locked into an animation (such as smashing a pallet, picking up a downed survivor) they can, with no counterplay on the killer's part, shine a flashlight in their eyes, blinding them, causing them to drop any survivor they are carrying (which restores the survivor's ability to run) and disorients them.\n\nSimply put; the game is somewhat unbalanced in favour of survivors. Quite considerably, in fact. Killers require a great deal more mechanical skill and better judgement than survivors, and even then will sometimes struggle as Survivors possess a number of abilities than can delay and derail a killers actions without any means for the killer to respond. And a lot of survivors are not very polite about it; brazenly goading killers, mocking them in post-game chat if they survive, insulting the killer for their gameplay style if they lose.\n\nAnd please, bear in mind, I play mostly survivor. I have prestiged 2 survivors and I've barely gotten a killer past the halfway mark. If someone on this side of the fence thinks it's a little unfair, imagine what the Killer Mains must feel like.\n\nAnyway, I'd say the game is highly atmospheric for your first maybe 20-30 games, and can be past that point depending on how each individual match goes, that the premise is interesting and is the logical way that asymmetrical multiplayer works best, that the gameplay is addictive and frustrating at once. But also unbalanced and somewhat buggy, if you can deal with that, go right ahead.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to add in this edit about a year later, after finally having reached high ranks (3-1, mostly due to sporadic play and very short seasons but now I just sound like I'm making excuses). High rank is really boring. Both as Killer and Survivor. Games are over so quickly, for killers this is because at high rank survivors are better organised and more efficient moving around the map, not to mention if certain perks are deactivated early the Generators can be repaired at a ridiculous rate. And for survivors it's because all the killers are running Memento Moris. To those uninitiated, a Mori, as they're known, allows a killer to slay a survivor by their own hand, rather than having to hook them for sacrifice, and depending on the Rarity of the Mori, (Cypress, Ivory or Ebony) the killer can slay up to all of the surivovrs after only a single hook each. Needless to say this shortens the game considerably and leaves little room for error or space for doing Altruistic actions.","timestamp_created":1510778493,"timestamp_updated":1637697799,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36538753","author":{"steamid":"76561198442993224","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":123233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1659451742},"language":"italian","review":"Coinvolgente.

played since the Beta and had a lot of fun with it. It's amazing value for money and has almost limitless replayability. The game was incredibly buggy and still stuffers from issues today, although the devs keep dropping patches, fixes and small gameplay tweaks to help improve things and its come a long way with many positive improvements.\n\nSadly I have to say that the game seems to have drifted into a very bad place and needs to serious work to put it back on track. Ultimately the premise of the game is based around hide and seek, where the seeker is a killer hunting for his/her prey (the survivors). These survivors are in constant fear for their lives and must try to repair generators as quickly as they can in order to power the exit gates so they can flee the killer and reach safety. This is the problem.. the contant fear just isn't there any longer, survivors simply taunt and run rings around killers often armed with a vast array of tools and perks readily at their disposal addiitonally teams of friends can communicate over voice chat giving a monoumenal tactical advantage against the killer.\n\nMajor work is needed on the game in order to bring about some balance, at the moment killers are often too powerful against newer or less skilled players. Whilst at the same time survivors become far too powerful in the late game, changes need to be included that keep the same level of fear new players experience and make escaping the killer actually challenging at all skill levels. This keep things fun for everyone its more rewarding to know you escaped when the odds were stacked against you and keeps killers engaged in the game.\n\nMoving on to DLC\n\nI've purchased all DLC so far and been quite happy with the chapters some good some average until the most recent one - Freddy krueger aka 'The Nightmare'. There was a lot of excitement around this new licenced killer and when it was released I found it to have quite a learning curve although it was very easy to track and down a single survivor it was quite tricky to manage all 4 of them and resulted in a LOT of running about in chases. Ultimatley I found him a little weak but with the right perks and techniques I could see him being a fun killer. Just ONE WEEK after release a tsunami of hatred fell upon Freddy from the survivor community calling for nerfs and complaint about him being too strong many of them being very new to the game as I mentioned earlier inexperienced players will struggle early on and shouldnt be a judge of game balance from one side.\n       The NERF hit a few weeks after release, with freddy suffering badly in all areas. Whilst the devs didn't go ahead with 100% of their initial planned nerfs the ones that they brough in were completely uneccessary and went too far destroying a paid DLC killer based on the loudest cries from the community. Freddy now stands a shadow of his former self and has become the weakest killer in the game; which is a shame as im sure he was play tested and balanced internally before all of that was just thrown away.\n\nBehavior Digital have seen the last of my money and I will no longer purchase any future DLC, I'll continue to enjoy the game playing as surivor and killer but have been burned by this recent decisions and will stick to consuming the free content thats offered with the hope that they learn lessons and attempt to put the game back on course to where it should be.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros\n\n- Game is amazing value for money (especially in the sales)\n- Procedurally generated maps make for high replayability\n- Active development, new patches and changes\n- Open and engaging with community on development\n- New free content included not just paid DLC\n- Very active player base\n\nCons\n\n- Still major bugs in game even so long after release (including save game loses)\n- High levels of toxicity  (im looking at you post game chat)\n- Game promotes bad play styles (infinite pallet looping, hook camping)\n- Poor balance between killer and survivor (playing killer as killer at rank 1 is not fun and SWF can be a joke)\n- A round can be ruined for others when a player purposefully disconnects (which happens far too often)\n\n\nI reach rank 1 killer and rank 1 survivor after each reset and have played serveral hundred hours as both sides, hopefully that gives me a little weight behind my experiences so far in reviewing this.","timestamp_created":1510717531,"timestamp_updated":1510717531,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":306,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.778733134269714355","comment_count":29,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36524157","author":{"steamid":"76561198399196853","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1337,"last_played":1543840532},"language":"russian","review":"Вообщем-то захожу первый раз в игру значит, ну вроде понял надо геники чинить, значат чиню геник а все это время из-за дерева за мной маньяк смотрел, я такой \"о привет! \"  меня тяпнул он своей секирой , я ковылял к товарищам а хрен вам!
