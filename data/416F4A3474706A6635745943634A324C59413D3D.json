When survivor gets discovered by the killer, and a game of cat and mouse ensues. The survivor must jump through windows, lay down a barricade, or hide in a closet.\nThe killer's role is pretty straight forward. You must kill these people, so you may sacrifice them to a dark entity. Which is a giant hook that you hang them on so they can await their death. There's 5 killers that you can choose from. Each with their own unique characteristic. You have a Trapper that lays bear traps. ( Doesn't sound like a good killer but he's probably the toughest one to beat. There's a Wraith, who has the ability to turn invisible and not warn you when he's close. A hillbilly that weilds a huge hammer and a chainsaw that he revs up to give him speed. Then a new addition of a nurse, who can teleport through walls.\n\n\nNow, here is why I give it a negative rating. The game was pushed out too fast. There are still so many bugs. Like disconnecting you while you are in the middle of something important. \nTrying to play a game with a friend? Should be as easy as, open room, invite friend, que. But You will have to repeat those steps a lot because it would kick you back to the main menu.\nAnother really bad thing. THe game goes off of a ranking system on your character. When you que up to play a game, you will not play against people of you're skill level. A brand new person could go up against the top ranked. Making for a horrible experience.\n\nThe game in all is great. You will have fun if you can get one going. But because of the bugs, I have to put it down. Hopefully they fix it soon. \n\nGive it a chance though. It's still a good game.","timestamp_created":1472374726,"timestamp_updated":1472374726,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540067672729492188","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25201191","author":{"steamid":"76561198197369729","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":56864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39598,"last_played":1597579645},"language":"russian","review":"Решил поиграть.\nВыбил фиолетовый фонарик.\nПоставил аддоны(батарейки).\nВ итоге у меня Фиолетовый фонарь который светит Капец как долго.\nЯ каждый раз светил маньяка.\nИспортил ему всю игру.\nОн меня за кемппил т.к. уже можно было сбежать.\nОказалось что у него Детище тьмы.\nОпупенно поиграл.

It forces you to choose and f*cks you for choosing wrong, like trying to save a person just to get stuck in a trap and see the guy run away and leaving you behind to fill his place. SCREW THAT GUY, IF YOU ARE THAT GUY SCREW YOU. Besides that, the Action/Consequence... Mind? in this game is amazing. Few things need to change, quickly.\nLike the perks, REMOVE THE TEACHABLE PERKS, At some point the characters becames just cosmedic, which is stupid cuz an athlete can \"teach\" someone to run fast for a couple seconds. After you get all the perks for all characters, you almost always choose the same 3 (self-care, saboteur, and Sprint burst (sometimes premonition or spinechill)) So whats the difference between Meg, Jake, Claudette, Nea and the last picked for the team at school guy. Like, you can play Dwight, DWIGHT, F*CKING DWIGHT and win. Just cuz you have all the perks and Dwight is actually Jake in a ret*rd costume. Get rid of that or a better Idea, BUFF THE OTHER PERKS. The box perk is amazing... for the first time you play the game, after that, you know where the boxes spawns and it becomes useless. Leave as it is at level one and at level 2 it increases your chances to get a better item, And at level 3, it the items comes with add-ons. Bunch of other perks need a change. Don`t nerf what`s working like Riot, Buff what is not.\nThe killer, After a few rounds it not scary anymore. Remove the red light from his face so people can be caught by surprise. They need to keep an eye on the killer, isn't that the reason that you have detection perks? So people can know that the killer is coming? Then what's the reason that they need the red light?\nThe survivors, If you don't change the perks, change the basic stats. Like the sprint speed, why can't meg run faster the claudette? she can run faster for a few seconds then she is back at the crawling, and why does Jake can't fix the generator faster the Dwight? Put jake to fix things faster, Meg to run faster (a bit faster then the nurse so that she needs to blink to catch up), Claudette to heal herself and other faster, and Dwight to be the most rounded character, Nea... she can be a more aggresive character, like wiggle out faster, more chance to escape hooks, stuns last longer etc but she is slower at everything OR GET THE ITEMS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT SOME CHARACTERS. Toolboxes should be more effective for Jake not cuz someone can break a post with a hook at the end by his on hand that he knows how to use a screwdriver. Fix the flashlight, Let us blind the killer even if the turns around. It already lasts very little and its almost impossible to blind the killer even if he is looking right at it, we add the fact that he can turn around and negate that complitly. The map, I like it, But add a add-on so you can mark the hooks. And the skeleton key, one of the most useless items and it is super rare, if you go for the hatch as soon as it apears, you don't pip and lose the round, the add-ons consumes the charges so quickly and are almost useless exept the one that allows you to see the killer through the walls, That could be usefull if IT LASTED FOR 5 SECONDS and if it could see the wraith while invis. \nAnd for last, One thing that almost everyone is complaning, The killer, does not have to kill. THE KILLER, KILLER can be a pacifist and just scare people so they run from him. Fix that. And since you heard my suggestions. get hooks on the corner of the map so people don‘t run to the corner to keep the killer there since they can‘t escape him, people just breaks the hooks on one corner of the map and run to the corner. Get one hook in every corner and that either can‘t be destroyed or takes more time to do. And maybe respawn after some time or a after an event, like a generator getting done or the exits getting powered ot the hatch opening etc. The rest IS AMAZING, Good job with the game. Ah , the the ranks. get rewards for player with high ranks, like cheaper bloodwebs or free items for a some time, or even a new kind of money/points that can only be aquired by piping and with that point you buy items outside the bloodweb, so luck isn‘t involved.\n\ntl;dr Fuck you, do you know how long I had to think to right the most clear review possible so dumb people don‘ get confused and think that I praise hitler for some reason.

Besonders wenn man mit den richtigen Leuten zusammen spielt, kann eine Runde zum großen Spaß werden und ein wahrer Nervenkitzel sein.
