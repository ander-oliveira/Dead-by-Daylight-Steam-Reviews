The problem is that so many people out there that troll, use expoits and camp hooks that the fun can easilly be killed. Players with lots of experience on either the killer or survivor side can end up going against new players and there are so many toxic people in the games that it could lead to new players just refunding the game. People are rewarded for playing dirty and camping the hook as killer or teaming up to basicaly criple the killer.\n\nUnless you can work though this stuff and get lucky in your matches that you dont get the toxic players or if you have a group of friends that you can play with I would not recommend this game.\n\nIf they work on fixing these problems and have things in place to limit a killers and survivors ability to play dirty and be toxic as well as fix killers that are far beyond OP (Freddy once again after they adjusted it before and got a backlash of hate for it) then maybe this game will be a better buy. As for me I will play on rare occations with a friend or group of friends because at least that way I might be able to have some fun with it.\n\nEdit: Also an additional thing is that the matchmaking on this game is broken. People who are high rank can get matched up to casual low ranked players/new players if they are in a Survive With Friends group that has other low ranked people. For example one rank 6 and 3 rank 15-18 will get put up against a rank 17 killer. The rank 6 player who plays this game all the time can run circles around the killer and waste their time, saving their friends and such so the killer will be lucky to get one kill. \n\nThis is especially true if the person playing killer happens to be trapper because their traps quickly get rendered useless by the far more experienced player that runs around and disables them. Then perks that help the killer for when the survivors get to the endgame phase (All generators fixed) are rendered useless because this far more experienced player also has played long enough to use a key to open up another way out that the killer may not even know the location of so them and all their friends can just jump out without having to try the gates.\n\nFinally the killer is even more burdened by the fact that there are so many people that Disconnect from the game if it is not going their way to take away points from the killer by preventing him from getting his hook points. They \"fixed\" this a bit by giving some disconnection points but they are no where near what you would get for a hook. To add insult to injury the reports don't seem to do anything to punish these people and all they have to do is wait 5 seconds to be able to find a new game.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nUnless you are playing with friends or don't mind the above issues then don't buy this game until they fix it..which considering how long they have been going on for...don't expect them to ever be fixed.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTwo years later the killer camping has only gotten worse. If you get anywhere in rank you will get put up constantly against killers that either just stand at the hook and stare at you or they will stand just outside the heartbeat range and stare at you. Killers that play have little to no skill which is why they use this tactic. It is cowardly and only geared to people that enjoy trolling or griefing others. If you play survivor you are going in to just get killed and only survive if you are extremely lucky.\n\nAdditions made to this game such as the timer if the exit door opens or trap door gets closed by the killer make surviving even harder though does help prevent people from needlessly dragging games on. The problem is if the killer closes the trap door which powers the gates you are now on a time limit to both open the gates and exit. Killers can patrol between them quite quickly which is only made worse when the gates spawn near each other. This makes it even harder to survive in these situations as the killers dont even have to down you...just need to keep you from opening the gates.\n\nThe biggest problem as I spoke of earlier is the camping. Killers camping hooks just make the end for survivors a matter of time as it takes too long to complete the generators. Unless you can get everyone else working on generators you wont be able to finish enough of them to power the gates and that is even a bit of a stretch as even with bonuses and people working on it you may get one and a half (two if your lucky with placement) finished before the first person dies. Then you will just end up losing people and it taking even longer to finish a generator. You will end up with one or two left by the end to be completed and the killer can patrol them very easily to keep you from having any chance of escaping.\n\nThe ranking system is also still quite broken with high rankers and low rankers getting paired up all the time. In addition even if you lose a game you still continue to rank up. I went from fresh rank 14 to late rank 12 and I won...two games out of 15ish? HOW does that even work!? It is impossible for you to ever play with people your own skill level after playing for a bit and no matter how much you report the bad players the developers wont do a damn thing about it.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nYou want to play as the killer and just be a prick to people then get this game. You want a challenge while still having a chance to escape as a survivor, dont get this game. It is solely geared for the killers with no care about survivors no matter what the devs say. They even say they put killers out initially as too powerful and then \"balance them\" later. Get this if you and 4 other friend just want to play together and have fun.","timestamp_created":1532219322,"timestamp_updated":1619107116,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489323854446411133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43670663","author":{"steamid":"76561198057793194","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":65984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32927,"last_played":1640127261},"language":"english","review":"10/10 Would loop again.","timestamp_created":1532218409,"timestamp_updated":1532218409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538539528846740723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43670619","author":{"steamid":"76561198287051774","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2627,"last_played":1653857471},"language":"german","review":"Ich finde dieses Spiel sehr gut.

It acts as a cat and mouse game on both the suvivours and killers sides with you trying to outwit and predict what the other will do. It's not without it's flaws like all prominantly online games but it's definately one that is worth playing.\n\nPRO\n- Games are pretty quick to find due to a good number of people playing\n- Each game is different with opponents, teammates and the randomly generated maps.\n- Every suvivour and killer has their own unique perks and abilities.\n- Plenty of killers and survivours to choose from and well timed and decently priced DLC (which include new maps)\n- Graphics are pretty nice and it runs well.\n- Lots of crossovers into different horror franchises that works great such as Michael Myers from Halloween, the Pig from Saw, Freddy Keruger from Nightmare on Elm Street.\n- Each game lasts roughly between 5 to 20 minutes depending on how well the players are doing which is a good length so it's not over too fast or you're getting bored.\n- Ranking system and levelling gives the grind a good feel. As you level up and spend points on the bloodweb you gain new perks, abilities and items that you can use in the games.\n- The music and atmospheric sounds really add to the tense aura of the game and that's not even mentioning the heartbeat that plays when the killers are near.\n- Events are held every so often which give special bonus' for in game events which are fun to go for.\n- There is no forcing players to work together which is great if you prefer to play solo. It actualyl tells you that you can do either and it will have pros and cons, it's about whichever works best for you.\n- Survivours play in third person to give an advantage of a heightened sense of \"awareness\" while the killers play in first person which is a great design choice.\n\nCON\n- No single player tutorial, it's all just text. It's alright but there's a lot to cover.\n- Players can sometimes be obnixious and quit before you're able to kill them. You get points but I don't think it's as much as it would be if you killed them nor is there much in the way of a punishment for that.\n- At first there were special DLC outfits that you could buy for cheap but it seems that they have implemented an \"in game currency\" for that which you can only use real money to get (that I know of). It wouldn't be as bad but there is a very limited selection as of now eg, plenty for survivours, not as much for killers.\n- Some players do enjoy running around the same thing over and over again so be prepared for a little frustration when vying to kill them.\n\nDead by Daylight is a great game if you can get past the 1 in 10 games that's pretty bad due to some annoying or frustrating players. But from my experience most of the games ar ereally fun and tense with everyone taking part and playing their role. If you enjoy a game of strategic teamwork or a game of brutal, bloody murder then give it a try.","timestamp_created":1532216773,"timestamp_updated":1532216773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43670182","author":{"steamid":"76561198275117476","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":51544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2323,"last_played":1654892178},"language":"english","review":"Fun Game, The game has some bugs in it but it is so damn addictive, very fun for people who like horror games, and cat mouse games","timestamp_created":1532216002,"timestamp_updated":1567720039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43670180","author":{"steamid":"76561198118871503","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":29542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7735,"last_played":1653962929},"language":"english","review":"Loop killer, get hit through window, get hit from a metre away, die, hit decisive, get adrenaline go to exit gate, die to devour hope's exposed status effect that you DID NOT activate on throught the exit gate, teammates that have not done a single gen do not save you, die on first hook.

I have been a devoted player for well over 4 years, streamed it for the missus, have been following since before the release, participated in the mobile beta and various PTBs etc. So I'll give as honest review as I can. And it should be noted that I play a fair amount of both sides.\n\nFirst off, the good has mostly stayed the same to my previous review. I've nominated this game for the \"Labor of Love\" award in the upcoming 2020 Steam Awards. I did the same last year and I know many mind find that abhorrent. \n\n[list]Pros:\n[*]Fun game-play, it will seem daunting at first but once you get a hang of the mechanics and know what to do, you'll get there. There's nothing quite like the feeling of fear when facing a killer, which is what you'll get if its your first time playing. After 4 years? Not so much. But it's still a hell of a thrill. Adrenaline pumping and we're still getting new killers added.\n\n[*]Ranking system is decent. There's been a new one since last years with a hidden MMR system kind of like League of Legends. It's worked well for me so far. The \"Bloodpoints\" and how they're earned are much more easier than back in the day and now with the archives, there's plenty of ways to level up the characters.\n\n[*]Surviving with friends is fun, alas, I don't play it as often as I play by myself. Oh hey, we have crossplay with literally everyone? PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Stadia, MS Store? That's an impressive feat and a much appreciated one! I tip my hat to the devs.\n\n[*]There's a vast choice of characters to choose from, which in itself can be a little daunting. Killers are always unique for the most part, which is nice to see. On top of that, there's an even larger variety of perks to customize your character into pretty much ANY play style you can think of, there are of course, meta perks as per usual. Meta perks haven't really changed all that much, which is a small gripe.\n\n[*]We're now getting consistent patches with always detailed descriptions of what has changed, the communication between devs and players (despite what some may think) is great, especially for a big community such as this. This has improved since my last review last year. Also shoutout to the DBD Twitter Guy. You da best.\n\n[*]Lore: The lore in this game is pretty damn solid, making me hungry for more. Back when it first released in '16, there was a small back story for each and that was about it. (The game was projected to only sell about 800,000 units after all) But as it is now, they've expanded massively, especially with the archives where we can learn about the killers back before they willingly (or unwillingly) joined The Entity. (On a side note, the \"battle pass\" system in place is completely fine)\n\n[*]Music: Michel F April does a fantastic job with all the tracks in the game. They give you a good sense of terror but also give you that pump of adrenaline and it works fantastic. Hell, sometimes I'll get chased for the music. I hope we get an update soon.\n\n[*]Licensed Killers: This one is a bit of a middle ground for me, since don't get me wrong, its great to see. Myers is great, Freddy is great, Demogorgon is great (with awesome sound design), Leatherface, is okay at best but not as viable as the rest. Pig makes cute squeaks when pallet stunned, 'nuff said. And finally, GhostFace. Now I like what they did for this, since they went for the license to the mask, rather than the film, giving them more ideas to go with and able to make his own unique story (even same name as me)\n[/list]\n\n[list]Cons:\n[*]Buggy. Yes this is probably a big one for some. T-pose Myers? Floating head Myers with a Chainsaw? There's been some hilarious and some not so much. Dedicated Servers are a blessing, though we suffered through some major hiccups to get where we are and they still aren't perfect. (For example, Huntress hatches registering as 2 hits, causing an insta-down)\n\n[*]Whilst I gave a pro point for the variety of characters, there are A LOT to purchase, especially for those looking to buy the game for the first time. On top of that, there are cosmetics as well, which would mean more money (but is optional of course).\n\n[*]The community. Don't get me wrong, you do get some good eggs but good god, there are some major bad eggs. Hook camping, sandbagging, tunneller are terms you will 100% come across as you play the game, even if you played as fair as you can possibly play. Don't be like this, don't get into that mentality. It ends up scaring off many players. The game-play can't even be enjoyed when killers and survivors alike have a go at you post game for making one wrong move, which will happen. We're only human after all. Disconnecting is common practice in the lower ranks. Both ends of the game faces challenges and toxicity.\n[/list]\n\nIt's a fun game but becomes a more challenging as you progress in to the higher red ranks, especially as a killer. It'll often stress you out. The devs, despite it all are still trying make things the best they can be. I tip my hat to those in the art team, cause it is gorgeous. They could have let this game die and leave it how it was back in '16. Trust me, you wouldn't want that (have a check on Youtube).\n\nI do recommend it definitely. [b] My only advice is that with this particular game, take breaks. [/b] [i] They will be needed. [/i]\n\nNot much has changed from my original review from a year ago. Bugs are being worked on, graphical updates to all the older maps are absolutely stunning. \n\nI could go on and on. Yes there are times where I don't play this game for a while but I always find myself coming back to it.\n\nDead By Daylight has lived for 4 years and I can guarantee it'll be around for another 4 years, if not more. \n\n[b] See you in the Fog!

Once a Killer hooked someone, the camp near the hooked person and stay until they die.

Their report system is very incomplete so you will run into a lot of hackers and very toxic players that consistently use hate speech and racial slurs at you. Also latley I feel they have constantly nerfed the survivors side of things and it is very easy as a killer once you are able to have all 4 perks you want in a build to get a 4 kill match. Also you get more bloodpoints as a killer than you do as a survivor so if you like being a survivor main but, are trying to level up/prestiege. You are going to have to play killer to get any bloodpoints. 80% of your dailys will also be killer dailys. Also Killers usually dodge a group of 4 anyways so it almost always takes forever to find a macth. So it could be a great game.

I'm going to cover both the strengths and weakness of the game in its current state. The game is unique in its killers, map design, perks, and addons. It offers players a very large learning curve, that is both interesting and compelling. There is a lot of flavor text and lore. The store is an amazing thing for DBD, and theres always fresh content coming. \n\n       As I’ve said before the killers have a ton of different unique powers. These alongside their addons really contribute to making no game the same. Every game you join in will have a different map and a different level design since there’s parts that are randomly generated, from the walls, to generator spawns, totems, you get the point. this supports my next point about how there is a big learning curve in this game. To truly master this game its imperative that you play both killer and survivor. Each will teach you the gameplay mechanics of this game. You’ll learn about perks, items, and even survivor or killer habits. It’s important to learn totem spawns for example, that way you can find out where those hex perks are hidden. Overall the game will just keep you coming back to learn more and more about the game. \n\n       Now lets talk lore. There is a ton of it. Each survivor and killer has a unique backstory. Even the maps have lore, you can find a ton of it on the Dbd website, or visit the devs stream to ask them direct questions about it. There is so much to learn about and if you haven’t noticed there is a ton of flavor text on addons, offerings, and perks. \n        \n       As I said before the store is an amazing thing because it offers you the ability to unlock tons of things for free. Yes you heard me right. While you can’t unlock everything for free, there is still quite a selection on what you can acquire. Even for some of the characters that you can’t unlock without paying for, you can still acquire their perks via shrine of secrets. I have acquired numerous perks without even owning a character thanks to this.  As of right now too, expansions for the game just keep coming out. I can’t remember the road map they set out, but there is always going to be new content to keep the game fresh. Overall the game has a lot of diverse content, ranging to different maps, to different playstyles, cosmetics, perks, addons, and there’s always new content coming. For what the game does best, it really shows.\n\n       Now let’s cover some of the issue that I have with the game. Firstly, there is defiantly balancing issues.. Then we have hitboxes, which can pretty wack sometimes. One other thing I have noticed is that there is a lack of incentive to play at higher levels. And finaly we are going to touch on loading screens and dedicated servers.\n\n       So Balancing, lets just start by saying that some of the killers are their builds are pretty busted. Personally I am all for counter play on both survivor and killer. But, there are some builds which you literally just can’t play around. More in specific, if you face off against a good nurse. There’s no way you’re gonna win. You really can’t outplay a killer who can blink over obstacles, and can travel the whole map in literal seconds with the right build. Billy for example is someone who can easily one shot and travel the map. And don’t get my started on his hitbox. In terms of build, right now at least, Franks Mixtap, Instadown hatchets, these just feel so strong that it is super hard to play against. \nNow Lets talk Hitboxes. Hitboxes at least for me can sometimes be realllly bad. There’s nothing worse then slamming down a pallet on a killer, and having them hit you as though the pallet didn’t do anything. Huntresses hatchets, which honestly have the worst hitboxes in the game can be gamble. Sometimes they hit, or sometimes they miss. Its just 50/50 and whichever end of the stick you’re on, well best of luck.\n\n       This can also be applied to the servers with DBD at the moment, which has you connect to the killers lobby. So the killer essentially has priority of the connection. Dedicated servers are coming, might happen in the next patch or so. But what this means, is that you can run into cheaters who essentially lag switch, which pretty much means they walk up to you and kill you. And ur stuck in place. At lower ranks you’re not really gonna run into this, but when I was around rank 5, I ran into this so often. This brings me to my next point which is loading screens. Yes, what could be so bad about a loading screen. Well when youre game constantly freezes, and doesn’t let you or a teammate into the game. I play this game primarly on Pc, so I’m not sure how it affects consoles, but this is a problem that I run into ever 4-10 games. Once or twice really isn’t a big deal if it happens, But when it happens all the time, and not just to you, that’s when theres a bit of a problem. \nFinally for my last point we have lack of incentive. What do I mean by this? Well, every season you can rank up. It’s a lot of effort, for no reward. Reaching rank 1 only gets you two things. One, an achievement. And two, Bragging rights. I feel like if they offered any season reward whatso ever, it would honestly motivate people to play for rank much more. Imagine if they had a cosmetic, that upon unlocking at the end of the season, had a different color based off the rank you got. It doesn’t have to be much, but I feel it would add a much-needed breath for veteran players of the game. And lastly devotion needs to be fixed up a little bit. Again you get no extra rewards upon reaching the cap, other than a number to brag about.\n\n\tFinally, I give dead by daylight a score of 4/5. If you are contemplating  on whether or not to get the game, I would highly recommend that you do.  The fact that there’s always new content, brings the game more experiences and fun. The bugs, while some can be really funny, does take away from the game experience especially when you can’t even load into a game. And really the only other thing that I think is missing from this game is progression based awards whether it be in rank, or devotion, that reward you for playing more. This is more of a thing for veteran players then newer. But To end with a positive, I think that the uniqueness of a survival based horror being a multiplayer game, is really just astounding. It has so much going for it, especially with the amount of fun and unique builds that you can play.
