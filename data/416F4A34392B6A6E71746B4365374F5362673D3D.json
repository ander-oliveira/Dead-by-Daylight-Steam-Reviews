This game has a great core idea and really delivers on it. It is thrilling to play as either the killer or the hunted survivors as you wander the dark, atmospheric maps. This game is much more fun to play than watch; I saw a few Let's Plays of it and decided it wasn't for me. However, when you are actually in the game and know that you are being hunted by a real human opponent and not an AI, it adds a terrifying sense of urgency to your action and fearful caution when you hear the monster coming your way.\n\nThat is the good of this game; it really conveys that sense that you are in a horror movie, forced to run from an enemy too deadly to confront head-on.\n\nHowever, the game has too many problems baked into its foundation to last long after the initial rush of running from dangerous enemies controlled by a human player. The first problem is the very low skill ceiling. Once you play the game for 6-8 hours, you'll be good enough to hit 95% of the \"skill checks\" that the survivors must hit. After that, the game becomes very repetitive and entirely based on whether your killer is competent enough to hunt you down and make it fun or breeze by.\n\nAnother problem is the terrible balancing for survivors once one of you is caught. The top priority for the killer is wiping out the survivors so that they cannot escape the level -- they have to hit you twice and then carry your body to a hook where you bleed out on a timer. Though there is a mechanic where other survivors can save people from these hooks, in practice 90% of the humans playing the killer will camp the bleeding out survivor. Even if you rush them with all the standing survivors, one of you will certainly be down by the end of the rescue and the problem starts all over again. This makes the hook rescue mechanic worthless unless you have a killer who refuses to camp out of good sportsmanship.\n\nThere is a level up system where you advance survivors (and killers) the more you play with them. Unfortunately the randomly generated rewards seem arbitrary and useless, usually leaving you with more addons for items than items to add them to.\n\nFinally, as others have said, the stability of the multiplayer is atrocious. About 1 out of every 4 times you go to join a lobby, you're left with a game-freezing loading screen bug. Plus, when lobbies actually do connect, usually a survivor or two will time out for one reason or another, leaving the remaining survivors with a very reduced cahnce of winning.\n\nAll in all, this is a good concept that I'm sure someone else will see the merit of and implement it much better from the ground up.","timestamp_created":1483221480,"timestamp_updated":1483221480,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28883034","author":{"steamid":"76561198283627476","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1520367666},"language":"russian","review":"ДА ЭТО КРУТО","timestamp_created":1483221205,"timestamp_updated":1483221205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28881883","author":{"steamid":"76561198146719253","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":11196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1634353214},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo não muito balanceado, muitos glitches e bugs \nmas o jogo é bem viciante.","timestamp_created":1483218297,"timestamp_updated":1483218297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28881681","author":{"steamid":"76561198084105692","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3443,"last_played":1567222595},"language":"english","review":"Great game overall but really buggy even this long after release.

The developers see there game as being seperated in mechanics, however many of them conflict with each other, leading to people being unable to even play the game for over a week if they crash from how poorly optimized this game is at times.

I only experienced some people disconnecting because of connectivity issues but nothing more.\n\n[b]The bloodweb:[/b] The bloodweb is a procedurally generated skilltree that allows you to spend your hard-earned bloodpoints (LITTLE HINT: Use killers to farm points in the beginning and use them on survivors) to buy items, perks, offerings and more.\n\n[b]As a killer:[/b] You have your very own skill and you are walking around the map trying to find and kill the survivors. After landing a hit on one of them you need to wait a few seconds for a post-hit animation that slows you down and prevents you from hitting repeatedly. You have to watch out for people using wooden planks to stun you and keep an eye on the hook you just hooked a wounded survivor on in case he gets freed. If a survivor is hooked long enough he \"dies\" and gets sacrificed. Mindgames when chasing one of them are welcome (fake a left turn and then go right).\n\n[b]As a survivor:[/b] Teamplay and stealth are key to victory. Each survivor has an increased chance to find perks fitting them in their bloodweb. (Meg will find more helping her escape, run faster or hide easier etc.) You can heal your teammates, repair generators (if you repair enough of them you can open the gates and escape), sabotate hooks, search crates etc. Eevery once in a while While you are doing these things you can hear a sound that warns you of an impending skill check. Skill checks mean you have to hit space at the right time or you will make noise alerting the killer.
