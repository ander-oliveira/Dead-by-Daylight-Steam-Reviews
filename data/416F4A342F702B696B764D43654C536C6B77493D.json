По моим часам проведенным в этой игре, можно сказать:\n [quote=Какой-то пользователь читающий обзор] Хмм, а он настоящий проGamer. Как он добился этих высот??[/quote]. \nНа что я отвечу - [i] Дадая[/i].\n\nБезумно люблю историю Silent Hill 2, что не задумываясь , [spoiler] купил себе дополнение,а не задумываюсь я довольно часто[/spoiler]. \n\nПриступим к истории, первый случай будет связан с Выжившими:\n[olist]\n    [*] Принялся я играть за сурвов, уже научился прыгать через баррикады и отличать, кто Маньяк а кто выживший, а это довольно трудно. Худо бедно, вкачал себе перки, которые мне помогут [b] ТАК Я ДУМАЛ [/b]. По-началу попадались нубы маньяки,нубы выжившие и это не могло не радовать, чувствовал себя среди своих. Затем попались он.. И главный злодей этой игры, это баланс. На момент игры 3 часа, мне попался маньяк с часами в эту игру, чуть больше чем у меня([u] 4300+ [/u]), как можно понять из выше сказанного, никто ГЕНЕРАТОР, даже на половину не починил.\n\nПосле, этого унизительного поражения, я решил поменять, что-то в своей жизни. И с кардинальных перемен я зашёл в игру за маньяка.\n\n [*] В Первой игре, за моего Ковбоя треугольного, сам злодей этой игры,  а повторяю  [u] Баланс [/u]. Решил мне закинуть группу типов, с дискорд или то хуже,со Skype. Я даже попасть по ним не мог, но под конец игры, когда я увидел, как 4 человека бегут к выходу. Я даже не удивился, что против меня играли 4, 3, 8, 18 ранги.\n[/olist]\n\nИгра на самом деле, достойная и в неё можно поиграть если играешь именно full - gey - party.  В ней много моментов и лишиться этих друзей и пофанится.  Поэтому я рекомендую игру, если вы готовы к Туннелингу и Кэмперингу. Досих пор не понимаю значения этих слов, объяснение в лс. \n\nСпасибо за уделенное внимание, всех целую. \n","timestamp_created":1594058576,"timestamp_updated":1594058576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594449281692504883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72178084","author":{"steamid":"76561198450926076","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1638815979},"language":"english","review":":)\n","timestamp_created":1594058441,"timestamp_updated":1624717627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72178023","author":{"steamid":"76561199056630771","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1651770617},"language":"russian","review":"игра пркольная","timestamp_created":1594058379,"timestamp_updated":1594058379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72177641","author":{"steamid":"76561198274338521","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2779,"last_played":1616693423},"language":"romanian","review":"Perfect game for me!\nLove it!","timestamp_created":1594057971,"timestamp_updated":1594057971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72177303","author":{"steamid":"76561198091967667","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10008,"last_played":1629674629},"language":"english","review":"10/10 camped entire game as leatherface and told someone to walk into traffic <3","timestamp_created":1594057610,"timestamp_updated":1594057610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72177224","author":{"steamid":"76561198745808687","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":26779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1768,"last_played":1656801741},"language":"russian","review":"Не играл?

Можно мне задротов из игры удалить? Нет? ну пля...\n\nИтак, итак, итак... Игра довольно таки интересная, её есть за что хвалить, есть за что ругать. Стоит отметить, что игра превосходно нагоняет тревогу на игроков, особенно на новенький. В ней прекрасные звуки, ужасающие колыбельные, и сногсшибательные звуки летящего топора. Донат не тяготит, и все что добавляет, так это костюмчики (я кстати люблю костюмчики). Графики выглядит красиво, нет отталкивающих элементов, и вполне чувствуется на таком среднячке, а в случае с нагнетанием атмосферы вполне можно поверить в реалистичность картинки. Геймплей простой и интуитивный, быстро вникаешь в происходящие и начинаешь по божески тащить, пока не сталкиваешься с мастерами игры )))   Комьюнити у игры довольно дружелюбное, относятся многие с пониманием. Есть конечно особенные индивиды, но такие есть везде. Разнообразие персонажей и перков, позволяют неплохо проводить время как с друзьями, так и с незнакомцами в общей игре. Карт довольно много, и в целом есть куда еще расти.\n\nК минусам стоит отнести небольшие проблемы с подключениями (но не всегда и не у всех). Некая схожесть в построении всех карт, на вполне не заметном уровне. Немного запутанная система прокачки. Неудобный атлас испытаний. Туповатые ежедневные ритуалы. Некоторые особенные ультра-перки, которые любого маньяка могут сделать \"ультранасильником\".\n\nВ общем и целом, игру рекомендую, играть можно и интересно, особенно для пугливых и безумных.

I started on Xbox but bought the game again on Steam in late June 2020.  I mainly play as a killer, but i have played as a survivor many times as well.  Dead By Daylight is an extremely fun game that is only gaining more and more players with every update.  It is so satisfying downing a Survivor and escaping the killer.\n\nThe game is pretty complex for an asymmetrical survival horror game.  There are perks, add-ons, offerings, items, levels and even a prestige feature, all of which are unlockable through the bloodweb, a randomly generated leveling system that lets you spend bloodpoints (currency awarded by completing challenges, playing the game well, and leveling up) to gain advantageous items. \n\n The game is ranked, and your rank as a survivor and your rank as a killer are always kept separate, so you dont have to worry about switching to the other side for a bit and deranking your rank as a survivor.  The game itself is pretty balanced, although at times it is hard to not think it favors survivors.  To kill a survivor, you must hit them twice with your basic weapon to down them.  One hit puts them in the injured state and another hit puts them in the dying state.  You can then carry a dying survivor to a sacrificial hook.  Once hooked, the survivor can be rescued by a teammate.  You must hook a survivor three times, or let the hook timer run out, to completely kill a survivor. There are four survivors and one killer per match.  The game has dedicated servers.  To escape, the survivors must repair five generators to power the exit gates.  Once the two exit gates are powered, the Survivors must open them using the lever.  After an exit gate is opened, the survivors can then escape, gaining more bloodpoints and keeping their items.  There is also a hatch that spawns after two generators have been repaired.  The hatch opens once a survivor with a key opens it, or when there is only one survivor remaining in the trial.  The hatch spawns at a random spot on the map, and makes a loud eery noise while open.\n\nIt's amazing how the developers have succeeded in creating a game that is balanced between the killer and the survivors.  This is in stark contrast to games like Friday The 13th, where Jason is majorly OP, and White Noise, where the survivors are too powerful.  There are some perks that majorly shift the balance of the game, like Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, and No One Escapes Death, but for the most part, both sides have an equal chance.  Dead By Daylight is heavily reliant on skill, and luck is only a very small factor in the game (such as what type of item you'll get from a chest or which pallet is a Dream Pallet or which Jigsaw Box has the key).\n\nAnother thing that I like about this game is the fact that there is such a wide selection of licensed killers and survivors to choose from.  So far, the game has Michael Myers and Laurie Strode from Halloween, Freddy Krueger and Quentin Smith from A Nightmare On Elm Street, Leatherface from A Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Ghostface from Scream, Pyramid Head and Cheryl Mason from Silent Hill, Amanda Young from Saw, Ash Williams from Evil Dead, Bill Overbeck from Left 4 Dead, and The Demogorgon and Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler from Stranger Things.  All of these characters are locked behind paid DLC, but the DLCs are cheap and well worth it.  \n\nThere are also a bunch of original killers to choose from.  These Killers include the Trapper, The Doctor, The Hag, The Nurse, The Oni, The Spirit, The Wraith, The Deathslinger, The Hillbilly, The Plague, The Clown, The Legion, and The Huntress.\n\nAll of these killers have unique powers and abilities that separate them from each other.  The Wraith can turn invisible.  The Huntress can throw hatchets at people to injure or down them.  Michael Myers can stalk people to increase his speed and lunge, and to temporarily gain the ability to one-hit-down people.  Obviously, this means some killers are objectively better and worse than others, and has created the trend amongst the community of creating tier lists, but all of the killers are completely viable (except for Wraith and Clown) and can get 4 Kill matches in the right hands.\n\nThe graphics for the game are certainly deserving of its star cast.  The graphics aren't that customizable.  The developers, instead of giving full sliders for every aspect, instead opted to make presets:  Ultra, High, Medium, and Low.  Ultra and High look great, Medium is about equal to what the console version of the game looks like, and Low looks like a mobile game.  The framerate is capped to 60 by default, but it is easy to remove this cap:  you simply have to go in the game's Engine.ini or GameUserSettings.ini file and switch \"bUseVSync = ON\" to \"bUseVSync = OFF\".\n\nThere are a few negatives.  For example, the community is very toxic, and it is common for survivors to trash talk the killer (\"baby killer\", \"tunneler\" etc) and vice versa. It is entirely possible to just ignore the chat and move on with your day, but more often than not, your matches will end in trash talking.  People especially like to insult people for using certain perks such as the ones mentioned above. \n\nThe matchmaking in DBD is absolutely terrible.  As a killer, it is not uncommon to have to wait more than five minutes to find a match, which is odd when there are over 55,000 people playing the game.  This will probably improve once cross play is introduced, which will be coming soon (code for it has already been found in the game's files), but for now the queue times are atrocious.  Wait times for survivors are much better, though.  \n\nFurthermore, matches almost always include rainbows of varying ranks, and more often than not you will find a rank 1 survivor or two in your match coupled with a rank 15 or a rank 20 (lower numbered ranks are better, so rank 1 is the best while rank 20 is the worst).  This can be quite frustrating for newer players, as they will almost never be matched with or against teams of equal level.  On a side note, there is no built-in voice chat for DBD, so if you want to play with friends, you better have Discord open.\n\nAnother bad thing about DBD is the disturbing lack of single player content.  The game is completely devoid of bots or any single player modes, and there is absolutely no story whatsoever.  The closest thing to a story is the character backstories you can read in the main menu.  This ruins the longevity of the game, for when the time comes that the playerbase shrinks down to below 2,000 or when Behaviour Interactive shuts down the servers, there will be nothing left in the game, no more reason to keep playing.  Maybe someday along the road Behaviour will throw in an Offline Bots mode, but the developers have stated they have no such plans in the foreseeable future.  This is very disappointing news for the playerbase, especially for people with poor internet connection.\n\nAdding onto the previous point, there are only two game modes:  Public Ranked and Private Unranked.  This detracts from the replayability of the game, and while the developers have argued adding extra game modes will split the playerbase, it is still disappointing to see such a lack of content in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is very addictive and is complex enough that it doesn't get boring, and DBD is probably the most balanced and the most active of its kind, but it is held back by its toxic playerbase and its disturbing lack of game modes and single player content.  I rate this game an 8/10.  One of my favorite multiplayer games.","timestamp_created":1594047220,"timestamp_updated":1594048662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72167496","author":{"steamid":"76561198418832364","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1640786670},"language":"schinese","review":"真实刺激 嘻嘻 嘻嘻 嘻嘻","timestamp_created":1594047151,"timestamp_updated":1594047151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72167465","author":{"steamid":"76561198109632379","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2017,"last_played":1649194308},"language":"brazilian","review":"Se você pretende jogar com seus amigos> maravilha, super legal\nSe você pretende jogar sozinho> vai jogar outra coisa.\nDigo isso porque:\n1- sou como a maioria, um jogador inexperiente, sou ruim\n2- O sistema de pareamento do jogo é horrivel, você é rank 13 cai com rank 1.\n3- Se você estiver sozinho e for a obsessão do killer, você sofre uma grande quantia de desvantagens, que torna extremamente frustrante levando em consideração que você esta sozinho, e que se você morrer acabou.

It's easy to understand and learn and enjoyable in the process.  You don't need perks to be good but it makes the game easier and more enjoyable.  Each killer is unique in their own way so it playing a new killer doesn't feel like just playing any other killer. They offer new play styles and something new to learn.  Playing survivor doesn't feel like an unwinnable game, and in some cases it's in your favor.  Most perks are useful in their own ways, of those a few are pretty much always used, for both killer and survivor, and the rest of the perks are either just not as useful or are only used by beginners who don't have any better perks.  The one thing that would be a negative is that it feels like the devs cater to the survivors complaints more than the killers.  The devs nerf more killer perks than survivor perks. They keep making it easier for survivors to pallet/window loop killers, make it easier for anti tunneling, and anti camping. But the devs do little to help what the killers go through. Gens being done so fast that by the time the time the killer gets one survivor hooked 1 or 2 gens get done when only 5 need to be done. If the killer is that unlucky, or bad, you could get 3,4, or 5 gens done by the time 1 survivor dies.  Killer perks that help with the chase get nerfed so that it only becomes usable in certain cases, perks that slow the game down so that killers have more time to kill survivors get nerfed so that they either don't get used because they're so useless or other perks do that job better.  But that isn't to say the devs don't care for killers because they have gave survivor perks massive nerfs but it still feels as if the game is more in the survivors favor. The devs do more for the survivors leaving the killers having to deal with everything in the book and then get teabagged at the exit gates with maybe 1 kill on their belt.
