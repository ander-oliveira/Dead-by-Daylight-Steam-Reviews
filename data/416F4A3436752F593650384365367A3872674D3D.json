I'll cover my thoughts on that within these two segments:\nGood parts: \nOverall, the game is fun and addictive I have had some good times with it. What makes it fun are the chases, variety of killers with each having a \"unique\" power (I say this with quotes because there are some killers who do share very similar powers), and the different perks. Also playing with friends is one of the SIGNIFICANT reasons that made me play DBD for so long. Of course, I have played killer a few times keep in mind this is pre-SBMM which was actually fun to play killer than; those few times I did play killer it didn't feel like a hassle to me, personally because I played for the fun of it. That's not to say others think differently. While killer was not so bad to play back then there was survivor which I mainly dominated for the most part; survivor was easy/still is easier to play even to this day, plus it was more fun when you have friends to play with. Before SBMM solo-queing was interesting it didn't feel totally unfair at all it actually was a lot more fun compared to now with SBMM on. Then comes the maps....honestly, they each are unique in their design, and some even having a different tile, or way to loop it than the usual. I really don't have much to say when it comes to the fun of this game, so I'm going to continue on since all I will do is repeat myself. \nThe bad:\nHonestly, this game is pretty bad when it comes to how it's handled. The developers don't even understand their own game let alone know how to play it themselves; they do a bad job at updates for the most part, occasionally making a few good changes. For the most part there is another issue that occurs, but they always manage to add some new glitch, exploit, or something not intended in the game. One of their hugest downfalls was adding SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) into the game. (great devs...) For a \"casual game\" I personally do not see why that needed to be added; if anything it really changed how people viewed the game, and played it which brings me to other problems with the game: \n-SBMM:\nThis was a move DEFINITELY NOT NEEDED, like it did not need to happen at all!! I genuinely wonder what in the hell were the developers thinking at this moment because this pretty much changed how a lot of the matches play out now. (as in how people's approach to the matches, yes, I know some people haven't changed which is a few percentage compared to the whole. Feel free to call me out on this if you want to.) Every match I have ever played since this was implemented into the game is just a drag to play, like it is not even fun unless if I were playing with friends. Even then, it gets stale after a while of playing the game. \n-Gameplay:\nEvery match you load into is do gens, loop killer, save/unhook here and there, and open gates. Not much other than that.. :/ I honestly wished that the devs would have added some other type of mode, or a new objective to the game to spice things up; it is sad to say that I stopped doing the goal of the game because it got boring, rather I would just go for flash light saves, or try some \"plays\" out. The perks are another big problem because you will mainly be running all meta perks, it is as if only a few selection out of the 197 total are playable. (feel free to chew me out on the exact number, I just did a quick google search :p) There are many perks the game has, unfortunately half of those are useless, or completely dumb which leaves you to maybe about 30-ish perks to work with. (kudos to you if you manage to use something else other than the meta, seriously hats off to you) It gets quite boring when you use the same perks after several matches, sadly for killer you have to have more of a serious build to even get a decent match. (well, if you're a godly player that's a different situation lol. Or you play a killer that's an A-tier or above this changes too)\nRewards/items:\nWith an online based game comes rewards, and in-game content; this game offers a lot of content in terms of items. Like a TON. Every chapter, or mid-chapter that comes out some new outfit comes out for a character, and if a rift is happening at the time you can get more clothing for your characters, or charms....(utterly useless, and don't matter at all) I mean, you can get more, if you pay with your actual cash, yes there is an in-game currency but the grind for it is too much effort than the devs will ever put in the entirety of this game. Honestly, most of the outfits that come out are kind of a rip-off like 10 dollars for just one outfit??!! \n*Side note: these last two I point out are not apart of the game, but they certainly create the game/influence it\n-Community: \nThe community is, and is not a huge factor to this game; let me explain why that is. When it comes to what the community wants the devs to do about the game the devs mainly ignore them because they dislike anyone criticizing them. (crazy how the devs can't handle that 0_0) On the other hand, the community is a huge factor for me not wanting to play the game for one reason: the toxicness. Maybe this just happens to me, or I'm doing something wrong but there is at least 7/10 matches I play where I have one player getting angry at me because I played in a certain way. Hell, I'll admit it I too have done the same back to others, of course I would never go as far as to tell other people explicit things over a video game. I just find it disgusting that people's reaction to a match in DBD is to tell people off, here is a perfect example of what I am talking about: https://youtu.be/zlp75c_jeqY. Just watch that vid that is more than enough, simply sickening to hear people say that, and yes I do know not every match people are like this. There are some people who are wholesome about a game, and I very much appreciate those few people, but for the most part people cry about every little thing in this game. \n-Developer Team: \nNow, these guys I can go on and on about but I'm going to try, and keep it short. As I said before, the developers do not even know how to play their own game, and they implemented SBMM in a game where it has no place; even mocking skillful plays by saying that \"if you make a skillful play, and still die was it really skillful?\" NGL, that irked me a lot and those who keep up with the updates know who said those exact words. The devs are a lot of things: people who enjoy watching players rage over this game, uninformative about their own game, hungry money, clueless people. Seriously, I dislike these devs a lot because of how ignorant they are when it comes to bettering their game; they get worked over people telling them good changes for a game, criticism, and what do they do...take away certain clothing over trying to fix things in their game. This is the last thing I say, these guys are a bunch of pansies when it comes to criticism.\n\nIf you read all of this, one you are a trooper for doing so, and two I apologize for my long review/rant I was not expecting this to be super long. There is so much I can continue saying, but I rather not bore my reader with my opinion on the game after all it's an opinion of one person out of the many, so do my thoughts really matter? That's up to you to decide on that; I simply wrote this to get my thoughts across about this game. As someone who played this game for a while I can say it is not that great, feel free to correct me on anything, or give thoughts.

I've been playing since release in 2017 on PS4 (before I had a PC) and I'm a die-hard fan, now owning it on steam and owning nearly all the DLC.\n\nIt can be very anxiety inducing, or very thrilling. Playing as the survivor, without any means of defending yourself against the killer, requires a top-tier level of stealth and skill. Generators and healing self or allies requires complicated, periodic skill checks that when missed, alert the killer of your mistakes. Running leaves \"scratch marks\" that only the killer can see and track you with, but walking/crouching is quite slow. Carefully selecting perks and understanding how they may help you understand the game is pertinent to a successful run, but the killer will also have this advantage.\n\nIf evasion and repairing generators is not your thing, hunting survivors and sacrificing them to the Entity may be your preference, as it is much easier. There are no skill checks, but the first-person FOV is quite limiting, whereas the survivors are 3rd person, you may be at disadvantage. You must hang the survivors on the hook successfully 2-3 times in order to eliminate them from the game and sacrifice them to the entity you worship.\n\nIt's a tough game, and definitely easier the more you understand how to play the game. It's definitely a \"learn-as-you-go\" type of game that I find better to play with a group of friends while in a discord. Good luck out there, and I hope you make it to daylight in one piece.","timestamp_created":1648486918,"timestamp_updated":1648486918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112977586","author":{"steamid":"76561198262150709","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1988,"last_played":1656530176},"language":"russian","review":" G O V N O но вкусно","timestamp_created":1648486580,"timestamp_updated":1648486580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112976995","author":{"steamid":"76561198322787164","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":43536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1943,"playtime_at_review":40952,"last_played":1660442085},"language":"english","review":"10 seconds of fun isnt work the 5 hours of suffering to get it","timestamp_created":1648485909,"timestamp_updated":1648485909,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512181699275970459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112976740","author":{"steamid":"76561198359637539","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2500,"last_played":1659251158},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная.
