When I play Survivor, I got matched with killer from red rank while me being a silver. And when I play killer, I got matched with juicer on comps while me being a coal. And you might ask \"yo dude how do you know that you go against the enemy team that has WAY above rank than you when the game has done fantastic job at fixing this problem by hiding ranks in end game summary page?\" yeah... they got TTV. in their name and I checked them out.

Damn, I wish I don't have to play with Chinese.\n\n6/5/2565 edit : Today I met a group of hackers with instant heal and speed boost. the speed boost is so blatant it not even something like 105% but it's more like 150% like permanent Sprint Burst, and they're not even hiding it either, when I down one of them, they stood up IMMEDIEATLY in front of me and tbag, this time they don't even run from me, they just let me down them and then mocking me for doing so because they can just insta-res themselves unlimited amounts of times. I managed to pick up one of them tho but that person just flew out to the exit gate with the hook on his back (with T-pose animation). And lo and behold, they's SWF Chinese ganggang. At this point, I'm not surprised anymore.\n\n16/5/2565 edit : This is my first day after rank reset. My first game was consisted of 3 bush Claudette with < 100 hrs playtime vs 5000 hrs Nurse, I wasn't so tilted with this one becuase I understand that this game has stupid rank reset system that reset eveyone to the lowest rank, so ex-rank 1ers got mixed with everyone, but man, I fought like 7 killers with above 1000 hrs back to back and it was a bit frustrating.

Quizzes for older people don’t yield more.\nI tried the arcade but the games there are just crappily hard and I made very little money.\nAre there any better ways to get the KinzCash?","timestamp_created":1651013203,"timestamp_updated":1651013203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114530585","author":{"steamid":"76561199008219207","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":12010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12010,"last_played":1650929075},"language":"english","review":"i got banned after playing for the first time in a few months","timestamp_created":1651010360,"timestamp_updated":1651010360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114530372","author":{"steamid":"76561198799268401","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2448,"last_played":1657174971},"language":"english","review":"epic swag jump scare panic mode","timestamp_created":1651009869,"timestamp_updated":1651009869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114530059","author":{"steamid":"76561199230322943","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3241,"last_played":1654730011},"language":"spanish","review":"esta bien bueno el juego XD","timestamp_created":1651009269,"timestamp_updated":1651009269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114529836","author":{"steamid":"76561199036924294","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10835,"last_played":1656271380},"language":"english","review":"Honest review, the game is good by all means; This game concept is great, a killer mind controlled by some unknown entity slaughter- Jk im not doing that shit game is good when playing with friends lmao","timestamp_created":1651008846,"timestamp_updated":1651008846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114528077","author":{"steamid":"76561198152518390","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11928,"last_played":1652880112},"language":"english","review":"This game forces you to play using boring tactics, which if you play without you just get punished by people have 10 times your hours.

This review will focus on 3 things; Gameplay, Horror/Not Horror and the Devs behind the game.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nGeneral gameplay is simple: 4 survivors must fix 5 generators, before unlocking a gate to escape all while trying to avoid being killed by a roaming killer. The survivors play in 3rd person, and the killer in 1st. A survivor is killed when their meter runs out after being hung on a hook. \nFirstly, by DBD being a team game, you can largely overcome balance issues if you have 5 friends to play together. As with all team games online, skills vary wildly between players and teams, and the survivors' skills may synergise well or not at all.\nThis would be fine for gameplay, if the game were not littered with extremely strong perks that overshadow the majority of others. Perks like seeing through walls, freezing generators, immunity and others are all haphazard bandaids the game introduced to help out killers (the largest population of players) who were often mediocre at winning. This then accelerated better survivor skills until they started to be reigned in. \n[b] DBD favours killers. [/b] They run faster, have longer ranges and impose many more debuffs and tricks than a survivor usually has to play with. There really isn't a chance to escape a semi-decent killer without things like Diehard nowadays, all the best survivors can hope for is to loop long enough for others to finish gens. Quicktime events for survivors are all stacked against you, to help mediocre killers in carrying you to numerous hook points which they can see through walls...because early players complained about always dropping people [b] after wandering around for 16 seconds. [/b] You sadly don't ever feel challenged as a killer when it comes to hooking people, and there's often no point wiggling as a survivor.\n\n[h1] Horror? [/h1]\nThe game isn't scary. At all. It can be when you're freshly starting out, but being in 3rd person view as a survivor IMO is not that scary. Knowing that the game favours looping and playing around debuffs takes away from the sheer terror this game could deliver. Killers don't have to feel afraid, nothing can hurt you, so Killer players are often after an aggro experience. Except, this game favours killers and perks that oddly are passive debuffs and see-through-walls abilities, so the hunt element is hurt too. \nDBD did great with killers like the Huntress and Doctor, who eschew the heart beat monitor for droning songs and hallucinations that are genuinely creepy. But then you have the likes of the Ghost who runs around invisible and is imperceivable to your heart-rate monitor, who kill immersion for cheap jump scares. Scream is lame, often a sighted as just squatting around before insta-killing people in a single dash. Nemesis is far too quick to look imposing, and most of the other killers are just awash with bland mechanics. So the game really can't be called a horror game, because all that really happens is a parkour fest with a not-so gory end for anyone caught by sprinting killers.\n\n[h1] Behaviour Interactive [/h1]\nThe devs are the makers of WH40K Eternal Crusade, and within a few years canned the project because they couldn't make the experience very enjoyable beyond piggybacking off of an old single player game's work. The devs are slow and wanton to address balance. They include \"Enjoyment meters\" and \"Report\" functions in game yet require you to use their online forums to actually report cheaters, meaning Xbox and PS players can't actually report cheaters. Despite the fact that crossplay is a thing in this game. The devs are into the popularity this game has on Twitch, often designing in-game trinkets of memes they make about the game/community. They dip their toes into \"woke\" political statements like claiming to be allies to LGBT causes, but if you can't even report homophobic or trans-targeting slur users in game, how can you claim that? They don't make alternate game modes because they know the waiting times are ludicrously long. The game sees updates of outfits and cosmetics faster than any balance issues, and eagerly charge €12+ for mediocre outfits. The female character proportions/outfit designs in this game are comically bad, while the male character outfits are just boring.\n\nSo, I cannot recommend this game ultimately if you're looking for something to scratch the horror itch you've been having. It doesn't do enough to be scary, and it doesn't try to be balanced to satisfy the competitive among you.","timestamp_created":1650981012,"timestamp_updated":1650981012,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114509819","author":{"steamid":"76561199126588470","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1650959960},"language":"english","review":"Better than movies","timestamp_created":1650980253,"timestamp_updated":1650980253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114509811","author":{"steamid":"76561197988265118","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":9637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9493,"last_played":1654547440},"language":"spanish","review":"Es lo más.","timestamp_created":1650980236,"timestamp_updated":1650980236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114509779","author":{"steamid":"76561198264137573","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":636,"playtime_at_review":13528,"last_played":1660572420},"language":"english","review":"yeah, not bad, not good, pyramid head is hot though","timestamp_created":1650980198,"timestamp_updated":1650980198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114509665","author":{"steamid":"76561199023800333","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6003,"last_played":1658522434},"language":"english","review":":)\n","timestamp_created":1650980059,"timestamp_updated":1650980059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114508030","author":{"steamid":"76561198839430368","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19788,"last_played":1657809307},"language":"russian","review":"Игра прикольная, но после неё попа болит","timestamp_created":1650977764,"timestamp_updated":1650977764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114506621","author":{"steamid":"76561198324393876","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":16850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15898,"last_played":1652783385},"language":"english","review":"A good game, but not for everyone.\nSome will find this game too frustrating for the first time.

The game was good before Gideon meat plant came out, now? It's not fun, it's nearly unplayable (if you want to main killer), nearly every lobby is toxic as hell and the game has a problem with hackers. In conclusion, do NOT buy this game. if you are a killer main, good luck trying to out smart survivors on these overly complicated maps and if you play survivor, have fun trying to navigate to generators / exit doors. 2/10.
