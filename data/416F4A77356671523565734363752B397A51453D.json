且怨灵的削弱给了人类一些喘息的机会\n本人目前在红段碰到的屠夫感觉是百花齐放 已经没有了写之前那个评测的时候全是怨灵护士的情况  基本啥的有 所以我把老的测评删掉了\n\n虽然高段位玩家可能玩的都不是特别开心\n不过在黄绿乃至紫段的一些局感觉应该还是很和谐很快乐的 \n反正游戏也没有段位奖励 爬高段位反而会让自己玩的很烦\n所以还是推荐\n新人入坑建议先玩人类\n在低段位的时候 屠夫玩家和人类玩家数量差距不是很大\n但一个屠夫玩家要对应四个人类玩家\n导致屠夫玩家大量溢出以至于排不到人\n低段位玩屠夫想排到人一般少说也要十几分钟\n从人类开始玩体验游戏也一样很棒\n建议开低画质建议开低画质建议开低画质\n因为低画质屠夫的红光可以穿墙看到\n而且无论高低画质这个游戏都是锁60帧 没有多大区别\n对新人玩家的一些建议\n1第一次上钩后不要挣扎\n人类在钩子上可以理解为有3个阶段 第一个阶段是可以挣扎的 第二个阶段是要不停敲空格的 第三个阶段就是死亡 如果你在第一个阶段挣扎了 那么你如果你没有成功的跳下来 你就会直接进入第二阶段 相当于你少了一次倒地的机会 你队友把你救下来你再被屠夫砍倒挂上钩子你就直接死了 第一个阶段挣扎的成功率仅为4% 除非所有队友均已倒地 否则完全没有尝试的必要 等队友来救你就好了\n2不要就知道躲着 要增加互动\n虽说杀机算是款恐怖游戏 但是你一听到心跳声就找个地方一蹲完全无法提高你自身的水平 假如这个时候屠夫是在追你的队友只是恰好经常附近 可是你却在一旁蹲着 白白浪费队友给人类方争取到的时间 这个就很蠢\n看到队友上钩了屠夫也不在旁边就尽量去救一下 能赚1500分不香吗 但是如果屠夫守尸就无脑修机吧\n3在对游戏有一定理解以后 不要怕屠夫 可以去溜屠夫跟屠夫互动 该过程不仅能提高你作为人类的实力 对屠夫的水平提升一样有帮助。等到你玩屠夫的时候 你想想你玩人类的时候是怎么被砍死的 用同样的方法对付跟你同水平的玩家一般都很有效果 同理对屠夫玩家也一样 你玩屠夫砍不到人 你就去玩人类 你看人家怎么把你砍倒的 跟着学就完事了 这也是人皇屠皇基本都不是单边玩家的原因。\n4玩屠夫不要守尸  这不是第五人格 你守尸并不能保证你能上段 很多时候反而会让你掉段 而且对你的水平没有任何提升 想要上段还是以提升自己的水平为本 学会了套路 倒车 藏红光等一系列，段位随便打打就上去了。尽量挂人后继续找下一个人追逐才是正确的选择 节奏不好可以打针对但真的不要守尸 真的太蠢了。接死了\n\n说一下我认为的存在的问题\n本人是人屠双边玩家  两边的一段都打过很多次 不相信的可以看我的成就界面\n目前人类常驻红段 屠夫在紫段\n当前版本下我在人类方的游戏体验还可以\n所以更多的站在屠夫方说一些\n在现版本毁灭改版的情况下究极速修成了主流 红紫段屠夫很难有游戏体验\n高段位走地屠夫打的是真的累 不愿意练幻神爬不上去\n我玩人类还可以摸个箱子逛个街  玩屠夫真的累\n这个上段机制是真的憨 有时候明明你已经砍倒两个挂了一个 这个时候想四杀你就应该直接去找第四个人 可是上段机制逼着你不准去 你只能去挂倒地的那两个 让剩下的那个人类出来救人你才能刷挂人的徽章 你才能上段 可是这会极大的增加翻车的概率 在人均毁灭打击的情况下概率更高 毁灭打击的改版基本就是逼着屠夫不打针对\n\n\n本来老版本打针对快速击杀一个 跟另外3个人慢慢打 我觉得是比较合适的（打针对不同于守尸 守尸这种憨批行为对自身水平没有任何提升）\n虽然有一个人类的体验可能确实不是很好（老版本我玩人类也经常被打针对）\n但同样你也可以表演    \n屠夫追你追了一局也没把你针对死你溜了他5台还出门了这感觉不爽吗？\n现在搞的打针对根本打不得 除非你明确的知道这把人类没有携带毁灭打击（当局游戏没有血祭品）一打针对就要吃打击 你要把同一个人至少砍倒地4次才能挂死 \n一般这个时候如果人类没有逛街的话门也差不多开了（除非你的水平远超这个被你追杀的人类）\n所以走地屠夫的体验是真的不太行\n希望这个问题以后可以得到改善吧\n\n其次是匹配机制 \n这匹配机制是真的离谱\n我红段的人类还经常能排到绿段的屠夫 剩下三个队友也是黄绿段的 就很离谱\n能不能搞得正常一点 红段紫段屠夫难道都没了？\n\n至于进不去游戏的问题我个人没有遇到 不做评论\n\n换了w1n10笔记本电脑后\n玩人类经常会出现摁了鼠标没反应 要摁好几下才能修机救人之类的\n玩屠夫也是  一出蓄力刀就卡 然后刚进游戏界面还特别糊\n该问题已经找到解决方法 同有问题的可以加好友问我\n\n最后是两边玩家的问题\n学会换位思考 当你玩人类的在开门后在门口对着屠夫1212的时候 你想想如果你是屠夫你看到人类对着你这样你气不气。 当你玩屠夫守尸的时候 你想想如果你是人类 你被守了尸你开不开心。","timestamp_created":1562475990,"timestamp_updated":1581227895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53876142","author":{"steamid":"76561198080379221","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":114,"playtime_at_review":3124,"last_played":1659441676},"language":"russian","review":"обзор","timestamp_created":1562475917,"timestamp_updated":1562475917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491159111261367798","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53875991","author":{"steamid":"76561198036136763","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":36938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30086,"last_played":1606965942},"language":"english","review":"Great
