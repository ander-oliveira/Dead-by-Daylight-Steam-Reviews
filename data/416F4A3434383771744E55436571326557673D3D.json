Oyunu kendi internet bağlantınız üzerinden hostluyorsunuz bu yüzden size en yakın oyuncuları bulmaya çalışıyor. Bu da katil olarak oyuna girebilmek için en az 10dk beklemeniz demek. En azından Türkiye için şu an durum böyle. \n\n-Oyunun derecelendirme sistemi tam anlamıyla bozuk. Rank atlamak istiyorsanız oyunun açıklarını kullanmanız gerekiyor.

I've been playing DBD for 6 years now and I'm very disappointed that this game has deviated from the concept of horror cat and mouse gameplay to \"omg look whos gay now, teehee\" and pride charm collection sprees. The devs are obviously now a group of midwit progressive activists who are more interested in pushing their politics than they are making the game worth playing in the future. The core player base like myself, who have plenty of f*ck you money to spend, aren't spending as much with DBD anymore. But hey, at least they got their rocks off with making David gay, amarite?\n\nMy only hope is that this game dies, which it will, with some kind of dignity or is sold off to another developer with skill and ability. \n\n6 years ago, this was a \"recommend.\"\nNow? No. Not until they scrap the dev team and make the game about the game, rather than their midwit political views.\n\n**********\nI typically wait until at LEAST 10 hours before I consider leaving a review. There's nothing I can't stand more than douchebags writing reviews after 1-3 hours of game time as though they had any insight or valuable experience to share. Keep in mind, I've only logged 11 hours; so there's a ton to the game I have yet to really get into. \n\nFirst off, this game is everything a hide and hunt SHOULD be about. There is no pay to win mechanic, no pay for added content, none of that garbage.  This game is precisely what it says it's going to be and it does NOT disappoint. The ambience coincides amazingly with the pace of the game. The objectives and metrics of which you gain blood points is balanced and reasonable. Speaking of balance, this is the FIRST game in a long time that I've sat down and had not once thought to myself, \"Wow, ( x ) is really weak and needs a buff\" or \"Wow, ( x ) is really broken and needs to be balanced.\"\n\nSome things I hope to see in the future would obviously be a party system. I'd love to have the option to play the game AND accumulate blood points. Obviously this would open the current system to abuse and exploitation, but with enough innovation I could see the devs coming up with a plausible solution. Another small qualm I have with the current system is how unforgivable the pip meter can be. If you're matched with a group of lower ranked players, I think the reduction of blood points on your pip meter should be lesser than if you were in a group of equally ranked players.\n\nAll in all, this game is 10/10 so far. Disregard the mouth breathers who play a game for 1-4 hours and convince themselves they know anything about a game. Good luck, have fun!\n\nEDIT:\n\nSeveral years have passed since I did this review and I have to say- the game has only gotten better. The content releases and balances is awesome and I definitely recommend this game to everyone who claims they like survival games.","timestamp_created":1466379393,"timestamp_updated":1651348244,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23660803","author":{"steamid":"76561197980975272","num_games_owned":7760,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":32465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":876,"playtime_at_review":4075,"last_played":1660155024},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏最开始的时候其实是最好玩的时候，到后面就变成时装游戏了，我就没有怎么关注了。\n最近因为怪奇物语绝版所以回坑了。","timestamp_created":1466379232,"timestamp_updated":1637779586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553626775741577148","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23660773","author":{"steamid":"76561198066053662","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":67,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1559659675},"language":"english","review":"Okay I like this game though it has many flaws. I only played the killer not the survivors yet until later patches. The reason why is this. First match was fine got two kills as wraith. Second match however bug happen when I decloaked to a generator with three people when decloaked went for a grab since one was focus on getting it ready. glitch through the map and fell downed for a straight minut. had to end the game prematurly for that. Third match people who spammed medics and somehow spots me when I was cloaked. Now I know you can still be seen when cloaked but only close range, I did a full B-line patrol of all the generators suddenly 4 were online only got one kill due to body camping cause one medics and two hook was right at entrance, and finallyI was mad because when I was cloak patrolling I was seen somehow. Finally was the maps. They were greatly build no lie there. But building and obstacle design placement even random was way to much for the survivors wining. Why? because a player played chase me if you can with a house were I can't catch at all. Now didn't use the hillibily chage but that just for clearing distance this chase wasn't. So the obstacles was way to much into survivors especially a person can just keep vaulting again and again. I don't like cheap surviving tactis like this and this my bad review for now unless these obstacles gets nerfed or the survivors have a stamina bar.

This is mostly due to MatchMaking, The firsts rank are a charm, people are learning survivors and learning killer with minimal perks, people are having fun and enjoying the game. In these ranks you find mostly casual gamers looking for a good time. Where everything goes south is when you reach around rank 12-13 or so. Then matchmaking matches you with rank 16 to rank 1 prestige, thus can be frustrating for the low as the high ranked. When you play killer you get matched with low rank survivor, example rank 12 Killer will 80% be matched with survivor rank 7 or better, this is due to the fact that there is less killers than survivors playing the game. This is the reason why finding a match for survivor takes many minutes whereas finder as a killer take a couple of seconds. When you reach those rank be ready for the downfall of the community, this is where everything gets toxic, boring and frustrating. After passing many hours of fun you get stuck in those ranks. As a primary killer player, if I win the match (ie: get more points than survivors) you're gonna get call a tunneler, camper, cheap shot etc... If you lose the match (less points than average of survivor) then you will be said you suck, get rekd etc... Whatever you do you receive toxic comments. (Take note a never initiate any conversation in the chat windows and thanks god that people on other platform cannot chat, dealing with PC players is more than enough).\n\nHere, I am not talking about winning or loosing, that is part of a game like this one. I am talking about how everyone threat the other players, the toxicity in the way to play the game and the in chat window and it goes for both survivor and killer. This game gets the worst out of people, players are frustrated about previous match and it's always all about vengeance and making the other player look bad, it not about having fun. \n\nWhen you play game you want to have fun, enjoy yourself , sadly in this game when reaching lower rank this is not the case and this is because of the toxic community around the game.\n\nI played many games, Siege, Dota, Battelfield, Evolve, named them and the community of DbD is by far the worst.\n\nSo for the second time in many years, I will stop playing this game.

The atmosphere is fantastic and for the most part I think the game looks pretty decent. \nHowever, after playing two rounds I soon identified that there were dominant strategies when playing as the survivors, which you could just pull off over and over again. \n\nI first noticed when I was being a spectator after dying (which btw is incredibly boring as you can barely see anything with the way the camera is tilted). I found as a survivor there were dominant strategies that  gave them a huge advantage and made it almost impossible for the killer to catch them...which ruined the fun. The fact that you can't actually kill the survivors yourself is a disappointment too. You can't deliver the finishing blow. You knock the player down, and drag them to a hook where they stay until their time depletes or another player saves them. The game mode gets quite repetitive very quickly, and I only played a handful of rounds. \n\nIt's a shame. It's a game I really want to like but you spend a frustrating amount of time trying to get the game going, and once you finally get to play, the buzz is already somewhat gone, and the shortcomings of the gameplay just hit you that little harder. \n\nI love the Idea, I hope they fix the technical issues and tweak some gameplay elements.

But horror games have always been frustrating. It's a reasonably original game that pits 4 survivors against one of three killers (each with their own unique abilities) Players also have access to their own skills and even equipable items to help them in games.\nOne of the game's biggest drawbacks is that can't play with less than 4 other friends, i.e. you and a few friends can't join public servers, you have to create a private games, but I've been only playing online with strangers anyway. \nThere is occasional lag but that's down to ping and not the game itself. I've only encountered one or two glitches myself, the ranking up system however needs some fixes. But levelling up characters to gain new items and perks is more than enough of an incentive to keep playing. The Killers seems slightly overpowered at the moment *especially the wraith* however it's better that it's slightly easier for the killer than the survivor as it makes the game more tense. Overall worth picking up if you have $15-$20 to spend on a fun survival horror game.

And when that happens we will be left with a solid arena survival-horror game.","timestamp_created":1466358540,"timestamp_updated":1466358540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23655600","author":{"steamid":"76561198210428052","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":32107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3862,"last_played":1631121052},"language":"german","review":"Ist ein recht gut gelungenes Spiel..etwas unbalanced aber sehr spannend!","timestamp_created":1466358389,"timestamp_updated":1466358389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486243903636932373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23655499","author":{"steamid":"76561198053806876","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":17045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1393,"last_played":1645877786},"language":"english","review":"- Survivors got nerfed into oblivion\n- Devs and their political pandering\n","timestamp_created":1466357929,"timestamp_updated":1645877756,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498426675796508789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23655372","author":{"steamid":"76561198107429466","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":11733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1569535054},"language":"german","review":"man kann nicht mit freunden zocken","timestamp_created":1466357458,"timestamp_updated":1466357458,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23655361","author":{"steamid":"76561198311579410","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":17888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1380,"last_played":1637217230},"language":"russian","review":"довольно таки страшная игра) Рекомендую ВСЕМ!!!!","timestamp_created":1466357428,"timestamp_updated":1466357428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464559942483901978","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23655334","author":{"steamid":"76561198069622016","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2199,"last_played":1516538608},"language":"german","review":"Nach dem Pathe ist es viel ausgeglichener nach meiner Spielerfahrung .","timestamp_created":1466357319,"timestamp_updated":1469975977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23655130","author":{"steamid":"76561198193915885","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1346,"last_played":1589714186},"language":"russian","review":"9/10\n9 Имеено из-за того что нельзя играть вместе с другом.\nНу и есть не большие помарки по текстурам,\nИ я не жалею что взял.Советую)","timestamp_created":1466356627,"timestamp_updated":1466356945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545148730278015137","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4487qtNUCeq2eWg=="}
