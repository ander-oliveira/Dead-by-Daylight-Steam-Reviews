Despite the bugs, it is still fun.\n\nThe new Emblem system is great. It does not impact your blood points in any way. Many toxic survivor mains are pissed, but that's because it makes them actually work for the ranking. Rank, btw, means nothing. No rewards, no impact of any sort. I play 50/50, and I don't understand the fuss. As killer it kind of sucks, because the survivors can gen rush and get 2 or 3 done really fast, which hurts one of your emblems. \n\nKeeping the rank separate from blood point gain is a good idea. I don't think you can derank with the emblems either, which helps. At least, not until their monthly or every other month rank resets.

With that said there's a few things I'd like to see fixed myself.\n\n1. Matchmaking can be horrendous at times. When queing for a game, constantly get the no network found error and it closes the game completely. If you do connect, you get kicked from your party and sent back to the home lobby about 10% of the time.\n\n2. Keep consistent groupings. One thing I dislike is having to send invites after every game to friends I play with on the regular. If I play 20 games in a day, I have to make 60+ or so groups (due to the above, as its not just me these problems affect but my group mates also)\n\n3. Latest patch penalizes Disconnects heavily. Usually that would be a good thing, but I had a game as a survivor earlier today where the killer disconnected almost instantly and we got the escape status screen. We got points for escaping, but I lost a rank pip due to not reaching a certain score. So if Salty Killers really wanted to just troll a group of survivors, they could just exit the game at the start and possibly cause them to lose rank. Maybe they dont like some of the offerings or survivor choices, who knows the mind of a killer?\n\n\n\nAnd just as a preference, maybe a few emotes to communicate with your team. Currently the community has adapted a crouch spam as a way of getting attention and such. Maybe even a proximity voice ... and to balance it out a bit you could make it so that proximity voice / emotes can be heard by proximity killers.\n\nI'd also like the ability to be able to have a group que as survivors and killers in the matchmaking. Randomize the killer if multiple people choose the role. Sometimes I want to be able to kill my friends (im such a good buddy) but dislike the idea of having to 1v1.","timestamp_created":1499299873,"timestamp_updated":1499299873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33295291","author":{"steamid":"76561197995259232","num_games_owned":3109,"num_reviews":266,"playtime_forever":40696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30115,"last_played":1644305760},"language":"english","review":"The best game you'll ever hate.","timestamp_created":1499299319,"timestamp_updated":1618358474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33295161","author":{"steamid":"76561198119897231","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":27234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11285,"last_played":1641346170},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um ótimo jogo, porém com diversos bugs e mal otimizado, melhorou bastante com o tempo em otimização, mas continua com seus probleminhas, a comunidade no geral é bem toxica, mas da para achar pessoas legais e diversas amizades.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1499298940,"timestamp_updated":1499298940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539748966693878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33295014","author":{"steamid":"76561198360599169","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":204475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1902,"playtime_at_review":1560,"last_played":1660605773},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est vraiment distrayant, prenant, et horrifique.","timestamp_created":1499298489,"timestamp_updated":1499298489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489228188991546631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33294911","author":{"steamid":"76561198096330311","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3225,"last_played":1600003113},"language":"english","review":"this game is make me very anger some time but it has fun time.","timestamp_created":1499298178,"timestamp_updated":1537833390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33294554","author":{"steamid":"76561198392756449","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":41757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":778,"playtime_at_review":7085,"last_played":1660601150},"language":"russian","review":"Достойная игра в стиле выживания и хоррора, всем советую!","timestamp_created":1499297073,"timestamp_updated":1499297073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33294532","author":{"steamid":"76561198126274637","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6430,"last_played":1633277755},"language":"russian","review":"После последнего обновления часто выкидывает, при этом ранг просто улетает на 3 капли.

This is one of the best online horror games out there (most aren't very good)!  It has cool lore behind it even if it is a online only game. It is worth $20 but the DLC's are not worth it. I would wait until they make a bundle for it like they did for Payday 2 as the amount of DLC in this game is retarded. It is fun for a little while but gets boring quick. You can meet new friends or people to play with. This game has a horrible community though. Try to stay away from it lol!  The developers need to work on fixing bugs as well.  I would rate Dead By Daylight a 6/10 (mainly because it is repetitive and has a very bad business model).","timestamp_created":1499274735,"timestamp_updated":1592860404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33283787","author":{"steamid":"76561198260927865","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":33835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1985,"last_played":1658267086},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра\n","timestamp_created":1499274735,"timestamp_updated":1499274735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33283621","author":{"steamid":"76561198048466463","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3704,"last_played":1599079461},"language":"russian","review":"Если вы тащитель от сырой дисбалансированной игры  где Царствуют Баги и Вх  то Милости прошу  Вам эта игра придется по нраву :\n-Множество Багов\n-Ущербный Fix Пасивных перков  с полнейшим дисбалансом  \n-ВОЛШЕБНЫЙ РАНДОМАЙЗЕр  который закидывает к вам Убийц 1 Ранга  а тиммейтов  20 \n-Волшебные приключения по мирам ПОДтекстурья  \n-Ущербные  тиммейты которые хостят с пингом в 800 \n-При подключении к серверу  може твыкинуть от 1 до 4 человек прост так, что б было и засчитать автоматическое поражение с потерей всех  ништяков. \nСписок можно продолжать бесконечно ......игра задумана интересно но реализация  просто оставляет желлать лучшего \n\nP.S за то DLC уже штампуются лавехи мутятся \n","timestamp_created":1499274464,"timestamp_updated":1499274464,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519722402095794678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33283588","author":{"steamid":"76561198008648650","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":960,"last_played":1538931408},"language":"english","review":"Cannot recommend because:\n\n1.

Now the Devs have nerfed the killers and their perks to the ground and buffing the survivors and their perks to the extreme. There is no fun in playing as a killer now and playing as a survivor with their overpowered perks make it escaping with flying colours. \n\nAs a survivor, all you need to do is earn points by doing most actions in the game, objectives, helping teammates, getting chased and earning points is pretty easy. Ranking up as survivor is a walk in a park and have a variety of escape perks that waste the killer's time easy.\n\nAs a killer, it is not rewarding to play anymore. The ranking system is changed instead of blood points, it is how many times you hooked and kill people. So if survivors just keep on pallet looping like they all do on these survivor sided maps, you do earn blood points but do not proceed to ranking up at all until you hook them. Killer perks have been nerfed to the ground as well and it makes it even harder to kill. Brutal Strength that was always used because it was so good against pallet looping has been nerfed and will never be where it was. Killers have animations that create time gaps for survivors to get away, which was fine before but now that they got stuff like sprint burst, dead hard, decisive strike, it creates way bigger time gaps and loses the survivor easy. Especially in Survive with Friends. When survivors are in groups have and communication, it makes the game 3 times as hard to play. You have to make no mistakes at all in order to rank up or break even on pipping.\n\nI do not recommend this game at all in it's current state. It is way too unbalanced for an asymmetrical horror game. It is suppose to be killer be super strong and survivor should be scared, but now it is killer the one getting bullied and survivors are the ones controlling the game and the horror game has turned into a competitive ranking game.","timestamp_created":1499273787,"timestamp_updated":1512126360,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33282981","author":{"steamid":"76561198015908241","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1618757653},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu génial, malheuresement, être survivant s'avère difficile, je n'ai fait que 2 parties en survivants alors que j'ai fait plus d'une trentaine de partie en tant que tueur, on dirait que le jeu est desert mais sinon le concept est fun, kiffant, les tueurs et les survivants sont uniques, les compétences peuvent renverser le cour du jeu mais y jouer avec des potes est une expérience que je recommande car seul le jeu devient vite lassant.
