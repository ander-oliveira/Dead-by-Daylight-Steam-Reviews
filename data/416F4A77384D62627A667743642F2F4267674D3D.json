You have survivors teaming up and choosing traits and items that compliment each other and it becomes impossible for a killer to get even one take down. Having some little nerd in a pink hoodie body block and teabag a six-foot tall monster while the teammates escape is just comic. Nothing to prevent even an average skilled survivor from slowing down significantly the killer. By the time the chase is over the game also is and all survivors  escape. Some slowdown techniques are unavoidable. Even the corresponding counter-traits do very little to stop that. Looping definitely takes too much of the fun in the game. There are also structure compositions that allow for infinite safe looping effectively disabling the killer.\n\nThere is also Discord. No chance as a killer versus survivors that share information and just pile up together to block or complete objectives. \n\nYes, there are a few killers that are pretty dangerous, but most are harmless as kittens. At high 'meta' rank, the survivors do not even bother to hide. They just run around like clowns and bump into the killer because they know it cannot harm them fast enough. With so much healing, protective perks, and looping it is extremely frustrating to chase. So far there is just one reliable generator-slowing killer trait. Some killer skills can even be disabled completely or just require impossible trick-shots. \n\nAs a survivor, I cannot loop and still get steady progress and gains. I have plenty of defensive perks and it is not an issue evading the killer. Sure, there is one killer that can camp pretty well, but leaving one behind is a small price for a win in those rare cases.\n\nAlso, I have noticed that for a killer to gain the same amount of points and rank progress as a survivor does, the game has to be almost perfect. A survivor still gains plenty of points even if he does not survive. As a killer, catching the survivors is not enough to gain a rank. You also need substantial participation in all supporting activities.\n\nThere are certain few maps that favour the killer but is still not enough. \n\nI will not discuss the community behaviours and attitude towards killers that just adds to the negativity.\n\nOverall, I will not recommend to a friend unless the game is re-balanced.

being tunneled? well people are dicks who knew. someone getting facecamped? stop hanging around (unless you got half a plan and other half being Borrowed Time).  do gens and gtfo, dont feed. even other suvrivors will forgive that. \n4. swf with 4 flashlights? hope you started as michael with tombstone lol \ngetting tbagged? clicky flashlights? ignore them! theyre runners, hunt the gen jockeys. down them, leave their ass on the ground and look for the rat close by to hit before picking them up or youll hear weeknd singing blinding lights.\n5. i hope you are doing totems before the last gen pops! until you see otherwise every killers run NOED.\n6. chase with the survivor is starting to feel long? you should have gone to that gen you heard close to being finished like yesterday. or looked for a weak link and hooked them first. biggest trump card for killer is always survivor making mistakes.\n7. dont yell at killers for \"camping\" if survivors are being too altruistic and running around close to the hook\n8. dont yell at survivors for gen rushing. have a good plan. i do feel your pain as playing is killer is stressful af. you bring hex and hear it get destroyed next 20 secs but just chalk it up as practice for next game. i hear guarding gens pays well. \n9. i was going to say rank dont matter but ohh shit. now you get more bp and shards higher ranks. so be competitive. just dont be a dick about it. there is always someone better than you!\n10. trust me both sides are unfair. that is the ground this game stands on. killer killed you? what are they supposed to do, host tea party? survivors brought in key and ran away, fk i got nothing for this but im sure its in the name somewhere. \nBONUS\ndoesnt matter what perks both side were using. they were tool to be used. this game has changed so much since the beginning and its PROBABLY better this way. not everyone has to like it (imagine getting moried 1 min into the game or survivors speed bursting 3 times in one chase and then also stabbing you with ds and saboing all your hooks with only basement remaining cause you cant break those and finishing 4 gens in 10 secs using brand new parts..... holy fk that was something)\n\nand the main main main thing. if those advice were ranked then this would be rank 1. you ready?\nDONT HANG ON THE END GAME CHAT. say GGWP and run away!!\nthank you for reading my nonsense\n\nooh wait the review\nlove being chased by your favourite movie killer you watched couple of times when you were a kid or a killer from a game you played (and other inspired-by killers)? love to play hide and seek from the killer as your favourite character from games or movies (and other originals)?  like despite the seldom weird hit regs, lagging survivors and few other minor annoyances? cause you dont really care and just want to have fun regardless. well this game is fun. \nWELCOME TO THE FOG.","timestamp_created":1634701049,"timestamp_updated":1634756880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101325630","author":{"steamid":"76561198874000355","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3278,"last_played":1658606606},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo incrível, mesmo tendo alguns filha da puta na partida","timestamp_created":1634700937,"timestamp_updated":1634700937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101325590","author":{"steamid":"76561199109118980","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":518,"playtime_at_review":9678,"last_played":1660516612},"language":"english","review":"A enjoyable occasion of suffering.","timestamp_created":1634700843,"timestamp_updated":1654069893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526582300662994385","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101325483","author":{"steamid":"76561198146554911","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1629768307},"language":"english","review":"nfts are gross, too busy worrying about making a quick buck than to actually fix their broken, unpolished and unbalanced game.\n\nEdit: They backed out on the NFTs Hoo-fuckin-ray. still haven't fixed a single thing game-wise, but they had plenty of money to throw at more licensed IP material.

They show no real interest in bug fixes or taking any creative initiative when it comes to creating their own original chapters as the killers and survivors remain uninspired. Particularly with survivor side continuing to receive perks that are sub par and do not inspire players to experiment with builds. Very few recent survivors are interesting and with their perks leaving so much to be desired it causes the game to feel rather stagnant. BHVR's insistence on releasing bland killers that revolve around both frustrating and boring mechanics that reward camping and tunneling behavior (Deathslinger, Twins, Blight and Pyramid Head) leave a lot to be desired whenever in a match with these killers.\n\nIt's laughable at how highly anticipated a couple of licensed chapters were only to be poorly executed. The Resident Evil Chapter immediately running into issues with RPD leading the map to experience more time disabled than enabled. Not to mention their poor execution of the Resident Evil Cosmetics, which allowed some players initially to buy the cosmetics unlinked. BHVR stated that however that was always their intention and then forcefully refunded players Auric Cells with little other comment.\n\nOr how about not disclosing the fact that BHVR allegedly spent MONTHS working with Boss Protocol to adapt in-game models for use as NFTs and approved them prior to the release of Pinhead in DBD? BHVR chose to make that information public at another date with no comment on whether refunds would be available. All they had to offer were a handful of tweets.\n\nApart from the poor execution of license content, the lack of interest in creating inspired original content, and the complete mishandling of bug fixes there is also the issue of BHVR's stance on accessibility. As BHVR hurriedly announced colorblind mode ONLY after  the fact a designer complained about accessibility requests.\n\nHonestly while I initially found the game to be a lot of fun the reasons to not give BHVR anymore time or money only continue to grow and I would not recommend this game to anyone.","timestamp_created":1634696297,"timestamp_updated":1634696297,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101323354","author":{"steamid":"76561198367629463","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":15170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1660518537},"language":"brazilian","review":"um jogo foda , para jogar com amigos !","timestamp_created":1634696229,"timestamp_updated":1634696229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101323291","author":{"steamid":"76561199129916453","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":72272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":735,"playtime_at_review":39748,"last_played":1660581114},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo maravilhoso e muito viciante só amo <3","timestamp_created":1634696125,"timestamp_updated":1634696125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101323255","author":{"steamid":"76561198045013568","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2735,"last_played":1657705033},"language":"english","review":"great game, i have a feeling all these people ragging on it just suck. stay awesome guys don't let the whiny babies affect you","timestamp_created":1634696065,"timestamp_updated":1634696065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101323235","author":{"steamid":"76561198030001256","num_games_owned":342,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4305,"last_played":1627519838},"language":"english","review":"I was never any good at this game, but I really lowed playing it, especially with my friends.
