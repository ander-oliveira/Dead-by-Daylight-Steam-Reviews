Don't waste your money and time for this. It's not worth it. You might have fun at first, and get addicted to this, but after the little fun from the one-dimensional gameplay wears off and you get tired of called by various names both in illiterate English and Russian you are left with bitterness and sadness, and you even might end up venting these feelings in a Steam-review like I am doing right now. You don't want to end up like this loser weeaboo with 1000+ hours on Dead by Daylight right? Didn't think so either.\n\nTo convince some of you even more here are a selection of things I personally dislike about the game and things behind it:\n\nEvery update is a freaking joke. Most of the time they break more things than they fix, and sometimes they don't even fix the things they claim to say they fix.\n\nEvery DLC launch without exception either gives birth to a fuck-ton of bugs, breaks already existing maps for some reason or it's launched in a state where the map included in it can't even be played for the first month or so (Resident Evil DLC, though I guess Raccoon City being disabled was a blessing in disguise in retrospect). \n\nGame has severe balance issues (or more like always has been), and after every attempt to fix these the new perks, nerfs/buffs and the likes just widens the gap most of the time. Community has had some pretty great suggestions to fix, or at least make things more fair for both sides, but this leads to another problem I personally have with this game.\n\nCommunity doesn't really get their voices out, or if they do the BHVR doesn't really show any signs that they'd listen to it. Outside of some tweaks community, who's clearly loving this game gives a lot of good pointers and suggestions to make overall game more enjoyable, but sadly they seem to be talking to deaf ears at this point.\n\nBHVR also did NFTs related to the Hellraiser DLC, when I thought my opinion of this game couldn't go any lower they magically found a way to make that happen!\n\nToxic community is something you can expect from every multiplayer PvP-game, and DbD is not exception, however the amount of toxicity in this game rivals to such salt-filled classics like CS:GO and LoL\n\nUnfair gameplay-tactics such as tunneling and camping are approved as valid tactics by the BHVR themselves. I know that preventing this isn't easy, but to the people behind the game give this a thumbs up is pretty weird.\n\nGameplay gets tedious on the survivor side after a while, and there probably won't be any major additions to it. You can try to make some different perk builds I guess, but that also has it's limits, especially when a good amount of the perks are basically useless, or work in really specific situations or builds.\n\nI actually want to like this game, but at it's current state I just can't. Slowly but surely I've gladly started to drift in the direction of other multiplayer-games and I believe that within the next year I will finally be freed from the shackles of this horrifying game, or that's at least what I hope.","timestamp_created":1608788775,"timestamp_updated":1640711190,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":190,"votes_funny":101,"weighted_vote_score":"0.76388925313949585","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83016552","author":{"steamid":"76561198296079244","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":20499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17213,"last_played":1656974719},"language":"brazilian","review":"Toma cuidado com o moço la","timestamp_created":1608788129,"timestamp_updated":1608788129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83016489","author":{"steamid":"76561198238447762","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17269,"last_played":1646118627},"language":"spanish","review":"Me gusta","timestamp_created":1608788052,"timestamp_updated":1608788052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83016005","author":{"steamid":"76561198076319546","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":15272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14938,"last_played":1634438650},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Not Recommended.[/h1]\n[b]Note: I've originally played this game on Xbox One before I hesitantly got it for PC on sale[/b]\n\n[b]In Short:[/b] [i]Lack of competent development is killing the game as well as promoting a toxic community and environment.[/i]\n\nThe review is organized by categories with additional notes if I have something to add.\n\n[b]Game's Visuals (Graphics)[/b]\n[ ] Beautiful\n[x] Good\n[ ] Decent\n[ ] Bad\n[ ] Poor\n\nPersonal Note: The game fairly recently received a visual update in a form of a downloadable update.

From personal experience, I say it's decent, but it has to be at least good.\n\n[b]Gameplay Mechanics[/b]\n[ ] Beautiful\n[ ] Good\n[ ] Decent\n[ ] Bad\n[x] Poor\n\nPersonal Note: This game has unique gameplay, which makes it very appealing in an industry filled mostly with FPS genres. However, it's always broken. Whether it was due to poor latency, exploit/bugs, or lack of a balance, I always encountered an unfair situation. There was not a single moment in this game's history where I can say \"Yup, I lost fair and square\" consistently. Perhaps I could have some bias, but I know how to accept defeat in a virtual computer game. I have no complaints like that in other video games, such as CS:GO, Overwatch, Team Fortress 2, or literally anything else I play. If I lose, I want to know that the chances were fair and I simply lacked the teamwork or personal skill. In this game, you will not get that chance.\n\n[b]Story/Narrative[/b]\n[ ] Beautiful\n[ ] Good\n[x] Decent\n[ ] Bad\n[ ] Poor\n\nPersonal Note: It has lore now... that's about it. The premise of the game is intriguing, but nothing crazy to pull me in and make me hungry for more information.\n\n[b]Replayability[/b]\n[x]Yes\n[ ] Kinda\n[ ] None\n\nPersonal Note: Definitely. It's a multiplayer/co-op game with the same objective every single time. The only factor that will vary from match to match is the people and characters they play. Although, there is a certain META you will encounter more often than not. Certain perks, abilities, or even characters.\n\n[b]Final Note:[/b]\nOverall, I have more negative experience than positive memories. This is absolutely the development team's fault, and Mathieu Cote represents its face. Their actions, words and choices speak for themselves. \n\nAt this point, they care more about your wallet than your experience. When this game desperately needs critical fixes and development support, they release expensive cosmetics and skins. You may literally look up many videos on the internet with Mathieu where the Dead by Daylight community meme's on him. I don't have anything against him as a person, [i]so far[/i]. But, as a developer, I do not respect him. He is killing this game. Lack of balance, especially for Killer Mains on this game, is suffocating the community and forces the casual players to leave. Survivors are not only given tools to bully and harass human beings that choose to play a Killer, but the developers promote such behavior through silly updates and in-game challenges. Of course, Killers may also bully survivors, but not as often as survivors bully Killers. There's only so much you can do against an organized team. This game attracted a very toxic community, and you may literally experience cyber-bullying on regular basis. Don't expect a good report system either, since the developers didn't care to implement a convenient report system to regulate toxic behavior or gameplay exploitation (Hackers also happen fairly often).\n\nI could write a whole essay on fundamental issues with this game. However, there's plenty of well-organized videos and articles that will present that information better than I can in a Steam Review. Every single corner and aspect of this game has a problem with it. [i]Gameplay, mechanics, development, support, sound, graphics, community, and so on.[/i] Every category has or at some point had an issue with it. For every fix, two new problems are introduced. Instead of prioritizing development, they monetize a broken game. I am surprised they didn't label this game as an \"Early Alpha,\" cause it certainly feels like one. [b]Save your nerves, find something better to do or play.[/b]\n\n\"[i]Maybe try survivor a little bit, maybe you're just tired. Change it up every now and then, or take a break. Play something else for like a week. We are working on balance all the time. Some of it can come from our ranking and that needs fixing.[/i]\"\n- Mathieu Cote, Producer of Dead by Daylight according to IMBd.\n[spoiler][i]https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1693788384127676805/[/i][/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1608787392,"timestamp_updated":1608787392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557195544242858887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015887","author":{"steamid":"76561198192280061","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7574,"last_played":1653273595},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1608787242,"timestamp_updated":1608787242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015813","author":{"steamid":"76561199110499113","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1655398046},"language":"thai","review":"หาห้องนานมากครับ  บัคเยอะทุกครั้งที่อัพเดท แก้ได้จะดีมากครับ","timestamp_created":1608787150,"timestamp_updated":1608787150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015559","author":{"steamid":"76561198880886053","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":1256,"last_played":1660426667},"language":"english","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1608786774,"timestamp_updated":1608786774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015441","author":{"steamid":"76561199078108282","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1640239379},"language":"spanish","review":"recomendable comprenlo\n","timestamp_created":1608786632,"timestamp_updated":1608786632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015342","author":{"steamid":"76561198950152384","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":155553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":182,"playtime_at_review":60175,"last_played":1660368614},"language":"koreana","review":"잼따","timestamp_created":1608786481,"timestamp_updated":1608786481,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315808296203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015319","author":{"steamid":"76561199012260105","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2388,"last_played":1640315220},"language":"spanish","review":"AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO perder, pero amo","timestamp_created":1608786453,"timestamp_updated":1608786453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015311","author":{"steamid":"76561199082111194","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3220,"last_played":1654984264},"language":"russian","review":"прикольная игра","timestamp_created":1608786446,"timestamp_updated":1608786446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83015036","author":{"steamid":"76561199094262262","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1611391504},"language":"russian","review":"супер тема только быстро надоедает","timestamp_created":1608786105,"timestamp_updated":1608786105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83014776","author":{"steamid":"76561198421541423","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1609683229},"language":"russian","review":"Играешь с друзьями.

Bir de beynimizi kullanıp yanlış ses infolarımı vereceğiz katile? Yok daha neler ;D \n\nKatil olarak en az 3 kill almak için  %100 motive ve performanslı olmanız gerekir.Survivor beş kez hata yapsa bile kazanabilir ama siz bir hatanızda oyunu verebilirsiniz.Ve en önemlisi Katil'i oynarken Survivorların koymuş olduğu kurallara uymalısınız.\n- Kancadan alınan adama asla dokunamazsınız ama o size barrow time ile block yapabilir.Tünel yapmayın yani.\n- Birini kancaya astıktan sonra 3 saniye içinde kancadan 50 metre uzaklaşmış olmalısınız.Bu Camp demektir ve survivorlar sevmez.\n- Bir taneden fazla jenerator engelleyici perk almayın.Aksi takdirde meta köpeği olursunuz.Survivorlar 4 kişi DH,BT,DS,UB ve kırmızı addonlu medkit, key alabilir.En doğal hakları?\nBu kuralları uygularsanız ve kaybederseniz survivorları mutlu edersiniz.\nSurvivorları mutlu edemezseniz oynamış olduğunuz katili nerflerler, o yüzden survları mutlu edin!Kurallara uymadığınız takdirde ise oyun  sonu chatinde ağıtlara hazır olun.\n\nOyun yapımcılarının bilgisi şuan ki oyun sektörünün 10 yıl gerisindedir.Her güncellemeden sonra oyunda en az bir bug ortaya çıkar ve bunun düzeltilmesi de en az 3 günü bulur.Bu işbilmezliklerini telafi  etmek için de geçtiğimiz günlerde oyun ve dlc'lerine %100'lük bir zam yaptılar.7 Temmuz 2021 tarihinde gelen güncellemeden beri İron Will perki olduğundan daha fazla iş yapmaktadır.Normalde bu perk yaralandığınızda acı çekmenizi susturmaya yarar.Ama yeni gelen gizli buff... pardon bug ile nefes ve ayak sesinizi  bile kapatıyor.Survivor aleyhine palet bugları  1 hafta içinde düzeltilmesine rağmen katil aleyhine olan bu durum 1,5 ay geçmesine rağmen hala düzeltilmedi.Çünkü gücünü sesden alan Spirit'i oynayan sadece %3'lük bir kısımdır  yani ağlamaları önemsizdir.Yeteneksiz survivorlara yapılan her buff 10 dolar demektir.Çünkü oyunun büyük çoğunluğu sadece survivor oynamaktadır.Para gelen tarafa yarayan bir bug varken katilin sorunu neden çözülsün ki? Oyun yapımcısı olmak, topluluk yönetmek bunu gerektirmez mi zaten.\n\nAğlamasınlar diye kendi koymuş olduğu kurallara uyarak oynamama  rağmen her oyun sonu ağlayan, iftira atan yeteneksiz oyunculara sahip oyun.Umarım düzgün bir yapımcı ve topluluk ekibiyle daha iyi yerlere gelir ama şuan ki haliyle  yerinde sayan bir oyun.","timestamp_created":1608777185,"timestamp_updated":1629499587,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537953794002532959","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83007880","author":{"steamid":"76561199090965468","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1654445027},"language":"spanish","review":"el juego llevo pocas horas jugandolo y les doy mi sincera opinion, el juego es increible es como un simulador de un asesino y o una persona intentando escapar de un psicopata, cuando juego como survivor me da mas tension ya que cuando veo la luz roja o los latidos del sobreviviente o tambien escuchar la cancion de persecucion me pone nervioso, juego mas como killer para desarrollar mas mi habilidad con los killers que solo me faltan 3 the twins the plague y the witch, la verdad es que si lo recomiendo muco si eres fan de este tipo de juegos, muy bien hecho","timestamp_created":1608776922,"timestamp_updated":1611178446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83007793","author":{"steamid":"76561199019660753","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17027,"last_played":1643510759},"language":"english","review":"Good game overall just need to fix some bugs and matchmaking queues and its good to go! :)","timestamp_created":1608776815,"timestamp_updated":1608776815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83007553","author":{"steamid":"76561198024709079","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22274,"last_played":1643919810},"language":"english","review":"Heyja this game is one of a kind.
