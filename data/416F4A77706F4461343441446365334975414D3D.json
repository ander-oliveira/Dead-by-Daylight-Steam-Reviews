Le cose che mi hanno fatto storcere il naso principalmente sono 2: le code un po lunghe in certe fasce orarie (anche se parlaimo di una attesa di MASSIMO 5 minuti, però come ho detto avviene solo in certi orari in cui i player sono un po di meno) e la communty molto tossica.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.","timestamp_created":1652631640,"timestamp_updated":1652631640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.375510215759277344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115506666","author":{"steamid":"76561198005848913","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":20707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20707,"last_played":1635565927},"language":"english","review":"MMR system that doesn't represent skill at all.

have played this game for over a 1000 hrs now. I only play survivor, because the first few times I tried playing killer I was bullied and made fun of for not being good ; I didn't feel like repeating the experience.\n\nAs a survivor, I don't mind \"losing\" a game, in the sense that if I die I don't care, as long as the game was fun. What I mean by fun is good chases and a killer who doesn't only target one player over and over, or camp the hooks or the basement without doing anything else.\n\nWhat's really annoying to me is that my having fun is dependant on how the killer I get feels like acting. If that killer feels like being an a***ole? Well he's gonna camp and tunnel survivors to oblivion. There's only so much you can do with limited perks and there essentially won't be a game. Especially if you're playing by yourself with random other players.\n\nOne of the killers, The Trickster, has a perk that makes the survivors exposed for staying in his terror radius too long. Why isn't a mechanic like this in place for killers who camp and/or tunnel? Like some sort of penalty? Because unfortunately, for every killer that plays fair, you get 5 who don't. \n\nThis is my main issue with this game, I won't even get into the hit boxes problem. I keep coming back to it because the base principle of it is awesome but I always end up having to take a looooong break before coming back because I just get frustrated with

- wybitna, w swoim rodzaju, z świecą szukać innych, takich gier, unikatowa\n\nJeżeli grasz z dwoma lub trzema kolegami, to ta recenzja nie ma sensu.\n\nW grze \"bawiłem\" się przez 200h, niestety nie rzadko była to udręka powodowana przez graczy, po równo, zabójców jak i przetrwańców. Problemy z dobieraniem do rozgrywek mam rozumieć małą popularnością gry? Czy co? Po rzekomej poprawie tego mankamentu, pojawiają się sami ruscy... więc już wiadomo o co chodzi, nie spotkałem jeszcze nikogo, komu chce się grać z ruskimi. Gra sama w sobie nie jest zła, sam nie spotkałem się z żadnymi błędami, ale poziom community jest tragiczny. Gwóźdź do trumny przybijają twórcy, którzy wzmacniają zabójców, nie dając nic przetrwańcom i nie było by to tak dotkliwe, gdyby nie strasznie niski poziom graczy, kij z tym jeżeli również zabójca jest słaby, ale jeżeli jest mocny, to jest mega trudno, bo grając we dwóch albo co gorsza samemu, reszta graczy będzie miała cię w głębokim poważaniu, a sami nie dotrwają do końca ze względu na ich brak, BRAK, NULL, KURWA IDIOCI PIERDOLENI, umiejętności grania.","timestamp_created":1652612924,"timestamp_updated":1652613418,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpoDa44ADce3IuAM="}
