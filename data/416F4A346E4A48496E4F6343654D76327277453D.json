The better parts of the community have gotten better, but the worst parts of the community have gotten even worse. The value and fun of the game you have depends solely on the people you play against. \n\nOn top of that, Behavior Interactive has to be the most ignorant developer I've ever seen. While killers are struggling against discord-comm using, Rank 1 SWF groups due to the terrible, sub-par matchmaking, they decide the best thing for the game is to nerf Ruin, one of the best killer perks that already struggles due to bad totem spawn locations. \n\nIt is my belief that at the current time of this review, Behavior cares more about maximizing profits from DLC than fixing their game.","timestamp_created":1542856236,"timestamp_updated":1590349526,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482386767864227295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46136428","author":{"steamid":"76561198321316822","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1045,"last_played":1657927222},"language":"spanish","review":"Un buen juego que te mete tanto del lado de los asesinos  como de los sobrevivientes.

The game has the 4 [b]survivors[/b] finish up generators to open up an exit gate for them to escape while the [b]killer[/b] has to kill them before they do so. [b]Survivors[/b] get to choose from a selection of characters that have their own perks that makes each of them have their own playstyle whether its to hide, run or finish generators. The [b]Killer[/b] also gets to choose from a selection of killers that have their own Active skill and perks that makes each of them unique.\n\nTLDR:\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Unique multiplayer horror exeprience\n    [*]Has layer of strategy and depth to gameplay\n    [*]Super Fun with friends\n    [*]Has unique characters to choose from either survivors or killers\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Laggy lobby hosts\n    [*]Fustrating random player behaviors\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[b]Uniqueness[/b]\nThis is one of the 1st games that I have played in this multiplayer survival horror genre and I feel it manages to stand out in this genre. The way how they have made each [b]survivor[/b] and [b]killers[/b] have their own playstyle and skills makes it different from the other games out there as you are able to level up your characters through a skill web system which really shows character progression. \n\n[b]Layer of depth[/b]\nI have never expected the depth in strategy or playstyle from a game like this to begin with as my initial impression of this game was just a simple cat and mouse game between [b]survivors[/b] and [b]killers[/b]. The varying skills and perks of each [b]survivor[/b] and [b]killers[/b] really help in this regard as it makes you think about a number of stuff like the [b]survivors[/b] have to find out which [b]killer[/b] it is as they have to play differently depending on the killer like the [i]Hillbilly[/i] can 1 shot [b]survivors[/b] with his chainsaw and can see other [b]survivors[/b] when he hooks someone or the [i]Nurse[/i] can blink distances and can see [b]survivors[/b] that are healing, etc. For [b]killers[/b] it is the same as there are [b]survivors[/b] that can dismantle your hooks that allow you to sacrifice [b]survivors[/b] for more points or some that can heal others quickly or another one that can escape your grasp when you carry them, etc.\n\n[b]Fun Cooperative experience[/b]\nEventhough some [b]killers[/b] may say it is really annoying to fight against a  party of [b]survivor[/b] friends but 90% of playtime has been playing together with my friends and it was the most fun I had playing this game. The game is incredibly fun when you get to communicate with your friends through a voice channel as you are able to scream at them when a [b]killer[/b] chases you or even shout and laugh when they make mistakes. In this regard the cooperative horror experience was further enhanced for me and I 100% recommend playing this game with friends as you can even try really weird and fun builds with set of [b]survivors[/b] .\n\n[h1]The Neutral[/h1]\n[b]Connection[/b]\nThis isn't something the devs can control but the [b]killers[/b] are the host of the lobbies and I have found alot of [b]killers[/b] that have really bad pings which can make the game totally unenjoyable for me when they make you teleport back distances and get hit by them. \n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[b]Bad Player behaviors[/b]\nThis may be more towards how players act and it won't be the game's fault but it was how the game is designed that made the player behave so. At times you may find [b]killers[/b] that will camp a single [b]survivor[/b] the whole game even if it means letting the other 3 live just to make sure they get a single kill and it can be argued that the [b]killer[/b] loses out in this regard but for me it ruins the overall experience of that single player that got camped. There are also certain cases of [b]survivors[/b] disconnecting instantly when they are downed once which really makes playing with random public [b]survivors[/b] even more annoying and fustarting when that happens. Overall this is the only bad thing I can find about the game and it really ruins my experience overall when these kind of player behaviors happen.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nIf you have never tried this kind of games before and you would like to try this multiplayer survival horror genre, I would highly recommend this game to you and its a must buy on discount which it usually goes on discounts. I would also recommend to get it with freinds to make it a much more enjoyable experience when you play as survivors. With it's unique selection of characters it is really fun to play and try out each killer and survivor the game has to offer. I have not played too much on killers but from my 10% of my playtime I can say it is really use and master each killer's skills and playstyles but it can get a bit fustarting playing against good survivors.","timestamp_created":1542855906,"timestamp_updated":1542856046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46135048","author":{"steamid":"76561198076641936","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":42041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2143,"playtime_at_review":5839,"last_played":1660272141},"language":"english","review":"Great
