It's extremely bad for your mental health unless you're already a sociopath.\n\nThe game is just toxicity personified. Unless you're playing with friends, expect your worst enemies to be your own teammates. They block your path, unhook you in front of the killer so you can advance towards death even faster, and are often found hiding or sneaking around doing nothing productive all but guaranteeing a full team wipe out. \n\nThe killer side isn't any better as you run into those groups of friends that have such an easy time coordinating and just generally not being terrible that you'll end up harassed and bullied the entire game... which will typically last just a few minutes because a coordinated group will have everything done in that time.\n\nHonestly, this game is much more enjoyable to watch other people play than to play yourself. It's frustrating, rage inducing, and the really fun moments are few and far between. Unless you have a full group of friends to play with, or are a serious masochist, save your money.\n\nMaking things worse are the plethora of bugs. It's become a meme in this community that one of the developers said they think they've \"done a pretty good job so far.\" You will be hit from such distances that you will wonder when Freddy Kruger became an evil Reed Richards. \n\nThe 'horror' aspect goes away fairly quickly and it becomes an elaborate game of ring-around-the-rosy. The primary interaction between survivor and killer is running in circles around terrain. Killers no longer inspire fear, but instead evoke either laughter or annoyance. Some killers are designed in such a way that once a player is good with them, they will win any chase within seconds. Others are so laughably weak that only the braindead people you get randomly teamed with will go down against them.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game sucks you in with a painfully horrible grind, making you feel compelled to spend countless hours just to unlock new perks in the hopes that putting together a 'meta' build will make your teammates less useless. Getting all the perks unlocked on a single character will take hundreds of hours and every three months, they add a new character, requiring another 45 levels of grinding (40 for the new character to unlock the perks, 5 to unlock them on the new character). \n\nUnless you hate yourself or plan to play exclusively with friends, seriously, skip this mess.\n\nEdit: Seriously, this game is complete shit.","timestamp_created":1593741157,"timestamp_updated":1654829763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498251765966415405","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71918182","author":{"steamid":"76561198391468229","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":5133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1965,"last_played":1653401760},"language":"english","review":"We

Alongside this, each killer has their own nuance and mechanics and once you're past the initial levels. The game will stop telling you anything meaning if you face a brand new killer. Tough.\n\nThe pacing and balance entirely favours the killer and feels near-impossible for the survivors. The benefit of the survivors is that there are 4 of them. The benefit of the killers is that the map layouts favour them, they have unique power ability, standard power abilities, and once they've begun damaging players, they gain more powers and benefits for having damaged the players meaning momentum entirely favours the killers. If they hook a survivor, the game is in their favour making it easier to find and hook more players. Once in a blue moon, the killer will just down all players and dance around you until you all bleed out. The best chance you have of winning is if your against a new player or a player who is new to the killer and they don't know what they're doing.\n\nThe game struggles on low-end machines. For the kind of game it is, it really shouldn't.\n\n[b]Helpful comments.[/b]\n\nI feel like the game could be balance far better if the survivors had more unique abilities that didn't give them marginal percentage boosts to the mechanics already available to them. Let them have spike traps that the killer has to perform skill checks to escape. Let them have firecrackers that distract the killer. Let them have baseball bats that stun the killer but they have to be close to use it. Let them have ghilly suits that corrupt if caught and really slows their movement down. Just...

by Daylight is really really fun and rewarding when you do well. Sometimes it can be somewhat frustrating, but coming off of League of Legends, it's refreshing to play something where it's not too hard to just get into another match that (probably) won't take possibly 40+ minutes to finish before getting into another one. I've been having the most fun being able to survive with friends, even though I usually prefer playing killer, so I'd say realistically speaking both modes are super duper fun. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for something to get into. One small gripe, the matchmaking sometimes is wonky, and occasionally I'd get put against high-ranking survivors when I was a low-rank killer, which made things much more difficult, and usually I wouldn't be able to get kills during these matches. TYPICALLY however this doesn't happen, although it's something to keep in mind. Another issue is that killer wait times can go up to ten minutes, but it's not too hard to just watch something on Youtube in the background while you wait. Overall very fun, will continue to play.","timestamp_created":1593732977,"timestamp_updated":1593732977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71912482","author":{"steamid":"76561198336092322","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1594646306},"language":"russian","review":"Зашёл.

игру пару лет назад по скидке и ни капли не пожалел.\nХоть эта игра и рассчитана на тимплей и команду,но в нее можно также играть и в одиночку.\nВ игре хорошая графика,что является одновременно и плюсом и минусом игры т.к. для нее нужен более-менее нормальный пк.\nТакже в игре очень хорошо сделаны объемные звуки и практически всегда можно понять с какой-то стороны выйдет маньяк.\nЧитеров в игре я вроде не встречал,но они есть.\nЕще очень много разнообразных сурвов и маньяков каждый со своим перком и кастомизацией.\nВ общем задумка интересная и ее реализация тоже хорошая(что бывает не так часто)\nНе знаю,что еще сказать,но скажу то,что по скидке да и просто так эта игра стоит своих денег,особенно если будете покупать ее с компанией друзей.","timestamp_created":1593731000,"timestamp_updated":1593731000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71911050","author":{"steamid":"76561199067974572","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1605750036},"language":"english","review":"Awesome!","timestamp_created":1593730885,"timestamp_updated":1593730885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71911043","author":{"steamid":"76561198269437578","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2902,"last_played":1623710338},"language":"russian","review":"Ну
