The developers have absolutely no incentive to change anything in this game, as it is currently the only one that fits the same niche. White Noise 2 has no playerbase, same with Friday the 13th. Last Year: The Nightmare is currently a discord exclusive, on top of the fact that you have to deal with survivors being vastly more powerful than the killer. Soul at Stake has no US playerbase so all games you join are either laggy as hell or nearly empty. Hide or Die isn't being released until later this year, and until then you can see there are no choices. \n\nThe developers, then, are some of the most dishonest, lazy, and absolutely baffling people I've ever interacted with. They disingenuously list nerfs and buffs as \"bug fixes\" or \"fixed an issue\" because those go in a different section of patch notes that nobody reads through as carefully. They have done this multiple times, and every time it was discovered, they've reverted the change within a week. The changes they make to this game are counterintuitive to the extreme. \"Wow, an entire half or more of the community wants this perk removed. Let's keep it in the game for months, then when we do nerf it, release a perk at the same power level one week later!\" Or \"You know who needs completely overt nerfs to her gameplay? A solidly low tier killer that you almost never see in games!\"\n\nThe first time they \"fixed bugs\", they completely broke the game. Killers could not play because survivors could escape literally any time they got picked up. After their numbers started tanking into the ground, even though it was during an event, they \"reverted the  bug fix,\"  refusing to even own up to the fact that they had so dishonestly tried to slip something past us. When their game breaks, they ban people for it. Recently there was a problem wherein one killer could use certain equipment to lock survivors in an animation for upwards of 10 minutes or more. Instead of disabling these addons or fixing the problem, they put up a warning stating that they would ban anyone caught using these addons. They took a week or two to fix the problem, banning people as they went. Meanwhile, people are still getting disconnected from games, the game crashes regularly, and the infinite loading screen bug will trap you in a game with no way to interact to end it, short of closing the entire program with Task manager. \n\nThey refuse to address any serious problems in the game. The two strongest things in this game are looping and communication. Through exploitation of hitboxes, survivors can take a smaller loop around obstacles than killers. This allows them to almost equal the faster killer speed, drawing out chases to ridiculous lengths. The majority of the game is running around the same pile of garbage 3 times, then the survivor goes to a different pile of garbage and repeats as much as they can. This game is not fun nor interactive. There is no true counterplay for most killer choices, which leads to nothing but Nurse at high ranks, stagnating the meta. \n\nCommunication is another story. The community really does care about the game, and tried to show the devs that. Marth88 was a twitch streamer who played as a survivor with a group of his friends. They brought no equipment into a game, only communicated over discord. They escaped 88 out of their 100 matches played. Then they did a later experiment wherein they used equpiment as well as communication. They aborted the experiment after 70 games because they won every single game completely. They presented these stats to the developers, trying to show them how unbalanced communication made the game. The only official response we got was from a design developer on stream, who said \"who cares? we know (communication) is broken.\" And that's it. They played hundreds of games to get told by the developers \"so what?\" \n\nMeanwhile, they constantly release new cosmetics at every opportunity and patch. New licensed killers come out more frequently than actual balance patches, and the shard system is ripped straight from games like League of Legends, where you CAN eventually get things with your earnings, but it's obviously made for wallet warriors. I have to admit, I've patronised this game over the 20 dollar price tag. And I didn't mind in the early stages, when the game was still fun and fresh. But it's become commercialised and lost something. The devs are looking for ways to cash out now, which is why there's even talk of a battle pass and mobile version floating around now. \n\nThe community is irrevocably split between Survivor and Killer mains, and the amount of toxicity could kill a horse. You will get told to kill yourself regularly. People will wait 20 minutes after they died in the game just to tell you your family should get cancer. The streamers are encouraged to bully killers without getting banned for that. The one streamer banned was banned for exploiting, then ban evansion. Not for making other people's lives hell long after the game was over. \n\nI have played this game from almost the beginning. I purchased about 1 week before they made the legacy skins from the beta exclusive to give you an idea. I can tell you with utmost certaintly, do not buy this game. It is most definitely a drug. I am trapped in a toxic relationship with this game, and you don't need that in your life. It is not fun. Do not buy it. No, not even because you want to play as Freddy or Myers. You will hate them by the end of your games almost as much as you hate yourself for playing the game. Do not buy.\n-------------------\nEDIT:\nWell here we are again, 500 hours later. \nA lot hasn't changed, and many of my criticisms still hold true. I don't think I'll change my recommendation quite yet. \nHowever, there's a lot in the pipeline that gives me hope for this game.

В целом очень понравилась на начальном этапе игры, когда действительно испытываешь адреналин от того что где то рядом с тобой рыщет маньяк и уж тем более от погони от него. Очень понравилась атмосфера игры и каждого из маньяков. Из недостатков могу отметить, что в игре действительно есть проблема с лобби, когда подключаются люди с высоким пингом и выходят, со временем вообще перестают подключатся. так же нередкие но и нечастые вылеты из игры из-за соединения. Я далеко не сильный игрок но  со временем игра на маньяке становится ну очень уж сложной из-за  игры против слаженной команды, общающейся по связи (дискорд, скайп и тп.). Использующих перки исключительно для выживаемости, но не для командной игры (они ведь им не нужны). Думаю это решилось бы ограничением пати-гейма до 2-х человек. Ну это моё мнение. Ну и со временем страх перед маньяками пропадает и игра становится уже спортивным интересом. Из-за простоты игры в команде на выживших. Да и выжившие как единица тоже не пальцем деланные. По итогу могу сказать, что игра всё же мне нравится, думаю, безусловно есть над чем работать в ней и будем надеяться, что она, как хорошее вино, станет с годами лучше.

Коннект. Представьте себе, вы будете играть не на сервере разработчика с автоматическим выбором региона и подбором оптимального пинга, а на компьютере игрока, играющего за маньяка. Да, вы не ослышались, в 2019 году еще существует система, которую придумал еще Юлий Цезарь. Еще раз: сервер вашей игры - комп одного из игроков. Что мы имеем на выходе:\n1.а. Лаги. Как случайные, потому что вы можете находиться за полмира от хоста, так и специальные, для получения преимущества.\n1.б. Пинг. Некоторые хосты у меня были с пингом 500+, но не в этом дело. Даже при почти идеальном пинге (примерно 100 для меня), у маньяка пинг будет идеальный, ведь на его компе происходит вся движуха. При прочих равных даже 100 пинга разницы будут стоить вам катки.\n1.в. Проблемы с коннектом. Из 10 игр одна-две не запускаются совсем, в половине вылетает со старта один из выживших, и иногда даже маньяк не подцепляется и игра обрывается. Обычная картина: из 10 игр только 4-5 играются с полным составом 4 на 1.\nСерьезно, ребята? У вас такая офигенная идея, такой великолепный старт, и вы не можете нормально сделать серверную часть? \n2. Лобби. Перед началом матча все набиваются в лобби, смотрят пинг и ставят статус \"готов\", или ливают. Проблема в том, что иногда можно ждать до 30 мин, наблюдая заходящих и уходящих игроков. То есть, 30 минут ожидания, чтобы потом кто-то отвалился на коннекте или ливанул в игре. Здорово, офигенно. Как надо сделать? Автоматический сервер, подбирающий пятерых игроков из одного региона с примерными рангами. Закинуло в игру - ливанул - бан лобби минут на 10. Вместо ливера ждем нового. Это же просто, посмотрите тысячи игр все это реализовали много лет назад.\n3. Ранги. За 80 часов далеко я, конечно, не ушел, но сказать могу следующее.\n3.а. Подбор кривой, я был в катке 15 ранга, маньяк был 4, и еще пара человек 4-5 ранга. Думаете, интересно мне с ними или им со мной? \n3.б. Ливеры. Чувак может лечь на 20 секунде и ливануть, или маньяк может побегать пару мин, увидеть 1-2 заведенных генератора и ливануть. И им пофигу, им не заблочат лобби, нет никакого \"low priority\", никакого наказания. Народ ждал начала катки до получаса (особенно маньяк) а тут такие дела.\n4. Оптимизация. Очень требовательная игра, погуглите, как люди с хорошими компами роются в файлах игры чтобы руками подправить проблемы с фпс.

The gameplay itself is really fun, and something that never gets old. The amount of different killers, and builds you can run, makes almost every match feel different in some way. There are some problems though, like the ranking system, you can easily get in a match with someone way higher rank than you, or people with a rank way lower than you. This can make for some frustating matches, and there will also be some bugs sometimes, or lag. That means it can be very easy to dislike this game, but i still  love to play it, so i leave a positive review.","timestamp_created":1558713637,"timestamp_updated":1571491458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50804137","author":{"steamid":"76561198242938812","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":34643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":196,"playtime_at_review":23883,"last_played":1660499255},"language":"schinese","review":"管管外挂吧，现在已经猖獗到飞天遁地了","timestamp_created":1558711093,"timestamp_updated":1584202912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":70,"votes_funny":39,"weighted_vote_score":"0.644704282283782959","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50803854","author":{"steamid":"76561198822123605","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":47278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29351,"last_played":1608431810},"language":"russian","review":"норм игра но лаги баги","timestamp_created":1558710122,"timestamp_updated":1558710122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495054394006729126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50803476","author":{"steamid":"76561198864262294","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1650646523},"language":"english","review":"When gamers watch youtube and see dead by daylight videos : \"360s is really awesome to be watched if the killer fail hit you.\".

What I want you guys to know Dead by daylight is this game is really a game that gives you mind game. It requires mind, strategy, and assumption (if you guys already above 600 hours).
