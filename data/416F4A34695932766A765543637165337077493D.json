I have never seen a dev team change so much shit that nobody asks for.\n\nup until patch 6.1.0 the game had a really long and tedious grind that took me nearly two thousand hours to unlock all of the survivor perks which before allowed you to then find the perk in another characters bloodweb which took even more playtime to get the perks I wanted on other characters I wanted to play. It took me over 4000 hours to get every survivor prestige 3 level 50 prior to 6.1.0 which reduced the grind by 75%. The reason i'm bringing this up is because of the horrible reward BHVR decided to give us for spending countless hours getting our characters to prestige 3. The reward is a \"Legacy Character Portrait\" which is a little effect that plays over your characters portrait in the menu. The reason I say that the reward is bad is because not only am I the only one that can see the reward, but its not even remotely as good of a reward to those who played back in 2016 and received legacy cosmetics for the original characters. Thats not me saying that I think BHVR should give us legacy either because I don't, that wouldn't be fair to those who had a way worse grind back in 2016. What i'm saying is that we should've at least have been given something that we can show to others, didn't have to be a cosmetic, but it could've been something better than a character portrait that only the person who earned it can see. \n\n#RevertDBDMovement -  new survivor animations suck ass compared to the old ones\n#FreeBilly - why was billy nerfed so hard? all he needed was a few add-on changes not an overheat mechanic and most of his add-ons reworked/changed\n\nget your shit together BHVR\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIO1g97S2x8&ab_channel=br0nze4life","timestamp_created":1602538232,"timestamp_updated":1656578166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548703312873840332","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77468375","author":{"steamid":"76561198849557351","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":11866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1309,"last_played":1658976456},"language":"russian","review":"Запуская впервые игру не думал что затянет надолго но был не прав.

But there are many things I have to mention, that have been going in the wrong direction in my opinion. \n\n[b]\nRanking system\n[/b]\nIn the early days  getting to red ranks or rank 1 even (the highest rank you can achieve) was a mile stone and an accomplishment. Through the years the devs added additional scoring events that contribute towards your game score, which establishes if u rank up, rank down or mentain your rank. This has lead to point, where, if u have played enough in a season (13th to 13th) there is nothing keeping u from reaching red ranks or even rank 1, Which means no matter how good you are, you can't rank better than 1 and are matched with people, who have a couple hundred hours or even less. If u have played this game long enough: There is nothing more frustration than watching inexperienced survivors throwing valuable pallets after getting hit, which is one of the single greatest mistake u can do in this game. You could consider pallets, which, if survivors use them wisly, gain them time in order to do the 5 gens necessary to escape. The only time this ranking doesn't suck, is, when u play with your swf buddies, where you do the ranking for the game and most of the time it is not balanced.\n\n[b]\nBalancing\n[/b]\n\nThe game has been out for 4 years + and since then some features got a change, whereas others did not. \n[list]\n[*] Most notably keys. The problem I have with keys, is even though survivors only manage to do 3 out of 5 gens and the killer dominates them, the last 2 can escape through the hatch, without needing to do anything in the game. \n[*] A different topic are Moris (which did get changed once if im not mistaken). The ability to get one out of the game early is huge for the killer in order to win and way too powerful and yet they leave it as it is.\n[*] Another point is map offerings. Some maps like Ormond or Coldwind Farm are often chosen by survivors obviously, because these maps definately favour them. The same goes for killer. \n[*] there are many very underwhealming / beginner perks and only a few considerable perks on killer and survivor\n[/list]\n\nThe actors should never have the possibility to choose whether they go to a map that gives them an adventage over the other side without it heavily being accounted for in the ranking system. \n\n [b]\nProgramming\n[/b]\n\nAll I am asking for a game like this is \"IT BEING CONSISTANT\". A few examples:\n\n[list]\n[*] being hit through windows that normally would not have hit if it wasn't for the killers high ping \n[*] getting stuck on stairs when hugging the wall for no apparent reason (invisable struckture that stands out and u get stuck on, i assume)\n[*] getting matched with survivors, who in theory know what to do and use their brain in chases at least to the slimmest extent\n[*] grabing survivors from gens / lockers / totems fail, because of latency (I wonder how other games cope with latency issues like this)\n[*] Survivor lobbies crash multiple times per hour because of an \"Unknown Error\", which apparently is known enough to be unknown \n[*] billy chainsaw stops before hitting a survivor (phantom billy chainsaw hit). Exists since 2016 if im not mistaken\n[*] huntress' axes sometimes pass you and hit you and sometimes they go straight through you and don't hit \n[*] hutress' hitboxes being cylindrical whereas deathslinger's is almost perfectly shaped\n[/list] \n\n [b]\nGraphic Update\n[/b]\n\nTo top it of, instead of fixing all those issues, they decide to rework the maps graphicly, which, don't get me wrong, I appreciate, but tbh, the reworked Yamaoka maps don't really look that great compared to the reworked Preschool maps. I am under the impression that this \"grafic update\" is rather an attempt to solve fps / performance issues on console and sell it as a grafical update. \n\nTo conclude this, I rather have a new chapter every 4 or 5, hell even 6 months if the other, in my opinion, more relevant issues get adressed and fixed.","timestamp_created":1602533472,"timestamp_updated":1602533472,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515751242637634277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77466005","author":{"steamid":"76561198165310601","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":22790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":499,"playtime_at_review":21939,"last_played":1660317593},"language":"koreana","review":"great
