I've played 600+ hours and mostly play survivor with some killer sprinkled in. This game has a multitude of flaws at its current state, the biggest being the toxic community behind the game. In all fairness, you will meet some great people on this game but unfortunately they are few and far between. These are the main things that grind my gears:\n\n- [b]Gameplay is extremely toxic[/b], consisting of survivors being forced to learn a \"looping\" (running around pallets again and again to stay safe) style of surviving simply because being stealthy is extremely hard against decent killers or made impossible by perks that killers can use. Killers feel forced into camping or tunneling survivors because generators are done way too quickly most of the time. This makes playing as a killer monotonous, stale as a survivor. The \"scare factor\" goes away after a couple games and survivors become a lot more brave while being chased or being altruistic.\n\n- [b]Doesn't feel \"fair\" to play[/b], both as survivor and killer. I find most games are very one sided, with map design being terrible or items/addons/perks running a game. Some maps are incredibly killer sided, others are survivor sided. I like the variety in gameplay but it's awfully balanced. You can be matched with terrible teammates because of how easy it is to rank or you can be a very LOW rank, new killer vs'ing survivors with full perks and many hours invested. Killers have multiple ways to insta-down survivors and can bring in momento-mori's to kill survivors after a hook which is not a fun mechanic to play against. Survivors have just gotten more perks for looping with Kate and can still run killers around for extended periods of time which does not feel fair as a killer.\nI remember watching a video of the community manager saying that it's a game where you can't please both parties (killer and survivors) and gave an example of a killer doing well and survivors being upset and vice versa. To some extent this is true, but it feels like a game design flaw.\n\n- [strike][b]Peer-to-peer hosting[/b], meaning you will run into lag spikes, random disconnects or just plain lag switchers or cheaters. Just now I went against a killer who played against before, reported multiple times, has multiple comments on his profile about using lag switch or cheats and even a video linking very obvious evidence of this yet he's still playing weeks later.[/strike]\n\n- [b]Perk imbalance[/b], some perks are completely rubbish and others are ridiculously strong. For example, there is a perk called \"No Mither\", letting you pick yourself back up off the ground after being downed but you are constantly injured throughout the game and cannot be healed to healthy. You will almost NEVER get to use the benefit of this perk because killers know you are using it and know to hook you straight away. Another perk called \"Self-care\" lets you heal yourself without the need of other survivors. I know which one I'm picking.\n\n- [b]Lobby Simulator[/b] A lot of the time you will find yourself re-queueing as survivor to find a new lobby because the one you have found has +300ms. You will eventually find a lobby with decent connection and the killer will leave because there are too many items in the survivors hands, sees a SWF (survive with friends) group or sees too many prestiged players. You can get anti-cheated as well, getting booted the game menu for no apparent reason. And then to top it off, people DC or leave as the game begins or simply don't connect to the game, making it a 3 survivor 1 killer game, which is much harder for survivors.\n\n- [b]Rank System[/b] is terrible in this game. It is extremely easy to rank up and it feels punishing ranking up because again, lobbies take longer to find and when you find one it sometimes has ms in the hundreds or survivors with ms in the hundreds.\n\nTL;DR - the game is actually quite a lot of fun to play when things run smoothly and you have a \"fair\" match, which is unfortunately rare.","timestamp_created":1532437270,"timestamp_updated":1583198088,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":66,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586991786956787109","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43715748","author":{"steamid":"76561198136376565","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2451,"last_played":1653360521},"language":"tchinese","review":"低分段沒水準的玩家偏多，常有拔線、面對面守屍等等破壞遊戲體驗的行為，希望可以對時常拔線的用戶有逞罰機制，常常白白浪費祭品。","timestamp_created":1532436620,"timestamp_updated":1532436620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43715347","author":{"steamid":"76561198054492211","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3586,"last_played":1614843966},"language":"russian","review":"ИГРА

I just started playing the game again after playing at launch (2 years lol) and noticed so many changes.  I also encountered various people that insulted me after playing so take that however you want. It's fun to be both the killer and a survivor as each has their own fun playstyles.  I will say though, the killer will almost have no advantage to the game whatsoever.  Winning as a killer takes strategic thinking and luck. Same with the survivors.  As a killer, It really only comes down to whether the survivors make mistakes. The best killer with the best perks going against the best survivors in the game with the best perks will almost always have the disadvantage. With all that said, this game is really fun and I'll keep on playing with friends. If you do pick up this game:\n\n1. Don't insult anyone or teabag the killer. It's pretty childish and it's not fun to get teased and insulted and it deters new players from buying the game and bringing in more players.\n2. Try not to camp: it prevents the survivor from actually playing the game and them from getting any points from the game. It's not fun to just watch someone die on a hook and honestly isn't viable since generators can be primed during that whole period\n3.Don't tunnel (targeting one person the whole game), if they are recently unhooked, it is understandable to go after them but if there are others in the way attack them first. It makes the game a whole lot more fun that way and gives others a chance to play (this point can go both ways)\n4. Learning curve can be quite steep, especially when seasons are reset since high level players will also be at the starting rank.\n5. If someone insults you, try not to lash back at them. It honestly just feeds them and I just laugh and tell them to have a good day. Kill'em with kindness :D\n\nTL;DR\n\nFun game that can be even better with a full lobby of friends as both killer and survivors.  Community can be quite harsh and if you play killer, expect some games to be challenging and frustrating at times. Don't be toxic or feed the toxic community, It deters new players from joining a great game.  Let people play the game instead of being a hardcore camper or going after a single person for an entire period.

Daylight》中文名《黎明杀机》，下面整理游戏内所遇到的问题：\n\n1、游戏初始游戏化失败问题，该问题至今官方未提供明确的解决方案，现解决方案只有不断点击“按任意键继续”来碰运气，极度影响玩家体验。\n\n2、游戏近期更新问题，多次的地图结构、强化屠夫技能，毫无考虑人类玩家在游戏中的生存立场，最新一次更新内容中显示“夹子”屠夫，捕兽夹将会自动布置，并且人类在健康状态下触发或拆解捕兽夹都会直接进入受伤状态，我实在不能理解这个更改举动，试想以后，或许你可以在游戏中看到一颗“树上挂着“人类，树下一堆布置好的捕兽夹，而队友无法着手营救，或是以后你会感受到，在快速移动状态中突然踩到一个未经屠夫布置而自动布置上的夹子的喜悦，再例如：封窗夹、无敌点夹等等位置，遐想留给各位。\n\n3、游戏外挂问题，至今该游戏对反外挂一直都没有正视，或许我可以理解成，因为没有自家的服务器导致了现在这种情况，所以现有的唯一解决方法是游戏中录制视频上传官网，致使现在游戏内透视挂、加速挂成批成群，玩家还举报无路。\n\n4、游戏刷血点问题，我时常能在游戏中遇到顶配的萌新，两个超级稀有配件外加一个超级稀有祭品，“OK，偶然而已”，那么我时常遇到同ID玩家顶配是为什么，我直言”把把高配 局局处决 真刺激“。\n\n5、这个是题外话，我不明白是官方不曾关注过中国玩家还是如何，上述问题在很多论坛、微博上都有人发声出来讲，但一直都没有得到过相关人员的回复，是漠视还是不懂中文还是市场的呼声你们不需要？\n\n三国无双8因为不兼备中文补丁的原因差评连连，后续因为发行了中文补丁而好评如潮，销量也因此翻了几番。玩家是游戏的直接参与者，也是游戏走得更远的基石，希望该游戏也能站在玩家角度多去做思考。第一条评论and第一个差评都献给这款游戏，只希望游戏能做更好所以写下该评价。","timestamp_created":1532411726,"timestamp_updated":1532411726,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":58,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736724317073822021","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43710759","author":{"steamid":"76561198263116680","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":57962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":168,"playtime_at_review":10516,"last_played":1660168589},"language":"english","review":"The

Though I highly recommend the game, I've had a blast with it since a little after it came out, and I still have some fun with it today. Though, I have several problems with it. First, the survivor team is grossly overpowered. While it's true, it is easy for a killer to just clean shop on a team, if the survivor knows what they're doing, it's impossible to catch them. Thankfully, with the recent nerfs on sprint burst, decisive strike, and self care, the survivors will have a slightly harder time, the problem lies in the map layouts. Over half the maps available are extremely tilted towards the survivors. There's easy pallet looping, window looping as well, though it's not as prevalent thanks to the window rework, and of course there's the bodyblocking and etc. Lots of people will say that \"You're just a bad killer\" but look at my time, I have 186 hours in this game, and this still gets me. This is not a question of skill, this is a matter of a game being purely tilted.\nSpeaking of tilted...\nOh my god, I've never seen a more toxic community. And I play Dark Souls. \nIf you win, you're a cheater, or someone who abuses the game. If you lose, your unskilled and don't deserve to play. The days of seeing \"Gg\" in the post-game chat have ended, now I end the game and type \"Gg\" and I'llI get in response is \"No.\" \"Kill yourself\" and my personal favourite \"I'm gonna rape your girlfriend\"\nLong review aside, this game is for a select number of people. It's hard, the community is unforgiving, and it requires a huge amount of dedication to even begin to have a chance at the game. But, if this sounds like something that you'll enjoy, get it. Because despite all of this, I still love this game. Most of the time, anyway.","timestamp_created":1532386780,"timestamp_updated":1532386780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525691688060760498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43706686","author":{"steamid":"76561198073755983","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1566,"last_played":1571551243},"language":"english","review":"Its good.

However, the things i mentioned above is just a  thing of balance for me and is quite minor when starting off, what I really dislike is all the problems with menus, booting and exiting. This game has been out for 2 years and still has great problems, you'd think they would at least dedicate enough time to the menus so it won't crash. Several times when booting it has taken 2 minutes the even see the selection-screen while it usually takes like 30secs from clicking the icon on my desktop. Just before writing this review I had a bug where it took a long time to load my character in the bloodweb-screen, also the \"join a lobby\"-button the after that match did not appear at all and I culdn't see my bloonpoints, AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH! I couldn't even get the Esc-menu to appear so I had to exit the game with Alt+F4, then when I tried to start the game again it just said that the game was already running which means it didn't even close correctly so I had to use the taskmanager to exit both the backgroundservices for the game and it's anti-cheatengine separately befoe I could start it again.\n\nGreat game but everything around the In-game itself has too many problems for me to recommend this game\n\nEDIT: The menu also ques up the command when it takes extra long time to load so that when it finally loads the for example Esc-key presses the \"Exit game?\"-popup will keep popping up when closing it for every time you pressed it.\n\nEDIT 2: I now realise that when I couldn't see my bloodpoints they were still consumed when I bought thing in the bloodweb, however my progress in the web didn't save\n\nEDIT 3: The problem described from \"EDIT 1\" also happens when searching for a game as survivor and the killer leavs just as you join\n\nEDIT 4: (A few weeks later just at the time of a new event) Seem like they cannot even update the game without having serverproblems for SEVERAL HOURS. The menu also messed up this time the one time i actually managed to get past the connectionscreen\n\nEDIT 5: (Like 2 months after the initial review) Just had a game as the Pig where 2 survivors ran out through the exitgate with reverse beartraps on them and escaped the match, only one survivor had deadhard (I think deadhard isn't supposed to work anymore), this severe bug made me lose my match (not a big deal for me that I lost a match but I will not be able to rely on pig as a killer before they patch this severe bug. My hypothesis is that the survivors ran around the pillars, don't know if this is map specific or works on all maps.","timestamp_created":1532361442,"timestamp_updated":1534956434,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43700525","author":{"steamid":"76561198330006927","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32896,"last_played":1631489502},"language":"thai","review":"ควยบัคเยอะยังเสือกเล่นไม่ได้อีกสัดเอ้ย","timestamp_created":1532360902,"timestamp_updated":1532360902,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43700507","author":{"steamid":"76561198849301039","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1544,"last_played":1556461767},"language":"english","review":"the
