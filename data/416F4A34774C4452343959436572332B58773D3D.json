The experience getting into a game is terrible. \n\nThe premise is very interesting and engaging, and the execution is fairly good. The gameplay is addicting, the progression is solid, and the ranking system is also functional. The only in-game problem is the unit collision, which is so bad that at times you can get kicked with anti-hack if you keep running into another player. It is as if the player interaction box is an invisible sea urchin. The cosmetics for characters also could use some more variation. Aside from that it is great.\n\nIts getting into the game which is the problem. The matchmaking is broken. Finding a game can take upwards of 30 minutes and when you and your friends are required to 'ready up' each 10 seconds to continue searching for a game, it can be extremely frustrating. Currently (Aug 2016), it is at times impossible to get into a game. The queue is non-functional, and you have to re-enter the queue to find a game roughly each 6 seconds. So I do not currently recommend buying the game, as even though the game is good, as in a 7 to 9 out of 10, you will hardly ever be able to get into a game, dragging it down to a 4 or 5 out of 10. \n\nThe settings menu also leaves much to be desired, with only the absolute minimum of settings being available to the user.","timestamp_created":1472239947,"timestamp_updated":1472239947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25167600","author":{"steamid":"76561198065907178","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":38831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":367,"playtime_at_review":1985,"last_played":1660487644},"language":"czech","review":"Načítací simulátor 2016. 9/11\n                         5/7 \n                         9/13","timestamp_created":1472239809,"timestamp_updated":1472239809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521912336349487305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25167313","author":{"steamid":"76561197973122575","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":6263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1885,"last_played":1601629153},"language":"thai","review":"โดยรวมแล้วสนุกตื้นเต้น แต่เข้าเกมยากไปหน่อยสำหรับผู้รอดชีวิตส่วนฆาตกรไม่มีปัญหา บัคจุกจิกมองข้ามได้ ให้คะแนน 8/10","timestamp_created":1472238791,"timestamp_updated":1472238791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25167265","author":{"steamid":"76561198063808122","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1658480112},"language":"english","review":"Match not found simulator 2016","timestamp_created":1472238647,"timestamp_updated":1472238647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25167018","author":{"steamid":"76561198159148906","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":44547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1746,"last_played":1651945519},"language":"russian","review":"игра шикарная , геймплей зашкаливает , графика отличная , и тематика годная , но жалко что пока что нет полной оптимизации, а так все прекрасно !! советую всем!","timestamp_created":1472237690,"timestamp_updated":1472237690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25166824","author":{"steamid":"76561198111304839","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1480925004},"language":"english","review":"This game is horrible the latency on every little thing you do as a survivor.

the best multiplayer horror game available. Think Left for Dead meets Hide and Seek.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. It's relatively bug free IN-GAME and has the potential for longevity not often seen by similar titles of the same genre. The concept at first seems very simple, but it's the progression that makes each game different. Perks, items and offerings (Once time use bonuses) make every game a unique and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe main issue with the game is without a doubt, the absolutely broken matchmaking. Make sure you are willing to press \"ready up\" every 10 seconds because the game searches and then stops constantly. Seems like a minor issue at first, but if you aren't patient it gets old fast.\n\nBut if you can get past the few matchmaking issues the actual game itself is fun. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play a horror game that has multiplayer and longevity.","timestamp_created":1472231584,"timestamp_updated":1472233315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505353331565856934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25165253","author":{"steamid":"76561198156491442","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3872,"last_played":1569056339},"language":"danish","review":"模式太单一，会玩的人类优势太大，优化不好。恐怖氛围倒是还行。不过升级起来太累了，打段位更是累上加累","timestamp_created":1472231097,"timestamp_updated":1472231097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25165168","author":{"steamid":"76561198113409394","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1514112776},"language":"russian","review":"ноенркпкеперенрне","timestamp_created":1472230763,"timestamp_updated":1472230763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25165037","author":{"steamid":"76561198072768670","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1348,"last_played":1637002832},"language":"english","review":"Really fun game.
