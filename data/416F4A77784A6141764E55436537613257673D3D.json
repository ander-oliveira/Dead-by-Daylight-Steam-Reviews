In \"Kill your friends\" mode you won't level up the killer or survivors, but it allows you and your friends to explore and learn the game while being suitably scared. \n\nYou do not need five friends to play the game in Kill your friends mode but someone needs to be the killer and the game will be very tricky with just one surviver. Ideally you want five people but can probably get away with four, three at a push.\n\nDon't have four friends? You can play the ranked mode \"Survive with your friends\". In this mode you can level up your survivors, queuing with up to four people (you and three friends) as survivors. The killer will be a random person from the queue. You do not need the full four people. Even if you queue with only two people the other two slots will be filled by another two people looking to play.\n\nMy only real complaint about the game is the lack of explanation in game. The game does, or at least used to have, tutorial videos that walk you through the game's bascis with a few advance tips. However the leveling system, various mechanics and equipment is not explained and you'll need to look it up yourself or ask in the in game lobby, though you only usually sit in the lobby for a min or two. \n\nAll in all quite a fun game to play, especially with friends. \n\nBit scary.","timestamp_created":1466623289,"timestamp_updated":1496468651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23712056","author":{"steamid":"76561198050122764","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":192287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66664,"last_played":1634335702},"language":"english","review":"Previously i had a very negative review about DBD. Seeing how things changed, I decided to rewrite my review.\n\nWell, to start with, Developers are showing more and more care about their game. Previously there were many things like exploits and the good ol' perk copying, now instead you get better gameplay. After a long time they also implemented a ping meter too. Needless to say, Dead By Daylight is in well hands and it will improve.\n\nGameplay is pretty much what it looks like. You got 4 survivors trying to haul their bottoms out of the map, while there is a killer trying to get rid of them. Each killer has their own method of hunting so it's up to the player when it comes to learning what to do. Lots of perks, lots of items, addons, and a big grindy bloodweb to gain them all.\n\nOnly thing that will not change is the fact that both sides are trying their best to win, so there is always an innate toxicity.

If they improved quality of life bugs and balanced their game to a point where it is fair for both sides, i would say this is a solid game. But that is unfortunately not the case. Ive had this game since beta, and i stopped playing for a long time due to all of the issues present in this game. Ive come back as of recently, and as it is better it is still not quite at a enjoyable playability yet.\n\nexamples of bugs and problems that havent been fixed since i played long ago:\n-when being placed into a game, if a survivor or the killer leaves there is a high chance to be sent into an infinite loading screen, and if you force quit your game you lose any items or offerings you equipped for the trial.\n-Joining matches with friends is poorly executed, more often than not you get booted back to the main menu screen once matchmaking has started.\n-Killer and survivor hitboxes are not well made, killers can reach way too far and survivors have little chances to escape uless equipped with good end-game perks.\n-certain killers (EX. Doctor, Michael Myers, Huntress) with end game perks are unstoppable, giving the illusion of walls or cheats due to their overpoweredness.\n-Survivors can have equally overpowered perks, making games as killer hard or impossible.\n-Game still runs like garbage, My computer is an average computer capable of running many performance demading games, but i still only get 60 frames on low settings. (Its a unity game, with a decent sized team behind it, cant anything be done to make it run a little smoother?)\n\n\nOverall, unless you have friends who play the game or are going to start with you, do not buy this game. It is awful to play on your own, and your money could be spent elsewhere for a much better game. but its still kinda fun so get it on sale.","timestamp_created":1466619410,"timestamp_updated":1543200381,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23710631","author":{"steamid":"76561198109016300","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1468733323},"language":"schinese","review":"-成吨的BUG（无处不在！）\n-不能组队（乐趣减半！） \n-没有强行退出游戏的惩罚措施，同样 受害的同战局其他玩家没有被保护，依然会掉段位（十分恶心！）\n-游戏不能全屏，设置里的全屏是假的，实际是无边框窗口，导致远超其画面应有的性能损耗\n- 居然是本地存档。。。然后可以使用修改器修改等级和技能\n-没有语音系统\n-预购奖励都是骗人的\n\n总结：虽然游戏本身很有意思，但感觉是个半成品，真的是半成品！所以建议等后续版本更新修复完善后再购买","timestamp_created":1466618571,"timestamp_updated":1466678016,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23710596","author":{"steamid":"76561197995184037","num_games_owned":1145,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1527203172},"language":"english","review":"While the game has it's issues, it is still wicked fun with friends.

Being an animal is very rewarding, and the archtypes do balence out over time to provide good experinces.

(Manic parts of the machine has turned off in advance). Last detail - gasoline. That is, if there will be one guy - he can leave quietly without gasoline. You might also add a new serial killer, but he had no idea specifically. The map may present itself a house with a basement, a garage which may be, den maniac forest. I think you should get something good.\nApologies for the translation: on Google Translate helped me with it.\n\nИдея такая: новый режим. (заодно и новые карты)\nВыживающие застряли в лесу у своего домика ночного или просто в палатках. Они приехали в этот лес на машине. Им надо найти детали спрятаные по карте. (маньяк детали от машины заблаговременно открутил). Последняя деталь - бензин. То есть, если останеться один парень - он сможет уехать без бензина спокойно. Можно заодно добавить нового маньяка, но тут идея особо не было. На карте может присутствовать сам дом с подвалом, гараж какой ни будь, логово маньяка, лес. Мне кажется должно получится что-то хорошее.","timestamp_created":1466615749,"timestamp_updated":1466615749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505102038383483887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23709638","author":{"steamid":"76561198151727558","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1989,"last_played":1561992622},"language":"english","review":"Game is super fun, and something I've wanted for a long time.

It had so many amazing features and looked like it was a solid buy. Then I bought the game, and tried playing it. I was disappointed that there was no AI system to allow for Single-Player, but I figured that wouldn't be too much of an issue. I was expecting to not be very good during the few first games, but what I didn't expect was the upgrade tiers that make it so new players cannot do anything. Not to mention the Game Breaking bugs and connectivity issues. I understand that it is still in a \"Beta\" stage, but it has features that make it so new players can hardly win at all when on a Public Server.\nIf you plan on getting this game, make sure you have a group of friends to play it with on a Private server.\n\nEDIT: Coming back two years later, there have been some major changes for the better. The gameplay is far more balanced for newer players, as you can no longer get tier 5 killers in groups of tier 20 survivors, and vice versa. Having exited beta, it is still rather buggy, but many of the main disconnection issues have been fixed or alleviated. Still multiplayer only, but now it allows you to invite friends to survive with you and still gives blood points (in-game currency). The change in the Ranking System is confusing, with the Altruism Catagory completely broken as it robs a player of all points when ANY survivor gets hooked, and does not refund them. Things are definately better now though, and I now feel comfortable recommending this game.","timestamp_created":1466612777,"timestamp_updated":1524171587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23708761","author":{"steamid":"76561198010213935","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1182,"playtime_at_review":2709,"last_played":1660570298},"language":"english","review":"Be a rage quitter and you will be the highest ranker of all.\n","timestamp_created":1466612385,"timestamp_updated":1466612385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23708639","author":{"steamid":"76561198156324310","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":23437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2455,"last_played":1657750770},"language":"russian","review":"Я похож на трапера","timestamp_created":1466611978,"timestamp_updated":1497901355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439116716384887695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23708603","author":{"steamid":"76561198082877309","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1495299309},"language":"english","review":"WELL MET GUYS!
