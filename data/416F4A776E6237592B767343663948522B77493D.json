main gripes:\n1. The gameplay loop is dull and lacking. All you're ever gonna do is repair generators, or defend generators, with secondary fluff inbetween. I'd really like to see some other game modes, but after 5 years of no innovation I doubt I ever will.\n2. Most of the characters are mute. I get that for survivors it's a stealth thing, but the dialogue wheel would've still been a nice way to flesh out characters. The game lacks personality badly, what's the point of all these brand names if you're not gonna let them speak? And there's no reason for killers not to have taunts. So much wasted roleplay potential. You'll never \"you can run but you can't hide!\" in this game.\n3. Due to the nature of the game any slasher movie atmosphere potential that might've is wasted and tainted by gamification. The killer is disrespected like crazy, ran around in infinite loops (they really are infinite by definition) and generally isn't being avoided by skilled players. It looks a lot like Saturday cartoon with poor villain getting dunked on with pallets, blinded by flashlights, stunned by locker doors, etc. I swear, any day now they'll add survivor perk that lets you punch the killer in the honker directly.\nAt least Ghostface feels right at home given how inadequate he's portrayed in the movie.\n4. Rampant cheating at mid to high ranks. Apparently \"Easy\" in Easy Anti-Cheat stands for  \"easy to bypass\".\n\nNow the pros:\n1. Tons of licensed characters and maps, from Silent Hill's infamous school to Resident Evil's Raccon City police station, from Ash Williams to Michael Myers. It's a dream team.

If you can push past that you will probably enjoy this game quite a bit, it has a lot of replayability.","timestamp_created":1631921155,"timestamp_updated":1631921155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99527415","author":{"steamid":"76561198013865126","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":149,"playtime_at_review":12624,"last_played":1660407613},"language":"english","review":"SBMM","timestamp_created":1631920980,"timestamp_updated":1631920980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551209449768066406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99527401","author":{"steamid":"76561199180608096","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1646257098},"language":"brazilian","review":"Já fiquei bem puto com os try hards, mas mesmo assim é um otimo jogo e bem emocionante","timestamp_created":1631920944,"timestamp_updated":1645895470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99527314","author":{"steamid":"76561198135650634","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":27721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":186,"playtime_at_review":3072,"last_played":1660524611},"language":"english","review":"This game is a ton of fun to play with friends! Just don't mind the randos in the post-game chat who will try to make you feel bad for how you played, whether you played Killer or Survivor. It's a fast paced game where the controls take quite a long time to learn, so it's a little hard at the beginning (and by that, I mean the first 100 hours at least LOL), but the satisfaction of pulling off sick escapes from killers or ingeniously taking down multiple survivors is unparalleled across all the games I've ever played before. Definitely recommend, best enjoyed if you have friends to play with!!\n\n(Also, special mention to the skin designs for the killers. I have yet to see a skin on any killer that I thought was visually unappealing. Like wow, the design team is really talented and the outfits for the characters are top-notch!!

No matter if you'd played a lot or a little there'd always be a chance to have fun. You could play the best/meta builds in the game or you could put a fun/meme build for a fun/drunk night to just do whatever.\n\nWith SBMM you get locked into playing against the people that are at the peak of your skill level. That means you have games that give you the maximum challenge every time and thus you are encouraged to min/max your build to have a chance.\n\nI have lost all encouragement to play meme builds, where I had the most fun, because now I get destroyed 10/10 games. Sure, I can still put my best build and win but narrowing in on those few sweaty builds was never what this game was about for me.\n\nI have had a lot of fun with DBD but I just don't see this viable anymore and DBD is becoming a truly competive/sweaty game. Thus DBD is no longer a \"fun game\" for me.\n\nBy all means, I do love the competitive games as well but when DBD enters into this domain, it goes up against some pretty heavy competition in DOTA, Valorant, CSGO, LOL etc. For me, in this domain, it simply doesn't hold up.\n\nTLDR:\nI have LOVED DBD and it used to be the best chill/fun game out there. But with SBMM it's trying to become a truly competitive game which moves it to the league of DOTA, Valorant, CSGO etc. And there it fails spectacularly.","timestamp_created":1631919776,"timestamp_updated":1631928904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99526718","author":{"steamid":"76561199065388256","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1824,"last_played":1649204612},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo bem feito que tem um dos meus monstrinhos preferidos de Stranger Things o Demogorgon a coisa que eu não gostei é que ele não tem muitas skins legais e infelizmente ele n estará mais disponível para a compra por conta que terminou a parceria com Stranger Things.

Bugs and Glitches make the nurse(a killer in the game) unplayable (still not fixed after years). Maps are getting disabled on a regular basis and the new Killers get mechanics that are best described with \"Just run and press m2\". The Game was one of my favorites and it is very sad to see how it is developing. The Game was never ment to be competetiv and your only goal should be to have fun, but you start to lose the feeling of enjoing the game if you have no chance of doing anything because you are getting bugs over bugs and the only thing the devs are doing is pumping out new skins and killers that are \"fun\" for five minutes and that you notice that there is another bug. (For example that you bought a nice skin but the game isn`t showing skins to other people anymore.)\nTwo years ago I would have recomeded that game to you with a 9 out of 10 but today I have to give it a 2/10 because ist isn`t playable anymore. Spirit has more \"fun\" \"counterplay\" than Nemesis. Your oponents are carring there internet with buckets and overall the design of the game is drifting more and more into a comic game rather that a horro game.

Hra mě bavila už od začátku, protože šlo vidět, že se o hru vývojáři starali. Gameplayově to bylo něco do té doby unikátního a zaujalo mně to natolik, že jsem hrával hodně často a i přesto že v té době byla konkurenční hra The Friday 13th, tak se to nemohlo DBD vyrovnat. Komunita byla převážně normální a i proto bylo DBD lepší v tomhle ohledu oproti konkurenci. Ale jak dny týdny a měsíce plynuly, tak se z mé oblíbené hry stala noční můra, kterou vývojáři završili přidáním nového systému SBM nebo-li MMR. To je jeden z důvodů proč již nehraji. Už několik měsíců zpět od vydání jisté aktualizace, která začala přidávat do hry reshade textury s více polygony se z toho stávala velice problematická hra z důvodů velmi špatné optimalizace a i na High-End PC a ultimátními grafickými kartami(RTX 2070) máte kolikrát problém dosáhnout stabilních FPS a místy s neuvěřitelnými FPS dropy. A vzhledem k tomu že DBD nemá již konkurenci, tak se vývojáři nemusí starat o \"spokojenost zákazníka\", ale mohou si dělat co chtějí bez ohledu na výsledek. K čemuž vyústil již zmíněný SBM systém, který nikdo nechtěl a oo kterém každý věděl že nebude fungovat a hlavně na vyšším SBM nemá za killera nejmenší šanci a za surva to je pravidelný tunnel a camp. Čili jediného čeho vývojáři dosáhli je zvýšení toxicity ve hře. Další \n\n<---Negativa--->\n- Přidání SBM/MMR systému do hry, který implementovaly do veřejné hry, namísto, aby to přidali jako samostatný mód.\n- Zvýšení toxicity ve hře kvůli SBM/MMR\n- Špatná optimalizace\n- Vysoké nároky i když je officální minimum úplně někde jinde\n- Dedikované servery\n- Hit Validation\n- Zneužívání vysoké latence za killera\n- Rollback, který evidentně funguje u všech jenom ne u mně\n- Nevybalancovaný matchmaking\n- Map design\n- Dlouhé fronty za killera\n- Hodně hráčů s baby egem\n- Špatná odezva\n- Nulová odezva od vývojářů\n- Arogantní chování vývojářů, které završili právě přidáním nového SBM/MMR o kterém neudali absolutně žádné informace jak funguje a tím vlastně porušili pravidla o koncovém uživateli.\n- Bugy, kde některé jsou vážně gamebreaking a  i po několika letech to nejsou schopni opravit jako je např.: sound bug, kdy slugnutý survík nevydává žádný zvuk na zemi.\n\n<---Pozitiva--->\n- Cena\n- Grafika\n\n<---Shrnutí--->\nDBD byla kdysi velmi pěkná a hratelná hra s normální komunitou a aktivním zpětnou vazbou s vývojáři. Ale bohužel posledních několik měsíců to bylo čím dál tím horší až to završili SBM/MMR o kterém nevydali žádné detaily a díky jejich aroganci mám pocit, že už jim na hráčích nezáleží ani na kvalitě hry jako takové.
