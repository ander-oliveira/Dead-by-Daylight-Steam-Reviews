Unfortunately plagued by greedy microtransactions, obvious imbalances, and some clunky mechanics.\n\nWas peer pressured into buying this game, and we've played intermittently the past couple years when Halloween comes around. However, after playing some on my own and really seeing what the game has to offer, I cannot recommend the game as a whole.\n\n[b]The good[/b]\nThis game does a lot of things well. The general pace of the game is nice, and it's clear the concept was thought out. Gameplay [i]usually[/i] feels smooth enough, and the game is very graphically pleasing. I love the feeling of dread and while repairing generators and hearing the terror music get louder, shortly followed by a panicked decision making process on whether to hide or run.\n\nMy favorite thing from this game is that almost all your bloodpoints, used for level progression, are based on your personal performance rather than wins/losses. Sure, you can get unlucky in a game and die pretty quickly, but its easy to just hop in another and try again. Overall, concept is cool and there is lots of potential. However...\n\n[b]The bad[/b]\n\nFirst and foremost, the He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named of PC gaming, [b]microtransactions[/b]. And I mean [b]a LOT[/b]. You should not release a game where literally 3/4 of the released characters cannot be unlocked without spending more money on a, excuse the emphasis, [b]PAID!!!![/b] game. This is obviously a money grab, emphasized more with the incredible imbalance of some killers/survivors/perks.\n\nQuick imbalance example: The Pig.\nAwesome concept for a killer. When she knocks people down, she can put lil face rippers on them, and they have to find the right area to disable it. Except there are multiple unlock places, and only one works. And the timer seems too short to reach them all. And she can crouch to nullify her terror radius. And for some reason she is ridiculously fast.\n[b]In short[/b], I've never even stood a chance against her. And don't even get me started on Ghost-Face (i.e. EZ-Face).\n\nAside from greed and lack of care, the game just falls flat and eventually feels awkward. It's a bit glitchy and laggy at times, the animations and general \"game feel\" are fairly clunky, and hitboxes on survivors are super strange. I could go on, but you get the point. Just don't expect a super polished game. Also, lobby's take a little while to find as survivors and are near impossible to find as the killer. So if being a killer is what excites you most, just go in expecting 7 minute breaks between each of your games while you wait to find a match. But to be fair, this might ease up as your killer rank improves.\n\n[b]In conclusion...[/b]\n[i]Maybe[/i] buy the game on sale if you get the chance. This is a very shaky \"not recommended\" review. I like the core game and will probably keep playing to get my money's worth, but the random glitched issues, player imbalances, and mass amount of locked characters (permanently locked, as far as I'm concerned) mock me just a little too much. Consider this less of a \"this game sucks\" and more of a \"this developer sucks\".","timestamp_created":1570926175,"timestamp_updated":1633308146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483193248510360718","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55576476","author":{"steamid":"76561198099413536","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":857,"last_played":1654267252},"language":"russian","review":"Игра достойная нимания!!

пинг у лобби в которые я захожу от 100-180)\nНу и что это за херня?\n3)Токсичность комьюнити-сейчас токсичность у сурвов идет на сбав,то маны-это еманый ездец-кивания головой,приседания(свинья ,гоуст),когда завалил какого-то сурва,который долго бегал:\"Обоссал лоха,слился на крюке,нуб\" и это при том,что он только за ним и бегал всю игру и когда ман начинает туннелить и кемпить(я не осждаю кемперство и туннелерство((вот насчет туннелеров у меня бомбит,но это уже мое мнение),он сливает сурва и вроде бы все сыграли и сыграли,но эта мразь начинает выебыфатса в чате,о том,какой он очешуительный и как он \"обоссал\"сурва.\n4)Жадность разрабов-я не говорю про длс по фильмам,т.к. они выкупали авторские права и им нужно подзаработать бюджет-я про кастомзацию пресонажей без возможности их покупки за осколки.\nВозьмем к примеру хеллоуинские скины-сейчас они стоят,со скидкой,1010 клеток\n500 клеток-330 рублей-страны СНГ(за англоговорящие страны ничего не говорю)\n140 рублей-РФ(и то,только из-за кипиша,который поднял народ за такие неебические цены на пиксели)\nС среднем выходит:в РФ 280 рублей за скин,в СНГ-660 рублей,в связи с чем напрашивается вопрос-не много ли?\n+их охеренное расставление приоритетов-сделать хороший КАЧЕСТВЕННЫЙ РЕВОРК каких либо проблем,сделать игру болле играбельной и балансной-но,к сожалению,нет-мы лучше новых скинов сделаем и срубим бабла.\n5)НЕЕБИЧЕСКИЙ ПОДБОР РАНГОВ В СОЛО-ЭТО КОГДА ТЫ НА 7 РАНГЕ,А ВСЕ ОСТАЛЬНЫЕ СУРВЫ-ОТ 15 ДО 10(ВООБЩЕ БЕСПОЛЕЗНЫ В ИГРЕ-С НИМИ В ОДНОЙ КОМАНДЕ ИГРАТЬ НЕВОЗМОЖНО)И ЭТО С УЧЕТОМ НЕДАВНЕГО ХОТФИКСА С РАНГАМИ-ОДНИМ СЛОВОМ I THINK WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR.\n\nВ начале 2017 еще можно было наслаждаться ламповостью данной игру,ее оригинальной задумкой,то теперь игра медленно и мучительно умирает-точнее уже умерла:Полное безразличие разрабов к ВИДИМЫМ ПРОБЛЕМАМ(Имбовость некоторых аддонов,баги,ОХУЭТИЛЬНОЕ ПОПАДАНИЕ ПО СУРВУ,КОГДА МАН УЖЕ ЗАКОНЧИЛ ВЫПАД С ОРУЖИЕМ),их жадность,постоянные бесполезные обновления(,где манам дают \"ВКУСНЯШКУ\",а сурвы просто идут в далекий нахyй),лень разрабов(ДЛС С ГОУСТОМ,ГДЕ ОНИ ДАЖЕ КАРТУ И СУРВА НЕ СДЕЛАЛИ,НО 140 РУБЛЕЙ ЗА НЕГО-ЭТО СВЯТОЕ+МАН ГОВН0)\n\nМОЙ ВАМ СОВЕТ-ЕСЛИ ВАМ НЕЧЕГО ПОТРАТИТЬ 500 РУБЛЕЙ,ТО СХОДИТЕ ПОКУШАТЬ,КУПИТЕ СЕБЕ ЛЮБУЮ ДРУГУЮ,НОРМАЛЬНУЮ ИГРУ,ПОТОМУ ЧТО ЗДЕСЬ ВАМ В 2019 ДЕЛАТЬ НЕЧЕГО-ВЫ ПРОСТО ПРИЙДЕТЕ НА СВАЛКУ,ГДЕ БАБЛО ЦЕНИТСЯ БОЛЬШЕ,ЧЕМ ИГРОКИ.\n\nUPD:Я почти всегда играл в соло и практчески всегда сливался-дело не в моем скилле,мана могу бегать долго.\nНо прикол в том,что я всегда обычно падал из-за окна в лачуге и тп к нему.\nЯ ни в коем случае не оскорбляю каких-либо мейнубийц,как вы это делаете в сторону мейнсурввов,,Sauron.\nНи один имба-аддон не контрится на манах,в отлчичии от ЕДИНСТВЕНЫХ ИМБОВЫХ аддонов шприца и порошка у сурвов.\nИ никто здесь не ноет-если бы маны умели играть и не ныли по причине:У НИХ ШПРИИИЦ,У НИХ АДРЕНАЛИН,У НИХ ОСКООООЛОК,то бы таких проблем не было.\nНерф навыков,довольно таки помойное решение,хотя бы по причине того,что я редко припоминаю,что какие-лиюо навыки у манов нерфились-БЕЗЖАЛОСТНЫЙ не в счет-он реально был дизбалансный:НЕРФ ОСКОЛКА,НЕРФ САМОХИЛА часов и тд.\nВот и подумай,кто ноет-маны которые играть не умеют и плачутся разроботчикам при каждом удобном случае или солосурвы,которые указывают на ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО ОХЕРИТЕЛЬНЫЕ ПРОБЛЕМЫ ЗА СУРВА В ОДИНОЧКУ(ТУННЕЛ И КЕМПИНГ Я НЕ БЕРУ ЗА ПРОБЛЕМЫ,ПОТОМУ ЧТО ЭТО ТАКТИКА).\nВот поэтому я и не играю в нее больше-тот же GOLD EXPRESS лучше.\n\nВы не видите проблемы,которые я написал помимо ПАТЧА 3.3.0-НИ СЛОВА ОТ ВАС НЕ БЫЛО СКАЗАНО О БЕЗРАЗЛИЧИИ РАЗРАБОВ\n\nСмотрите шире,господа-это игра уже умерла\n\nUPD 2:Вы меня все окончательно задолбали своим \"Если игра-помойка, то почему ты в неё играешь?!?!?\"Мне надоело всем все объяснять, поэтому пишу здесь -Я НЕ МЕЙНЮ ИГРУ, КАК РАНЬШЕ, А ПРОСТО ИГРАЮ, КОГДА МНЕ СОВСЕМ СКУЧНО И ДЕЛАТЬ

Can it be fun, definitely. Can it be painfully frustrating, definitely. But you know what, that is the game.\n\ncons:\n\nMatchmaking - Once you get to about rank 13 you can start being matched with those as low as rank 1.\n\nSWF Groups - This is the cause of all the toxicity in the game, well that's where it started. The game is designed for solo players, but SWF bypasses that by allowing groups of friends to play over comms. Good groups will drive killers insane and will turn their play style toxic, this then overflows into solo games (because you don't know if you're playing SWF or solo) then survivors hit back with their own toxicity and the cycle begins and remains. It gets worse as you get lower and lower in ranks.\n\npros:\n\nExciting - Your heart will be pounding as you quickly attempt to get that exit gate open or desperately trying to search for the hatch as the killer hunts you down.\n\nAtmosphere - They've done a great job with the maps overall to give them that creepy horror atmosphere.\n\nFun - Overall this is a fun game, whether you're a survivor or killer, yes it can be extremely frustrating sometimes, but it can also be extremely fun other times.","timestamp_created":1570864896,"timestamp_updated":1601755996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55562651","author":{"steamid":"76561198344989630","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10008,"last_played":1649055511},"language":"english","review":"hi","timestamp_created":1570862315,"timestamp_updated":1570862315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48305085301399231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55562443","author":{"steamid":"76561198437521817","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1603,"last_played":1643017765},"language":"english","review":"overall great game, great graphics, the things you need to improve are the many bugs and glitches, other then that i recommend it.","timestamp_created":1570860915,"timestamp_updated":1570860915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55562028","author":{"steamid":"76561198387412210","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":208539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5789,"playtime_at_review":9966,"last_played":1660605011},"language":"koreana","review":"병123신같은 게임","timestamp_created":1570857977,"timestamp_updated":1587653951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508235275745391846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561930","author":{"steamid":"76561198102771083","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":85353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":90,"playtime_at_review":12249,"last_played":1660186323},"language":"english","review":"I woke up one day, and I was in the warm arms of the entity. The entity caressed my face and tucked me into the sweet sweet bloodweb. Until I woke up in a giant wheat field with nothing but loads and loads of wheat. I went looking around and found a shack in the middle of the field, and from there, I heard a bell in the distance. Was it time for church? Am I atoning for my sins? Have I done wrong? No... There was a creature like nothing I have ever seen before... It whacked me with some strange club and I was in pain, I was limping away as the swing of the club boosted me forwards, helping me escape. My heart beat started to calm down and I began to feel safe. I find a lovely friend who says her name is Claudette, I never even saw her until now, she was hidden in a patch of wheat. She blended in like no one I have ever seen before, must be a military veteran or something. She must have been a doctor as she took care of me in a very timely manner and made me feel good as new. She points off to my right where there is some sort of power generator... I look back to ask her what it was and I can't find her, she must have gone to another bush to stay safe. I notice some holes in the side of the generator and I decide to reach my hands in and find some buttons and parts. I start jostling them and the generator starts to move, the engines start to fire and warm up, slowly but surely. I hear a bell a good distance behind me again and I begin to get worried that the creature was back. I didn't see it and I was concerned, but I heard a locker open faintly in the distance as I peer around a corner and see some IT guy getting pulled from a random locker. Was he forced into there? Why was he there? Was he scared? I didn't get the chance to ask before I saw him thrown onto a big meat hook... He tried to struggle off the hook and I was confused,,, Doesn't that hurt? I peer to my right because I heard something and saw Claudette again, she whispered \"struggling only makes it worse...\" and I see him carried off into the sky by the entity that once caressed me earlier... I guess his time was up... I went to ask Claudette where he went and she was also no longer there... Back into the bushes she went I guess... I heard a ding in the distance and see a light go off.. A generator was on? Was there someone else who had been fixing the generators? I noticed 4 of the generators had been on, for how long though? I had no idea... Except I heard the bell again, this time right behind me, my heart began to pound, I was terrified for my life, but I heard another ding as another light lit up, and a horn sounded, and some gates began to light up. Could I escape? The creature with the bell was still right behind me, and as the horn sounded, he kicked it into overdrive, seemed to break into a sprint? He could run faster? I had only seen him go one speed during my time here, I was terrified. At least I know that when he hits me, it hurts, but not enough to stop me, so I keep running for the door hoping for the best, when all of a sudden... *W H A C K* I was on the ground. In more pain than I have ever felt before in my life. What was this? How did this happen? I thought I was going to be okay? The creature put me on his shoulder and said \"Hello friend... No one escapes death\" And let out a terrifying chuckle that rattled my bones... As I was thrown onto one of those meat hooks as he stared me in the eyes, straight to my soul, as the hook was digging into my shoulder... I had the feeling the other people must have left, because in not too much time, they hadn't came for me... And I too, was taken up by the entity... Carried away into the sky... in more pain then I could ever describe in words... I passed out once I got way up in the sky... And awoke once again to the blood web, this time, with some options of things I could have found useful during my time in that cursed wheat field... I took a flashlight and a tool box just because there was no one to stop me. Before I knew it I heard a sound, and I was all of a sudden in a junkyard... With the same eerie feeling I was being hunted, and seeing another group of broken generators... I knew this was my fate, and I was going to be here for a long long time... Even death isn't an escape from this sick game... It only lets you improve, and pray that next time, you don't die.","timestamp_created":1570857277,"timestamp_updated":1570857277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561760","author":{"steamid":"76561198347031537","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":110903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":215,"playtime_at_review":6737,"last_played":1660113592},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo melhorou bastante vo deixar meu like","timestamp_created":1570856206,"timestamp_updated":1648193258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473684221506118774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561737","author":{"steamid":"76561198398870885","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2760,"last_played":1639145320},"language":"koreana","review":"아아-이게임은 살인마가 생존자를 죽이는게 아닌 생존자가 살인마를 죽이러 쫒는 게임입니다","timestamp_created":1570856038,"timestamp_updated":1570856038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561647","author":{"steamid":"76561198039902019","num_games_owned":381,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":15217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11735,"last_played":1655615331},"language":"english","review":"Audience :\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☐ Casual players\n☑ Pro players\n\n¤ Graphics :\n\n☐ Potato\n☐Really bad\n☐ Bad\n☑ OK\n☐ Good \n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n€ Price / quality : \n\n☐ Full price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☑ Dont do it\n\n€ Requirments :\n\n☐ 90' PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium \n☑ Fast\n☐ High end\n☐ NASA computer\n\n¤ Difficulty :\n\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Ez\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master \n☐ Hard \n☐ Dark souls\n\n\n€ Game time\n\n☐ Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n☐ Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n☐ Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n☐ Long ( 12+ hours)\n☐ Very long ( 30-40+ hours)\n☑ Endless\n\n@ Story\n☑ It doesnt have\n☐ Still better than Twilight\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n§ Bugs\n\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☑ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Lot of bugs\n☐ Few Bugs\n☐ You can use them for speedrun\n☐ Nothing\n\nOverall: 2/10","timestamp_created":1570855487,"timestamp_updated":1570855487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484544068574905396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561384","author":{"steamid":"76561198067989389","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1569150251},"language":"koreana","review":"고인물만 남은 ㅈ망겜 뉴비랑 고인물들이랑 묶어줘서 뉴비들은 재미도 못보고 엿먹는것만 볼수있음\n맵 외우기 전에 농락 당해서 손절당하는 게임","timestamp_created":1570853656,"timestamp_updated":1570853656,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561355","author":{"steamid":"76561198119019433","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4129,"last_played":1626216737},"language":"brazilian","review":"Este jogo fez eu começar a ir no psicoanalista e no cardiologista após começar a fumar 3 maços de winston durante as partidas.","timestamp_created":1570853492,"timestamp_updated":1570853492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55561316","author":{"steamid":"76561198186144317","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":17330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1698,"last_played":1616306920},"language":"spanish","review":"Lo compré con dudas, pero la verdad no me arrepiento de conseguirlo, muy entretenido aunque de ves en cuando te encuentras con campers o hackers por lo demás todo genial.

Daraufhin folgten etliche Patches und Balances, um die Killer gleichgültig mit den Überlebenden aufzuwerten. \nABER aktuell sind durch zahlreiche \"Rückschritte\" (Man kann den Killer nicht mehr aufgrund des Hakens erkennen, die Schlagreichweite des Killers ist abnormal, etc.) die Überlebenden derart im Nachteil, dass man schon automatisch weiß, wenn der erste Überlebende am Haken hängt und noch alle 5 Generatoren unten angezeigt werden, dass das Spiel für die Überlebenden verloren ist.\nAlso Behaviour Digital Inc.
