The DLCs are not needed since you can still match make with DLC owners. Also the horror atmosphere and lore is really well done. The game play loop has very simple mechanics paired with a large depth of knowledge. This allows the game to feel easy to pick up, but very hard and long to master. It also makes a fun party game to play with friends. The best part is that the game has regular updates giving more committed players reasons to come back after a break such as reworks, events, and new outfits. \n\nThe downside is that every new DLC seems to stress the creativity of the devs. With how simple the basic mechanics are, its hard for newer killers to release with interesting or standout abilities. The survivor game play also has the issue of unreliable teammates. Unless you play with friends, there is a huge lack of consistency to the quality of games. Playing solo vs playing with even 1 partner is a huge difference. Also the time required to unlock most/all perks on every character you want to play is ridiculously high, especially if you want to prestige them for the bonus cosmetics. This deters you from playing new characters (especially killers) simply because of the time investment required just to unlock their full perks.","timestamp_created":1632180963,"timestamp_updated":1632180963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99707525","author":{"steamid":"76561198386877852","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1642555990},"language":"english","review":"ghost face","timestamp_created":1632180918,"timestamp_updated":1632180918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99707522","author":{"steamid":"76561198301919563","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7747,"last_played":1657690005},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenardo 11/10","timestamp_created":1632180906,"timestamp_updated":1632180906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99707080","author":{"steamid":"76561198039694154","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1354,"last_played":1655790902},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight","timestamp_created":1632180079,"timestamp_updated":1632180079,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479166656732559204","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99706762","author":{"steamid":"76561199108553836","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":531,"playtime_at_review":4366,"last_played":1660336188},"language":"brazilian","review":"maravilhosoooo tirando os tuneladores ksksksk","timestamp_created":1632179428,"timestamp_updated":1632179428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99706709","author":{"steamid":"76561199124244342","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1634972443},"language":"english","review":"After many years of playing Dead by Daylight there are a few things to be said that definitely make it a great game.
