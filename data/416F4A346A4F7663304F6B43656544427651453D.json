Again going to save people the trouble and tell them exactly what DLCs to buy now:\n[quote][h1]Killer[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Leatherface (BBQ & Chili)\n[*]Curtain Call (Pop Goes the Weasel / Bamboozle - Just buy Clown in-game with Iridescent Shards)\n[/list]\nAnd maybe watch the shrine for the handful of other meta Killer perks.\n\n[h1]Survivor[/h1]\nThe literal only DLC you need to be competitively viable as Survivor is the [b]Halloween[/b] DLC for Laurie Strode's perk Decisive Strike. Every other meta perk for Survivors (Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Iron Will, Unbreakable, various speed boost perks that cause the Exhaustion effect) are available for free with the base game.[/quote]\n[b]Literally every other DLC is [u]worthless[/u] and you are [u]actively harming your experience[/u] by purchasing it.[/b] (Since you dilute your bloodweb with garbage perks.)\n\nFor a list of things that they need to change in Dead by Daylight to make me come back:\n[olist][*]Change the maps so you don't need a character who specifically has a power to move around the map fast in order to be viable. Remove like 40% of the dead space on all the maps. (Or give every Killer a Last Year-esque \"phasing mode\" where they move at like 300% ms)\n[*]Rework or outright remove the Bloodweb system. Being competitively viable should not be tied to RNG. Just let players buy the perks and addons they want; you can still tie Prestige to BP expenditure but at least players can invest in items / perks / addons that they want and actually have fun before deciding to Prestige.\n[*]Actually fucking nerf perks / tactics / items / addons / offerings that have been meta for four years running: BBQ, NOED, tunneling, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Iron Will, Spine Chill, Adrenaline, Exhaustion perks, Keys, Moris, various Ultra Rares for various Killers...\n[spoiler][b]3.1.[/b] And stop doing stupidly heavy-handed nerfs like with Billy and Nurse.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler][b]3.2.[/b] Add various perks that should be part of the base kit to the base kit: Decisive Strike (anti-tunneling perk), Unbreakable, BBQ (detection), Pop Goes, Thanataphobia (being injured should have more of a penalty), Whispers, Overcharge (stop Survivors from tapping a gen that was kicked), Unnerving Presence (stop Survivors from doing gens in the Killer's face), Spies from the Shadows, Bloodhound...[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]3.3. STOP ADDING MORE FUCKING SECOND CHANCE PERKS TO THE GAME HOLY SHIT[/spoiler]\n[*]Fix all the fucking bugs that have been in the game for four years running.\n[*]Fix the fucking matchmaking so that the average skill gap between players isn't as wide as the Mariana trench.[/olist]","timestamp_created":1553198585,"timestamp_updated":1594456563,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49681095","author":{"steamid":"76561197962787391","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":41634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1197,"playtime_at_review":13711,"last_played":1660601942},"language":"english","review":"I
