So let me tell you that the review bombing is absolutely reddit shit but to be quite honest its not entirely unjustified. Now, I figured out a long time ago that I enjoy games much more when i have a bunch of games in the rotation instead of burning myself out on just one game, so when the devs completely break their game its easy for me to say \"ah I just wont play this shit for another couple of weeks\" and move on, but its also funny to know that the ease in which I can do that is directly connected to the amount of times this game breaks upon a new update. Its easy to call incompetence and assume that everyone rolling out the updates is just inept but I typically try my best to avoid that kind of behavior. At a certain point though... I mean you can kind of see the cracks in the wall. Every update for this game is a bumpy ride & this update is completely 100% broken. Whatever, I still had fun messing around for a little while with my friends I mean thats what the game is all about. I got my fill. I will absolutely not play enough to hit rank 1 on both (like I usually do) but Im sure the game will enter a playable state sometime in the next 90 days and ill be playing this shit basically every day like I used to. the reason I even bother to write out a kind of sprawling steam review is to say: its not the buggy updates or the shitty changes that make things worse that worry me, its the philosophy behind the changes. Because the more the game breaks the more i have to research the behind the scenes and watch their shitty livestreams where the people who make the game fumble around with their controllers. And beyond just being bad at their game is a lack of understanding for how it works or plays. The balance changes have a 50% chance of being completely harebrained and Im never surprised by some stupid shit that makes it past the ptr and into the game. Im not surprised when the new event sucks (trend for the last year and a half). Im not surprised when a legion bug keeps him unplayable for months. Im not surprised when the \"purely visual\" animation updates make 360ing completely impossible. Im not surprised that theres still only like 5 standout perks out of the pool of 200 leading to a completely stale gameplay loop where every single person has the same \"build\" and all anyone does is complain that the other side is crutching for literally two years now(!). I mean it doesnt matter. None of this matters. Im just venting my frustrations about a game I really enjoy playing. Who is the game for? It trys to have its cake and eat it too and ends up just pissing everyone off. And im sure that will keep happening until this game eventually dies (if it ever does). The uniqueness of the game gives it a lot of longevity and so despite all the shit its community flings at the devs, theyll all keep playing this shit, including me. \n\njust wait till the game and all the dlc is on sale its usually pretty cheap. dont try to play f2p like i did just spend like 10 bucks when its on sale and get some teachables and have some fun. there thats my review, 4/5","timestamp_created":1613239240,"timestamp_updated":1613239240,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86562511","author":{"steamid":"76561199025884771","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":7799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1640605868},"language":"english","review":"Great game!!","timestamp_created":1613239151,"timestamp_updated":1613239151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86561727","author":{"steamid":"76561199076696946","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1652136852},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1613238462,"timestamp_updated":1613238462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86561683","author":{"steamid":"76561198120338092","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":17281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9531,"last_played":1654819143},"language":"english","review":"OK so, this game can be very fun, and very frustrating. The Devs seem to be semi incompotent or just ignore their beta feedback. As I write this review they just released a patch that vastly altered the UI, something no one had been complaining about, and made it worse. As they blundered this they also updated graphics and animations, which has now resulted in killers looking telepathic with some of their new hit boxes and their ability to hit you. That all being said, the concept of Dead by Daylight is straightforward, 4 players act as survivor while 1 acts as killer. Survivors try to escape, killer tries to stop them. Very fun game concept, custom games is particularly fun with friends. Probably too many DLC paywalls with killers and survivors but that seems to becoming the unfortunate norm now a days.","timestamp_created":1613238429,"timestamp_updated":1613238429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86561294","author":{"steamid":"76561198182382183","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":73490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":68546,"last_played":1660159653},"language":"polish","review":"a bit better but still dogshit XD","timestamp_created":1613238066,"timestamp_updated":1622305123,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86560741","author":{"steamid":"76561199044342851","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":867,"last_played":1648579126},"language":"russian","review":"Класс.

시스템 아닌가요? 왜 이런것에 오류가 발생하는지 저도 프로그래밍하는 사람으로써 이해가 되지 않습니다. 맨날 돈 받으시면서 출근하시면 좀 빠른 답변좀 부탁드립니다.","timestamp_created":1613234118,"timestamp_updated":1613234118,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86556628","author":{"steamid":"76561198033452015","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4710,"last_played":1639941936},"language":"english","review":"nice

someone that's played the game since The Saw DLC came out, I can honestly say this game is a mixed bag from update to update. The most recent update is unenjoyable for most, including myself. The Gideon Meat Plant map and Asylum/Chapel map reworks are great, they look brilliant (despite GMP having between 25-30 pallets in total). Everything else, is meh. The HUD is a mess, where before everything was in the same place on the screen, now it's all over the place. I've played MMOs for many years so it's not too bad for me personally but for other people it may be difficult for them to focus on the game entirely. As of now the devs have said they're working on changing the HUD, which is a plus. The new survivor animations are... Questionable to say the least. And even though hitboxes have been dodgy for years, it honestly feels like you're getting downed by Elastigirl and Huntress feels like she's yeeting fridges at you instead of small hatchets. The Trapper and Wraith mini-buffs are pretty good though! But that's about it for this update.\n\nLike I said this game varies in quality from update to update, the past few updates have been rather meh. The only solid consistency this game has going for it is the cosmetics. That's literally it. It does feel like the devs have shifted priority from making a good game even better to just pumping out cosmetics. It's a real shame, because I love this game, even when the updates are lacklustre and/or disappointing. I will always go back to this game but the way it's currently going I'm going back to it less and less. I completely understand that they need to make money and they need to please investors and shareholders, however the game feels like it should be a \"freemium\" game but you're paying for the game and the DLC. It'll set you back around £125, including the cosmetic dlc and the soundtrack available on the steam store if you decide to buy all of it. If you want to buy some of the nicer cosmetics in the game you will need to buy Auric Cells and an entire set can cost around 1000 Auric Cells. There's also the option to buy a \"battle pass\", which again feels like a freemium game thing. If you want to purchase the battle pass and get cosmetics for every level you progress (there are 70 in total), that will cost around 1000 Auric cells as well. \n\nI have no doubt that Behaviour love this game and the community, and it's the same for the community. We love this game, and they've literally got us \"hooked\". It's just a shame that it feels like they'd rather pump out cosmetics than fix the problems that the game has had for a fair while.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely! Would I recommend this game in its current state? No. \n\nI hope this review has helped you guys <3","timestamp_created":1613232806,"timestamp_updated":1613232806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592774033546447754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86555126","author":{"steamid":"76561198976264150","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1657761655},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenardo para jugar con amigos t quedas enganchado en 0,006, va en relidad no porque las primeras partidas son re random porque son todos nuevos pero despues se pone bueno","timestamp_created":1613232660,"timestamp_updated":1613232660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86555107","author":{"steamid":"76561198863440777","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":32956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31199,"last_played":1657942719},"language":"schinese","review":"新版ui改的太烂，ui信息太分散。","timestamp_created":1613232640,"timestamp_updated":1613232640,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86554686","author":{"steamid":"76561198063288670","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":14842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":6837,"last_played":1660049298},"language":"tchinese","review":"你以為在玩DBD嗎？\n錯，這是第五人格(๑´ㅂ`๑)","timestamp_created":1613232290,"timestamp_updated":1613232290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86554588","author":{"steamid":"76561198870977287","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":17989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17014,"last_played":1628768493},"language":"koreana","review":"숙제게임","timestamp_created":1613232221,"timestamp_updated":1613232221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tMWIzvcCfP2WygI="}
