Ich habe damit vor ca. 1 Jahr angefangen und mich hat sofort die \"Sucht\" gepackt. An dem Spiel gefällt mir sehr, dass oft neue Updates kommen, d.h. öfters neue Killer, Überlebende usw. Es kommen auch öfters Bug-Updates, das sagt einem ja schon das sich die Entwickler sehr viel Mühe geben und alles daran setzen alles mögliche zu beheben. \nEs gibt natürlich auch die ein oder anderen Mängel im Spiel, die einem aber dank der starken guten Sachen fast gar nicht auffallen. \nFür alle, die \"Horror\" Spiele mögen, empfehle ich dieses Spiel sehr. Ich persönlich würde DBD nicht in Horror einordnen, da es einem manchmal nur den einen oder anderen Schreckmoment gibt.","timestamp_created":1507496527,"timestamp_updated":1507496527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35582782","author":{"steamid":"76561198388013466","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11509,"last_played":1510522113},"language":"dutch","review":"good","timestamp_created":1507495516,"timestamp_updated":1507495516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35582385","author":{"steamid":"76561198109842844","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":35232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15766,"last_played":1652429062},"language":"english","review":"After the release of Friday the 13th, they finally realised what they had was special and have been improving this game at a rate I have not seen before from the company. they have been adding characters non-stop and doing bug fixs every few days.

spiel ist klasse soviel man mekern kann hat man trotzdem spaß.\nIch erzähl euch aber nun Punkte die mich nerven.\n\n\nWenn ein Überlebender den Killer maximal Trollt will der Killer ihn ja sehr gerne aus seinem spiel raushaben deswegen wird er ge Facecampt.Was mich daran nervt,dass der Überlebende und andere dannach schreiben Sch*** Camper deinstalire das Spiel, obwol sie sich das selbst zuzuschreiben haben da sie den Killer so nerven das er irgendwann keine lust mehr hat.Damit will ich aber nicht sagen das die Überlebenden einfach stehen bleiben sollen, sondern das sie einfach Killer nicht zur weißglut bringen sollen z.B. das sie nicht immer sachen nutzen sollen wo man sie nicht bekommt.Denn wenn man es mal nicht schafft freut sich der Killer dann über einen kill oder Killer campen (Facecampen) auch wenn sie keinen Überlebenden bekommen haben und schon alle Tore offen sind da sie wenigstens einen kill haben wollen ,da sie nicht wie der letzte noob aussehen wollen obwohl wenn man facecampt oderso nur noch noobiger auf die anderen wirkt.\n\n\nDann gibt es so Leute die die ganze Runde nichts machen sondern sich nur verstecken und sich erst bewegen wenn man einen raben hat.Wenn sie dann mal gejagt werden laufen sie auch immer zu anderen und schmieren den Killer an ihnen ab, am ende führt es wieder dazu das er einfach hängen gelassen wird er sich aber im Lobbychat  darüber aufregt und andere leute beleidigt.(so wird der chat voll mit Schimpfwörtern)\n\nDann haben die Entwickler ja ein neues Rangsystem für die Killer rausgebracht,nun muss man Leute töten um ein Rangkristall zu bekommen.So wird man ziemlich zum Campen gezwungen was auf hohen Rängen nichts bringt da die Überlebenden solange er Campt die anderen Gens(Generatoren)machen.Trotzdem wird fast jedes dritte match gecampt.\n\nDann bringen die Entwickler immer super starke Killer raus z.B. jetzt der Kanibale oder die Jägerin.Das nervt da es einfach nicht fair ist das Killer schneller und Stärker sind als die Überlebenden.Bei der Krankenschwester ist es ok da sie unglaublich schwer zu erlernen (spielen)ist.\n\nDann nutzen manche Leute immer Bugs aus um einen zu töten oder um zu Überleben.\nManche nutzen auch Cheats was ich unter aller sau finde da das Spiel schon Schwer genug ist.\n\nTrotz all den Punken bleibt es  mein Lieblings Spiel da es das beste Horrormultiplayer Game

I offered my friends keys, I played and it was pretty fun. I got the Deluxe edition because I really wanted to support them. I played the game for a couple of months and had to put it down to get a new computer. Cut forward a year or so later and I've gotten back into the game. Since Beta these are the issues that I am reporting and also talking about, which also happen to be the reason I don't think the devs deserve any more money:\n\n[b]Let's talk about surviving-[/b]\n\n[b]Pallet's are broken[/b] \nfor all of the small sheds, if you look on my profile you can see video evidence of it. I had someone confirm with a screenshot in the official bug report thread that the problem is real and they've experienced it as well. The pallet's being broken also didn't used to be an issue in Beta.\n\n[b]Survivors are no longer allowed to camp[/b] \nas there are crows that spawn above the survivor which is both good and bad. It's a good idea that was executed poorly. Not only do the crows spawn above you because you're camping but they also spawn if you're waiting for a camping hunter to go away. Why is this bad and why is this good? It's good for the hunter, it's bad because the crows stay there for 30 seconds-60 seconds straight, and if it's camping hunter you won't get far without being spotted. The crows are also unnecessary in my opinion as in Beta they didn't have them and it made the game more challenging because it forced the hunter to be active. If they didn't add the crows it wouldn't of been the end of the world as no progress would be made by either party until the survivor did something which means the survivor would be stuck for as long as they camped for. Even now I can still \"camp\" by alternating between walls every 10-15 seconds so the crows aren't really that effective obviously.\n\n[b]Survivors are no longer allowed to loop window jumps ,[/b]\nwhich was obnoxious to say the least. However I don't think it was a necessary addition because if someone were to do that in beta you just moved on to the other survivors. If there were no other survivors you'd be there with that one survivor until they messed up or got away which... if you don't pay attention to your surroundings, is what happens anyways. Most survivors didn't window loop for longer than maybe a minute until getting caught or moving on but I do understand the \"moral\" obligation to implement something that stopped the abuse of a feature.\n\n[b]Hunters have an additional perk[/b] \nnow to where their speed changes up to 15% during a chase which of course makes it even harder for the survivors to escape.\n\n[b]Let's talk about the hunters-[/b]\n(I'm talking about bare bones here, no extra perks or anything)\n\n[b]The Wraith[/b] \nwas added sometime in the Beta period. With his ability to turn invisible and have no heartbeat in this state. This killer is actually a great addition to Dead by Daylight and follows closely with the world and gameplay style of the game itself. The Wraith has to ring his bell to uncloak which is a great balancing technique so that players have a chance to get away and it's not an instant kill for the wraith.\n\n[b]The Nurse[/b] \nis also a pretty unique and very well balanced killer. She can be a little OP with certain perks and an attentive player using her and her blink ability but it's not an instant kill with The Nurse either. Every time she blinks she either has to hit someone or suffer the 1-2 second stagger effect which forces her to look down and gives the survivor a chance to run away.\n\n[b]The Trapper[/b] isn't a very fast killer and he doesn't do a lot of damage without his traps. But his traps are really important to his gameplay and doesn't always guarantee an instant pickup as the players have an opportunity to struggle and get away which can prove to be challenging without perks or good teamwork, but the killer is still very balanced as survivors (if paying attention) can easily spot The Trapper's traps most of the time.\n\n[b]The Shade[/b] \nalright... so now that we've reviewed three of the most unique killers in the game and their bare bone gameplay style... let's talk about The Shade. \nWith the addition of this killer any survivor in his line of sight is highlighted effectively making juking and quick hiding almost impossible. \nHe starts off with an ability that practically allows him not to have a terror radius and he still does standard damage. \nBut the player is allowed to choose when they level up their \"Evil Within\" rendering the \"bu-that's-only-in-tier-one\" argument invalid but also meaning they can keep their terror radius practically non-existent.\nWith an attentive and skilled killer that just means moving a bit slower than The Trapper (except not because of the chase tier speeds which are made easier by the highlighted survivors and he can highlight more than one as well), doing the same amount of damage, but without the ability to set traps.\nOnto The Shade's next level tier... he's able to do everything in the above mentioned, but just a bit faster at the cost of just a slightly bigger terror radius, his terror radius isn't even normal at this point which gives him an advantage over The Trapper because not only does he have the chase tier speed perk (5% faster 10%, 15%) but he now is able to lunge a bit faster and move at a normal speed and has a reduced terror radius. \n\nHis next tier is insane, first off he now FINALLY has a NORMAL terror radius which still gives him an advantage because it's exactly like playing The Trapper but you now have a lunge ability and increased movement speed/vaulting speed which makes it... once again.. almost impossible to escape him (Again keep in mind this is WITHOUT perks. Literally just standard abilities and normal survivors).\nThere also is no warning when he see's you or you're being followed as long as he stays far enough away, The Shade is difficult to play with in almost any tier because of these reasons.\n\n[b]Adding perks[/b] \njust adds insult to injury with The Shade. Making him quieter, faster, able to instakill prey, and all around more effective and precise than any other killer who has a visual or audio penalty for missing their skill or attack, or just for using the skill in the first place (The Wraith's bell)\n\nNow the argument can be made that \"you can just equip perks noob\" but that's entirely the opposite point I'm making here. I'm saying the base gameplay isn't balanced. Perks shouldn't be used to balance a game they should be used to enhance gameplay or experience. Not make it \"fair\".\n\n[b]Now let's talk about a core element/mechanic that's really really basic and shows that they don't have a fundamental understanding of what they're doing or how it functions and had to struggle for a year to figure out how to do whilst charging their supporters for DLC and the core game itself, while not labeling it as a Beta game any longer-[/b]\n\n[b]Ranks.[/b] \nThey. Can't. Even. Save. Ranks.\n\n[b]There is no penalty[/b] \nfor camping hunters.\n\n\nI still enjoy the game, it's fun to play with friends. But I don't think the Dev's deserve any more money, especially when they've released a bunch of DLC and the game isn't even complete and still has basic mechanic bugs they need to work out.","timestamp_created":1507454986,"timestamp_updated":1507607002,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35567069","author":{"steamid":"76561198316342515","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":13866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":68,"playtime_at_review":4783,"last_played":1660361169},"language":"schinese","review":"好","timestamp_created":1507453955,"timestamp_updated":1507453955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35566843","author":{"steamid":"76561198158777586","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1624881309},"language":"polish","review":"goood good:D\n","timestamp_created":1507453282,"timestamp_updated":1507453282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35566377","author":{"steamid":"76561198142365071","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":57462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36876,"last_played":1648841068},"language":"russian","review":"Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра\n Это просто обос.саный выеб.аный бомж инвалид а не игра","timestamp_created":1507451788,"timestamp_updated":1528402930,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35566297","author":{"steamid":"76561198110452533","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":11796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11024,"last_played":1535414214},"language":"schinese","review":"I really enjoy playing DBD, but recently I have lost all my perks, levels, and items.
