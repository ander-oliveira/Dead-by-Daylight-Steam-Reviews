game is such garbage compared to any other competitive games. Devs made a beautiful and cool game, but the competitive aspect is just ridicilous.\n\nEven a no hand disabled kid would hit rank 1 as survivor, and killer just needs to tier 3 NOED and buy pop goes the weasel to actually win games. Even when killer is still easy and an autistic kid would hit it without any problems, the killer side is just boring and poorly designed. He just has too low amount of options not like survivors - they can hide in lockers, use a lot of nice items and their perks are very effective and gameplay changing, not like killer, perks are just bad and only give you advantage over the enemy. Addons are very cool on specific killers, but addons on Bubba or Billy jusut give him faster chainsaw speed.\n\nWhy did I spend 250 hours in this game? Cuz the game is fucking good, but devs making non-regular updates and the game being extremaly buggy make the gameplay have no sense in 10% of the matches, which is quite a lot if you look at it from the other sight (1 match = 20-30 minutes of doing nothing, while it happens from 1 to 10 games, which means if you play regularly you will encounter a bug pretty much everyday). They are only good at patching exploits that are games mechanic, for example moon-walking or pyramids head instant attack after cancelling ranged attack.\n\nThis game is fucking horrible in terms of balance. Would you like to win every game because youre good? This game is not for you, go play counter strike or slender fortress in team fortress 2. Who enjoys winning because of RNG? Normies that play this game. If you really want to cringe over a game, check a dead by daylight facebook group. People post wins there and show off how good they are, even when winning by total RNG. People like Tru3Ta1ent or lefort87 are the bets examples (not including otzdarva, cuz i dont think hes good at killers and tactics, hes the master of mindgames), these guys are godlike at killers, but guess what, get a shitty map on a killer you use and test your limits. If you want to get true balance, you really need to tryhard every game and play with op addons (myers tombstone).\n\nDo you like scary games? No, this game is not even scary, this is just an rpg where you do a quest to repair 5 generators and power the exit gates. Simple as that. Oh my god, retarded big monk with a chainsaw is charging into you. You stun him and guess what, no grunts of pain, he makes sound like he attempted to test his limits Cock & Ball Torture, thats why hes moaning like a 21 yo teen.\n\nWho do I recommend this game? I only recommend this game to people that have nothing to do and want a cheap, cool looking game that has some sense in the start. The gameplay is fucked up in the middle of the learning, after like 50 hours, this is the time where a lot of people just leave this game because they probably already hit rank 10 and hes getting rekt by rank 1 killers because \"mmrs\". Please, devs, maybe make a game for everyone instead of people that just love this game and are from the start of it.\n\nOverally: 7/10 stars, very good game to play with friends, in longer gameplay this game is madness and a game where you just grind all the time. Very good graphics, funny characters, lore and perks. I love this game. I still hope it will get some more love.","timestamp_created":1612252464,"timestamp_updated":1636895750,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85805348","author":{"steamid":"76561199101639368","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":55,"playtime_at_review":1995,"last_played":1659695417},"language":"schinese","review":"太好玩辣，","timestamp_created":1612252135,"timestamp_updated":1612252135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85805087","author":{"steamid":"76561198967631535","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4374,"last_played":1652291550},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная

There's a heart-pumping adrenaline that accompanies every moment near the hunter. Then, you start experiencing bugs. Not so fun. If you're like me, you'll look up these bugs, see if anyone has found a workaround or if they've been reported. \n\nUh oh. They've been reported since the games release, in 2016.\n\nDouble uh-oh. The Devs are very neglectful of the community, and have been since release. Microtransactions are as forced as possible, with every interesting element hidden behind a new, tiny, DLC. \n\nLet's talk about perks. There is very little balancing in regards to perks. There's 3-4 killers that are worth playing - the rest you can forget about. All of them are pretty fun to play, but if you want to have any edge against toxic players you have to take the meta options (very limited). The devs response in the past to community balance requests has been mixed. Usually, the community is ignored. When large responses happen, the devs on occasion acquiesce. \n\nRegrettably, this game has serious potential - but only if the Developers step up and make the changes necessary (bug fixing, balancing, less DLC microtransaction BS) to make it great.\n\nThus, in this state, it is not recommended, and as the devs have no current goals to fix these issues, it will likely never reach a point of 'completion'.","timestamp_created":1612233546,"timestamp_updated":1612233546,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85794230","author":{"steamid":"76561199100743806","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3154,"last_played":1650072099},"language":"brazilian","review":"Desbalanceado

На более высоких уровнях прокачки выжившего попадаешься в лобби к киллерам, которые гораздо выше по рангу и соответственно по уровню игры. В таком случае, сессия тоже не играбельна, поскольку бороться с убийцей невозможно. При игре в паблике с случайными людьми на высоких рангах играть тоже невозможно, поскольку в таком случае итог игры во многом зависит от тим плея(рандомные тимейты часто оказываются не самыми грамотными игроками, что влечет поражение и неприятный эмоциональный осадок после игры). Проблема с подключением к лобби тоже присутствует: я подключаюсь в лобби один, ища игру вместе с напарником, поэтому приходится постоянно покидать лобби, дабы попытать удачу в очередной раз. Решил эту проблему только путем подключения впна(в других играх такой проблемы нет, играл без впна).
