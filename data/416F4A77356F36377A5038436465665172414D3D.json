It can be a lot of fun, and It's great with a group or just by yourself. That being said, I can't really recommend it to new players with the current killer system. It would just be cruel. Killers now typically camp, aka, won't allow other survivors to help, and just stand in front of the hook until time runs out. Another favourite is guard basement entrance, dooming all who attempt to play the game normally. Unfortunately with the way the game is now, that kind of behaviour to encouraged, as killers get the most bloodpoints from sacrifices. It's a real poo poo unsportsmanlike way to play the game. And no, i'm not a whiny survivor, I also play as a killer as well, in fact more often than survivor. It is more than possible to still win without being playing this way.  Games are made to be fun, and I think everyone \"aside from the poopy killer\" can agree that this sort of behaviour \"is not fun\" I would like to see more creative ways to give the killers points instead of just handing them free points for playing like a trash player.","timestamp_created":1647580072,"timestamp_updated":1647580920,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112392375","author":{"steamid":"76561198031787418","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":48483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1490,"playtime_at_review":38206,"last_played":1660530854},"language":"english","review":"I

Hacking has become increasingly common, and some bugs have been bad enough to crash matches. While the most recent update addressed some of the bugs, everything has been thrown even further out of balance. It's a fun concept, but it's so terribly broken and unbalanced that I can't say it's worth playing anymore. The most recent update/anniversary event completely ruined the game. I can go 20 matches in a row as a survivor and escape every time without even getting hit once, but as a killer, regardless of what perk stack I use, there is no longer a way to counter the many, many exploits that survivors take advantage of. The most used survivor meta was recently nerfed, but that's only caused everyone to drastically ramp up how much they overuse other meta strategies. This game is no longer scary or fun.

Many perks in the game have been unbalanced for a long time, and they need to be changed. Stuff like unbreakable, boon: circle of healing, dead hard, and ds. There are also perks that crash the game as well such as Object of Obsession. The maps in this game are truly abysmal. It does not matter if you play as the survivor, or the killer, you are going to see how awful and lazy they are at making maps. It really goes to show how little care the devs have for this game. I also will go on to say that since skill-based matchmaking has been introduced, it has felt like most killers are unplayable. If you do not play any killers that are at least decent, and that are combined with overpowered perks, you will be crushed by sweat lords. These sweat lords will use nothing but the best perks in the game, and will hold w to the other side of the map if you chase them. These people did exist before skill-based matchmaking, but they were not in every game. The survivor side is also terrible with how many killers have started to use sweat perk because of skill-based matchmaking. If you can't beat em, join em.

Yes\ndoes the game make me angry at times due to everything. Yes\n\nBut is it fun, and do i enjoy it. YES. after playing it for a couple weeks worth of time on mobile, and it getting too big for the phone to handle. I still wanted more. if you want the best out of this game, get the stuff on sale and do some basic maths to get the best deal on the dlc and such. also as a tip, dont expect to win. play simply to have fun, you might still get mad at specific things, but play smart, learn, and don't expect it to go right, and you will find yourself enjoying yourself more and able to laugh at the people angry at you in post-game chats.\n\nupdating to say that still very fun especially if you get a friend group to play with you","timestamp_created":1647551576,"timestamp_updated":1655521314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112374078","author":{"steamid":"76561198286566415","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":39873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":18233,"last_played":1660311129},"language":"english","review":"god game","timestamp_created":1647551336,"timestamp_updated":1647551336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112373965","author":{"steamid":"76561198286211874","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36875,"last_played":1654736170},"language":"english","review":"good game.","timestamp_created":1647551202,"timestamp_updated":1647551202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112373959","author":{"steamid":"76561198401304749","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1211,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1660525021},"language":"english","review":"pretty fun game","timestamp_created":1647551196,"timestamp_updated":1647551196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112373828","author":{"steamid":"76561198086729389","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1647793557},"language":"french","review":"Bon jeux de slasher sensiblement le même principe que friday the 13th mais le choix de tueur est très large de quoi bien s'amuser je le recommande je les sur pc et xbox et j'y joue constament","timestamp_created":1647551025,"timestamp_updated":1647551025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112373521","author":{"steamid":"76561199089756801","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":763,"last_played":1655931707},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gutes Spiel weiterempfehlenswert","timestamp_created":1647550648,"timestamp_updated":1647550648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112373378","author":{"steamid":"76561199221875209","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":362,"playtime_at_review":9356,"last_played":1659694901},"language":"italian","review":"Il gioco mi piace molto, il fatto che si inizia con la possibilità di giocare da novizio con 7 personaggi gratuiti dà molte possibilità di game-play e di divertimento, in più sempre gratuitamente si ha la possibilità di ottenere ulteriori personaggi, competenze e skin.   il gioco è online 4vs1 e devo dire che è fatto molto bene.  dopo 150 ore di gioco penso che questo sia un gioco molto valido, l'unica pecca è che alcuni killer e personaggi non si ha più la possibilità di ottenerli in alcun modo per questione di contratti scaduti (R.I.P.
