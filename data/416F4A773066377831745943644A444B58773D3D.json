Either as killer or survivor, the hi-deand-seek gameplay keeps you engaged and on your toes throughout the match. The game is a good mix of scary & fun. If you have a few friends who like these kind of horor games, it's great to play for a few hours together, either with one of you as the killer or with a random killer. Community, so far, has been generally welcoming and players generally give you helpful tips if you ask. There is a discord server avalaible to anyone who wnats to find people to play with, and this has greatly improved my experience with the game.\n\nBad: Survivor gameplay has a much, much steeper learning curve and so initial games as survivor tend to be frustrating as you can get hooked easily. Included tutorials are very basic as well. Game is definitely indie and doesn't have a lot of polish in some areas - harmless visual bugs such as clipping throguh a generator, hanging too the side of a hook, or appearing to loose a pip (for ranking) when you actually haven't are relatively common. Some more general imbalances at the time of writing, such as a silly killer hit distance, may bug you if you want to go on to a higher level of play. No servers so the killer is always host which can lead to some really buggy games (pro tip: you can check lag via the chatbox in the starting lobby and bail without penatly then if you need to)\n\nOverall: I recommend for casual play, if you are willing to put the time in to learn how to survive or to play a lot with friends.

Examples are healing an ally, sneaking by the killer, looting helpful items, or in the case of the killer, injuring survivors, impaling them on hooks, and many other things.\n\nThese points are used to level up, which means receiving consumable items as well as permanent perks that add another layer of strategy on this game, which already has a fairly high skill ceiling (since I've only played this game for four hours, this part only comes from me watching streams of people who have hundreds of hours in it.)\n\nI've only started playing this game during the free weekend. It's a lot of fun, and if it was completely balanced and polished I'd even consider buying it for two or three times the current price (20€/17€ during the free weekend)\n\nHowever, it is not, which is the reason why my recommendation is to wait with buying for the next few patches. The devs seem to be very active because they apparently fixed a recent problem with finding lobbies during this weekend. They've also informed the players via twitter of other bug fixes they'll be working on on monday (tomorrow). Now some of you may say that is the least the devs should be doing, but sadly, as some of you may have experienced, it is not.","timestamp_created":1471805631,"timestamp_updated":1471805631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25058877","author":{"steamid":"76561198216344519","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2281,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1660369787},"language":"english","review":"Decent game not sure its worth 14.99 though","timestamp_created":1471805244,"timestamp_updated":1471805244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481859415769577026","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25058854","author":{"steamid":"76561198057613955","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1388,"last_played":1593338006},"language":"english","review":"Very entertaining when play with friends","timestamp_created":1471805158,"timestamp_updated":1471805158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510069787502288818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25058819","author":{"steamid":"76561198157301959","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":80645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2994,"last_played":1658759295},"language":"tchinese","review":"2021.02.12重新評價\n史上最爛改版，動作的反饋變得很不直覺，生存者下板，殺手會被吸過去另邊，我自己玩殺手都受不了。\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n周末免費玩的活動後便上鉤了，決定購入\n外掛還是有，但官方有在抓，碰到的機率也不大，剩下的是人品問題防不勝防\n遊戲具有難度與隨機性（你不知道會是哪張地圖及所面對殺手的實力），一再的挫敗能夠激發鑽研的決心\nrank制度的設計很好地鼓勵了互助行為，避免遊戲陷入各顧性命的僵局，也避免失望的玩家離開\n被詬病的倖存者間不能對話溝通，其實是具有巧思的設計，一方面是擬真且使遊戲中的能力具有意義，\n一方面也照顧了找不到朋友玩的玩家，且各國玩家之間不受語言限制共樂，可把林子做大，這根本是優點才對\n產商有在思考\n\n一場遊戲不會太久，節奏快，以及重要的隨機性，使人不知不覺一場接一場\n每個角色都有獨特性，會讓人想一一練功，當殺手當倖存者都好玩\n後續應該還有很多擴充的空間，造型服裝更多新角色新地圖等等\n加上廠商有在動腦思考，包括平衡，包括國際主義路線，包括獎勵玩家做出使整體遊戲體驗更佳的行為\n我認為這款遊戲的發展可以期待\n\n\n缺點：Dwight（隊長）能力做太弱了，生存能力差其他角色太遠，推薦給高手高手高高手使用。","timestamp_created":1471805064,"timestamp_updated":1613121712,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516795873641967773","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25058793","author":{"steamid":"76561198127579180","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1633,"last_played":1475399092},"language":"german","review":"Ich habe das Testwochenende gespielt.

Оригинальная идея казалась невоплотимой, начиная от общей механики игры и заканчивая различными мелочами. Игру я купил по чистой случайности, друг уговорил, и ни чуть не пожалел о покупке.\n\nВ начале, честно говоря, было не по себе, я постоянно ходил вдоль стенки на корточках, побаивался маньяка и редко нормально мог попадать в мини-играх, но буквально через несколько часов игры ко многому привык, и даже маньяк перестал быть чем-то страшным. \n\nВ игре приятная, качественная графика, при этом игра не слишком требовательная. Игровая механика не сложная, однако, что бы начать хорошо играть, придётся понять некоторые тонкости и изучить кое-какие основные тактики. Игра на удивление не приедается и не надоедает даже после многих часов геймплея (лично мне точно). Честно говоря, в игре еще есть некоторые шероховатости, однако разработчики активно трудятся над улучшением игры. Доказательствами этого могут служить стримы разработчиков (да и вообще их наличие) и часто выходящие патчи.\n\nИтог: уникальная в своем роде игра, не имеющая пока что нормальных аналогов, с достойной графикой и приятным геймплеем. Подтверждением того, что игра хорошая и интересная, может стать активность сообщества проявленная к Dead by Daylight. Лично я, ничуть не жалею о недавней покупке, и хочу сказать, что игра полностью стоит своих денег.  :D","timestamp_created":1471802528,"timestamp_updated":1483527097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25058033","author":{"steamid":"76561198187617446","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1561133873},"language":"russian","review":"Игра великолееепна ; я готов ей обмазываться","timestamp_created":1471802527,"timestamp_updated":1471802527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48423302173614502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25058013","author":{"steamid":"76561198120149522","num_games_owned":1110,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":11035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":10536,"last_played":1659445820},"language":"english","review":"Seems like the devs got a unique idea back in 2016 and have shat on it since.

Will update how I feel as I progress (New Update as of 4/7 - general edits noted to show things the devs have fixed to indicate how this dev team is actively improving the game)\n\nDiamond in the rough - VERY ROUGH.  \n\nHow to put this - the game core concept and most of it's mechanics are awesome.  But there is so much that needs to be addressed first because the issues it does have?  Completely rage-inducing.\n\nGame has 5 players on 2 teams.  Their mechanics are as follows.\n\nKILLER \n- Can't be killed\n- is slightly faster than the survivors\n- can down any survivor in 2 hits.\n- can track sprinting survivors as sprinting leaves a trail for a period of time.  Wounded survivors also drop blood spatters that also fade, but can be followed.\n- Locked into first person view with your FOV locked so that the survivors have a chance to break line of site and loose you.\n- It's just you, versus 4 others.\n- Your locked into a standing run.  You cannot crouch to make yourself harder to spot, and you cannot spiint.\n- You have a slight aim assist on your swings, but this can be exploited if the survivors know what they're doing. (Taking hits for a wounded teammates - tricking the killer into hitting a tree with the swing, ect)\n\nSURVIVORS\n- Has 3rd person camera for better awareness.\n- You have the advantage of numbers.\n- When the killer is near you, you get a heartbeat that intensifies the closer the killer is.\n- Less frustrating as a survivor as you climb through the ranks, early matches are tough.\n- Your pretty much boned if your teammates won't work with you.\n- Can leap through window sills faster than the killer can step through them.\n- Can crouch and hide behind smaller obstacles.\n- Can stun the killer by wiggling out his grasp, blind him with flashlights,sabatage most of his hooks, toss pallets in his way (or on him for the stun) which he must circumvent or take time destroying.\n\nTo get away from the killer, the survivors need to power up 5 of 7 generators spread throughout the proceedurally generated map.  Repairing them take some time and will randomly pop skill checks which are essentially QTE's.  Succeed in said event, you continue repairing.  Fail - the generator blows in a flash of light and the killer gets both an audio and visual alert from anywhere in the map (and some of your repair progress is lost)   Survivors can all assist on the generator, making the repair go faster -  but you will certainly who failed the QTE when it happens :)\n\nOnce the generators are powered up, the electric gates on the map power up (there's 2 of them for each map so the killer can't just camp it).  Gate takes a bit of time to open once you get to the switch and you still have another short run to get out after it's open.\n\nIf the killer manages to nab all the survivors but one, but the team manages to gotten at least 2 generators at that point, then a 3rd escape in the form of an escape hatch opens.  Said hatch makes a slight howling noise that can be heard from nearby.  Making said hatch it worth a lot of points, and some survivors seek them out even if they don't need to.\n\nKiller on the otherhand must locate and nab each survivor.  You can either nab them in the middle of an action (such as repairing or jumping through a window) or just hit them 2 times.  You then toss them over your shoulder and bring them to sacrificial hooks dotted around the map.  Toss the survivor on a hook, and leave them to wait for a spider entity to eventually appear and kill them.\n\nTo cap it off - the game has a progression system that seems to reward giving a good chase rather than outright destroying your opponantes.  Indeed, it's possible for the killer to make bank in points without every killing any players outright.  Killers who figure this out stop camping hooks because they realize there's more progression for them if they let the victim get rescued so they can chase them around and down them again.  And survivors start doing risky things to get those extra boldness points around the killer.  Makes for a lively game when everybody is on the same page and actually gaming the system a little bit.\n\nThat being said - game does have issues.  There's times where buildings and windows that generate place windows and barriers such a way that it's virtually impossible for the killer to catch the survivor (**MORE OR LESS FIXED NOW - WITH MORE IMPROVEMENTS COMING**) - and some killers just don't \"Get it\" and will camp hooks which kills the fun for the person being camped (**DEVS ARE LOOKING TO CURB MORE SEVERE VERSIONS OF THIS, SOME OF THESE ARE NOW IN TESTING**).   Community has some real tards that will exploit that garbage going both ways and ruin your experience.  But occasionally they'll surprise you and you'll run into a killer who will down the last survivor, but then carry them to the exit and drop them as a kindness for a game well played.\n\nGame is also very unforgiving to the new player (THIS IS THE GAME'S LARGEST FLAW) and can be really really unfair to them.  I don't suggest you pick this up if you hate starting at a disadvantage - because you WILL be placed with killers or survivors that have more unlocks and perks than you do.  If you can't handle that, please give it a pass.  Hopefully - that's something they'll eventually address.\n\nOverall - I liked it enough to buy it for 16 bucks and I don't feel cheated so far.  Certainly not worth 30 bucks I'd say, but 15 or 20 is fair - especially since they've shown they are not adverse to adding new maps and killers for free.\n\nSolid game - but frustrating to play at times.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9/24/2016   50+ hours update\n\nCommunity needs patching - because there is some seriously pissed off players out there.\n\nThere are a couple of issues this game needs to address\n\n- Matchmaking (still the biggest issue - and the biggest hinderance to new players).  You won't get an even fight. (As of 4/7, still an issue)\n- Once you break into the middle ranks, game gets really hard unless you have the meta perks.  So be prepared to derank often until you get those metaperks.  Personally I'm still finding my fun where I can.\n- Hook Camping does need to be looked at.  I don't camp hooks as killer anymore and it's not hurting my score and it indeed makes the survivors a bit more willing to take chances around you and give those scoring opportunities.  I think the game would benefit from a system that would discourage the hook camp while keeping it a viable strat (sometimes there's just a player you NEED to remove from the game)\n\nOverall, I still enjoy the game - but I see more of it's flaws now.  I'm willing to give them time though, still worth 20 bucks as far as I'm concerned.\n\nOCT 23rd - 150 hours in-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGame is really a drag for the killer the higher up through the ranks you get.  But it seems the developers recognize this and are at least making noise that they are about to make some changes to address it.\n\nIt's funny, the game is easy as pie for the killer when you are first starting - the skill floor is lower for the killer.  But then the entire game flip-flops as both sides gain experience - and the Killer is severely hampred by his lower skill cieling.\n\nit's somewhat mitgated by the fact that one or two of the killer's scale well with skill.  Nurse is easily the most powerful killer when in the hands of somebody good at the game - but getting to that point is a chore as her skill floor is higher than some killer's skill ceiling.\n\nAt any rate, game's toxic community and frustrating game play at the higher ranks is starting to take it's toll - but I'm not yet ready to revoke my recomendation.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n4/7 update - 3 new killers and survivors have been added to the game, another about to be released.","timestamp_created":1471801050,"timestamp_updated":1491549606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545349240303039551","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25057578","author":{"steamid":"76561198007490223","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3977,"last_played":1572674292},"language":"english","review":"The game is a GREAT horror game!\n\nTo newcomers, please ignore *most* of the bad reviews. Focus on the reviews, good or bad, with people actually explaining their points without hyperbole. A very unfortunate thing about this game is the amount of haters who can't handle when something doesn't go their way, be it getting owned in game a couple of times, or an unfortunate bug that's not getting fixed now now NOW! You will hear far more from the haters and trolls than you will ever hear from those that genuinely love the game.\n\nIn a nutshell, the game is balanced, despite what some are saying. The complainers are people that have gotten owned 3 times by the same killer and changing tactics never even enters their minds. I've played games as survivor and as killer. I've played against good players and against not so good players. I've won matches and I've lost matches. Every killer and every survivor has their pros and cons. \n\nThe game is a BLAST! Played right, it's extremely tense and scary as a survivor, and very satisfying as a killer. There are enough unique perks for each survivor to make them feel like they \"fill a role\" without feeling like they are out of balance one way or another. Killers are all unique in game play, and you'll find which are your favorites and which aren't. But, they are all balanced fine.\n\nThere are a couple of exploits, and it's not the devs' fault that asshats choose to exploit them. The major ones have been fixed. For the record, \"camping a hook\" (a favorite complaint from haters) is NOT an exploit, as it has pros and cons and is a valid strategy. I've won plenty of games where the killer camped a hook and killed one survivor while others have finished one, even two generators.\n\nThere have been bugs. Obviously, because it's a video game. The devs are active in working on them. The biggest issue was the wait time in the lobby, but this last patch has by and large fixed that, with a small few still having issues. Again, you're going to hear the vocal minority scream while those who are now happy with the game will rarely speak up.\n\nThis is actually my first game review, but I wanted to do it because it's such a fun game and I wanted people to know what a great game this is. The only really bad part of this game? The toxic whiners/haters who scream so loud that you can’t hear the people who have something legitimate to say.\n\nGood luck in game!","timestamp_created":1471801007,"timestamp_updated":1471801119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511784493923187256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25057571","author":{"steamid":"76561198134259470","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1648334033},"language":"russian","review":"нормас","timestamp_created":1471800993,"timestamp_updated":1471800993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25057544","author":{"steamid":"76561198032654783","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":32887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":2338,"last_played":1660607166},"language":"english","review":"My original review was negative due to features I felt the devs had neglected and exploits that had a very big impact on the game. \n\nThey've largely fixed these issues and now I feel this game is deserving of my praise.

Survivors have been nerfed into balanced ratio, whereas with the release of the nurse, now we have a lack of good survivor teams to go around, as all killers who haven't just started can play nurse and take teams apart like abstract art.\n\nAKA with the plans to differentiate and buff the nurse, they inadvertedly broke the game and allowed any killer to guarantee two kills a game, giving them a point up their ranking every time.

It however suffers from horrible balance. Most perks are not worth picking up at all, while a select few are too good to pass up, leaving room for very little customization. Hiding from a killer is pointless as any smart one will not be lost thanks to all the clues they get, not to mention survivors don't get anything to really help them hide. With the new auto aim you can't even try to juke a killer as they will just lock on to you so getting caught is a 99.9% chance of getting hooked. Thankfully hook camping is a thing so the chance of anybody even coming to save you is zero. \n\nThis game is in desperate need of a balance patch to improve the selection of both killer and survivor perks. The fact that some perks are required only hurts new players, as they will have to grind out games against higher rank killers while they lack the tools needed to even survive. Until the developers show a little more care into proper balancing this game is a must avoid as it is just a mix of frustration through glitches, poorly executed features, hook camping, infinite juke spots, messy connectivity, poorly balanced perks, etc.","timestamp_created":1471795357,"timestamp_updated":1471795357,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553398072719573975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25055605","author":{"steamid":"76561198041111325","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1591700692},"language":"russian","review":"крутая игра очень отмосферная тока вот бы получить еще на совсем бесплатно ! )))","timestamp_created":1471794827,"timestamp_updated":1471794827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487084865570068359","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25055492","author":{"steamid":"76561198007366973","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1595684106},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu rqppelle férocement les horror movies des années 70-80, à ambiance glauque. Ya du slash, du sang, des cris, des gens qui courrent pour sauver leur peau, dans des décors bien dégueus et sombres. \nOn peut incarner un survivant ou l'un des tueurs qui rappellent des \"archétypes\"/méchants de ces films : le mec à la tronçonneuse, le fantôme flippant, l'infirmière sournoise, le taré avec des pièges. C'est vraiment \"jouissif\" de jouer un de ces psychopathes. Courir après des petits lapins pas si crétins...\nLes survivants sont au nombre de 4 avec leur propres spécificités : sabotage, soin,... L'arbre des compétences de tous évolue à chaque niveau. \nLe but est pour le tueur d'occire les 4 survivants avant qu'ils n'arrivent à s'enfuir. \nCe jeu est néanmoins perfectible. Mais est vraiment bien en l'état... Les devs y apportent régulièrement des patches et un contenu gratuit vient de sortir... \nLes seuls bémols, il faut être en QWERTY pour jouer. Et il faudrait peut-être varier la façon dont les survivants se barrent.
