Its fun to play alone, but when you start playing it with friends, the only time you will play this game is when your friends are online because playing Dead By Daylight with friends is one of the BEST experiences you will have playing a video game. However there are a lot of bugs that I would literally suck off the devs to fix. But other than that, this game is fricking great and I 100% recommend if you are looking for a fun game to play with some pals.","timestamp_created":1535809209,"timestamp_updated":1535809209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44508535","author":{"steamid":"76561198120391787","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":12525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8846,"last_played":1616052743},"language":"russian","review":"Оригинальная задумка игры, радуют недолгие матчи и отсутствие разделения игр на обычные и рейтинговые.

And do **NOT** buy this game. The reason? You will get a new character you don't know how to play but will still have to face very high ranking survivors. There is no incentive to try new killers. It's saddening how everything the developers do feels like it was just forced on to keep the product alive rather than doing something they can be proud of.\n\n2021: More cheaters, more rage from players. You would think that they would learn how to actually detect very obvious cheats, but I doubt they actually have anyone working on that. Even more-so, cheaters can even remove the 'report' button from their name, so you don't even get potential closure. \n\n2020 Conclusion: Do NOT buy this game in this state or any of the DLCs. It is in a very bad state.\n\nThe game has a lovely blend of action and suspense, but sadly one thing manages to ruin it all, at least for one side. If you're keen on playing Killer, as I am, you'll find that as you go higher up in rank, you start landing against more and more Survive with Friends groups. At lower ranks this isn't an issue, but at higher ranks it is. \n\nWhy?\n\nA SWF group can have a rank 20 and a rank 2 in their team and they'll land against Rank 10-13s or so. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The game offers perks that allow you to see what your team is doing / where they are / if they're chased and so forth. Guess what? When you're in Discord with every other survivor, you don't need those perks. You can very easily have 2 or 3 survivors, often the lower ranks, work on generators while the higher ranks distract the killer.\n\nWhile playing alone as a survivor, you can't really be safe, even if one of your team mates is wounded, there's a bit of suspense. In SWF, your friend can just tell you that the killer is chasing them, so 3 of them can do generators all at once.\n\nThe developers need to add some form of balancing to this. And oh, they recommend dodging the lobby, but is that really a solution?\n\nEdit: The worst kind of events they could ever do are the double bloodpoints ones. Survivors and killers will 'work together' by landing in the same lobby and will farm other survivors. The game becomes unplayable on survivor side during those events.\n\nRe-Edit: The developers have nerfed Ruin and buffed toolbox speed because generators weren't going fast enough as is. The game is focused on survive with friends teams and landing against a decent one will turn your day sour.\n\nAugust 2021 Edit: They changed hit detection to always favor the survivor now. This means that hits you'd get as a killer would still show blood on pallets, but no longer hit. This also means that a new breed of cheaters who use lag switches (yes, that's a thing again) have appeared, since so long as their client says they weren't hit, the server believes it.\n\nSeptember 2021 Edit: MMR was added, somehow ruining the game even more, all while the Pinhead release managed to create bugs for Freddy. Imagine caring so little about the game that you develop. This somehow feels like the opposite of a passion project.","timestamp_created":1535765201,"timestamp_updated":1631205916,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528174936771392822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44498530","author":{"steamid":"76561198068462610","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":52704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":244,"playtime_at_review":4929,"last_played":1660545894},"language":"english","review":"This game is great.

(play the game to understand what im talking about). sounds like just alturistic survivors who just want to save their friends? that's not what you'll be thinking when you fall victim to this. ( you'll most likely think \"you son of a  _'_ç_&è_è'ç_è&\"). thing is, like i said, these problems come from the community itself. and even with adding new perks to change that, (borrowed time and lightborn), these problems stay, and that makes this game sometimes very frustrating to play (trust me there i no fun in staying all game on a hook with the killer right in front of you, and noone coming to save you because the killer is just going to kill both you, if they do) (and spending half of the game chassing a survivor aroung a single piece of wood, and the other half with a white screen because they just blinded you is no fun either)\n\nthat being said, these problems far from occur at evey single game, most of the time, you'll find nice survivors, a nice killer, and you'll have a good time. note that campers usually hang around rank 20 and frustrating survivors are usaully at righer ranks, so you'll find better games between rank 10 and rank 15. for me it works like that, anyways.\n\nso my advice : download this game (or not, you do what you want, but if you do), and play the game to have fun. don't be an asshat, don't be toxic, don't ruin people's day, don't let others ruin your day, and have fun. but then again i can't do anything to stop you or your toxicity, but if we end up in the same day, you will find yourself face-to-face with a very angry player. \n\nalso, remember that killers are supposed to kill you, but they are also controlled by human beings, most of them capable of compassion. so if you end up alone if a trial because every one else disconnected, chances are, the killer will let you walk free out of compassion (they'll also probaly let you smash some palets on them just to farm points.) but still be ready to run, just in case.","timestamp_created":1535744597,"timestamp_updated":1535744597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44493679","author":{"steamid":"76561198282843752","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":1409,"last_played":1659454851},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaslarinizla eglenmek icin harika bir oyun.

В данной игре я увидел отличную гарфику (хорошо проработаны мелкие детали), написанные предистории, как обычных персонажей так и маньяков. Отдельную благодарность хочу выделить за пасхалки в игре, которые заставляют пересмотреть давно забытые и замечательные фильмы (Техасская резня бензопилой, Кошмар на улице Вязов, Пятница, 13-е, Хэллоуин и тд.)\nВо-вторых хочу отметить производительность самой игры. Хоть игра и требует высокие системные требования, у меня с моим железом отлично потянула на средних настройках, поэтому если вам нравиться игры про выживалки и ваш компьютер или ноутбук тянет эту игру на минималках, то советую взять эту игру:)))","timestamp_created":1535689317,"timestamp_updated":1535689317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44479254","author":{"steamid":"76561198376721984","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20898,"last_played":1659193996},"language":"english","review":"Great game!","timestamp_created":1535689113,"timestamp_updated":1535689113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44479161","author":{"steamid":"76561198411070750","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1646570100},"language":"english","review":"Why i can't launch the DBD I just bought it yesterday it comes our win64 shipping.exe error.

BHVR is really getting super greedy with this shit. Patch after patch full of bugs, content that is just so bare, perks that are so boring, the grind is absolutely horrendous. Buying this game now, when there are 81 survivor perks and like 72 killer perks will require you to spend hundreds of millions of bloodpoints just getting those perks on ONE killer or survivor. Not to mention you have to multiply all of that by 3 because of the grind in the game, so it's even worse. \n\nI really do enjoy this game sometimes, but holy shit, the Twins, Trickster, and now Nemesis? Big bad Nemesis is as poor quality as he is? He looks great, but come on, you have to hit a survivor once with his ability before you can injure them with his ability, and they get a speed boost on all three hits. That's something that sounds minor but means a lot when it comes to time crunch, which is what you'll be doing as you get more and more into the game.\n\nThe Resident Evil chapter sealed the fate of every other asymmetrical game that's trying to get two legs to stand on. Nemesis blasted those legs across Raccoon City, and they never had arms to begin with, so there ain't no crawling to get them. Good for BHVR for getting such an important license to the survival horror genre, but good God, was it a bad way to bring it into DBD.\n\nI really can't recommend this game anymore in it's current state. Here's hoping this boycott or whatever works, I know I won't be buying anything from them for a while until the quality improves, even if I do keep playing it due to my crippling perfectionism and completionism.","timestamp_created":1535688373,"timestamp_updated":1624813422,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505574882030487061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44479043","author":{"steamid":"76561198322143484","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":79224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":21,"playtime_at_review":17217,"last_played":1659783821},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏很用心，皮肤也很精致，但再平衡性上，制作组还希望加油，制作组为何不多增加点遛鬼点，博弈区，然大砍一砍修机，本来不就是体验追与被追的刺激的，谁想玩修机模拟器啊.......","timestamp_created":1535688018,"timestamp_updated":1596561507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513282239437103271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44478652","author":{"steamid":"76561198098004275","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16088,"last_played":1653603655},"language":"spanish","review":"Es hora que hagan Free To Play el juego basta de los DLC.
