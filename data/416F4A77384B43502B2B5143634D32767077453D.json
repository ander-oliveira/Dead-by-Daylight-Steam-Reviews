Es gab ja lange Zeit noch Probleme mit vielen Bugs oder DCs. Das hat sich aber mittlerweile gelegt. Auch die Balance zwischen den 4 Survivorn und dem Killer ist gut wie selten durch die letzten updates. Zwei killer sollten noch verbessert werden, die Devs haben das aber schon angekündigt etwas zu tun. Bugs findet man keine gravierenden mehr und DCs sind eigtl kaum vorhanden wenn man nicht eine Internetleitung wie ein Stück Schwarzbrot hat. Wenn sich allerdings jmd überlegt, das Spiel zu holen um killer zu spielen, sollte sich das überlegen. eingige aus ddf Community, hauptsächlich Leute aus dem Survivor Bereich, sind extrem toxic und man kann, wenn man kein pro gamer ist, schnell mal als killer zun opfer werden. Ansonsten habe ich nur geringfügige sachen zu bemängeln, wie bspw. das man sich mit der krankenschwester nicht überall durchteleportieren kann.

Where to begin...….\n\nDead by daylight is a very interesting game. I came across it from my sister who has over 2,000 hours on record and let me play a little bit of it. At first I loved survivor it was the heartbeat and the rush of running. It was honestly something new but I wish I never tried killer. Once I played one game of killer I was instantly hooked! HA SEE WHAT I DID THERE? But soon after I hit rank 12 thing's changed. I noticed how easily I was run around a map pallet to pallet. Soon it dawned on me that unless survivor makes a mistake and I get a free hit. I would never actually catch them and by the time that I did I lost 3 or 4 generator's. At first I thought I was just bad at the game being relatively new but it began to happen every goddamn game. Then the toxic survivor's would teabag and blind you and not leave the game after the exit gates are open. Let that sink in for a second. THE EXIT GATES ARE OPEN BUT THE SURVIVOR'S ARE STILL IN THE GAME CLEASING TOTEM'S TEABAGGING AND LOOKING FOR EXTRA POINT'S. That right there summed up what the problem in dead by daylight. Killer's are too weak and have too many negative thing's put against them. Not to mention not feared in the slightest. Playing survivor just isn't fun when it's the same thing every single game. It's usually hillbilly or nurse because of there quick downing potential. It's a real shame but even after all of the updates to the game. Killer's are still too weak. It's not the skill of the killer anymore when you can run to a pallet still even though they supposedly fixed that in one of the earlier patches. Not to mention being looped around one until your at the point of literally screaming. And now killer's have to run certain perks to try and counter a mechanic that shouldn't have even been in the game in the first place. Survivor isn't fun because it's all the same killer's and watching one of your teammate's loop the killer into 3 generator's is sad to see. I don't even take the game seriously anymore killer is just a bad joke and survivor is too strong. I PURPOSLY MAKE A MISTAKE just so the killer can get a hook in at least. Watching the killer rage quit is even worse. After the developer got his ass kicked by those Korean's he still doesn't play his own game and doesn't know how to balance it. I just hope in one of the future updates they balance the game out like it should have been. Until then this game is gonna run out of killer's soon and it'll just be a bad meme on steam. If you want to get looped for a thousand year's play killer in DBD and see for yourself. If you want to make the killer quit and be a toxic survivor who think's killers are OP play SWF. Bring all purple flashlight's and decisive strikes. Take care DBD a failed product of the system. The biased one sided system.","timestamp_created":1533217938,"timestamp_updated":1533218235,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485329121351242065","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43891576","author":{"steamid":"76561198398146613","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":79990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69296,"last_played":1655133754},"language":"schinese","review":"UI我不管，刀气不改回来我差评不改！\n\n\n刀气改回来了！我改了！","timestamp_created":1533216087,"timestamp_updated":1614127088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43891545","author":{"steamid":"76561198444791227","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3765,"last_played":1658326981},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是好游戏，就是对新手不够友好orz。","timestamp_created":1533215981,"timestamp_updated":1533215981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43891307","author":{"steamid":"76561198119763898","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1081,"last_played":1586015425},"language":"tchinese","review":"連續斷線

I am talking about either making it so there is a VERY SMALL skill check during wiggle that can allow them to escape as an example.

Die Killer wurden mit den letzten updates so viel stärker gemacht, weil alle immer wegen swf rum heulen. Einerseits ist es verständlich, da du als killer gegen eine full swf lobby fast keine chance hast aber andererseits ist es als solo spieler echt viel zu schwer geworden alleine schon zu entkommen, da man den anderen spielern meistens komplett egal ist. Also für einen solo spieler ist das game nicht (mehr) wirklich zum empfehlen. Das Game hat aber noch viele andere Probleme: - Das reporten von Spielern ist total unnötig, scheint den developern einfach egal zu sein.(Nur gut fürs Gewissen)  - Fast jeder killer ist am campen oder tunneln, da es eh nicht bestaft wird. - Mutiges spielen, wie zb Taschenlampe nutzen, teammate aus dem keller befreien o. ä. wird 0 belohnt -Neue dlc killer sind anfangs viel zu stark und werden erst monate danach generft... Und vieles mehr. Einfach nur schade um das Game!","timestamp_created":1533149695,"timestamp_updated":1533149695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518454432487487793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43878186","author":{"steamid":"76561198139190491","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4571,"last_played":1658746419},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Flashlight","timestamp_created":1533148814,"timestamp_updated":1533148814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43877929","author":{"steamid":"76561198450765808","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":73749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13519,"last_played":1628296506},"language":"english","review":"best game","timestamp_created":1533147929,"timestamp_updated":1533147929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43877913","author":{"steamid":"76561198237560878","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15901,"last_played":1640889526},"language":"polish","review":"Dobra gra bardzo nastawia na team play polecam :D","timestamp_created":1533147852,"timestamp_updated":1542833982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43877379","author":{"steamid":"76561198050990795","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":44626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15575,"last_played":1657773933},"language":"brazilian","review":"-Dead by Daylight é um jogo de sobrevivência 4x1, consiste em um assassino tentando matar os sobreviventes, enquanto que os sobreviventes a fim de escapar precisam achar e ligar os geradores para abrir uma porta.\n-No momento que eu estou escrevendo esta análise, contém no jogo 13 sobreviventes e 12 assassinos ( alguns de dlc )\n-As dlcs desse jogo tem como conteúdo um assassino e um sobrevivente ( vale bem mais a pena comprar em promo )\n-O jogo é bom.
