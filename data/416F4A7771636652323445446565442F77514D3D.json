has some really exciting aspects to it, but the matchmaking system is why I'm likely uninstalling this game soon.\n\nSurvivor Review\nNew season if you will, has just begun. My first or second match, being \"Ash 4\" the lowest rank imaginable, got a \"Iridescent 1\" player who is literally the top rank on my team. That may sound like it's in my favor, however if you're someone who is Iri 1 rank and you get someone whose doing their first or second match, you're not going to have a great time. I don't play enough to know all the maps, loops, etc so getting people who play significantly more and have a certain expectation for matchmaking leads to poor experiences for both. The toxicity runs rampant, because some players can't fathom new people might start playing the game so the after match lobby usually makes you not want to play further.\n\nKiller Review\nSame thing with matchmaking being abysmal, my first game of the season as \"Ash 4\" I get a survivor who was \"Gold 4\". I've had numerous games last season where I had a full wipe, and would regularly down 2-3 per game at/around that rank. My first few matches this season I haven't been able to get a single down.\n\nKillers honestly experience a lot more toxicity, probably because you've got 4 candidates on the other team who can be toxic. My favorite has been when 4 people run toolboxes and every single time you go to hook they'll body block it and sabotage hook. Which, as a killer if all of them run this, is a pretty miserable time. Or another go to as a survivor is the spam tbagging, or rapidly clicking flashlight at the killer. Also normally when the gates open, multiple survivors sit at the door and wait for you to walk up purely to troll you. They'll spam tbag and spam flashlight and wait for you to try and get a hit to walk through the gate. That honestly led me to just sit AFK on my phone every time the exit doors open, just so I don't have to watch that toxic behavior and just wait for my match to end.","timestamp_created":1656657777,"timestamp_updated":1656657777,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117976515","author":{"steamid":"76561199190438588","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":279,"playtime_at_review":11137,"last_played":1660297001},"language":"tchinese","review":"人類.殺手的平衡感覺真的不太好做到完美  \n\n入坑的話建議還是要有一定的抗壓性  當然也推薦新手來玩畢竟人多才好玩","timestamp_created":1656656805,"timestamp_updated":1656656805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117976170","author":{"steamid":"76561199090498448","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":771,"playtime_at_review":2882,"last_played":1660577789},"language":"polish","review":":>","timestamp_created":1656656197,"timestamp_updated":1656656197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117975942","author":{"steamid":"76561199095698786","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1660486053},"language":"english","review":"FUN ALONE.

It has been used since salt crystals were first noticed in trapped pools of sea water. Its use is practical only in warm climates where the evaporation rate exceeds the precipitation rate, either annually or for extended periods, and ideally, where there are steady prevailing winds. Solar salt production is, typically, the capturing of salt water in shallow ponds where the sun evaporates most of the water. The concentrated brine precipitates the salt which is then gathered by mechanical harvesting machines. Any impurities that may be present in the brine are drained off and discarded prior to harvesting.\n\nUsually two types of ponds are used. First is the concentrating pond, where the salty water from the ocean or salt lake is concentrated. The second is called the crystallizing pond, where the salt is actually produced.Crystallizing ponds range from to 40 to 200 acres with a foot-thick floor of salt resulting from years of depositions. During the salt-making season of four to five months, brine flows continuously through these ponds. This is a saturated brine solution, containing as much salt as it can hold, so pure salt crystallizes out of the solution as the water evaporates. Natural chemical impurities are returned to the salt water source.To enter a salt mine, miners go down a shaft from the Earth’s surface to the salt bed. There are two shafts in each Morton mine – one for personnel and one to lower materials and equipment into the mine, as well as to hoist the mined rock salt to the surface. The shafts also are used to deliver a constant supply of fresh air to the miners while they work hundreds to thousands of feet below the surface. Most mine shafts are lined with a concrete wall called a shaft liner.\n\nSalt is mined by the room and pillar method. It is removed in a checkerboard pattern to leave permanent, solid salt pillars for mine roof support. Usually 45 to 65 percent of the salt is removed. The room height may average 18 feet in a bedded deposit to 100 feet in a dome mine.\n\nNormally, the first operation is undercutting. Large machines cut a slot 10 or more feet in depth across the bottom of a solid salt wall. This leaves a smooth floor for picking up the salt after blasting.\n\nNext, small holes are drilled into the salt wall to a depth of 10 or more feet and explosives are loaded into the drilled holes. After the work shift, the explosives are set off electrically. Several hundred to several thousand tons of rock salt are blasted and fall onto the mine floor.\n\nEquipment is used to load and haul the salt to machines that crush and feed the salt onto a conveyor belt. The lumps are conveyed to a series of stations for crushing and additional sizing of the lumps. The salt is then placed in a storage bin to await hoisting to the surface.\n\nThe above ground processing of the rock salt consists of screening the mined salt into various marketable sizes by sorting through mechanically operated screens. When separated, each size is conveyed to its individual storage bin to await packaging for shipment or to be loaded as bulk salt into railroad cars, trucks, river barges or lake boats for shipment to
