pesar de ser un juego repetitivo con pocas mecánicas básicas y con algunos errores, los desarrolladores intentan estar pendientes de la comunidad y poco a poco ir mejorándolo.\n\nEl típico juego del gato y el ratón, perseguir o ser perseguido, con una temática tétrica y angustiosa, sobretodo para los principiantes.\nComo decía tiene una jugabilidad y unas mecánicas realmente sencillas, que cuanto mayor experiencia y rango adquirimos mayor complejo se torna el juego, podemos escoger entre ser supervivientes o asesino, desde mi punto de vista el juego en altos rangos es más difícil para asesinos que para supervivientes.\n\nHay algunos desbalances en el juego, todo superviviente y asesino tiene sus propias habilidades únicas (aunque al desbloquearlas podemos ponerselas a otros personajes), y algunas de ellas mejores que otras, aun tienen que arreglar y ajustar una serie de descompensaciones pero poco a poco van afinando el juego. Teniendo también un buen sistema de progresión y satisfacción. Pero si realmente quieres sacarle todo el jugo al videojuego, tendrías que ver streamings y vídeos para comprender el juego en altos rangos en qué esferas se mueve, haciéndose algo más complejo, divertido y \"divertido\".\n\nEl juego se convierte en algo realmente aburrido y repetitivo cuando ya llevas unas horas jugadas, hasta que finalmente te limitas a jugar solo con amigos, que es el punto más fuerte de este juego, las risas y cagadas con los amigos. Aún así, de vez en cuando una partida en individual para matar el mono siempre viene bien.\n\nComo ya he dicho es un buen juego y lo recomiendo, pero lo mejor es jugar en premade con amigos.","timestamp_created":1561927114,"timestamp_updated":1561927114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52596651","author":{"steamid":"76561198075323581","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":17326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3594,"last_played":1658876675},"language":"brazilian","review":"Top demais!!","timestamp_created":1561927075,"timestamp_updated":1561927075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52595512","author":{"steamid":"76561198034945306","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":85099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40447,"last_played":1658580678},"language":"swedish","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1561926918,"timestamp_updated":1583449864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52595430","author":{"steamid":"76561198335122203","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":79287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36395,"last_played":1659373588},"language":"english","review":"Sad, sad how they don't listen to the community and then blame the lack of interaction ON the community.\nTherefor the community gets frustrated.
