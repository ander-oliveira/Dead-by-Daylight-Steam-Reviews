Only buy it at sales if you have friends to play with. The game is missing several necessary fixes and quality of life features. \n\nYou have to reinvite all your friends each round, but not only that, after a round it places you into a lobby, where you have to go back to the menu, select play with friends and reinvite everyone one by one.\n\nWant to play as a survivor? Don't bother, before getting to level 30 your survivor is completely useless. It can be useless after level 30 if you weren't lucky enough to get all the perks that can help you. Imagine this. You have less than 10% to escape from a hook, and if you do manage to get off the killer get notified, pretty much seconds after you get off he is on your trail because most killers start with a perk that can track you by your whimpers, blood or just simply see you through obstacles if you are injured.\n\nWant to play as a killer? Prepare to be hated, low rated and abused. People will block your steam profile, because there is no other ways implemented to never get to play with the same player again. If you ok with that you son of a b* then enjoy the infinite amount of XP by camping hooked players or just collecting them when they are in dying status next to a hooked person so you can keep eye on both. Easy game easy life.\n\nThere are killers that are straight up invisible, or have terror radius so small that you only notice them when they stick a knife up your ass.\n\nI only enjoy this game for a few rounds with friends. I got it on a good sale, so no regrets, but I heavily recommend to play something else.","timestamp_created":1510591541,"timestamp_updated":1510591541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482062786817550659","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36494902","author":{"steamid":"76561198164498632","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":427790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":728,"playtime_at_review":364243,"last_played":1659807568},"language":"russian","review":"♡","timestamp_created":1510590882,"timestamp_updated":1658412516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36494788","author":{"steamid":"76561198192844465","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":90304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1051,"playtime_at_review":2841,"last_played":1660591362},"language":"polish","review":"ty no nie wiem ale fajne\nale gdyby nie camperzy to ideoloo xD","timestamp_created":1510590520,"timestamp_updated":1574879056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36494701","author":{"steamid":"76561198155582447","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":122175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1666,"playtime_at_review":17785,"last_played":1660577833},"language":"russian","review":"Очень интересная игра,всем советую играть","timestamp_created":1510590232,"timestamp_updated":1510590232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536111056804656982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36494469","author":{"steamid":"76561198511781510","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":349977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2001,"playtime_at_review":123864,"last_played":1660564273},"language":"english","review":"So, Its been a while that this Game is Still alive and i'm really suprised about that\n\nCan't really say something special right now..\n\nYou guys doing So much for the community, balancing this game and trying to fix every bug thats comes\n\n","timestamp_created":1510589442,"timestamp_updated":1529847836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48245614767074585","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36494359","author":{"steamid":"76561198410217072","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2288,"last_played":1613935947},"language":"english","review":"best game ever!!! great game and super addicting.

EDIT: Since i have played this game for 300+ hours now i can now give a good review.  People here complain about how this game is survivor sided and i agree with it. This game tried to get a fix with the Emblem System but all that did was push the killer pip more to survivor (that means that survivor now has more control over the killer) and the killer can not make the depip since the survivors hold the power.  This game is supposed to be an assymetrical survival multiplayer horror game where 4 weak survivors go against 1 strong killer. At the current state of the game the survivors are more powerful than the killer is.

этого дня.\n\nОн охотится за вами\nВы даже этого не знали..\nВы для него как твари..\nПотому что с ним не как надо поступали...\n\nНу вот настал тот час.\nСлышишь крики....\nИ покинул этот мир один из вас\nА орал он словно психи...\n\nНу вот заведен первый геник\nНо нету все равно одного из вас...\nИ ты метаешься словно веник..\nПотому что настал тот час....\n\nА он не спит ищет вас....\nА вы в надежде убежать...\nИ провомолвил один из вас- ВОТ ЖЕ ГОНДУРАС!!!\nДа и некому вас спасать....\n\nВот прошло еще немного время\nВсе твои друзья легли....\nИ взошло то истенное семя\nКогда мы сбежать

stimme anderen zu, was die geteilte Meinung über das Spiel angeht, da hier allerdings nur ja/nein verfügbar ist nehme ich dennoch ja, da es mir auch nach all der Probleme immer noch irgendwie Spaß macht. \nIch schildere jetzt die Spielprobleme, die bei mir in meiner Zeit aufgetreten sind.\n\n\nDC's und Onlineranking:\nIch habe gestern entspannt spielen wollen und es gab wohl massige Serverprobleme. Hatte mit den Pips Rang 16 erreicht und hart dafür gearbeitet. Jetzt bin ich auf Rang 18, weil es sehr schwer war ein gutes Match zu finden bis ich dann das Spiel geschlossen habe. \nDas erste Match war super laggy und es war reines Glück, dass ich gewonnen habe, da ich vor Lags nicht sah wo ich überhaupt war, danach ging es bergab - ein Match wurde komplett gecrasht und ich bin auf Rang 17 ohne Pips gefallen, das danach hatte zwei DC's von Überlebenden, während die andere Person schon tot war und ich an den Haken kam. Insgesamt liebe ich das Spiel, aber es ist frustrierend, wenn ich dauernd meinen Rank verliere, denn es ist schon mal vorgekommen.\n\nDLC's und OP-Killer bzw. Spielerverhalten:\nLeider, und das wurde oft bemerkt, gibt es mittlerweile viele Killer/Überlebende und dann auch noch die richtig guten nur als DLC zu kaufen. Bei denen, die Lizenzrechte brauchen verstehe ich es, da diese auch kosten und man irgendwo wieder einholen muss und wenn mir ein Killer besonders zusagt, dann kaufe ich ihn auch (selbst wenn es im Sale sein sollte).\nIch besitze also selbst drei der DLC's, einfach, weil ich sie aus Nostalgie besitzen wollte.\nIch spiele allerdings maintechnisch Survivor und nicht Killer, da das meine \"Rolle\" ist, die mir den Kick verschafft.. nur leider verschafft es mir aktuell eher Frust und Gereiztheit.\n\nEinige der neuen Killer sind leider sehr overpowered - Freddy, der Doctor, Leatherface, die Jägerin - und es ist nur als gutes Team möglich, da lebend rauszukommen, insbesondere, wenn der Killer weiß was er macht.\nFreddy ist ein Killer, gegen den es genauso viel Spaß machen kann, aber genauso gut einfach ätzend sein kann, da er, wenn er dich in seiner Traumwelt hat, restlos deine Aura sieht bis du aufwachst.. und so schnell geht das nicht, dass der nicht zu dir rüberlaufen könnte, außer, wenn du extremes Glück hast.\nGleiches gilt für den Doctor, der, wenn er andere im Wahnsinn hat und sei es nur Stufe 1, schnell weiß, wo man ist.. \nDie Jägerin ist davon noch am harmslosesten, taucht aber in vielen Matches auf und ist durch ihre Distanzwürfe besonders gefährlich, was durch Perks und Add-On noch verstärkt werden kann.\nEs ist also recht frustrierend gegen diese Killer zu spielen und sie brauchen dringend eine Regulierung.\n\nAußerdem ist mir nicht klar, wieso Camping als Spielstrategie gelten darf, denn es ist für einen ohnehin starken Killer eine Versicherung, dass die Überlebenden einander nicht retten können und ich finde es sehr unnötig, wenn ein Killer straight facecamping betreibt anstatt faire Chancen zu gewähren.\nManche mögen mir da widersprechen, aber ich selbst verliere direkt den Spaß am Spiel, wenn ich das Camping bemerke - sei es, weil ich am Haken hänge und der Typ mir in der Lunze hängt oder weil ich meine Teammates nicht retten kann, was mich als hilfsbereiter Spieler, der gerne alle raus haben will, auch echt annervt.\n\nHilfsbereit ist auch das letzte, was ich ansprechen möchte: Spielerverhalten der Survivor.\nIn letzter Zeit häuft sich, dass Überlebende den Killer mocken und triezen, teabaggen und pallett looping machen und das Spiel nicht mit dem dafür geforderten Ernst nehmen, sondern einfach herumalbern bis Killer quitten, weil sie darauf verständlicherweise keine Lust haben.\nAuch ist mir zunehmend passiert, dass meine Teamkollegen nicht gerade von der, sagen wir, netten Natur waren und eher egoistisch gewartet haben bis ein anderer oder ich starb, um selbst die eigene Haut zu retten, wo ich selbst verletzt noch zu dem Angehakten laufe und versuche, denjenigen da raus zu holen (weil es sich so gehört, es ist ein Teamspiel).\nIch warte immer an der Tür, ob alle in Sicherheit sind bis ich sie verlasse, außer ich werde vom Killer dazu gezwungen und muss gehen.\n\nDennoch muss ich abschließend sagen, dass trotz der aktuellen Kritikpunkte, das Spiel für mich ansprechend und spaßig ist, nur eben in deutlich weniger Runden als ursprünglich, da sich das Gegenverhalten aller leider verschlechtert hat.\nMit guten Teammates und einem fairen Killer ist es aber ein aufregendes und spannendes Spiel und ich genieße es und freue mich über Siege oder nehme - bei fairem Verhalten - auch Niederlagen lächelnd in Kauf.\nDas Leveling im Blutnetz macht Spaß und ich bin immer neugierig, welche Perks und Items mir verfügbar gemacht werden.\nWenn man dicke Nerven hat und Freude an einem Spiel dieses Konzeptes hat, dann empfehle ich es, aber für die, die mit den aktuellen Problemen und Unbalancing nicht umgehen können ist es leider nichts.\nIm Endeffekt muss es jeder selbst ein paar Runden ausprobieren, ob es einem wirklich zusagt oder nicht.","timestamp_created":1510571879,"timestamp_updated":1510571879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36489811","author":{"steamid":"76561198239646704","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":27369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5501,"last_played":1640410745},"language":"koreana","review":"재평가 들어갑니다.일단 데바데는 서버가 분리되어있지 않기때문에 서람이 적을 때에 들어가면 빨핑이 자주 잡히는 것을 볼수 있다. 그러나 사람이 많을때 들어가도 고랭이라면 빨핑이 자주 잡힌다. 그렇다는 것은 이게임의 동접자가 적어서 주변의 사람을 잡지 못한다는 것이다. 그렇다 빨핑똥망겜이다. 그런데 게임성은 좋다. 따라서 5점 만점에 3점주겠다 저랭이라면 4점 주겠다","timestamp_created":1510571801,"timestamp_updated":1517123572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36489138","author":{"steamid":"76561198055781303","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3692,"last_played":1532396109},"language":"english","review":"super fun and interesting","timestamp_created":1510568584,"timestamp_updated":1510568584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36489134","author":{"steamid":"76561198781449857","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":36153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33075,"last_played":1602222460},"language":"tchinese","review":"不是不玩了 是容量太大57G 知不知要下載多久 用500KB起碼2天 所以放棄 \n先在超過30G都不玩","timestamp_created":1510568570,"timestamp_updated":1639189413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36489102","author":{"steamid":"76561198364925183","num_games_owned":624,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1608761347},"language":"schinese","review":"一个恐怖游戏硬生生被玩成了鬼畜游戏，里面的鬼大叔人都好好呢，脾气好，说话又好听，还会教我修电闸，呆在里面都不想出去了(´；ω；`๑)","timestamp_created":1510568426,"timestamp_updated":1510568426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610538661479949951","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36488571","author":{"steamid":"76561197985312497","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2357,"last_played":1550944376},"language":"russian","review":"very cool","timestamp_created":1510565729,"timestamp_updated":1510565729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36488164","author":{"steamid":"76561198378467827","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1587118919},"language":"schinese","review":"可以","timestamp_created":1510563316,"timestamp_updated":1510563316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36488059","author":{"steamid":"76561198329543123","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2039,"last_played":1608743170},"language":"english","review":"Great game! but still needs improvements in match making!","timestamp_created":1510562808,"timestamp_updated":1510562808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36488039","author":{"steamid":"76561198148964043","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":349432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":205,"playtime_at_review":41188,"last_played":1660089222},"language":"english","review":"DBD Has been one of the most entertaining experiences I've ever had.

I love this game -- the concept of it, that is. However, the latest updates, nerfs, and especially DLC nerfs (looking at you, Nightmare and Cannibal) unfairly favoring the survivors is beyond frustrating. This games balance is broken. Even if I try my hardest and do the best that I can, none of my skill will out-perform the nerfs on killers and the overpowered perks of the survivors.\n\nFix this ****, devs. FIX IT.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT:\n\n8/26/2018 -- So far the game has gone through multiple revisions. Sadly, the game developers have struggled to keep a good balance between the killers and survivors, the game balance swaying from side to side. I can hoenastly say that the game seems to be a lot more balanced than it has been in the past, but it still has a long way to go. I have switched my review from a negative to a positive, in hopes that this balance will continue.\n\n7/20/2022 -- As of the latest rework, the game seems far more balanced. My time in this game as of now is 50/50 between survivor and killer, and I can honestly say that both roles feel much better as a whole. The UI rework is refreshing, the perk reworks were done (mostly) well, except for unnecessary reworks such as Iron Will. Dead hard is harder to use, but actually feels rewarding to use right, instead of getting a free bolt to the nearest obstacle. The added 10 seconds to generators feels nice, lengthening the round a bit (in higher ranks the games go by way too fast in my opinion). As killer, the faster pallet and vaulting feels fluid. I'm not steamrolling survivor teams constantly (or anymore than I did before the rework, anyway). I've come across more endurance saves, but nothing crazy, and regardless, I enjoy having to work for my kill anyway. The bloodweb grind is finally a little less, well, grindy, and having perks of prestiged characters was much needed. I wish having prestige characters before the update gave you more of an award besides a perk charm, but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Overall, the rework seems to have been a positive one, and I can honestly say that I'm having more fun with Dead by Daylight than I ever did in the past.\n\nThis isn't to say that the community is as toxic as ever with camping/tunneling killers and bully squad survivors, both of which make me want to tear my hair out, crawl up the wall, and screech at the chandelier, but it's certainly a start lol","timestamp_created":1510527411,"timestamp_updated":1658340465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36481075","author":{"steamid":"76561198261572163","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10926,"last_played":1649186500},"language":"russian","review":"Нормально\n","timestamp_created":1510527284,"timestamp_updated":1510527284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36481034","author":{"steamid":"76561198065513848","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":85307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3794,"last_played":1638915784},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo top desse mds","timestamp_created":1510527119,"timestamp_updated":1510527119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503267943859100342","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36480229","author":{"steamid":"76561198013081314","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3693,"last_played":1549790304},"language":"koreana","review":"진입장벽이 존재하지만 고비만 넘긴다면 그야말로 갓겜","timestamp_created":1510523772,"timestamp_updated":1510523772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36480195","author":{"steamid":"76561198378416917","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5624,"last_played":1656129841},"language":"english","review":"simple yet addictive. easil get lost with the time playing this lol","timestamp_created":1510523680,"timestamp_updated":1510523680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36480118","author":{"steamid":"76561198210302341","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":102088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4702,"last_played":1561464689},"language":"german","review":"Ausgezeichnetes Soiel macht sowohl als killer als auch als Surviver viel Spaß und wird auch nicht eintönig","timestamp_created":1510523390,"timestamp_updated":1510523390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518507480621338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36479766","author":{"steamid":"76561198139024514","num_games_owned":905,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":146828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":62768,"last_played":1660076094},"language":"english","review":"This is an M for mature game for adults. \nYet they censor any type of cursing or \"bad word...\"\nEven thought the game is about some creepy rap*st killer in a mask* killing people lol\nThat is actually pathetic.. not to mention the word f*ggot* or anything relating to that word is banned.

Not knowing the killer before starting the game is a good thing but against overpowered killers like the Doc for example you can't even build your perks against him.\nWhile killers have the chance to go into the match with an insane perk build you are pretty frigged up as a survivor since you can only make a general perk build and hope for the best.\n\nOverall the game is pretty decent and i feel like there were a lot of improvements especially when it comes to loading time and performance but i also think it got way more unbalanced and is not as fun as it was when it came out.

Or I can become the monster and slay them all? \n\n[b]Amazing![/b] At the first look....\n\nI am really into horror-movies. I love old and new slasher-movies. I didn't recognize this game until end of 2016. I bought it and instantly fell in love with this game. I spent already 2000+ hours of my life with it. So let's talk about it.\n\nGameplay:\nAs survivor you have to repair generators to get the exit doors working. There are four survivors versus one killer. The killer walks a bit faster than the survivors. If he has hit you the second time you go down on the ground. If you go down he can hang you on a hook and you die at the third time hooked. Might?\n\nOther survivors can heal you after the first slash. The killer shouldn't be too near actually.\nThey can take you off the hooks. They can sabotage the hooks. They CAN. A lot of people don't do anything. They do a generator, flee from the killer to the other side of the map and let you hang on the hook. At the first chance, they open the exit and get out. Best excuse I got so far: \"I am not meant to help you... Help yourself.\"\nSometimes people heal you while the killer is approaching. You can't move at that moment and they just release you shortly before the killer hits you. Only by a trick you can escape (press 1 or 2 to show with your character).\n\nSometimes the survivors die one by one and you are the last. If there are already two generators repaired, you can find a hatch and escape, without doing the last generators alone and opening the exit doors. Sadly a lot of killers just camp or even facecamp (i.e. they stand directly before your hook), so noone can rescue you. \nWhat, in my eyes, destroys the whole game-idea. Some killers seem to be afraid to lose rank and don't get enough points. Maybe it gets them a hard one. These players always say \"It's not forbidden!\". Right, but it's a difference of being an idiot that ruins the game and someone who wants to have fun.\n\nAnother problem are people which leave the match. As survivor you have to do their job now too and are even more in danger.\nAs killer: If a survivor leaves, you get a small amount of points as a compensation. Which is in my eyes not enough. After three years a time penalty is invented. Finally...\n\nTechnical:\nGraphics are not pretty or something special. The fleeing survivor has no time for beautiful landscapes. Amazing graphics wouldn't fit in this type of game anyways.\n\nSo you should expect that the game runs fluent and without problems? Sometimes you will have lags, like in any other game. Some people are so laggy, that it affects you in a horrible way. While fleeing from the killer you run against walls and trees, get stuck at invisible edges of the floor. So you get easily hit or caught by the killer. But you can see the pings of the other players in the lobby before the match. Too high ping for you? Just leave the lobby and search for another match.\n\nCheats.\nAs survivor: killers without a single perk can carry you around the whole map while you can't get off them. \nAs killer: some people seem to lag, but don't hit a tree or a stone or a wall. You just can't hit them. Some are warping forward, that it's fun to watch. I played one day as The Hilbilly, chose my chainsaw-run and they FLED! In a direct line! They were faster than me with the chainsaw! I was curious what perks they had. They had: NONE!\n\nAlso the developers come up regularly with interesting ideas. Like change the pip-system for killers. Now you LOSE a pip while having killed actually only two survivors and having 18000 points after the match. Why? Because one of the survivors left the game while dying. A nice idea for killers trying to rank up, hm?\nAlso you can get 17000 points for the match, kill two survivors and get a loss of pip there. Huge fun! Oh wait, sometimes you do the exact same thing as in the round before. You only get 13000 points, but get a pip. You can't be serious, developers?\n\nAnd let's not forget the dailies. You have to survive two times with Laurie Strode? You escaped through the exit door, and the killer hasn't even seen you. Success? NOPE. No bloodpoints for you! Kill a survivor with the Hillbilly with it's own hands? I did a Momentum Mori of four. And did not get the points.\n\nA word on community: often toxic, most time malicious.\n\nLet's just take a look at the broken mechanics. Like pallets. If you as survivor run through the gap and pull down the pallet, it happens that you stand on the side you have been before. On the killers side! He sure easily hits you then. Even better is, you want to pull down the pallet and just nothing happens... Killer gets you. Amazing!\n\nIf you're playing as killer and have someone on your shoulder and run through the pallet-gap, other survivors can pull down the pallet and you drop the survivor. Amazingly the survivor might now stand IN the pallet.\nOnce I had a situation I was blinded then, the last generator was made and by that the stuck survivor was healed, while I destroyed the pallet. He fled. Another survivor already opened the nearest gate so he was able to flee without a scratch. THAT are the moments I hate this game.\n\nAnd now my personal technical disasters. \nOne day a patch came in, I updated and wasn't able to play anymore. No matches were found anymore, lobby instantly closed when I tried to open. So a restart might help? I wasn't even able to start the game then anymore. Did the help came from the developers? No. Two months without playing I saw a new solution in a community discussion. And the game started again. Thank you, tech support.\n\nLet's come to the [b]BEST[/b]. One day I experienced the \"zero bloodpoints bug\". What is that and how it happened? First you have to know: savefiles were (then) on YOUR Pc. Not in the cloud. By a strange game-behaviour my savefiles were corrupted or deleted. It is a known problem since some time.\nAll my bloodpoints, the ingame-\"money\" to level up, were lost and all my survivors and killer were reset to level 1. So I submitted a support-ticket. Result: [b]FOUR WEEKS NO REACTION[/b] of the support team. So I wrote another Email. I told the support I expect an answer within a week.\nResult:[b]NOTHING![/b]\nTWO MONTHS no reaction on my ticket.Long waiting times? That's an excuse for lazyness.\nAfter a year the bug was finally fixed.\nInteresting, it's a running-gag when some of the devs said: \"[b]I think we did a pretty good job so far.[/b]\"\n\nStory:\nNo story (only if you call the written \"background\" to each person as a story). Just multiplayer.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game needs several fixing, but can be played IF you get the right players and not unfair and / or retard3d f\\/cks. \n\n[b]I can't recommend the game anymore.[/b]","timestamp_created":1510510652,"timestamp_updated":1590402221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36475822","author":{"steamid":"76561198103187658","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":26415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2897,"last_played":1653886150},"language":"english","review":"Its a solid game \n","timestamp_created":1510509648,"timestamp_updated":1623774518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467289716005325317","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiIPZ2N8CfrqSiwE="}
