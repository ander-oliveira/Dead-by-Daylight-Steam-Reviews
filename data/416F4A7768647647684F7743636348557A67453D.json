O jogo é repetitivo demais e não há nada de novo, a comunidade é extremamente tóxica e infantil, não tem como você jogar de uma maneira \"casual\" ou para se divertir, a menos que sua diversão seja jogar com sangue nos olhos em um jogo totalmente desbalanceado. Jogar partidas solo é sem graça porque você encontra killers tryhardando com 5 geradores como se a vida deles dependessem disso e de killer também é ruim porque você pega swf com build meta.

Le jeu possède une ambiance excellente, on se croirait vraiment dans un film d'horreur. Le jeu peut être effrayant du à ses musiques et autres effets sonores, du au design des méchants qui sont vraiment charismatique et effrayant pour la plupart. Le jeu est plutôt addictif et on s'y verra passer de nombreuses heures à réparer ces générateurs et à courser ces survivants. Le jeu est globalement très bon mais alors qu'est ce qu'y m'fais mettre une mauvaise évaluation ? Quelle audace de la part d'un joueur s'approchant des 300 heures de jeu d'oser mettre une note négative ? \n\nEh bien je vais vous l'dire, ce jeu n'est parfois pas plaisant à jouer, genre vraiment pas. Tout simplement parce que ce jeu possède l'une des pires communauté que j'ai vu dans un jeu, une communauté à la fois agressive et toxique qui plongera votre expérience de jeu dans une sorte d'humiliation collective, enfin surtout quand on est le tueur. Parce que les survivants qui on de l'expérience sur le jeu n'auront même plus peur de vous, le jeu passe d'un survival horror en ligne angoissant à un \"attrape moi si tu peux\" extrêmement frustrant en tant que tueur. Ce concept de faire passer un sale moment au tueur peut en décourager plus d'un, ça peut dégoûter d'un jeu très facilement. D'autant plus que le matchmaking de ce jeu est à la ramasse. Pouvant faire jouer des rang 16 avec des des rangs 1. Ce genre de comportements toxiques de la part des survivants peut pousser les tueurs à les adoptés en FaceCampant ou en Tunnelant les survivants ce qui est très frustrant quand on les joues. Certes je critique cette communauté, mais le jeu en lui même pousse les survivants à se comporter de la sorte, parce que l'un des seuls moyens pour les survivants de s'en sortir est de faire tourner en rond le tueur en attendant de lui foutre une palette à la gueule. Le jeu leur donne toutes les cartes pour survivre. C'est simple, un tueur le plus expérimenté qui soit, il ne pourra pratiquement rien faire face à des survivants qui savent un minimum jouer. C'est un jeu de survivants. Certaines Map sont même faites pour que l'expérience du tueur soit encore pire, avec des Map extrêmement étroites rendant impossible l'utilisation de certains tueur (comme le Montagnard par exemple). Certaines maps possèdent des endroits où il est littéralement impossible au tueur d'attraper le survivant (je pense aux maisons d'HaddonField ou encore d'une pièce dans la Map du désert où il est impossible au tueur d'emmener le survivant au crochet) et ce n'ai en aucun cas normal qu'un jeu possède des spot où les survivants soient intouchables. Au lieu de corriger ça les développeurs préfèrent nous pondrent des Dlc à 7 euros pour pouvoir jouer certains personnages. Après il n'y a pas que du mal dans la communauté, il m'est arrivé de parler à des gens très sympa mais cela est très rare dans ce jeu, la plupart des joueurs jouent en équipe et 4 joueurs en équipe qui peuvent communiquer entre eux n'est pas équitable du tout. La plupart des retours de joueurs se résument en \"Gg ez\", \"Baby killer learn 2 play\", \"fcking camper i Hope you'll die\", j'ai juste l'impression que si on ne respecte pas leur pseudo critère de jeu ou qu'on ne les laissent pas gagner, on est une merde à leurs yeux. Ce genre de gens ne sont qu'une bande de grands enfants qui veulent imposer leur supériorité en narguant le tueur le plus possible à base de gestuelles ou de T bag. C'est vraiment dommage qu'un jeu que j'apprécie autant donne autant la possibilité au joueurs d'humilier leur adversaire. Un jeu est surtout fait pour passer du bon temps, il est très déplorable de voir à quel point la plupart des joueurs tryhard comme des porcs en ne jouant bien évidemment jamais seul, toujours accompagnés de leur larbins pour faire chier un maximum de monde, en n'oubliant pas de se déconnecter si le tueur s'apprête à les sacrifier, parce que bon ça serait trop aimable de leur laisser des points. Ce genre de comportements est très fréquents ce qui rend quelques une de mes parties en tueur une véritable humiliation. \n\nPour conclure le jeu n'est pas mauvais en soit, mais est beaucoup trop cancérigène, d'autant que le système de ban est complètement biaisé. Le jeu est cool et la plupart de mes parties se passent dans la bonne humeure mais est globalement gâché par cette communauté de grands enfants se croyant maître  de vous parce qu'ils savent tourner autour d'une palette...","timestamp_created":1563651508,"timestamp_updated":1588283533,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54200111","author":{"steamid":"76561197990858492","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1562554124},"language":"english","review":"bem bosta, ótimo game pra pedir refund! não é divertido, é idiota..  conseguiram fazer algo pior que o battle royale de feijão!","timestamp_created":1563650886,"timestamp_updated":1563650886,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54199999","author":{"steamid":"76561198184156935","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30344,"last_played":1656730171},"language":"brazilian","review":"\neu gosto + por que não tenho uma plataforma mac homem por favor crie o pai por favor ame você morto à luz do dia","timestamp_created":1563650233,"timestamp_updated":1606463244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54199886","author":{"steamid":"76561198091670855","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1631227116},"language":"english","review":"Why does this game have perks that can see the other team...","timestamp_created":1563649717,"timestamp_updated":1563649717,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54199804","author":{"steamid":"76561198068498045","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":23318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4354,"last_played":1644968790},"language":"english","review":"I like letting my teammates die, then escaping through the hatch :)","timestamp_created":1563649215,"timestamp_updated":1563649215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54199118","author":{"steamid":"76561198017536915","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2263,"last_played":1648070595},"language":"russian","review":"Решил поиграть за сурва - обосрался от появления расчлененной азиатки.

played this game for a long time as you can see from my hours. But it has finally reached the point where I can’t play it anymore.\n \nIf you are a new player, this game will most likely be pretty fun for a while, so if you’re going to play this game extremely casually (1-2 times a week for a few hours) you’ll probably enjoy this game, particularly with friends. \n\nHowever, if you’re going to play this game as your main game or one of your main games – I can’t recommend this game. The grind is unachievable, the cosmetics and DLCs are overpriced for someone starting from 0 (and the cosmetics are mediocre). However, the biggest issue is their latest involvement of Skilled-based match making. That has made games unbelievably sweaty and unfun. Skill based match making that at the high end for killer and survivor pretty much unplayable. Killers can’t do much of anything, the average killer will get 2-4 hooks at high SBMM level unless they play scummy AF. But even then, it’s a struggle bus. If you go to many of the top Twitch killer main streamers, you’ll see the struggles. Many of them are switching to survivor. For survivor at high SBMM it’s actually fairly easy (and boring) since all your teammates are typically pretty competent if you’re solo queuing. However, all the killers are going play scummy AF in every game to try to get at least 1 kill (tunnelling – proxy camping, etc). The SBMM has highlighted the severe imbalance between survivor and killer and has made it unenjoyable. Gens go way too fast for anyone to enjoy. The devs only care about the new player experience, and pretty much believe once they sucker you in, you’ll stay forever even if you’re having a bad time. And to some degree they have been correct, but this has been the breaking point for me and many other veteran players. \n\nLike many games, the community / survivors are very toxic. I’m speaking as a former survivor main, but who played killer casually. The devs do not care about veteran players. \n\nOh and btw the SBMM score (which you can’t see) is not determined by skill, but actually how long you’re in the match for and if you escape/how many kills. That’s it. There’s nothing else to it. It’s actually less required skilled than the previous ranking system. The devs are trying to make this party game an E-Sports game, with that kind of match making. \n\nAlso another note, there is an ever-increasing amount of cheaters/hackers in this game. Like blatant ones, not ones where it could be questionable. You can report them in game and via their ticket system online. But not much will happen if anything at all even with evidence. Half of them can unban themselves even if you did get them banned.  1/10 of the cheaters probably get perma-banned, but it takes 1+ months for Behaviour to do anything about it. \n\nTLDR; good for new casual players (<8hrs a week, for maybe a few hundred hours total), but game is buggy/very imbalanced, expensive, too grindy for long term players & game is riddled with hackers. SBMM is s***. \n","timestamp_created":1563599171,"timestamp_updated":1633821935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55350261926651001","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54188473","author":{"steamid":"76561198373534643","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1258,"last_played":1649385382},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1563591883,"timestamp_updated":1563591883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54188437","author":{"steamid":"76561198393167988","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1649320279},"language":"english","review":"Nice","timestamp_created":1563591653,"timestamp_updated":1563591653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54187969","author":{"steamid":"76561198069464263","num_games_owned":524,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":6998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5861,"last_played":1642837535},"language":"english","review":"This game is loads of fun! However, If you care about ranking up don't bother letting your rank ruin your enjoyment of the game. The ranking system is designed for a specific style of play. You have to be chased and you have to do gens and you have to save your teamates in order to rank up as survivor. While that may seem reasonable, it has some serious flaws in its application. If it's all for the entity as a killer why does the entity care if as a killer i didn't break the gens or hit and down and hook all the survivors on more than one occasion and perhaps instead of hooking survivors i just decided to murder them in cold blood and oh BTW maybe the match didn't last more than 10 minutes.... If they are all dead  before escaping why does the entity care? And as survivor if I took the time to complete several gens and hide from the killer the entire game all sneaky beaky like without being chased or hit once and the other survivors happen to do just the same, why wouldn't I be rewarded for doing so?

With killer, it's so stacked against you that if the survivors just know the basics at high ranks, they can all escape, with you getting 0 kills, playing like a SWF, and while there are plenty of garbage SWF players, their communication advantage almost always prevents 4Ks unless the killer is one of the those top-tier 0.01% of killers that can 4K with Bubba blindfolded, who are known for telling every other killer player they just need to 'getgud'. It's like one of the 2 people that can play one of those absurdly complex fighting-game characters to their full potential, and will never lose to anyone. This game is balanced around those few killer-streamers and the majority of Rank 20 survivor streamers who can't just do gens, loop, and not screw their teammates, and when they die, occasionally scream 'ThIs GaMe Is So UnFaIr To SuRvIvOrS' 'kIlLeR oP' through a cussing fit.\n\nIf you can play without getting too attached to winning (getting 4 kills or 4 escapes), the game's great. If not, you will run into the problem of 4 queue SEAL Team Claudette either finishing every gen in 3 minutes or dragging out the game just to feel superior to you, or a killer camping and tunneling everyone they can, despite the fact that almost no one in these games gets much Blood Points. Learn to loop pallets (look up 'dbd killer tiles' or 'dbd survivor tiles' on YouTube), not run to OTHER side of the map to heal (a little bit away unless killer is coming to you is good), strategies against each killer, and don't instantly throw pallets in shacks or long walls (it hurts everyone including you later).\n\nP.S. For your sanity, probably keep gameplay minimum, and do those dailies. If you wait 3 days and come back, as soon as you do one of the three currently available dailies to you, a 4th will appear.","timestamp_created":1563560004,"timestamp_updated":1585790732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54182641","author":{"steamid":"76561198105010740","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33352,"last_played":1631639886},"language":"thai","review":"ระบบชวนเพื่อนเล่นผู้รอดชีวิต 4 คน  ผู้รอดชีวิตมีการสื่อสาร บอกตำแหน่งฆาตกร หลบซ่อน ปั่นไฟง่าย โดยไม่ต้องกลัวฆาตกร \nกลายเป็นเกมวิ่งไล่จับธรรมดา ไม่มีความน่าตื่นเต้น [ ควรปรับปรุงระบบทีม ] \nเพื่มเติม ถ้ามีฉากหรือลูกเล่นให้ตกใจ เป็นด่านเฉพาะจะน่าสนใจยิ่งขึ้น\n","timestamp_created":1563558959,"timestamp_updated":1563558959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54182597","author":{"steamid":"76561198335295033","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":10449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7222,"last_played":1620899692},"language":"russian","review":"Дырка","timestamp_created":1563558805,"timestamp_updated":1563558825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54182154","author":{"steamid":"76561198802610212","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":33415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5093,"last_played":1653741537},"language":"polish","review":"Gierka jest bardzo fajna , tylko nie podobają mi się osoby które stoją przy wiszącym ocalałym.Proszę abyście coś z tym zrobili.Gra jest godna polecenia","timestamp_created":1563556791,"timestamp_updated":1563556791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539622604846954346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54181994","author":{"steamid":"76561198107135599","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":36303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3631,"last_played":1647640449},"language":"polish","review":"Założenie fajnie, ale wykonanie mega hujowe w trzy dupy\n\nEdit:\nPo kolejnych 260 h grania to ciągle jebane gówno, nienaprawione, serwery to żart cała ''produkcja'' prowadzi do kurwicy.

wanted so badly to love this game but right now it's so utterly broken for new killers. If you like to play survivor then you're in luck, the devs obviously favor survivors so much it's painful. It wouldn't be so bad if the matchmaking weren't a total joke. A handful of rounds into the game and I constantly get matched up against people who have been trolling the game since launch and are beyond coordinated. It's not much fun when everyone but you knows what to do, and it doesn't help that the tutorial is a joke. You basically have to look outside the game for help because the tutorials don't give you a chance to get any real practice in with the killers unless you have friends play unranked rounds with you. The online community is so toxic, I've never dealt with so many keyboard warriors and trolls in my life, and my generation invented that shit. No one is helpful or offers any tips, they just tell you that you suck and spam obscenities, but you can't block them from your matchmaking so... Just be warned you're in for a long and painful \"git gud\" grind for decent perks with most of the killers before you'll have any chance of winning unless you're using the tiny handful of killers that can teleport/blink around the map, but then you'll be a \"toxic killer\" and don't even think about camping or you'll get shit for that too.

I haven't been banned for long, but I still think it was very unjust and unfair for me. I never would be toxic, even if things do anger me. I could probably say this for many people that your reporting system should be fair and just so it could be a much better way of actually banning people for a reason. If someone were to be banned, maybe you should have receipts as to why they were banned so they don't have to constantly question what they've done wrong. Knowing this now, it frightens me to even play this game, knowing that there's going to be someone who's just petty enough to report someone just because they made them angry.","timestamp_created":1563520850,"timestamp_updated":1563520850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541935503482818604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhdvGhOwCccHUzgE="}
