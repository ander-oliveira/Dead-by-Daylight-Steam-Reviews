For example, you have a 25% chance of being on this map, or 15% of this thing appearing and so on. Also any perk, item, and ability you bring into game will go away if you die.

If you play survivor, there's a very high chance you get stuck in the loading screen when joining a lobby.

The perk bug pretty much allows players from both sides to hack the game with wall and speed hacks. \n\nWhen not on vacation, devs seem more focused on paid DLC and make custom stuff for streamers than addresing game breaking bugs.

But the way devs deal with game braking bugs and community feedback is one of the worst I've ever seen. \n\nThere's a bug going on, where people are losing all their progress in the game. If you contact devs, all you'll get is a bot reply: \"Nothing we can do, sorry\". Awesome customer service.\n\nIt didn't happen to me, but I read a lot about it in forums.\n\nDevs neglected this bug for a while, and after a lot of complains they made a sticky in forums asking players to back up their saves.\n\nProblem is, not everybody goes to forums. There should be an ingame message warning about this major bug, telling people what to do.\n\nDon't buy it until they fix it.","timestamp_created":1481506880,"timestamp_updated":1489022168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28319926","author":{"steamid":"76561198081221009","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25355,"last_played":1629037336},"language":"thai","review":"แนะนำครับ แต่บัคเยอะไปนิด","timestamp_created":1481505404,"timestamp_updated":1481505404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28319573","author":{"steamid":"76561198336401188","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17783,"last_played":1641995178},"language":"schinese","review":"不错，这一款游戏是我最喜欢的游戏了 末前来说 是没有之一的","timestamp_created":1481503333,"timestamp_updated":1481503333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28319359","author":{"steamid":"76561198302183255","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3130,"last_played":1648263933},"language":"schinese","review":"很刺激。多人配合一起玩 可以广交朋友。很不错","timestamp_created":1481502003,"timestamp_updated":1481502003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28319269","author":{"steamid":"76561198064017564","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":27435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21726,"last_played":1641727347},"language":"russian","review":"Идея хорошая, но после 350 часов все начинает надоедать, и однообразно.","timestamp_created":1481501452,"timestamp_updated":1610620465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28319219","author":{"steamid":"76561198126117756","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1633145763},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno 10/10","timestamp_created":1481501156,"timestamp_updated":1481501156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28319202","author":{"steamid":"76561198150703819","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4575,"last_played":1654076746},"language":"english","review":"can you please fix the fact that when the killer disconnects you lose your rank please its so frustrating to play the game because of that!","timestamp_created":1481501047,"timestamp_updated":1481501047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28318850","author":{"steamid":"76561198277651916","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1354,"last_played":1531089540},"language":"english","review":"this game is a great game. really addicting annd really fun. that is when it finally loads. this is the first review i ever write about ANY game, because usually I just dont care.

That's all that we ever needed. This is a great game, that was plagued by a faulty infrastructure. We've gotten some updates and fixes, as well as some additions to help cope with it. It's playable now.\n\nThis is a really fun game. Great concept, great replayability. I can't in good conscience recommend it to people in general though. The peer to peer hosting is just atrocious. Game constantly hangs at loading screens requiring a force end task, people disconnect from 45% of your games, game immediately kicks you to the survivor menu as soon as you enter a lobby, or you rubber band everywhere if you even manage to get into a game. They want to make this game competitive, they need to front the money for some good dedicated servers for match hosting. One quick solution to avoid these issues is to just play as a killer. I get wonderful games when I do, nobody dcs everyone is having a good old time. Unfortunately, the sole determination as to who you are matched against is rank - not your character's level. So once you start winning some games as a killer, it will begin to match you with people with maxed out survivor levels making it nigh impossible to ever catch and find them. I'm not sure why this game needs a ranked matchmaking system, it is certainly not a very competitive game insofar as being considered an esport. So many lame mechanics that people can abuse. Just another way esport/twitch are fundamentally ruining potentially wonderful games by making developers feel like they need to make their games \"esport MLG competitive.\"\n\nFix the hosting problems, and this game is great regardless of the matchmaking issues.","timestamp_created":1481479345,"timestamp_updated":1505671390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28313651","author":{"steamid":"76561198125959249","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":50539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17316,"last_played":1633642843},"language":"russian","review":"Игра работает через жопу","timestamp_created":1481478771,"timestamp_updated":1481478771,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491071432828903198","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28313125","author":{"steamid":"76561198332399450","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1385,"last_played":1645651695},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดีค่ะ เล่นกับเพื่อนได้สบาย ลุ้น/ฮา/เสียว รับประกันความสนุกค่ะ 5555","timestamp_created":1481475073,"timestamp_updated":1481475073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28312789","author":{"steamid":"76561198342204951","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":55694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11477,"last_played":1656694123},"language":"thai","review":"บัคเยอะไปนิด","timestamp_created":1481473987,"timestamp_updated":1481473987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28312449","author":{"steamid":"76561198219697993","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":31030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9304,"last_played":1562317801},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Daylight, eins der besten Spiele die ich je spielen durfte.\nSehr viel Aktion, sehr viel Spannung & Hass. :D\n\nFreue mich über jedes neue Update & neue Killer!","timestamp_created":1481472953,"timestamp_updated":1481472953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28312220","author":{"steamid":"76561198058469318","num_games_owned":399,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":112804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":13,"playtime_at_review":16663,"last_played":1659916115},"language":"french","review":"Je joue à ce jeu depuis la bêta.\n\nJ'ai craqué pour son ambiance et son univers unique, le jeu était une petite perle dans son genre mais avec l'arrivée du \"survive with friends\" le jeu a beaucoup changé.\nPour y avoir joué presque 300heures en jouant aussi bien tueur que survivant, rank1 à chaque saison aisément.\nJe ne peux que m'attrister devant l'état actuel du jeu...

Als Survivor: Repariere alle Generatoren, um die Ausgangstore öffnen zu können und zu entkommen. Als Killer: Versuche, alle zu töten, bevor sie die Möglichkeit haben, zu fliehen. Nebenbei muss man aber aufpassen, nicht vom Killer erwischt zu werden.

Diese unterstützen euch alle auf ihre eigene Art und Weise. Ihre Fähigkeiten können mit sogenannten Add-Ons erweitert oder verstärkt werden.\nOpfergaben erhält man ebenfalls im Blutnetz. Diese werden beim Spielstart verbrannt und gewähren euch verschiedene Boni.\nPerks sind die eigentlichen Fähigkeiten eures Charakters. Diese können im Laufe des Spiels in ihrer Auswirkung erhöht werden, je höher euer Level ist. Jeder Charakter (auch die Killer) haben ihre ganz eigenen Perks. Das heißt, ihr solltet am Anfang weise wählen, wie ihr das Spiel bestreiten wollt, um den passenden Charakter mit den wichtigen Fähigkeiten auszuwählen. Seid ihr ein Teamplayer? Oder doch eher ein Einzelgänger?

This game is a freakin joke.\n\nDevs are concentrating on DLCs rather than fixing bugs, balancing or infinites.\nMatchmaking is so freakin bad.\nKiller vs. 4 survivors is NOT balanced at all... horrible balancing.\nNo new content unless you want to spend extra money on DLCs to play a character.\nSurvivors are not afraid of the killer anymore. why should they? they have the tools to just run around the killer the whole game.\nDevs make changes considering only the low tier players complaining about things, and not trying to balance the game for high(good) ranked players.\n\n\nSo like I said, this game was a horror survival game: As a killer you focused on killing people. As a survivor you focused on running away from the killer and survive, which should be the point of this game. Now the game is all about farming points. Killers have to let survivors go to get more points (let them get unhooked or leave them when they use infinites). And if you are a survivor, you can just run around collecting points for free. Killers can't camp, because they wont get points -> free 1500 points. We have totems -> free 400 points. Destroy hooks -> free 500 points. use infintes -> free 8000 boldness points.\n\nSo many changes has been done to the game, you cant even play your own style anymore.\nFor example:\nAt the beginning, you wanna save ppl, you are rewarded with points. you wanna be selfish, you can do gens get out, rewareded with points. Now you have to save ppl, escpecially if they get hooked within the 1st minute of the game, or you wont be able to get out.\n\nAs a killer main, I havent played this game for a very long time, and I dont feel like playing it any time soon either.\n\nFrom the killer's perspective (rank 1-5 killer):\n\nSurvivors got buffed like no tomorrow. As a survivor if you get on the killers shoulder you deserve to get hooked, because you messed up. But no, first killers got nerfed, then add survive with friends, then gave survivors Decisive Strike. Survivors are not punished for being caught, they get a 2nd or maybe a 3rd chance to waste 2 minutes of your time chasing again.\nAs a killer if you camp the hook, you wont get points, if you don't and survivors escape, you wont feel very good either, but either way, you are a noob, you will be t-bagged by the survivors, and there is where the community comes in, its as bad as in any other online game.\nInfinites are still in the game... Good job devs.\nHad to wait till level 60 to get level one Iron Grasp, meanwhile in every game, my hooks are all gone, and you know how frustrating playing that type of games where you have no hooks at all.\nCan't play my favourite killer, which is The Wraith, because he was completely useless, cant get points for anything.\nSurvivors are not afraid of the killer anymore, just get 4 decent ones and the will run around you the whole game, flashlight stuns, etc...\n\nPlaying as a survivor:\nI was rank 5-7 with survivor, and all I got is ranks 17-20 new to the game teammates against a 1-5 prestiged killers. Not fun, all I hope for is a black pip in that situation and I might not get it.\nIf the killer against me rage quits, I lose a pip... thats straight up bs\nThen they bring in pay to farm points, The Shape, stalk couple of ppl. hook 2 survivors and even if we all get out thats 15k points. I think we can all agree that it was very easy to get points with Michael Myers. He was also strong.","timestamp_created":1481462643,"timestamp_updated":1535930895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517359316349029541","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28309317","author":{"steamid":"76561198205319720","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":14483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":973,"last_played":1652486706},"language":"spanish","review":"Que deicr... Bueno no llevo ni 15 horas de juego pero tengo que decir que las que llevo son suficientes.

En el punto de vista del asesino... Muchos camperos,pero tambien gente muy legal.
