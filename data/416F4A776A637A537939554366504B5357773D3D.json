Honestly that's what it is. Rushed out before it was finished like most games nowadays. \n\nThis game is tons of fun; the concept is fantastic and addictive. However the mechanics and processes that come along with the concept are either broken or lacking. \n\nThe join lobby is not a queue rather a quick join. With that you get a lot of \"failed to connect\" issues. \n\nThere is no party system so you cannot play with your friends on a ranked system. You are left with a create a friends only lobby that nets you nothing. A party system was promised on release since it was not in beta as well; harking back to why this is still beta.\n\nThe some perks are broken, vague, or worded wrong. For example the \"Insidious\" perk says \"unlocks the stealth ability. By standing still for 3 seconds you reduce your terror radius to zero and become stealthy until you act again.\" You would think that you would become invisible because the game teaches you that as stealth from the wraith but you do not. it just reduces your terror range to zero despite it leading you to think there are two properties. The survivor perk \"spine Chill\" is completely broken and does nothing. \n\nA lot of the skill tree is vague as well. When i fist started playing and getting items some would say \"increases your blood points for Boldness.\" What is Boldness??? I had no idea b the game never explains it nor is there a way to look at it in the menus. It just shows quickly at the end of the game.\n\nAdd on's: there are add on's for you to add onto the items you bring. Some are also broken others don't do what the explanation says. \n\nThere is no punishment for stalling, leaving games, or dodging a pregame if you think the players are to hard to play against. You can literally wait an troll for Hours in game. For example I got glitched into the floor while opening a chest, no reason why it just happened. I couldn't move, no one could save me and the killer couldn't hit me. So it became a waiting game of \"who will leave first?\" You can do the same thing at the exit, leaving the killer to wander and hope someone massively slips up. If no one does then its whenever they want to end the game. \n\n Further more people can disconnect from the game without punishment and further punishing players who want to play. Another personal example is that I was running for the exit and just about to get there and the killer pressed Alt F4, causing the game to end. The game brings you to the victory screen and says \"you escaped\" but you don't get any additional points. You Have to escape using the games mechanics to get those points; the killer robbed us of that and didn't get any lesser points then what he was going to get nor a punishment of any kind. On top of that, If they do that to you your survivor rank goes down! it's not based on wins its based on points accumulated withing the game. If you are a killer and get into a game where everyone DC's right off the bat, you go to the great victory screen and then the, bummer you lose a rank screen. \n\nThe menu UI is not fluid and clunky in places, not terrible but a super easy fix and should be perfect for release.\n\nIn short:\n\nEven with these looming problems and then some; this game is addictive and fantastic. I am still going to play it but keeping in mind that the game is broken and people who break the rules get off scott free while punishing you. If you don't accept that then this game will be a frustrating mess for you. \n\n**Update!*\n\nThe new DLC came out and luckily the game no longer works! Seems like they are scrambling now, just in time for a random free weekend download!\n\n******UPDATE!****\n\nI main survivor and its hard to keep playing this game when the killers are so underpowered. There really needs to be a rebalance. I shouldnt be able to abuse and man handle a killer by myself.\n\n******UPDATE AGAIN 4/10/19*****\n\nBeen Awhile since I have played but same problems it seems. Super Toxic community still. Did a daily quest as a killer and was told that I \"tunnel, Proxy-camp, camp gens, camp hooks, spam my killer ability, and use unfair perks.\" How did i do all of those in one game. How do killers even manage in this anymore??? We need killers because they are the brunt of the game.\n\n\n*********Update AAAGGAAAIIINNN 3/28/2020********\n\nHere we are again with another update after several month hiatus. Truly this game has come a long way and I can finally say that I can recommended this game. I would say that there are very slight balancing issues for the higher tier player thus of which are indicative of these style of games that get new abilities and skill sets added regularly. The game overall looks and feels better mechanically and visually now.  Although the game does go on sale and randomly bundles DLC; I would honestly say its worth the 19.99 price for PC users, but you can make you dollar stretch more based on your patience. The game still has a \"Toxic\" side but its somewhat better now. You can just ignore the comments if need be but you will still get players who complain to a toxic level on you using certain combination \"perks\" or using a killer on how they are intended to be used.","timestamp_created":1467146395,"timestamp_updated":1585427153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132211208343506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23904899","author":{"steamid":"76561198118117441","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1604701647},"language":"norwegian","review":"This game is siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick","timestamp_created":1467146004,"timestamp_updated":1467146004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23904721","author":{"steamid":"76561198022396735","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":8091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1538698992},"language":"english","review":"A great game to play with friends, unbelievably funny.

However, needs quite a lot of work and balancing to become a great game. No party system makes it hard for people with only 1-2 freinds. The ranking system is some what broken. In the sense that is very hard to rank up. Now the worst part is some of the exploits that the survivors can use to make it impossible for the killer to get them. From vaulting over 2 ledges that are right next to each other to running around a truck endlessly to avoid the killer. It can make the game infinitely more frustrating to play. In conlusion, Dead By Daylight needs work. It's a fun game but, it might've needed a little more time before it's release. Hopefully the devolpers can fix these issues within the game. 6/10.

I loved the competitive nature of the game and I felt like it was always worth my time to continue improving. However, throughout the years DBD (Dead by Daylight) has become very casual. This is mostly because of a new progression system they added called the Archives. \n\nThe Archives is essentially a battle pass, where you have 70 days to progress through different objectives whilst receiving awards, with more rewards if you decide to buy the premium version. As a result of this, a lot of killers and survivors (myself included) purposefully play sub-optimally in order to complete the objectives in their battle pass. Most of the objectives can be completed while playing optimally, however some of them (such as having to sabotage a certain amount of hooks as a survivor or having to hook a certain amount of survivors in the basement as killer) take away from the main objective of the game, forcing people to ruin the competitive nature it if they want to complete the Archives before the 70 day period is over. Since at least 1 out of the 5 players in your game is likely to be doing an Archive objective that takes away from the main objective, it is very unlikely that all of the players will be giving their utmost to win. There have always been casual players in DBD due to the fact that there are no rewards for reaching rank 1 (which, by the way, people have been asking for since the very beginning of the game), however the game was very seldom ruined by such players due to the fact that there weren't that many of them. However, with the Archives, it is very seldom that you'll find a game that isn't ruined.\n\nAside from the uncompetitive nature of the game, even when you do reach rank 1 (the highest rank obtainable as killer or survivor) it is very unbalanced in favor of the survivor, and pretty much has been since the existence of the game. The developers have even stated that they plan to balance the game toward lower ranks. Generators are able to be repaired way too quickly for the killer to be able to stop the repair of them until all the survivors are killed. For reference, repairing a generator with one survivor takes 80 seconds, with two survivors takes 47.06 seconds, with three survivors takes 38.1 seconds and with four survivors takes 36.36 seconds (all without items or perks that increase generator repair speed). First of all, while playing a killer that has no movement abilities, it is possible that a generator can be completed before a killer gets to it even if they start gunning for it as soon as they spawn into the match. Additionally, as soon as good survivors see you get into a chase with someone else, they're all going to get onto a generator, especially if all of the survivors are in survive with friends and are communicating with each other. Therefore, assuming that 3 different survivors are on 3 different generators and you're chasing someone for at least 80 seconds (which is fairly common at high ranks with at most times zero possible counter-play), 3 generators can be done before you can even hook one person. Since each person requires 3 hooks to kill assuming that they get saved before entering the next phase, it is almost impossible to kill everyone unless the survivors really mess up. There are perks such as Hex: Ruin and Corrupt Intervention that can slow down generator repair, but Hex: Ruin is gone as soon as its respective totem is gone and Corrupt Intervention only lasts 2 minutes and doesn't even affect every generator. Additionally, Hex: Ruin only makes a difference if survivors don't hit great skill checks every time, otherwise it is almost entirely worthless.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual game where you can just mess around, DBD is definitely the game for you. However, if you are looking for a competitive game where you can constantly be improving in order to best your competition, this game isn't, and never will be (due to the path that the developers are taking), the game for you.","timestamp_created":1467137633,"timestamp_updated":1598149870,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23900789","author":{"steamid":"76561198144330827","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":507,"last_played":1649678197},"language":"english","review":"I really love the game.

This game is very exhilerating and fun with friends, it can be frustrating with randoms sometimes. It has the potential to be much better than it currently is.\nI know that the game just got released and I am loving it. It just needs some fixes that's all. \n\n1. LOBBY.\n- About 90% of the time when you try to join a lobby as a survivor it says \"FAILED TO JOIN THE GAME. This is not major but very annoying!\n- And as a killer you sometimes need to wait up to more than 10 minutes for people to join your lobby. It gets REALLY annoying\n\n2. MATCHMAKING.\n- I simply don't understand it. 99% of the time I join a lobby as a survivor I get teamed up with low ranks and somewhat low levels.\n- However, 99% of the time I make my lobby as a killer the people who join are very high rank, often higher than 10. (I am rank 20 most of the time because I simply can't be arsed ranking up as of now)\n\n3. BUGS.\n- There are many small bugs in the game. There are so many small and weird bugs that are ruining the fun sometimes. I must admit, some bugs are very funny though.\n\n4. RANKING.\n- This system is sh*tty. You derank if the killer ragequittes and if you don't perform good enough you will not rank up. If you don't do it good enough/escape you will also derank. You should not lose it, just keep the rank you have.\n\n5. KILLERS CAMPING.\n- There needs to be a bigger reason for the killer to not camp someone on a hook. The only reason not to is that if you pick up a survivor more than once on a hook you gain more points. However, most killers don't give a f*ck about it, they just camp until you die and it makes the game somewhat lame.\n\n6. RAGEQUIT NOT TO DERANK.\n- As a killer when you are about to kill a survivor, I have noticed this only includes high rank survivors, they ragequit when they are about to die to not derank.\n\n7. REPETITIVE GAME.\n- After a while this game gets somewhat repetitive, it needs more gamemodes and more content. I would also love to see some more customization for the survivors and killers, such as more outfits. This would not improve the game overall, I am just a customization nerd.\n\n8. JUKES.\n- There need to be some sort of stamina system for survivors vaulting over things. You can so easily evade the killer by just constantly vaulting over the same thing over and over again.\n\n9. ONLY ONE WAY TO DIE.\n- It would be nice if they added more than one way to kill survivors. The hook is getting somewhat boring.\n\n10. PLAY WITH FRIENDS.\n- You can only play with friends in a private match. \"It will come in the next patch\" is the only thing that the forums mods can say in defense to any of the bugs and suggestions.\n\n11. KEYS ARE NOT REBINDABLE.\n- This might not seem like a big deal to most people, but ALL the left handed people I know prefer to use num pad to play. I feel very sorry for them. Every game should have the option to rebind keys.","timestamp_created":1467137253,"timestamp_updated":1467138367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560280203819274902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23900710","author":{"steamid":"76561198140058154","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":540,"last_played":1629785310},"language":"english","review":"Great game!

Кошки мышки только побольше крови. Играть за охотника или выжившего очень весело. Главное за выжившего не убежать подальше, а хорошо спрятаться и скрыть следы, так сказать расстаять в тумане. А за охотника просто тупо бегать за другими тоже не лучшая идея, нужно слушать и быть внимательным, наблюдать и находить следы, устраивать ловушки. И да не кемперить жертв, это плохая идея. Цель не убить всех, а получить как можно больше очков. \n А кстати тут и вырисовывается проблема на данный момент игры. Много ливеров, очень. Только недавно играл за охотника и буквально со старта ливнуло 2 урода, потом и третий ливнул как я его поймал. Им то пофиг, но у меня слетел ранг и конечно я ничего не получил за этих уродов. Или такая проблема, вы отремонтировали все генераторы, открыли двери собираетесь уже выиграть, но бац! Ливает охотник. Смешно потомучто это -5000 очков для вас или -7000 если вы решили найти люк и конечно у других оставшихся в живых товарищей по команде.\n Есть ещё проблемы, места на карте в которых охотник вас скорее всего никогда не догонит, если у вас руки нормально растут. Или же карты на которых практически нереально убегать от охотников (привет кукуруза), обычно маленькая карта без каких либо мест для паркура*. Не знаю как другим, но вот меня например немного нервирует то что, играя за охотника низкого уровня, мне приходилось бегать за 1-2 рангами с 50 уровнями, если бы я был бы ещё более плох в роли охотника то я точно был бы в ярости. Я хочу сказать что такая разница в уровне сильно сказывается на игре, играете вы за охотника или за выжившего. Например у охотника есть перк, который палит всех кто испугал или около ворон, извините но низкие уровни этому ничего противопоставить не могут. Или будучи охотником не дай бог встретить ботаничку, она будет вилять туда сюда со спринтом и хилить себя без аптечки.\n Надеюсь разрабы не кинут игру, так как у неё огромный потенциал и она всеравно приносит массу удовольствия от игры.

Нужно подумать головой, проявить ловкость рук, а так же хороший слух. \nВ игре присутствуют разные персонажи: 3 маньяка и 4 выживальщика. Насчет выживальщиков мне еще разобраться до конца не удалось, а вот насчет маньяков скажу несколько слов. \nВсего 3 маньяка. У каждого свои способности, например один может устанавливать ловушки возле генераторов, другой - становиться невидимым и так далее. Так же они имеют свои перки - способности. Кто-то говорит, что невидимый маньяк - это слишком имбово. На деле все решается наблюдательностью и ушами: где-то могут взлететь вороны, где-то могут раздаться звуки шагов, а если маньяк совсем близко - начнет биться сердце. Мне довелось поиграть за маньяка только один раз. Понравилось.\nНасчет выживших тоже скажу несколько слов. У них тоже имеются перки, некоторые добавляют снаряжение (аптечки, ящики с инструментами и так далее). Я часто вижу, как в лобби из троих человек с одинаковыми персонажами 1-5 уровней заходит достаточно опытный игрок. Забавная сцена, потому что примерно за 10 минут в лобби зашло около 8-ми людей с персонажами 30+ уровня, и как только они видели уровень опыта игроков - ливали сразу.\nКасательно качества команд - казалось бы, зачем она, команда? Каждый сам за себя, никто друг другу не мешает. Последние две игры я об этом и думаю. Две игры подряд мне попадались люди, которые использовали генератор просто чтобы его взорвать. Они не знали про окна, про деревяшки, про ворон, про сердцебиение - они просто бегали и выдавали собой других жертв. Тем не менее, мне удалось увидеть пример настоящей командной работы. 3 человека (не знаю, то ли они были связаны телепатией, то ли имели еще какой-то способ связи - не знаю) четко распределили роли. Двое занимались починкой генераторов, один - бегал, взрывал те же генераторы и скакал через окна. Иными словами - отвлекал маньяка. Для меня роли, увы, не нашлось (неудивительно, это был мой самый первый раунд в этой игре). Так что вот так вот как-то.\nВ игре так же присутствует что-то вроде сюжета, но оно настолько хорошо спрятано, что я не могу найти точного описания сюжета и всех персонажей. Или я просто плохо ищу.\n\nПерейду к плюсам и минусам.\nПлюсы:\n-Атмосферная и достаточно жуткая игра.\n-Приятная графика.\n-Неплохой геймплей.\n-Сюжет?\nМинусы:\n-Главный минус - полная зависимость от онлайна. Я надеюсь, что игра раскрутится и в ней будет легче с нуля собрать лобби.\n-Только одна карта, которая очень быстро заучивается. Первые несколько раундов вы будете учить места с крюками.\n-Отсутствие(или неадекватная работа?) ранговой системы. Иногда в команду попадаются абсолютные дебилы, иногда попадаются очень сложные маньяки.\n-Сюжет?\n\nТочную оценку я поставить игре не могу, но примерно - 8/10.","timestamp_created":1467126494,"timestamp_updated":1467149569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23895547","author":{"steamid":"76561198139747721","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1563963625},"language":"schinese","review":"为什么我老是停止工作？","timestamp_created":1467125973,"timestamp_updated":1467125973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23895417","author":{"steamid":"76561198045250349","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":10767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6619,"last_played":1627920176},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然感觉是一个很逗的游戏\n但我还是被吓到了啊！\n第一次玩进去就被音乐吓得退出来了！\n第二次玩被心跳吓得直接上去给屠夫杀。。。\n第三次被砍了一刀逃出来了 然后还是退游戏了= =\n为什么逃跑需要偷电啊？\n为什么这游戏这么恐怖啊！\n这游戏 我只想说一个字：\n爽！\n233333\n+气氛塑造很好\n+虽然感觉只是躲猫猫+拿情报的升级版，但感觉玩法还是很有意思\n+能跟朋友一起撕，满分！\n\n10-30 另：智障们总喜欢拿平衡性说事，却忘了这游戏本身就不是竞技而是恐怖游戏，不看标签自己买了怪开发商？给差评理由是平衡性差的人大概就是没脑子。这本身就是一款多人合作生存的恐怖游戏，请搞清楚定位，想要平衡回你的dota2。\n溜鬼如果作为这游戏的主要玩法，那么这游戏已经变性了。看看外服怎么玩这游戏，再看看你们某些玩家吧。\n不反对溜鬼，溜鬼溜不成了请你不要批评制作组。","timestamp_created":1467125712,"timestamp_updated":1477767828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6042327880859375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23895253","author":{"steamid":"76561198076879150","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1483729782},"language":"russian","review":"Игра за \"жертв\" :\n\n- Бег по кругу\n\nИгра за \"маньяка\":\n\n- 30 минут медитации на лобби\n- Бег по кругу за жертвой, с большой задержкой\n\nОчень интересная игра.\n","timestamp_created":1467125320,"timestamp_updated":1467125320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50188678503036499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23894935","author":{"steamid":"76561198134403721","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1643986064},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень не оптимизирована, русского языка не поддерживает!!!","timestamp_created":1467124592,"timestamp_updated":1467124592,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505877792835235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23894729","author":{"steamid":"76561198015374038","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1473015276},"language":"english","review":"Not really very \"horror\" but it can be scary when you're running away from the killers and it can and will get VERY intense.

Я решил сыграть сначала за маньяков, а чтобы сыграть надо ждать по 3 или 5 или 10 минут. Серьезно, за это время можно заняться другими делами. К счастью, я всё-таки сыграл за 3 доступных убийц. И знаете что?\nИз 3 сатанистов только 1 меня заинтересовал (чувак с бензопилой). У него отличная способность - рашить с бензопилой и надеятся, что попадешь в [u] кого-нибудь [/u]. У всех других более скучные и ими можно вообще не пользоваться. Вообще.\nЧто насчет выживающих... О-О-О-О-о! Насчет, того что там 4 персонажа на старте, то их (как и убийцу) надо качать. А прокачка здесь задротская. Сыграй в одну игру получих 3-5к очков можешь купить 1 скилл (У меня была такая ситуация). А потом, через несколько матчей можешь и LevelUp-пнутся. \nНо из-за того, что я решил сыграть с рандомными людьми (А у большенства моих друзей нет этой игры, а другие это чистый рандом и я их не знаю), то я получал чистую жопную боль за попыткой выжить. Знайте, если вы режили купить эту игру, чтобы \"отдохнуть\" и поговорить с кем-то, то вы попали не туда. Большинство игроков в Dead by Daylight - это мудаки. ОСОБЕННО это убийца, который ждёт твоей погибели, стоя перед тобой. А остальные выжившие либо занимаются своими делами, либо ждут момента спасти тебя (Из нескольких матчей только одна дама всё-таки пришла и спасла меня. Спасибо большое, ВЕДЬ ПОТОМ СРАЗУ ЖЕ МЕНЯ СНЁС ЭТОТ УРОД И ПОСАДИЛ НА КРЮК И Я СДОХ ТВАЮЖБ*6МАТЬ!!!!). И уже после 4 поражений я решил, что для того чтобы выйграть в этом аду надо быть МУДАКОМ. Но игра вообще перестала соединять с игроками и я решил удалить её и вернуть деньги.\n\n[h1] ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ [/h1]\nЖизнь - боль... тортик это ложь... если вы попались на крюк, то 100% вы уже труп... и имейте 100 друзей, чтобы сыграть в эту игру. + Игра ещё и не страшная.\n \n4 мудаков из 5.

Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.\n\nYou can also play private matches with your friends and you won't lose anything if you do die as a survivor.\n\nThe ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called [b]PIPS,[/b] according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.\n\nSo the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren't that perfect...\n\nTLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.\n\n[h1]NEGATIVES[/h1]\nThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:\n\n- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a shit ISP.\n- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...\n- You will lag in almost [b]EVERY[/b] game.\n- You [b]WILL[/b] rage.\n- You [b]WILL[/b] die in stupid ways.\n- You [b]WILL[/b] get stuck in objects.\n- There are [b]HACKERS[/b] in this game too!\nNow it's time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has shit internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn't affect him at all. [b]LAG[/b] will ruin you, and make you rage. I've lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you're lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer's chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character [b]FREEZES.[/b] Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.\n\nYou will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these [b]TRIALS[/b]) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \"Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\" So I go behind 'This tree' and crouch and he walks past me. \"Yeh I'm all good.\" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn't move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn't see me. Although he didn't see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn't going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a [b]HUGE[/b] advantage in the game. This also isn't the only object I've gotten stuck into.\n\nI have recorded games I've played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I'm talking about.\n\nLast but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn't even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven't even prestiged, including myself. \n\nTLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn't really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn't give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.\n\nThank you for reading my review!","timestamp_created":1467123469,"timestamp_updated":1467123469,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":278,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.747620165348052979","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23894293","author":{"steamid":"76561198142903860","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1506448142},"language":"german","review":"CONTRA:\n-Alle campen als killer in diesen spiel\n\n-die kack survivor haben auf jeder map mehrere spots wo der killer sie gar nicht kriegen kann und sie campen dann auch da\n\n-Feuer Rauch Nebel sind alles pngs die immer zu einem gedreht werden (also 2d)\n\n-Jede menge glitches (z.B.
