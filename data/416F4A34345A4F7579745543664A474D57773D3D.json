In vielen Rezensionen wird angemerkt, dass bestimmte \"window-cheese-spots\" das Spielerlebnis für den Killer zum Albtraum machen, allerdings stimmt das nur zu einem sehr geringen Anteil. Ich hab auch schon oft genug gegen Leute gespielt die die genannten spots nutzen und sich auch nachdem ich sie geschlagen habe geheilt haben. Daraus wird dann schnell ein \"Mindgame\" und wenn man es richtig spielt schafft man es auch. Wie bereits der Spielentwickler selbst in einem seiner Q&A Streams auf Twitch gesagt hat: \"Get good!\". Auch zu den Vorwürfen es sei unbalanced bin auch ganz anderer Meinung. Alle drei Killer haben ihre einzigartigen Skills und Spielweisen, jedoch ist keiner von ihnen OP oder im Ganzen unbalanced. Eine Lösung für das Problem mit dem Windowcheese ist bereits bei den Entwicklern in Arbeit und sie kennen die spots in den Maps, wo das besonders missbraucht wird. Aber aufgrund von einer Sache kann man meiner Meinung nach nicht ein ganzes Spiel negativ bewerten. \nDen einzigen wirklichen Kritikpunkt den ich bislang habe ist, dass es keinen Partymode an sich gibt, um zusammen gegen andere \"Randoms\" zu spielen, sowie Hacker die sich Bloodpoints ercheaten und alles direkt freischalten. Glücklicherweise spielen die Hacker dann trotzdem grottig und haben auch trotz ihres cheats keine große chance. \nAlles in allem kann man dem Spiel eine Wertung von 8/10 geben, welche sich nach oben verbessert wenn der Partymode integriert, Cheesespots verhindert und Hacker gebannt werden.

У четверых выживших общая задача - завести 5 генераторов и сбежать, но препятствовать этому будет маньяк/монстр. В игре есть 3 вида маньяка/монстра. У каждого из маньяков своя специальная возможность (Капканы, бензопила, невидимость), и свои специальные перки, которые можно прокачивать получая опыт. Игра ненадоедает т.к. у вас всегда есть к чему стремиться. У выживших тоже есть свои специальные возможности (аптечка,ломать крюки и т.д.). Играя за выживших, у вас есть выбор - либо вы будете держаться в команде и по возможности помогать своим товарищам, либо жертвуя товарищами, которые нуждаются в помощи идти к победе...\nХоть игра и новая, в ней довольно таки мало минусов, сейчас я перечислю основные.\n-\n1. Русский язык... А вернее его отсутствие. Очень сложно разобраться во всех этих перках и вещах.\n2. Нельзя звать друзей в открытое лобби, можно конечно создать закрытое, но где вы найдете 5 людей?\n3. Failed to join the game... Иногда нужно нажать кнопку \"Поиск\" от 5 до 15 раз, не знаю с чем это связано...\n4. Я даже не знаю, плохо ли это... Но упомянуть стоит - в игре нету средств общения - не микрофон, не чат. Чат конечно есть, но только в лобби.\nНу, из минусов вроде все...\nТеперь, перечислю плюсы.\n+\n1. Атмосфера страха и волнения. 10/10\n2. Довольная низкая цена.\n3. Много персонажей.\n4. Раунд состоит только из людей, никаких тупых ботов. Возможность игры как за живых, так и за убийцу.\n5. Эмоции незабываемые.\n6. Довольно таки интересный сюжет и задумка у игры.\nИгра отличная, без учета того, что на игру не выходило не одно обновление ( игра вышла 14.06.16 ).\nМоя оценка - 9.2/10 \nОт себя хочу добавить - игра очень крута тем, что в ней перед тобой всегда стоит право выбора - представьте ситуацию, где-то недалко от вас бродит маньяк и рядом ваш союзник попал в капкан...

You'll laugh alot and you'll complain alot about your friends, leading the killer directly on your trail, leaving you hanging from the tip of a hook at the end of the day. At the same time, you get kind of happy, seeing the killer chasing down one of your friends, for it means you can have your time with the generator. \nYou will percieve your own heartbeat as the killer roams your area, sometimes just inches away form your characters model, without seeing you, as long as you don't move. \nYou will curse yourself for running away and give in your position,  when the killer is heading your way, without having you actually spotted at the beginning. \nThis game is a lot of fun, if you and your friend can set up some simple rules:\n- no hard hook camping\n- no window hopping\n\n... the bad part is... those rules are ignored online.\n\n---: Lame online gamplay\nAll the fun you have with your friends vanishes into the mists of point farming, when playing this game online. People are less than seldom interested in helping you from a hook or quit the game as soon as they are hooked themselves, sometimes even before they actually hit the ground from the second hit the killer needs to ground them. But who can be mad at them?\nIf you got hooked, killer is more than likely staying at your hook and watching you die, even though the others will get some generators done in this time, because your death equals points for him. \nPlaying this game online is the TRUE HORROR you will experience... For it is ALL about points and keeping items, addons and perks, on both sides. \n\nConclusion:\nIf you have friends to play and skype with, this game is a must have and will keep you entertained for quite a while.\nIf you don't have enough friends (...poor little thing you are...), don't by the game unless issues are fixed.\n\nNote: There are quite some mechanical problems in the game. Namely, weird engine behavior and display issues. Mostly, they are harmless and can be ignored for the fun having with your friends.","timestamp_created":1467107745,"timestamp_updated":1467107888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23887841","author":{"steamid":"76561198056975310","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1656492810},"language":"english","review":"The games fun","timestamp_created":1467105779,"timestamp_updated":1585955234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23887239","author":{"steamid":"76561198200816942","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1621,"last_played":1515679672},"language":"russian","review":"ДА ИГРА КРУТАЯ НО БЫЛО ЕЩЁ БЫ КРУЧЕ ЕСЛИ ВЫ МЕНЯ БЫ РАЗБАНИЛИ Я НЕЧЕГО НЕ ДЕЛАЛ","timestamp_created":1467104062,"timestamp_updated":1495525347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23886754","author":{"steamid":"76561198090091211","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":44284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2103,"last_played":1623929059},"language":"english","review":"Support team of this game. \nPlease do handle all the current bugs and unstable server issue. \nI have been disconnected from game serveral times in a day itself. \nI believe it's not my network issue as my friend is still able to cont the game in the same lobby as me. \nThis is getting so irritating for a person to play the game. \nHope to see the improvement of the game itself asap.","timestamp_created":1467102566,"timestamp_updated":1467102566,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23886590","author":{"steamid":"76561198208472443","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":29193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1659702369},"language":"schinese","review":"…非常有创意的一款游戏，游戏平衡性做的非常好，幸存者玩起来非常的紧张刺激…如果匹配不到人可以挂vpn，游民星空上有汉化，值得一玩！","timestamp_created":1467102053,"timestamp_updated":1467102053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23886537","author":{"steamid":"76561198304587024","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1494305258},"language":"russian","review":"Нет ну давно надо было добавить игру с режимом маньяка\nКачественная игра .Мне нравиться","timestamp_created":1467101841,"timestamp_updated":1467101841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23886492","author":{"steamid":"76561197991520744","num_games_owned":589,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":3013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1203,"last_played":1632609392},"language":"english","review":"Had to change my review.

I hover briefly over each to check levels and names: One is called 'Drizzy is AIDS.' I silently tell myself that this player is going to end up being a real jackass.\n\nI run around the level, snatching mo'fuckas up in bear traps and slinging people onto meat hooks. It's well-fought, but the team doesn't work together, and divided they fall. After a few minutes, I've gotten three sacrifices. Notably absent from the list? You've guessed it--Mr. AIDS.\n\nDrizzy doesn't even bother to try and start generators. After about five more minutes of running around looking for him, I decide to just wait for him to disconnect or try to escape, passing the time by reading some guides for killers that are new to the game.\n\nTen more minutes pass. No movement. Nothing in the guides tell me about these sorts of players, but it doesn't take long before it dawns on me: Drizzy is hiding somewhere, trying to force me into quitting in a fit of rage. I smile as I begin the tedious task of checking every damned locker in the level.\n\nLocker after locker with no Drizzies inside pass before I realize that this guy is probably hiding where he assumes I'll never look. I head to the basement, replete with blood, gore, and baling hooks, only to begin checking lockers. I finally get to the furthest locker and open it up, and would you guess who was cowering inside? Drizzy! The reunion is sweet as the P.o.S. starts screaming, right before I lovingly slide his wriggling body onto a sharpened, curved piece of pig iron.\n\nDrizzy doesn't plan on staying there, however: As I watch, he somehow frees himself from my beautiful contraption, only to fall to the floor limping and bleeding. I observe somewhat detachedly, a grin spreading across my face, as our hapless protagonist attempts to run upstairs.\n\nA crude machete cuts Drizzy down as he reaches the top flight, leaving him crawling on the cold stone floors in pools of his own blood. I find myself standing over him, watching curiously as his life meter drains; he drags himself around the map, grunting as he does so.\n\nAfter about three minutes of me waiting, his life meter finally has only a sliver left. Humming a sweet little show tune to myself, I pick up our friend and drag his ass back to the basement, throwing him up on a hook yet again. I set a bear trap under his feet as he dangles there, looking quite troubled, indeed. \n\nAs Drizzy attempts, yet again, to drop himself from the hook into the waiting jaws of the bear trap below, our eyes finally meet. Gazes lock as the pain of torment, loss, and even betrayal simultaneously flash across that beautifully-lotioned face of his. I smile for the last time as I whisper softly to our good friend Drizzy: \"-I- am the AIDS, Drizzy... -I- am the AIDS.\" \n\nI could have sworn that he nodded, eyes full of recognition as they started to turn gray. He stops struggling, going completely limp. I stroke his sweet, sweet afro as netherworldly appendages arrive to impale him. \"-I- am the AIDS, Drizzy. -I- am the AIDS.\"\n\n11/10 would be the AIDS again","timestamp_created":1467097825,"timestamp_updated":1467097825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596311628818511963","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23884982","author":{"steamid":"76561198147339131","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1981,"last_played":1578837163},"language":"schinese","review":"买来以后玩了这么久，渐渐熟悉地图和操作，从一开始的腊肉王变到猥琐的草丛伦，这个游戏还是很好玩的。戏耍屠夫死了也开心，只想告诉大家，这里面的段位无所谓的，不要再一直拔网线了，屠夫抓那么久也累人家辛辛苦苦玩屠夫，也是要分的，这个游戏并不恐怖，玩的时候不要紧张，别把屠夫当仇人。","timestamp_created":1467096336,"timestamp_updated":1467096336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51327437162399292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23884661","author":{"steamid":"76561197976071098","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":75111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":97,"playtime_at_review":27792,"last_played":1660087116},"language":"english","review":"This game is a steaming pile of shit, should have done more research on it before spending the money for it.

Firstly, they have this stupid Season Reset system which resets player's Ranks every so often. What this means is that everyone essentially starts back at Rank 16-20. So a person with 3,000 hours as a killer may face 3-4 survivors with 50+ hours and annihilate the game (and vice versa). This creates a very unfair game and you would want to quit as a new starter.\n\n2.) Unlike other team games (like TF2) where you can still carry across if you end up with dudd player or 2 (from the 4), this game heavily relies on ALL 4, so if you have a bad one in your team, you'll most likely all end up dead\n\n3.) The Devs seem to Buff & Nerf various killers/survivors very frequently, you can never master a player without either that playing being buffed or nerfed. This shows that after 2 years the game is imbalanced.\n\n4.) They try and discourage the killers from camping however they create perks that simply promote it like Dying Light where you have to kill 1 specific survivor to gain an advantage.\n\nSorry for the new-comers who don't understand some of the points above as they're specific but don't spend $19.99 unless you've played imbalanced games and happy to try and have fun.","timestamp_created":1467090224,"timestamp_updated":1509011015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23883201","author":{"steamid":"76561198014212931","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":41491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":667,"playtime_at_review":40890,"last_played":1660577600},"language":"schinese","review":"初始化失败，一直初始化失败。\n现在流行不让人玩了还是开始封中国玩家了呢？","timestamp_created":1467090001,"timestamp_updated":1660299302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23882967","author":{"steamid":"76561198124710222","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":19657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1371,"playtime_at_review":1072,"last_played":1660550008},"language":"english","review":"can not play with friends , and F*** the killers all they do is camp ! no fun no nothing at all it was cool for a momnet but dammm  really all you do is camp","timestamp_created":1467089052,"timestamp_updated":1467089052,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511307775974273682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23882824","author":{"steamid":"76561198042038430","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":82924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":882,"playtime_at_review":72422,"last_played":1660588911},"language":"english","review":"Interesting game, nice concept, fun to play.\nTips for future lobbymaking:\n1) try to get lvls together, aswell for killer as survivors (killer low lvl vs survivors with 4 OP perks? makes no sense and vice versa)\n2) lobbying with friends (maybe give the killer powerups when there are survivors playing together?)\n3) punish lobbyleaving 24/7; should deduct a system where you would start getting penalized after leaving 3 lobbies or smth.

There are many killers now, all with unique powers and new perks to keep everything fresh, which is nice. Same for the survivers, all have recived lots of new additions. I also noticed many really abused infinite loop palate areas have been patched up or fixed all together which is a nice thing to see. Also a ton of new maps which change the style of how you play, e.x, some maps are way more open, while others will be closed off more. They even increased the tick rate on the servers which is a major gain for everybody.  \n\nCONS:\nWhile most infinite loop spots have been fixed, there are about 20 different bugs that haven't been and they are game breaking when exploited. To give context, I mostly run killer because thats how I enjoy the game, and the more and more lower ranked you go in DBD the more of these bugs and exploits get abused each game. \nFor example, Its VERY common to find teams of 4 people who, when carrying a hooked survivor, will rush the hook and stand in the exact spot that bugs the UI so you are UNABLE to hook the survivor. Not being able to hook the survivor in DBD, which is your primary goal, is absolultey game breaking, and the fact that all they have to do is stand in a certain spot to \"glitch it out\" shines light on how well the devs are at fixing basic issues. This issue was in the game when I left and is still here to this day. \n\nMy next and last complaint about the game, is more towards the community that plays it, and less about the game. Although, the game, and how it functions, does lead to players acting with this behavior. It is VERY common for to dissconect from the match if they even have the smallest idea that they are going to lose. This wouldn't be a huge issue, except for the fact that it can cause you to not rank up or maybe even derank if enough people disconnect early on. Why give the survivors this power? It gets to the point where I will catch someone going over a pallet and they will DC in my arms 2 seconds after, and now I have to be punished for that? Why not have a leaving penatlity? Why is this STILL an issue in this game?\n\nOverall this game is a blast to play, but some of its issues make it really hard to continuely play. You basicly shoot a gamble with each match, and hope the survivors don't know the glitches or good luck.","timestamp_created":1467081435,"timestamp_updated":1600103990,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492978811264038086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23880635","author":{"steamid":"76561198043813456","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1467080794},"language":"english","review":"Being a killer is to hard when you face a lvl 7 survivor not because they are better or anything just the sheer fact they can hop windows over and over again while the other 3 do whatever they want.
