음성채팅이 돼버리면 살인마의 거의 모든 행동이 최적의 움직임으로 파훼당하기 때문에 살인마가 미친듯이 불리해지기 때문이다. 이런 경우엔 살인마가 생존자 다인큐보다 훨씬 잘하거나 하는게 아닌이상 1킬조차 하기도 매우 힘들어진다. 설상가상으로 종종 어떤 다인큐들은 이런 유리함을 악용해 살인마에게 심한 인성질까지 한다. 왜냐하면, 한놈 잡아서 다같이 갈구면 자기들은 재미있을 테니까.\n ㅡ이렇게 명확한 문제가 있는데, 데발진에선 그 어떤 구호 조취도 취하지 않고있다. 아니 오히려 권장하는 모습을 보이고 있으니 살인마 입장에선 기가 찰 노릇이다. 그러니 살인마 유저들은 알아서 다인큐를 잘 거르거나 아니면 실력이 월등해질 때까지 그런 온갖 부조리를 감내하는 수밖에 없다. 그리고 그런건 당연히 할짓이 못 되니까 살인마는 계속 줄어들고 있지.\n\n\n다인큐는 이겜의 부조리한 문제점 중의 하나일 뿐이다. 위키에 가면 문제점이 다 나와있으니 구매를 고려한다면 찾아보면 좋다. 아님 생존자만 하든가.\n\n\n또 혹시라도 살인마를 하고싶다면 절대 한국서버에선 하지 말길 바란다.\n한국섭은 생존자들 실력이 너무 썩어문드러진 살인마 죽음의 땅이라서 어중간한 살인마들은 엄청난

여가시간을 써서 고통받아야 할 이유가 전혀 없지 않은가.\n\n+21.7.27 일자 패치로 데발진이 Stun Validation 이라는 걸 업데이트했습니다.\n이제는 살인마가 타격을 할 때, 기절 판정을 우선적으로 체크해서 살인마가 타격 직후 기절에 걸리면 타격 성공이 무효화됩니다.\n이게 무슨 소리냐. 쉽게 말해서 이제는 살인마가 때린 직후에 판자에 맞으면 그 때린 것이 무효화된다는 뜻입니다. 이제는 생존자가 맞은 직후에 판자 내리기를 하면 살인마도 기절시키고 그 생존자도 맞지 않은 게 된다는 의미죠.\n\n와... 정말 대단하네요.\n\n그래도 어찌됐든 다시 적응해나가겠지.. 언제나

А может и в самой игре\nб) естественно петушиный вид. Каждый оффник и токсик носит вызывающую одежду, чтобы найти партнёра по спариванию, желательно одного пола. \n2. Проблемы с серверами. Играя в эту хуету, я попадал в лобби, где пинги выше 300, и пробития доставали, вроде бы, в безопасных местах, но хуй там купался, где вы сидели, теперь вы на крюке или замеменчены пидорасом, который поджёг это всё говно, запёк и схавал. \n3. Естественно, это обновления и добавление дизбаланса в игру. Если вы хотели Gay-pop исполнителя - ловите 16 ножей, и мементо сверху, как знак унижения. \nНёрф нюрсы. Медсестра - интересный ман, но нужно уметь играть как против, так и за него. После обновления(которого я не застал, но видел на ютабе как челики страдали)люди просто удаляли игру из-за того, что Нюрсу понёрфили. Конкретней: ей сломали блинки, как и руки разработчику нахуй, потому что они стали кривыми и через жопу. Летишь за сурвом, он за шинами, хуяк - а ты уже в подвале, хотя держал блинк не дольше секунды. Второй блинк просто не нужен, в тайминг никогда не попадёшь, и есть же Анюта, у которой хитбоксы попадания топорами сломан вообще пиздец.

Все знают, но не все хотят признавать это. Всего хорошего тем, кто всё же собирается покупать эту хуету. А те, кто не покупают и сидят, смотрят на ютабе, ловите респект и кайфуйте лучше на ютабе, чем быть повешенным за жопу и уже гореть с того, что какая-то шлюха тебя пробила за стеной. \nИ как бы я не хуесосил эту игру, я хотел бы поиграть в неё ещё.

The advantage of the perspective allows humans to better observe the surrounding environment, so that they can still complete various fancy and difficult actions in the face of the pressure of the butcher.\nOf course, sometimes human players must make cruel and correct QAQ decisions under strong pressure.\n[h1]Psychological Game of Asymmetric Confrontation[/h1]\nThe game feature of asymmetric confrontation fills the immersive game experience of Dawn Killing Chicken in one fell swoop. In the face of immersive horror experience and unknown fear, the weakness of human nature is fully reflected. After a wonderful and exciting game, there are still lingering fears.\nIs it curled up in the corner, or is it active and calm to face?\n[spoiler]Maybe the next person (Tu) emperor, this emperor is you.[/spoiler]\n[h1]cheat?

He thought of everything the opponent wanted, and he thought more thoroughly than anyone else.\nIt's not just calm down and think together, you will only see people confused, but once you realize it, you will only feel wonderful and amazing!\nWho can imagine that the \"chicken-killing game\" that even children can play can conjure so many tricks like a kaleidoscope. Among them, the use of psychological tactics is paramount.\n[h1]Background setting[/h1]\nThe evil spirits used human hope as food to create illusions, based on the place where the killer had suffered terrible tragedies before his death, and let the killer hunt down the survivors here.\nThe game map contains a variety of random interaction points such as trees, grass, houses, etc. The overall weather system will also randomly generate dark or rainy and foggy weather.\nIn these maps, the higher the score of each game in a single game settlement, the more experience points and blood points will be rewarded in the end.\n[spoiler]The subtitle of the game is \"Death is not an escape\", which means that neither death nor escape is an escape.[/spoiler]\nBecause the survivor role played by the player is trapped in a world created by the evil spirits, whether it is successful to escape from a certain map, jump into the cellar, or be killed, the survivor will always return to the same place. At the campfire in the beginning of the game, everything that happened just now seemed like a dream. Then be chased and killed again or escaped again, infinite loop.\ngame character\nSurvivor (human) has a total of 14 characters, each of which has different skills. Except for the basic characters, you need to pay to purchase DLC to unlock them. Non-copyright characters can also be purchased with the in-game currency \"fluorescent splinters\".\nWhen entering the game, players can choose their own roles until the end of the round before they can change roles.\nWhen the survivor team repairs 5 generators, the gate will appear to escape. When repairing the generators, humans are likely to be caught and hooked by the butcher. The survivors must consider whether to save their teammates. The survivors can unite and overcome the difficulties. , You can also fight separately.\nThere is also a special way to win, that is, when there is only 1 survivor on the field, no matter how many generators are left, the cellar on the map will be opened, and the survivor can escape through the cellar without repairing the generator.\nThe butcher (killer) has a total of 13 characters, each of which has different skills. Except for the basic characters, you need to pay to unlock the lock. When entering the game, the player can choose by himself until the end of the game. The butcher hooks all survivors to sacrifice or kill, and the butcher can win.\n[h1]Finally, I wish the killing of chickens get better and better![/h1]","timestamp_created":1616451907,"timestamp_updated":1616452020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88911856","author":{"steamid":"76561198062774545","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1618456751},"language":"english","review":"spooky and fun","timestamp_created":1616451685,"timestamp_updated":1616451685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88910650","author":{"steamid":"76561198977962774","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10012,"last_played":1657694117},"language":"english","review":"Killer time :)","timestamp_created":1616449857,"timestamp_updated":1616449857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88910523","author":{"steamid":"76561198307658354","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1209,"last_played":1636319580},"language":"english","review":"very fun and good craic","timestamp_created":1616449686,"timestamp_updated":1616449686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88910384","author":{"steamid":"76561198991976945","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":18230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1640153715},"language":"english","review":"The game itself is very fun and addictive. For some reason though, the player base is %60 mentally ill, people. There is going to be times where the killer is going to get you down, and just wait for you to die in that way. And they do it so professionally, It's crazy how many times they did that shit. There are going to be times where the killer is going to camp. There are going to be times where your team doesn't save you from hooks and shit. There are so many bad things in the player base but still, the game is so fucking fun and I love it.\n\nUPDATE:\nOh boy. How innocent was I while typing this review. I thought the survivors were pure human beings. Trying to survive the death, trying to live. But I was wrong. The real devils are the survivors in this game. You have no idea how evil these pure-looking creatures are. In the story, they are the ones being haunted. You would think that this is true until you play killer for a while. You are not hunting them, they are hunting you. These disgusting devils will taunt the shit out of you at every second they possibly can. They will wait minutes in the exit gate just to press CTRL and taunt you. They will use lag hacks just to annoy the shit out of you. In my 20 hours killer experience. I have understood that the killers are more innocent than the survivors.","timestamp_created":1616449442,"timestamp_updated":1618105664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694497823715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88910038","author":{"steamid":"76561198086254517","num_games_owned":633,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":36774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26141,"last_played":1655971681},"language":"english","review":"I would like to iterate, this is NOT a horror game. Yes, the first 20-30 hours will feel very scary and you'll just want to hide and you'll feel helpless. Yes, the first 20-30 hours will make you feel like a menacing and deadly killer who's just toying with the survivors until you eventually murder them all. However, you'll quickly realize that this game is NOT that. This is a competitive 1v4 game with a horror THEME. It can be stressful, laid back and anything in between, but NOT scary.\n\nWith that our of the way, this is truly a unique and addictive game. The only kind of it's genre of Cat and Mouse that's truly pulled it off. As Survivor, you feel as if every single person's actions matter to the team as you work together to make it out alive. As killer, you need to micromanage the objectives, survivors and your time, all in an effort to sacrifice the survivors. \n\nThe meat of the game is the looping. Survivor runs away, Killer chases them. Simple on paper, extremely complex and engaging in practice. There's no better feeling in this game than completely outsmarting the killer in a chase and losing them completely, or mind gaming a survivor so they run directly into your arms as a Killer. Even with 435 hours of DBD, I still feel like I have a LOT more to learn and improve upon, both with basic mechanics and specific tech. \n\nI COULD go on about this game for hours, however, I would recommend getting the game and trying it yourself, as it really is it's own unique experience that really is worth getting into.","timestamp_created":1616448907,"timestamp_updated":1616448907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88910031","author":{"steamid":"76561199114039118","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":4156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1387,"last_played":1631691941},"language":"english","review":"worst mm ever","timestamp_created":1616448892,"timestamp_updated":1617012963,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88910018","author":{"steamid":"76561198163595266","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":993,"playtime_at_review":25212,"last_played":1660464114},"language":"japanese","review":"味方によって勝敗を左右されるのが嫌いなので、キラー側をいつも遊んでいる。ほかの方も書いている通り、煽りや放置、トロールに遭遇する確率が非常に高い。例えば、倒れた味方を助けず屈伸を続けるサバイバーや、ケバブ（フックにつるされた敵を殴る、戦略上ほとんど意味のない煽り行為）ならまだましで、勝利が確定したとたんにサバイバーをフックにつるさず放置するキラーなど。かなり面白いゲームではあるが、精神衛生上、このゲームを始めるのはあまりお勧めできない。\n　非対称（１対４）である以上、キラーがある程度不遇なのは仕方がないとして（だって人数同じだったらマッチが成立しないでしょ？）このペースでいくと、プレイヤー比が１対１０とかになちゃいますよ、エアプ運営さん？？\n\n10/23　追記\n現在、度重なるキラー愛好プレイヤーに対する虐待により、キラーは爆速でマッチする一方でサバイバーは１５分以上かかることもある。言うまでもなく、これはとんでもないストレスを生む。マッチングを始める前にはどれだけ時間が掛かるかわからないため、「ストレスになるならやらなきゃいいじゃん」という主張は通らないのである。また、このゲームを支えてくれていると言っても過言ではないキラープレイヤーは、そんなことを微塵にも考えていないパーティからの幼稚な煽りに耐えなくてはならない。「キラーをやるのが楽しくないなら、CIVでもやってればいいじゃないか（このゲームのディレクターによる発言）」。その通りではあるが、このままでは本当にリアタイのマッチング中のプレイヤー比率が１０対１になってしまうだろう。\nいや、もうなってる？\n\n2022/8/10　追記\nようやくキラー側が有利になる調整がいくらか入った。今ではむしろキラーの方がマッチングが長くなっているくらいだ。もちろんキラー有利の環境ではないが、非対称ゲームとしては十分である。よって、「このゲームをお勧めするか」については、「いいえ」から「はい」に変えさせていただく。","timestamp_created":1616448877,"timestamp_updated":1660112673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88909573","author":{"steamid":"76561198867763216","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4159,"last_played":1618269002},"language":"french","review":"J'adore le jeu","timestamp_created":1616448212,"timestamp_updated":1616448212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88908943","author":{"steamid":"76561199068826558","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1633721879},"language":"turkish","review":"bok gibi kitlesi leş katıle trol yapıyom onunde egılıyom direk kesiyo benı orospu cocugu","timestamp_created":1616447314,"timestamp_updated":1628506268,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88908450","author":{"steamid":"76561198078904144","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":88362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65847,"last_played":1653733390},"language":"english","review":"Great game since the beginning.
