When you first begin to play as a survivor you can expect to get reckted the first few rounds. There is really nothing letting you know what to do. The killer will seem horribly overpowered at first. I found that they are not as overpowered as it seems. While they don't have to hit you many times and it seems that they are right on your tail, if you can run randomly and get over obstacles than you have a chance to escape. This game does have some scares. I was playing with a friend and we were fixing the generator than all of a sudden the killer that turns invisible was right next to both of us. Scared the living shit out of us. It was very fun and winning is very doable once you get the hang of it and play with people that are not level 1. The game does have some issues though.\n--playing with a friend can be a bad experience. Multiplayer is fine very badly. My friend and I would have to back out of every gane and reinvite to continue the party. This is something that with most AAA titles would be seen as unacceptable. \n--Also, the game will let you click ready when you are already searching for a game which leads to a bug that stops the game search and will not allow anyone in the party to do anything. This leads to having to relog the client to continue play. \n--Items you get are notated as having uses. In actuality it is more like having a certain amount of usable seconds instead of uses. This could be explained more or reworded maybe. \n--certain aspects of the game seem unexplained. Does startling crows alert that spot to the killer? \n--It is entirely way to difficult to wiggle your way out of the attackers arms. With one execption. Of the survivors have diasbked hooks and the killer can only use the basement than it is easy to escape because the killer may have to walk for like 2 mins just to get to the basement. \n\nI would almost consider buying this if,some things were fixed. It seems great. I enjoyed the few hours I got to play it. The blood web system was awesome but can be worked on. The overall concept is great. The experience can be generally scary. Everyone who has watched a scary movie and thought man I would hide in the closet what is that stupid idiot doing hiding under the table, you kind of have the opportunity to do that somewhat here. It is scary and shit to run away from the killer and not even be able to see them. Really enjoyed the experience. I hope it has more free play time soon.","timestamp_created":1471759579,"timestamp_updated":1471759579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25047048","author":{"steamid":"76561198326156299","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":60860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":505,"playtime_at_review":6719,"last_played":1660526167},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game, but the community is heavily plagued by toxic players who must have been abused as children to act as horrible as they do.

These include the pallet teleporting and rediculous lunge range (though it still is fairly annoying, but nowhere near as bad).\n\nProgression also got a lot quicker, and you now get a choice at higher levels of what perk you want to take in a bloodweb (there is still a chance you wont get it).\n\nThis is a great game with friends, though a lot of players are very angry people. Expect a lot of salt from both sides as you play. Just ignore it and continue to have fun.\n\nThings I'm hoping the developers will look into and implement in the future:\n1. Lobby Ping - see the host's ping before the match begins.\n2. Something to fix when a killer pulls his plug for a second, causing survivors to DC intentionally and lose pips. This has been increasingly annoying lately.\n3. A reward for being Rank 1.\n4. Slightly more bloodpoint gain for survivors, as it's kind of low in comparison to killer.\n5. More maps for each location to balance out seeing Coldwind Farm a majority of the time.\n\nKeep in mind, this game is not easy to start out with. There is a lot of learning to do, expect to die often as a survivor, or get very few points/kills as the killer.
