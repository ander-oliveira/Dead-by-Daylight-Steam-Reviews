Never really played by myself. I like the concept and it works. It can get intense and frustrating and that's just when your mate \"accidentally\" lures the killer to your location. Then when you actually win, it feels so much more rewarding. I also love the soundtrack for this game and that it changes from a solemn acoustic guitar while a survivor, to a rather heavy distorted electric guitar as the killer. But I hear it all the time and here's why...\n\nThe game is a mess...\n\nMore so the queue and lobby system. It is absolutely horrendous. Why for the life of me I have to click \"READY\" 20 times within the span of a minute is beyond me. Throw me in a queue for at least two minutes before you make me have to click \"READY\" again. My mates and I have stopped playing the game after one or two games, simply because we don't get matches after 10-15 minutes of spamming that lovely FIVE letter word. Which is really dissapointing and disheartening.\nAnd there's no such thing as matchmaking. I queued as a killer (I'm only rank 20 with 12 hours played) and was matched with two rank 1's, a Rank 3 and a Rank 4. I had no chance... \nThere have been other times playing as a survivor and getting matched against people who have been around much longer than us, but nothing quite as extreme.\n\nAspects of the game are a little too confusing as well. I do like that the item descriptions stick to the theme of the game, but they're really vague and the fact that some or most of the items and offerings are only a one time use, which makes sense, is not explained.\n\nAlso, why am I not able to see the killer's rank? I know it's like that to keep the killer anonymous, but there are ways around it. Just have a shady black part of the screen with a default \"Killer\" sillhouette in front of some dead trees and leaves and then have the rank circle above their head like they do with the survivors. Not really a big issue, but it kinda irritates me.\n\n\nAll in all, I'm aware the game is still in BETA and I think the game itself is fairly alright. Obviously there are still major things that need to be fixed, like an overhaul of the matchmaking system (if you can call it that). Then the normal balancing issues and bugs which are not uncommon with any game.\nThe objectives are fairly obvious (Go for the generators. Don't get killed. Go for the generators. Don't get killed...) and the mechanics aren't the worst when you can successfully navigate those stupid skill checks. Not a fan of getting hit by the killer after I've slid or thrown down a barrier. Really not a fan and doesn't make sense. \n\nI'm on the fence. I recomend this game WHEN IT WORKS. Which is less than half the time, unfortunately.\nGive it a shot if you can, if not steer clear for now and pick it up when it's on sale or when the game is a lot more stable.\n\n","timestamp_created":1472043036,"timestamp_updated":1472043036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25111408","author":{"steamid":"76561198067014548","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1632853454},"language":"english","review":"This is my one of my favorite games.

Почему? Сейчас...\nПлюсы:\n-Идея. Вот реально что то новое на игровом рынке. Где еще можно выступить в роли маньяка и набить хлебало другу? Или побыть в роли жертвы и пытаться скрыться от него?(Но тут ничего удивительного, есть такие друзья от которых хочется спрятаться)) \n-Саундрек. Когда ты заходишь в меню, нажимаешь \"Стать убийцей\" и начинает играть соответствующая музыка. И ты реально чувствуешь что играешь за убийцу. Так же за жертву.\n-Дизайн. Уровни нарисованы очень красиво. Дизайн убийц и жертв тоже. Картинка радует глаз. \n-Атмосфера. Она тут есть, и еще какая. \n-Графоний. Ну мне лично нравится. Я не из графодрочеров. Но даже на минималках все выглядит весьма сочно и красиво. \n-Разнообразие. Ага. Много карт, аддонов и подношений. Костумизация персов(ну сейчас она так себе, не очень много). Но все равно это что то средненькое, в минус не отнесу. \nМинусы:\n-Баги). Баги тут, конечно, обворожительны. Например: жертву может так скосоебить, что она будет пострашнее маньяка. Ну или застревание в текстурах и прочее. Разрабы, вроде, не болеют Форестом. С каждым патчем что то да фиксят. Это хорошо. \n-Комьюнити. НО НЕ ВСЕ! Бывают такие игроки, которые кемперят(т.е. пасут жертву весящую на крюке), багоюзеры и мансеры (Но в последнее время мансеров меньше, дизайн карт норм переделывают), ливеры, которые так же подставляют.

A few bugs plague the early release, but overall it is fairly well polished. On both sides it can be an enjoyable romp, the four killers have their own unique feels that can completely shape a match. On the survivor side the perks they bring to the table can seem overall fairly mundane, till they save your life in rare instances against an overwhelmingly scary creature. The only issues I see with the game going forward, is a deal of players seem to take it as more of an action game then a horror game. They complain about constant overpowering on the killers side without realizing that many of their own shortcomings affect the way their own matches play out. I fear with the repeated abuse of the reveiw system that the overall feel of scary monster will be lost to a group of four action heroes sprinting around saving the world. More often then not I'm outwitted by many a decent player many levels below me, the issue is when I encounter a lvl 50 that not only has no idea what they're doing, but complain after the match that I'm a horrible player abusing the games systems. The community does need some work, but that isn't much to say for the game itself. As an over all, I feel the systems in place are well done, but I do hope they don't obsolete the horror element of this work of art, and turn it into just another mundane action title.","timestamp_created":1472010491,"timestamp_updated":1472010491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25105392","author":{"steamid":"76561198062678737","num_games_owned":668,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":9411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":289,"playtime_at_review":2425,"last_played":1660267091},"language":"english","review":"Is this worth $19.99? \n\nIf you answer Eight/8 of the Twelve/12 statements with Y/Yes - it is. :)\n\n#1 - I enjoy Hide and Seek.
