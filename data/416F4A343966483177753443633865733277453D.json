Единственное почему стоит апать ранг, так это для того чтобы в матч мейкинге на высокий рангах (за сурвов) (если вы играете соло) попадались опытные сурвы(и то сомнительно), здесь же и одновременно и минус, чем выше вы себе подымаете ранг тем больше шанс, что вам попадётся опытный маньяк который сделает - 4 и заставит пукан взрываться как ядерная боеголовка. (Про кемперов, читеров и прочих дудосерах которые юзают конфиг на красное свечение и прочее ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥о отдельный разговор)\n\nВывод - Играйте в пати, желательно в 4-ром, (киллеры при виде фонариков в лобби сразу ливают либо берут \"Детище света\" или \"Гибель Франклина\", так же чекают играют ли сурвы в пати(пинг в это время обычно подскакивает) (есть конечно фишка позволяющая брать те предметы в матч которые вам нужны не нарвавшись на перки приведенные выше) Носите часы, дабы хоть как то обезопасить товарищей от кемпа и тунелинга, % конечно маловат, опытные киллеры будут отсчитывать 15 сек, и только потом бить вас, могут вообще не дать снять, все зависит от игровой ситуации или стоять под инсидиусом. (Сразу споминаю Каннибала под инсидиусом, эх, классика:)\n\nСурвы\nПреимущества очень много,(главное грамматно их использовать, знать механику игры, расположение досок на карте итд) начиная от инфинитов в блядской лачуге или в другом любом месте где есть 2-3 окна с большой территорией для обхода, заканчивая перками, предметами и блядскими хороводами вокруг досок. (И даже если вам удалось поймать свою жертву у неё с большой вероятностью может оказаться еб*чий осколок;) (Любимая фраза маньяков: \"Сурв не может осколок поможет\")\n\nМаны\nПреимущества у каждого разные, не все маны способны тащить на 1 рангах (об этом позже) против потных сурвов или китайцев на хайлевелах, которые выбивают скилчеки на отлично под хексом и на 3 стадии безумия.\n\nСлабости - не все маны способны противостоять сурвам играющих в пати, (тут конечно все зависит от игровых ситуаций и умения играть за мана, но на выских рангах, все решает скорость действий, такая уж мета) так как вы физически не успеете делать несколько вещей одновременно, с учётом генраша и долгой погоней за сурвом шансы на победу становятся очень малы (Вам конечно может помоч НОЕД, но это не точно;) (Любимая фраза сурвов: \"Маньяк не может НОЕД поможет\".)\n\nМаньяки способные крушить черепа сурвам на любом ранге это:\n\n1-Наш любимый Билясик\n2-Нюрса\n3-Анна\n\nВсе остальные гораздо слабее и после 10 ранга заметно проигрывают другим, а на 1 ранге так вообще не дееспособны. (Опять же все зависит от умения играть, понимать ход игры, и действий сурвов. Как сказал Джон Крамер \"Все должно быть продумано до мельчайших деталей… если ты знаешь ход мыслей человека, сюрпризов не будет.\"\n\nВ заключении\nСкажу что игре есть куда развиваться, но разрабы смотрят совершенно в другую сторону, выпуская новых платных маньяков, нежели править баги, починить хитбоксы, починить лобби, сделать нормальный анти-чит, добавить новых игровых механик, сделать адекватную систему матч мейкинга, добавить значимость в рангах, пересмотреть получения очков и капли за обе стороны.\n\nПосмотрим как покажет себя новая система эмблем, которая конечно не совершенна и еще будет допиливаться. Забавный момент когда сурв и маньяк находят люк и начинается игра в стоялово, кто кого перестоит.\n\nПо поводу нытья и оскорбления с обеих сторон (Сурвы и Маны) вы оба друг друга заслуживаете, ругаться и выделываться на ровном месте нет смысла, дешевые понты ваше ЧСВ не подымут. Если Маньяк играет нормально без фейскемпа и прочей дичи то и разного вида оскорблений он не заслуживает. (Хотя есть большинство отбитых, которые в любом случии напишут вам какой вы кемпер итп, не смотря на то, хорошо вы сыграли или нет)\n\nТоже самое касается и Сурвов, если вы не делали пиу-пиу фонарем, не приседали в палетках, не юзали инфиниты, не бодиблочили крюки, не юзали осколок всей тимой, и не занимались прочей дичью (одним словом Токсики:) то и кемпа от нормального маньяка вы не получите.Если же вы являетесь Токсиком, то не удивляйтесь что вас потом кемпят.\n\nСистема игры кемп не поощряет, (это не критично) соответственно те кто кемпят и убивают, получают меньше БП, чем те кто ведет активную игру.Те кто наиграл больше 1к часов БП не так валнуют, как жажда убийства;) Аналогов у данной игры нет, либо есть схожие но мение интересные.","timestamp_created":1574229684,"timestamp_updated":1574229684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54185020923614502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57514313","author":{"steamid":"76561198009204894","num_games_owned":928,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":47628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":526,"playtime_at_review":3280,"last_played":1660267812},"language":"english","review":"bring back demo's gorgon","timestamp_created":1574229606,"timestamp_updated":1645149708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559127628803253174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57513988","author":{"steamid":"76561198798482118","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":25859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15675,"last_played":1645870433},"language":"english","review":"gudgame","timestamp_created":1574228930,"timestamp_updated":1574228930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495569020509719849","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57513982","author":{"steamid":"76561198262737492","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16502,"last_played":1636828776},"language":"tchinese","review":"半價買的玩了快三百小 太划拉","timestamp_created":1574228922,"timestamp_updated":1574228922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57513910","author":{"steamid":"76561198967468068","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1699,"last_played":1653674138},"language":"schinese","review":"牛逼就完事","timestamp_created":1574228758,"timestamp_updated":1574228758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57513492","author":{"steamid":"76561197985186574","num_games_owned":520,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2028,"last_played":1621310422},"language":"english","review":"Had not played in two years, so decided to try it out.  Five hours later, time to uninstall again.  Dedicated servers have made the killer play even more janky some how, with hits and misses that were not present before.  Only real way survivors lose under rank 112 is if they just run around and don't play the objectives.  As a new player, it does not feel good getting two hits, no hooks on average and just losing.  Even getting kills means they just didn't want to live, so what is the point?  I'll just watch players with the max/best skills have fun and enjoy this game vicariously.\n\nI kept trying since I am a masochist.  7-8 minute average queue time, with 7-8 minute average matches.  No kills, one hook each for BBQ.  20k average BP.  I'd rather level a warrior in WoW Classic with a gray 1H and have a better experience.
