I've been playing Call of Duty since World at War, though I skipped Advanced Warfare for lack of a platform to play it on, I considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark. So, when I built my own PC I couldn't really resist the chance to play another Treyarch Zombies experience. So, here's a little on the game modes. My lack of experience with Advanced Warfare means this is my first installment with the new mobility options, bear that in mind.\n\nCampaign: Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but by god this was the worst story I've played so far. Black Ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war gameplay with sci fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise. This time, the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission, assuming you're paying attention. I'm not sure what the message they're trying to get across in this game is, but it's a wholy unsatisfying experience, and by the 6th mission I was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so I could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end.\n\nYou're not fighting a war, because it's never really explained who you're fighting for, the game is one big game of \"Chase Paul Taylor around the world\" and by World I mean Singapore and Egypt. Level diversity isn't present here, and level design, while obviously catered to the \"new\" movement mechanics, isn't fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality. The campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh, but it doesn't really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games, no matter how linear. The weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too, as they're just \"Point at person, make them stop shooting you for a bit of time\" Which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead, or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room. The Campaign is needlessly padded with customization to add this illusion of content, when it's easier to just use the preset load-outs for each level.\n\nA boring experience with no payoff, bland characters and far too linear shooting. Playing this made me want to play Black Ops 1. The main problem I find with these overly futuristic installments is that they're not believable enough to immerse yourself in, and atmosphere is completely non existent. I hope they finally ditch this future ♥♥♥♥, it's been 4 years. Take me back to World War 2 already.\n\nZombies: I played about 4 games of the new map before putting it down for good. The whole easter egg thing was nice at first, giving you an extra objective and a way to get a few extras, like maybe all the perks on the map, but this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ absurd. You have to jump through far too many hoops just to get basic features, and it's just a huge chore, honestly. You pretty much have to do it as well, unless you want all your guns to be worthless by round 15. Once again, they compromised level design in favor of retardedly complicated story ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the bland cast of literal who's voiced by expensive actors, throwing back to Call and Mob of the Dead, but I never liked those ones anyway. Kind of annoys me that this garbage is the only map available unless you own The Giant, which is still the best map, or unless you bought the season pass.\n\nIt's pulled an Assassins Creed whereby they started tuning an overarching story into it but let it get too complicated and just ditched it, I've lost track of everything at this point. The worst part, as mentioned, is that they ruin the actual gameplay to make way for boring scavenger hunts. Shadows of Evil is boring to play, tedious and poorly designed. I haven't played a map as bad as this since Shangri-La.\n\nThe Giant, a reskin of Der Reise, still stands the test of time, however. The new visuals make this look absolutely gorgeous, and stands to remind me just how old this franchise is at this point. The map has not changed whatsoever, besides randomization of perk locations and a few small easter eggs (That don't take forever to do!) The mechanic of Pack-A-Punching your weapon twice was introduced in the first Black Ops and added generic attachments to your weapon, but now they add interesting mechanics to your guns, allowing zombies to explode into fireworks that damage other zombies in an AOE, for example. Finally, the Gobblegum machine is easily the best addition to the game mode since the introduction of the Pack a Punch in the original Der Reise. A fantastic way to add small power ups that are consumable. Extremely powerful ones, such as spawning an ammo box on command, are gated behind a drop system, which reeks of a micro-transaction system that was probably removed at the last second. As usual, I'll be waiting for the rest of the maps to release before passing my final judgement, but if you're going to buy the base game and that alone for a taste of modern Zombies, then you'll be disappointed.\n\nMultiplayer: And I thought League of Legends had mobility creep, yet here we are. There are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot, which is actually pretty nice, because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area. Sliding, Jumping, Wall-running all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game. I'll stand by the statement that this mechanic was a fantastic addition to the game.\n\nIn terms of balance, it feels like they've gone for the MW2 approach, whereby \"If everything is disgustingly OP, then nothing is!\" which isn't actually a bad thing. SMG's are still far too powerful, sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence, and for once the shotguns aren't garbage. Melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill, which I feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed. However, you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly, leading to a lot of knife only players. Maps are well designed around movement, but other than that they're pretty weak. None of them are fun or satisfying to play, and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever. All the maps are medium sized, and there's no real diversity like back in MW2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones. Nothing is unique, it's all grey again and devoid of color, which sorely disappointed me.\n\nHowever, as usual Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overflowing with content, and it's easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what ♥♥♥♥ like Battlefront gets away with charging £40 for. There's loads to unlock, accomplish and use. Every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to Skinner box you into playing more, yet there's still no real reason to prestige. This amount of content makes the game feel \"worth it\" in the same way a £50 box of 50 sweets is worth it, but you'll get bored of the same sweet eventually.\n\nConclusion: If you've never liked Call of Duty, this game won't do anything to change that. Couple the *complete* lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small PC player-base and uninspired themes I feel like this is one of the weakest Call of Duty games ever. And I enjoyed Ghosts. In its current state, I find it hard to recommend as what you get is a lot of content, but it's all frustrating and ultimately worthless. The running joke has always been that \"Call of Duty is always the same\" but this is no more obvious than in this installment. Feels like a mediocre side-grade of Advanced Warfare.\n\nIf you're reading reviews for a COD game, you're not the primary market. Don't buy this.","timestamp_created":1630370370,"timestamp_updated":1630370419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98535972","author":{"steamid":"76561198125875213","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1633578629},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1630368819,"timestamp_updated":1630368819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98535961","author":{"steamid":"76561198140095826","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":46387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37480,"last_played":1655159263},"language":"spanish","review":"La verdad un juego muy entretenido para jugar con amigos","timestamp_created":1630368791,"timestamp_updated":1630368791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98535937","author":{"steamid":"76561198077962518","num_games_owned":633,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":3259,"last_played":1660535759},"language":"english","review":"It's aight","timestamp_created":1630368744,"timestamp_updated":1630368744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505208373069763184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98535866","author":{"steamid":"76561199103280208","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1647192100},"language":"brazilian","review":"muy gangsta","timestamp_created":1630368647,"timestamp_updated":1630368647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98535538","author":{"steamid":"76561199073191291","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1651461180},"language":"english","review":"best game to have fun","timestamp_created":1630368066,"timestamp_updated":1630368066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98535037","author":{"steamid":"76561199034627693","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1635477143},"language":"english","review":"scawy","timestamp_created":1630367228,"timestamp_updated":1630367228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505208373069763184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98534870","author":{"steamid":"76561199073266446","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":149,"playtime_at_review":3056,"last_played":1660355075},"language":"english","review":"honestly i really only play this game for the cute character cosmetics and the lore lmao","timestamp_created":1630366886,"timestamp_updated":1630366886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505208373069763184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98534805","author":{"steamid":"76561199008802170","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":66300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60011,"last_played":1656299540},"language":"english","review":"Bad game, made me incredibly sad.","timestamp_created":1630366759,"timestamp_updated":1636935709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98534607","author":{"steamid":"76561199053642670","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5635,"last_played":1658187166},"language":"english","review":"ayo f u c k the developers of this game.
