Every game is a new experience, and personally I've found I'm a far better killer than survivor. I'm just not a team player. But picking those suckers off one by one is oh. So. Satisfying.\n\nEdit: There is an issue with survivors complaining so much that they don't win every game, calling EVERY killer OP and moaning until the devs bend to them. The game is becoming less and less scary for survivors facing killers and more about survivors being whiny little jerks making fun of inexperienced killers and flaming competent ones. I still recommend the game, but please do not join this community if you're just going to be another one of these whiny little babies. If you want to main as a survivor, don't complain when you lose.

Игра действительна требует доработки и заслуживает статуса \"Early Access\". Ждем и надеемся, что с будущими обновлениями и патчами всё поправят. \n  \nПо первым впечатлениям действительно хотелось запросить возврат средств за игру по вышеописанным причинам, да и до самой покупки очень скептически к ней относился, пересмотрев несколько видеороликов и полноценных стримов, желания поиграть в неё абсолютно не возникало. И вот, буквально на днях, состоялась акция \"FREE WEEKEND\", по случаю выхода нового бесплатного дополнения \"The Last Breath Chapter\", и 15% скидкой на саму игру, я всё же решился опробовать данный продукт.\n   \nСлегка войдя во вкус, я ощутил, насколько эта игра проработана в плане геймплея, такого трепетного отношения разработчиков к игре, я не помню со времен The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Разных \"тонкостей\" в игре полно, их просто невозможно перечислить, опишу лишь основные моменты. В игре практически не задействован интерфейс с подсказками [spoiler](это я сейчас про радар с уровнем обнаружения аля metal gear или hitman)[/spoiler], необходимо действовать почти интуитивно,  ориентируясь лишь по звукам и окружению. Например, шорох в кустах, бег, открытие ящиков и дверей, -могут легко выдать местоположение преследуемых. Самого преследователя в игре выдает нарастающий звук ударов сердца, но его легко спутать с собственным сердцебиением, особенно когда маньяк проходит мимо и ты даже не знаешь - заметил ли он тебя или нет. В этом плане Dead by Daylight можно назвать целым симулятором выживания. \n  \nИгра дает невероятные по силе чувства такого необычного страха, держит в напряжении и неуютном дискомфорте. Объективно, по такому описанию игра очень смахивает на других типичных представителей жанра survival horror, по типу  Slender, Amnesia или Outlast, но суть то в том, что за маньяка играет реальный человек и повадки у него не  запрограммированного бота, а реального человека.\n \nПрочий фан-сервис к игре тоже просто прекрасен. Различные арты из прилагаемого артбука демонстрируют очень основательный подход к воссозданию слэшер-атмосферы из фильмов ужасов. Саундтрек более чем великолепен, простой и одновременно очень душевный мотив, который так и хочется набренчать на гитаре, [spoiler](жаль не умею)[/spoiler]. А сюжет в игру не завезли, вернее он есть, передается через описание разных предметов и способностей, только вот глубокого лора как в Dark Souls ждать совершенно не стоит. Всё же, если бы Dead by Daylight была фильмом, то это была бы очень провальная задумка, сравнимая с \"Резня пневматическим молотком (1985)\".

Game is absolute trash, wouldn't play it if it was a gamemode in Tower Unite. It's straight-up unpleasant to play, even with friends it's absolute misery. Overall game design is bad in an infinite amount of ways and the gameplay itself is boring as all hell. Can not recommend this to anybody.\n\nMarch 2018: They added horror movie characters via purchasable dlc but other than that this absolute SNOOZEFEST is still the most boring game to involve murder other than Clue.\n\nJan 2017:\nSUMMARY: This game is not competitive material but the devs insist upon it being competitive, which has led to terrible design decisions and an overall lackluster game that represents the idea of a game that could be much, much better. Design choices gleaned from much better pvp games were hamhandedly and forcibly implemented. These choices are incredibly confusing and the result of which can be seen in the \"open menu\" section of the lobby, where there's like a skill tree that is really more of a loot tree, an inventory that is.. I really don't have words for what in the hell this is, and a perks menu which is equally confusing. Wtf is going on here?\n\n\nGameplay isn't very deep but it's functional, visuals are acceptable. The only reason to play this game would be to play with friends. It has great potential as a fun horror game but that idea is entirely abandoned in favor of tedious \"competition\" gameplay mechanics. Even IF this game was competitive in any tangible way it wouldn't matter because matchmaking is fucked up. Additionally, the maps and characters are so very boring.\n\nOverall this game is as \"ok\" was a game can get. Everything it is, is underwhelming. Major problems that aren't being addressed and will absolutely contribute to this game being forgetten in the next year:\n\n-In order to be a killer in matchmaking you have to be alone, which would be fine in any other game, however, most people including myself bought ths game *with friends* and intend to play it *with friends*. This evolves into a second problem:\n\n-I play this game with friends because it's not fun enough for me to want to play it alone (and everyone I've played it with would agree), killing my friends in a custom game is fun but you can't earn anything that way. Killing random people is boring. Even when I succeed it's just fucking boring, mainly because..\n\n-Killer gameplay consists only of \"see person, get person, put person in place, repeat\". Patience isn't rewarded as much as brute force is, there's barely any options, if any at all. Players can't even jump. You could play this game after downing a bottle of xanax and the results would be similar, only you might not be bored.\n\n-You can earn special items to use in matchmaking multiplayer games that you only can earn from matchmaking multiplayer games. These items and perks give you huge advantages *if you have them*. If not then go fuck yourself.\n\n-This game could have really cool maps and environments but instead every level is the same, flat, boring pac-man labrynth of random junk. You also cannot jump. Not that it would make the game any better if you could. Speaking of boring, killing people could not possibly be more boring.\n\n-Matchmaking times are ASTRONOMICAL. Ever waited 20 minutes for a match in any game ever? No? Me either.That's far too fucking long for a game I enjoy, much less a game that I feel completely ambivalent to (or did until I waited an hour).\n\n-Seriously, why are FOUR people waiting for ONE person in matchmaking for 15 fucking minutes, just let one of us be the killer. Who gives a fuck if we farm XP this game shouldn't be competitive in the first fucking place.\n\n-Lastly, rubberbanding issues, input lag issues, fail to join game and lobby connection bugs are prevelant and obvious. It took me and 3 friends like a half an hour to figure our shit out and get the game working, and by that I mean we gave up and started a custom game.

Surviving can be a very intense experience, although the gameplay itself is a little plain, as it is really easy to give your position away to the killer and you have to remember that you are hiding from a real person. Killing is concerningly fun, as there is this primal joy that you feel when you start chasing people around with a chainsaw. Imagine any slasher movie killer, and think from the mindset of a deranged psychopathic killer, and you will have a blast while also being concerned for your own humanity.\n\nAll of the Killers have their own unique ability such as going invisible, teleporting, or running really really fast with a chainsaw that can 1HKO. It sounds overpowered, but they all have a weakness that can be exploited by the survivors to help them get away, so you have to learn the correct time to use them. The Survivors and the Killers also have their own unique perks that can be unlocked through a random skill progression system. The perks give you all sorts of abilities that help emphasize different ways of playing.\n\nThe bad part of the game is that the gameplay itself is REALLY simple, so it can have it's dull moments. The real fun of the game is hunting down survivors, or trying to not get killed. The game is also very glitchy, although it has slowly gotten better with time and lots of patches. The game did not initially come with some very key features like key rebinding and friend matchmaking, but those are all in now, so don't believe the other reviews that say that they aren't there, although it is in in a very basic form at the moment. There are a lot of matchmaking issues, but they are being fixed, and it used to be so much worse.\n\nThe game is not perfect, but if you are patient with it and want to enjoy a unique type of fun that you don't get to experience in other games too often, then I would highly recommend trying this out.

It's something I see many people point out and complain about.\n\nSo, the game's fun, the concept of a killer trying to brutally murder a bunch of teenagers is simple, yet extremely fun and intense. Problem is, the game's a bit wonky. It has some bugs that can be quite frustrating while playing, the devs are actively updating the game though and are making sure everything runs as smooth as it should be.\n\nWhat you're essentially doing in this game is, you have a group of four survivors and you're trying to  escape the map by trying to activate generators, while the killer is trying to sacrifice all survivors to the so called 'Entity'. \n\nThe game provides hiding spots and cover for survivors, who need to sneak around and try to avoid the killer. An interesting part about this game is that the survivors play in third person, while the killer plays in first person. This is because it makes it easier for the survivors to spot the killer, while the killer might be suffering from intense tunnel vision and walk straight past his targets.\n\nAfter each game you will earn so called 'Bloodpoints', a sort of currency you can spend on items, perks and offerings that you can use in the game. All killers and survivors have different 'Blood webs', a sort of skill tree. This means that all characters have unique skills that can be used in the game.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yeah, I do. It's fun, especially if you have a group of friends to play with. I also feel like that fate of this game is in the hands of some good developers, who host a weekly Q&A stream on their twitch to interact with the community and develop the game further. I suggest you give this game a try, it's a really cool experience.\n\n","timestamp_created":1471734622,"timestamp_updated":1471734622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25042415","author":{"steamid":"76561198037368246","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":103125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98214,"last_played":1634755998},"language":"english","review":"i dont recommend anyone to buy this game right now, its a buggy mess and developers have no idea what they are doing.

I do enjoy playing with friends, but it can be boring when playing alone. The controls are alright, the graphics are alright, but my problem with it stems from the options menu (or lack there of), there aren't enough display options, the maps are too dark (would like some gamma/brightness options, but according to the dev's they would find it to be a cheat of sorts), and everything blends together. The animations are too slow at times for my taste, and half of the time it feels like nothing is going on in the map, its troubling enough to find people through the map (noting that it's not because people are good at hiding, just too hard to see anything). The music is repetitive as well, but I mean the game looks cool and that's about it. There are also not nearly as many running options for the killer as there are for the survivors, but I can say the killers are unique in their own right. \n\nThe last thing I can touch on is the fact that it is slowly becoming more and more of a controversial paid promotion game, which there lacks creativity, some find it cool but I want more original killers as well. I think this game is a gamble, you pay for what you get, but the DLC is where a lot of people go to when bringing up the game. As of the Pinhead chapter there has been controversy regarding NFT's on a platform that has actually banned that type of business model, while I understand that people will still play this game because it has become one of those \"streamer game\" titles, the developers only care about taking your money. If you want to spend your money on this game, it's your money, but I would wait for a sale because this game is a hard pass for me in terms of recommending.","timestamp_created":1471734349,"timestamp_updated":1634673450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25042249","author":{"steamid":"76561198236834864","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1482924114},"language":"russian","review":"This game is very best for all gamers in the world\nGraphic\nSound\nGameplay\n\nBest in all Ambitions!","timestamp_created":1471733927,"timestamp_updated":1471733927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25042099","author":{"steamid":"76561198214074508","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":430281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1365,"playtime_at_review":243050,"last_played":1659980006},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es puto vicio.
