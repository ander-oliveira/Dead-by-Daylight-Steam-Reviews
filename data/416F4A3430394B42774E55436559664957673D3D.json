Но эти 3 года были офигенны, но всё же. Что я получил от этой игры? А по сути ничего. Всякие плюхи, разрабы начали добавлять, аж почти через 2,5 года. Для ветеранов каких-то плюшек, особо и не добавили, а только сиди молча и соси хуй. Только и подстраиваются под новичков, которые продолжают ныть и ныть.\n\nСпустя 3 года -\n\nИгра превратилась в кучу сплошного говна. А разрабы сидят, жрут говно и смеются. Надеюсь они там подавятся. С каждым патчем! Либо кого-то нерфят и потом получается полное дерьмо. Либо нерфят то, чего не нужно нерфить. А если они что-то исправляют. Для них это всё баги игры. Банят даже за баги, которые они сами же и делают. И исправляют они только тогда. Когда пол народу перебанят. ОДНА ИГРА - ОДИН СПЛОШНОЙ БАГ.\n\nНу что я могу сказать. Не смотря на нытью со стороны игроков. Нерф дошел и до порчи. Сколько бы нытья не было по поводу порчи, не смотря на ген раш, даже с порчей. Ну да. Мы всё таки решим её за нерфить. Удачи, что я могу сказать им. За киллеров Press Esc и Delete game. Нет смысла уже играть за киллеров. А какой смысл? Вот и я думаю об этом. Если я хочу по чиллить или по убивать кого-то. Есть другие игры!\n\nДополню: А еще мы выпустили серваки, да серваки. Да нахуй нам нужны ваши серваки лагающие. Куски дерьма! Нахуй вы выпускаете бесполезный бателпасс?! Нахуй он нам сдался. Лучше серваки отключайте пидарасы.\n\nКонечно, лучше срубить по больше бабок, чем починить баги и т.д.\nА еще мы раздали всем эксклюзивные шмотки. А ну збс я смотрю вам там. Люди которые потели на тех же турнирах, за скины или кто-то просто выиграл на халяву а из немногих, кто-то даже покупал их, за приличную сумму. Теперь, они есть у всех!\n\nРазработчики - ебаные животные. Которые постоянно делают одно дерьмо. Ну зато шмотки офигенные делают да. За это им респект. Хоть что-то у них получается делать нормально. \n\nНадеюсь ваша страна и компания BHVR - Провалится в канаву. Лучше я сам лично приеду и сожгу вас офис к хуям.

und für sich ein sehr gelungenes Spiel, welches einen für lange lange zeit in seinen Bann ziehen wird. \nEin ausgeklügeltes \"Level-System\" in Form von Blutpunkten und interessanten \"Skill-Bäumen\"

Der Überlebensmodus, sowie der Killermodus machen beie extrem viel Spaß und sorgen besonders zu anfang für ein hohes Maß an Nervenkitzel. \n\nEin kleines negativ-Pünktchen gibt es jedoch auch: Wie in jedem anderen Spiel gibt es auch hier Personen die durch das ausnutzen von kleinen grauzonen den Spielfluss etwas beeinträchtigen. Um in seinen Rang als Überlebender, oder Killer voran zu kommen muss man eine bestimmte anzahl an Punkten absolvieren. Schafft man die nicht innerhalb eines Spiels so verliert man an Rang. Personen welche nun das Spiel, oder die Internetverbindung kappen, wenn diese nun im nachteil sind, versuchen hiermit ihren Rang zu sicheren, schaden jedoch den anderen Spielern und dem \"Killer\" da diese für den durchgang weniger Punkte erhalten.\n\nEine weitere anmerkung währe, dass man ggf. einen seperaten Online und Offline Account erstellen könnte, damit man auch beim Spielen mit freunden und bekannten Punkte sammeln könnte. Das, denke ich, würde auch die Zahl der \"Lobby-Jumper\" verringern.\n\nFazit: Das Spiel, Online, oder auch offline macht eine Menge spaß und ist jeden Cent des Preises wert!

current new cycle the developers have chosen for Survivor players is tedium and boredom. To make matters worse, they had enough balls to come out and say \"Lol we're not changing it until Q1 2023\". The state of the game involves the most toxic killer players you will ever encounter who get legitimate joy out of wasting your time - and they will waste your time because 90% of this game is sitting around waiting or otherwise doing nothing. The developers are too busy chasing down licenses and franchises to keep a stranglehold on the \"horror\" genre while doing absolutely dick about the moment-to-moment gameplay. \n\nThe only way you can have fun in this game is if you spend several thousand hours learning all the nuances and getting good enough that you can play competitively, and even then there is no guarantee of that because a lot of the critical perks you need to be able to play (for both killer AND survivor) is either locked behind paid-for DLCs or getting lucky with the Shrine of Secrets having the perk you need that week (a 1/52 chance, so basically once a year). \n\nHolding out hope that the developers will do anything major to the game that isn't just a few tweaks to stats or changing how a certain popular perk works is folly because they just do. not. care. They're content to have a game ride on the success of their licenses while doing nothing about the fact that the majority of the game is sitting around waiting or otherwise doing something boring like holding 'E' on a generator. The chase is the most fun part of the game and they have intentionally changed the meta so that chases are short and killers benefit immensely from getting survivors out of the game as quickly as possible - which means that they spend their time doing anything BUT being chased. \n\nUntil this changes, this game will only be fun for the initial novelty or the competitive players who spend thousands of hours in it having absolutely no memory of the past five matches they played because they are all fundamentally the same: Spawn in, get tunneled/slugged, back to lobby. \n\nI've since uninstalled it and have no plans to pick it up again. I don't recommend you try it for longer than it takes to refund it because giving the developers any money at this point is just proving to them that they don't have to actually make their game fun as long as they keep throwing money at licenses/franchises.","timestamp_created":1466735184,"timestamp_updated":1658904554,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23741428","author":{"steamid":"76561198072660975","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":16988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10635,"last_played":1657766748},"language":"english","review":"Game seems fun but the price to unlock everything can't be worth it unless the whole set is 90% off.
