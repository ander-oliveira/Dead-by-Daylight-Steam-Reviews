If you play it with friends it makes it even better.

The game also get new updates with a bit of new content and for some festive holidays there will be special events.\n\nIf you haven't played the game yet I recommend that you buy it. If you also convince your friends to get it as well both you and your friends will have fun.

You also may want to get of the DLC'S so you can have perks that will help you.\n\n\nEDIT: 2022/07/31\n\nThis game has gone to shit, there has been so much more tunnelling and camping after patch 6.1.0 and the increase of hackers just made this game boring. There hasn't been a single match where a person hasn't disconnected and every game now takes extremely long to finish that it makes it boring. The time that you waste on this game is not worth it, the devs have taken out all the fun for both killers and survivors all you do when you load in to a match is see someone disconnect, the killer camp and tunnel you, or some hacker.\n\nBHVR needs to do something because this has been one of the worst patches they released it has made both sides boring to play the fun that this game used to bring to me is no longer there. Some of the perks changes are understandable, but others make you question wtf BHVR was smoking when the thought of the idea. Overall this game is no longer what it used to be, its too toxic now and everyone hates each other.","timestamp_created":1604378479,"timestamp_updated":1659292896,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78631945","author":{"steamid":"76561199015404992","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":38982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":432,"playtime_at_review":7386,"last_played":1660003287},"language":"english","review":"It has issues obviously but it's worth playing even if it isn't really scary.

Esto y si te gusta ser asesino (como es mi caso), pero si por el contrario te gusta ser perseguido, podrás encarnar a la víctima del respectivo asesino, y ser perseguido por este. Tendrás que hallar la manera de escapar y salir ileso.\n\nHablando de apartados técnicos, pues la verdad he de decir que me encanta en la mayoría de aspectos. Jugar como sobreviviente es divertido, y jugar como asesino todavía más. He encontrado algunos fallos o detalles faltantes como: Que quiero jugar como asesino, y el sistema de matchmaking suele ser tardado, pero en cambio busco ser sobreviviente e inmediatamente me encuentra partida. Otra cosa es que me hubiese gustado que se agregaran más objetivos que solo reparar generadores para abrir la puerta y escapar. En mi DLC favorito (el de SAW), las trampas para osos que le pongo a mis víctimas, la animación es excelente cuando el contador llega a 0, pero el detalle la cara destrozada in game me dejó un mal sabor de boca, aún teniendo en cuenta que el trailer muestra otra cosa.\n\n¿Debería comprarlo? ¿Vale la pena?

Most everyone BMs and stands around the exit and crouches repeatedly instead of running out, wasting my time and making me go up and hit them all to force them to run out, instead of moving on to the next game.

There are some \"rules\" that would be hard to learn unless someone teaches you them, mostly behavioural stuff to keep the game fun. Without going into the nitty gritty of it, the best way I can summarize it is this: you're not trying to win, you're trying to accomplish as much as possible in a match as you can. Because even if you don't \"win\", if you do a ton of stuff (survivors: healing, unhooking, working on as many generators as possible. Killers: Chasing as many survivors as possible, using your special, hooking even if it means they don't get sacrificed) you will get extra experience points and will be able to progress your characters. \n\nAll around it's an extremely fun game, if you don't want to spend any money on extra characters you don't have to, but there are some really fun DLC characters like Pyramid Head and the Demogorgon.","timestamp_created":1604359007,"timestamp_updated":1604359007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78620400","author":{"steamid":"76561198796221396","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":99,"last_played":1644287043},"language":"brazilian","review":"joia, porem nao muito joia","timestamp_created":1604358855,"timestamp_updated":1604358855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78620121","author":{"steamid":"76561198415394761","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3041,"last_played":1659243565},"language":"brazilian","review":"bem desenvolvido","timestamp_created":1604358426,"timestamp_updated":1604358426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78620034","author":{"steamid":"76561198930743373","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7117,"last_played":1654142337},"language":"english","review":"bruh","timestamp_created":1604358291,"timestamp_updated":1604358291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78619801","author":{"steamid":"76561198006312323","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":96676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2062,"playtime_at_review":1074,"last_played":1660577130},"language":"english","review":"Noice","timestamp_created":1604357953,"timestamp_updated":1604357953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78619792","author":{"steamid":"76561198346566982","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3236,"last_played":1644697444},"language":"turkish","review":"Başarılı","timestamp_created":1604357939,"timestamp_updated":1604357939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78619511","author":{"steamid":"76561198139915939","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22415,"last_played":1656247624},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, sempre com novas atualizações.

Mostly as survivor. A lot of that time is spent not playing the game thanks to long load times and poor optimization. This game is 5 years old and the only way you could tell that is by looking at it. It remains full of balance issues and bugs. New content must often be disabled for weeks after purchase as they try to fix the thing they wanted money for. There is fun to be had in the game but you either need to play with friends or have a high tolerance for nonsense. Plenty of toxic behavior that there isn't any true counter for. I kept coming back to it hoping it would get better as time progressed but they can't help but drop the ball again and again. Survivors still just do banal qt events every game. They've added to the lore but not to the mechanics. Killer can be more engaging for certain but seems to bring out the worst in people. The bloodweb (your method of progression) is uninspired and gets worse the more characters you level. Suffice it to say, I like the premise but loathe the execution and how much the developer seems to not care.
