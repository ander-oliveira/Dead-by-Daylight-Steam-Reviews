I love the game and have poured as evidence over 300 hours into it. There is a plethora of issues with this game, and even during the Winter/Spring Sale I still wouldn't say it is worth it honestly. The major concerns are: the game itself, the developers, and the community around it.\n\nThe Game\n\nIt’s a 4v1 survival horror game, you’ve probably seen reviews or gameplay that made you interested in the game, so I’m not going to explain what it is. The problem I have with the game itself is the complete lack of support and polish the game has. The part of the developers will talk about other aspects later on, but I will just talk about the game itself. \nIn short, the game is broken. This game charges you $20 (sales are different) and it’s in an abysmal state. It has been out for over 4 years and still is not even closed to being balanced. The game is incredibly survivor sided, there are these keys that survivors can get and they can all escape without even finishing the objective if a few stipulations are met which just wastes the killers time. Keys are absolutely broken in this game, now granted the developers said they are working on nerfing them, but the fact remains, at the time of writing this review, they are stupidly OP for the survivors.\nThe perk system is also broken. Each killer has 3 unique perks, and so do the survivors. However, only a handful are actually useful. For the survivors: Decisive Strike (which is locked behind the Halloween DLC), Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, and Adrenaline are some of the “meta” perks that most people who have played for a while run. Those who have played in the high “upper ranks” know that it is the same bunch of 2-4 perks every game. And it is the same for killer pretty much, with Hex: Ruin and Undying as well as Tinkerer. Now I am not blaming the community for choosing these perks, they are the strongest and produce the best results, it’s just that there is so many perks that are completely worthless or situational at best so they’re not even worth it to run; so the game is filled with bloated perks that pretty much do nothing at all, but just take space and time. \nThe game is a complete grind fest, though I have not played Destiny, I have played RuneScape and I feel that this game is a much more taxing than RS. Survivors barely get any bloodpoints (BP) for playing, but killers are flooded with them for playing which is a great incentive to have people play killer, but the amount you get per game is abysmal and barely makes a dent in the bloodweb. There are so many perks and items now, that it takes 3-4 games to finish a single bloodweb if you are a survivor. \nTo continue on the point of the grind, it brings up the Iridescent shards. These are a progression currency you get for leveling up by playing more which again encourages people to play, however the cost of getting something worthwhile is so astronomically high that it takes forever to get something such as a character. Now, every level I get ~300 iri shards, however, buying a character costs 9,000 shards. And the rate you level up isn’t like Fortnite where every game you’re going up one or maybe 2, oh no, you play like 4-6 games then you level up. And at lower levels, it’s not even a guarantee you get shards. So good luck trying to buy a new killer, or survivor bud. \n\nThe Developers\n\n“… or play something else for a week.” – Dead by Daylight Developer (M. Cole) 2018\n\nThe game is an unbalanced mess, the perk system is bloated more than a freaking water balloon. And the only fault for that is the devs. Now I am sure they are great people, and I don’t wish them any ill will, but with the closing of Friday the 13th and with Evolve left for dead, this is the only legit 4v1 survival game out there, but dear god this is brutal. Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. The devs are constantly updating this game, and bugs are still present. “bUt WeRe uPdaTiNg oLd MaPs”. The grabbing mechanic for killers, broken. Invisible walls, you betcha. Broken animations? In spades. Match making connection issues, oh there’s tons. Let me remind you, that this game is 4 years old, they’re still making new content (which has its own issues, more on that later) but there are still bugs throughout the game. The community on r/deadbydaylight and others have said that they would rather have a few months of no new content if they fixed all of the bugs and made the game a stable game. And what have we got instead? More NEW broken content. The most recent killer at the time of writing this, The Twins, was probably the worst DLC launch I have had the experience of playing. The 4.4 update introduced 6 new perks (3 killer, 3 survivor), when the DLC launched, only 1/6 perks worked as intended. Features on the killer were nonexistent, as the devs just did not put it in. Now I get that there were deadlines that were out of their hands but paying $20 (plus any excess money) and getting a broken update is just an insult to the playerbase. Fortnite, a free game mind you, who only makes money via V-Bucks is more optimized than this.\nYou just bought the game, a rank 20 killer, first game, you get ran over. At the end screen, you see a group of red ranks playing together. Now there is no problem playing with friends, but why on earth is a new player getting placed in a game with people who have over 1,000 clocked in. I wouldn’t be surprised if the killer just stops playing because match making sucks and isn’t fun. They introduced MMR in 2020, and that somehow was even a bigger mess up then the system in play now! And the developers see nothing inherently wrong with this, as nothing has really been addressed. They’ll change parts of the game such as bloodlust (which makes killers go faster over a period of time) and experiment with that for no reason, but broken matchmaking that turns people off of this game, that can stay the way it is. \n\nThe Community\n\nThis game’s community is one of the worst I have ever seen, and I have played a fair share of LoL. Camping people on hook, tunneling someone out of the game, end game chat, watching people bleed out of no reason are all part of the experience. Survivors are entitled and expect that a killer should hook a survivor, go AFK for a minute then come back and go after someone else. Killers, who control the pace of the game can easily go on a power trip and waste everyone’s time not hooking people. One aspect I didn’t mention was that as a killer, you are playing by yourself, survivors have friends with them, which just encourages the toxicity. There is a reason why survivor wait times are awful 1/5 of the game’s players are killers, the other 80% are survivors. The entitlement on both sides is what makes this game an awful place. I log in, play a game as killer, get 2/4 kills, in chat I’m told to uninstall the game, I suck, racial and homophobic slurs are thrown around like a baseball. How is this healthy for any community? I recognize that not every person is like this, but there is a perpetual cycle in this community that will not end, that being toxicity breeds toxicity. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe game is a blast to play with friends, and fun to play alone. But the state the game is in, the developers lackadaisical attitude, and the toxic community, I can’t say that this game is worth the money. I like it, but it is a nightmare, you’ll may have fun, but if you do buy it, just know what you are getting into.\n\nUpdate: The game is still broken as hell. A map doesn't work, the grind is one of the worst I have seen, but they just HAD to fix a cosmetic glitch that let you mix and match things.

the moment of writing this review I have about 350 hours in the game. \n\nI can thoroughly say, although it has some bug issues, some matchmaking issues, and an unbalanced player base, Dead by Daylight genuinely isn't that bad. It's a different type of pick-up-and-play game as opposed to Fall Guys or another battle royale. Through this game I was humbled to know that I indeed cannot outrun people in real life or video games. I appreciate the games decision to be able to purchase dlc with in-game currency, including the killers licensed from varying franchises. Not only that, even the characters from the game itself are each unique with differing designs, killer powers, and animations.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n-Nice animations\n-Unique characters\n-Different spin on a pick-up-and-play game\n-Not pay-to-win\n-Nice events to keep you playing\n\nCons:\n-Has a battle pass\n-If a killer uses an unfair/toxic tactic... they can't get reprimanded\n-Some glitches which though are difficult to occur... can be game-breaking.\n-Unbalanced ratio in the player base\n-You can be matchmade with extremely high leveled opponents at the lowest rank possible.","timestamp_created":1609723069,"timestamp_updated":1609723069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83952473","author":{"steamid":"76561198134336017","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1660591871},"language":"latam","review":"Buen juego","timestamp_created":1609722962,"timestamp_updated":1609722962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83952236","author":{"steamid":"76561198113349197","num_games_owned":727,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":39124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2115,"last_played":1658611502},"language":"english","review":"press space to struggle (fixed now but still a shit game)","timestamp_created":1609722693,"timestamp_updated":1643578097,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83952066","author":{"steamid":"76561199058262051","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":849,"last_played":1657308107},"language":"brazilian","review":"de terror porém muuuito fodastico","timestamp_created":1609722503,"timestamp_updated":1609722503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83951860","author":{"steamid":"76561199115044386","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":41374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1659551380},"language":"english","review":"spooky\n","timestamp_created":1609722262,"timestamp_updated":1609722262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn4675fYCdI+gwAI="}
