Obviously has its flaws which I'm sure you'll find pointed out by many other reviews here, but I can't undersell how the gameplay, primarily, has kept me playing through all the shit matches. During my time playing Survivor (which, admittedly, was always a Survive With Friends group) I enjoyed a majority of my matches; not all ended in wins mind you, but nonetheless, a fun experience versus the right killer. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for solo survivor, which during my short-term experience,  was filled with more frustration and loathing than fun. I hope more is done to address the severe shift in difficulty for both killers and survivors depending on whether or not the team is a SWF or not (changing / adding mechanics that would aid solo survivors - is there any reason they shouldn't be able to communicate more? Is a \"point\" and \"follow me\" gesture really all that's necessary for a game about cooperation?).\n\nKiller gameplay has always stood out to me - you can have some really, really fun matches even without getting wins but its entirely dependent on the survivor team you get. The stories about toxic teams are all too true; you will definitely encounter plenty of very uncooperative and rude players who are only there to try to spoil the fun for everyone. This not only makes the game worse for Killer but, provided it is a solo team, means that the other teammates will be effectively missing a member as they throw themselves into your face all the time. \n\nUnfortunate decisions by the developer means that the game in \"high-rank\" areas has a ridiculous amount of Survivors who will most often (and, logically, by all means) utilise the most sought-after, \"meta\" perks - causing the gameplay for Killer to become stale, furthered by the heightened levels of toxicity in higher ranks. This has come to a conclusion where there is a clear, distinct part of the player base that downright refuse to play as the Killer for the aforementioned reasons; meaning Survivors make up majority of the population on this game.\n\nWorth a purchase onsale, definitely. But please, try out both playstyles and, above all - just try to have fun. You don't have to win all the time.","timestamp_created":1643849157,"timestamp_updated":1643849157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109359277","author":{"steamid":"76561199031485927","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1658772597},"language":"english","review":"makes

началу было действительно страшно играть в эту игру. Атмосфера, звуки, погони без оглядки, а в дальнейшем игра становилась веселее) То есть, нет никакого страшного момента, со временем он исчезает, а убийцы, порой на них смотреть больно))) Со временем понимаешь, что разработчики этой игры не пытались как-то сделать эту игру страшной, тут совсем всё наоборот.\nВ целом, игра хорошая и в неё действительно весело играть с друзьями. Может тут нет глубокого лора и каких-то сюжетных линий, но может быть, когда-нибудь разработчики придумают что-то новое и интересное для этой игры)))","timestamp_created":1643830892,"timestamp_updated":1643830892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109343972","author":{"steamid":"76561198208626300","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":318,"playtime_at_review":3620,"last_played":1660155208},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1643830673,"timestamp_updated":1643830673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109343657","author":{"steamid":"76561198340802447","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":83215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83019,"last_played":1653850439},"language":"italian","review":"tutto stupendo","timestamp_created":1643830347,"timestamp_updated":1643830347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109343225","author":{"steamid":"76561199086248521","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":165,"playtime_at_review":2275,"last_played":1660170855},"language":"english","review":"yas","timestamp_created":1643829909,"timestamp_updated":1643829909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109343220","author":{"steamid":"76561198870256028","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1705,"last_played":1654475992},"language":"latam","review":"Me parece un gran simulador militar, en el cual puedes rolear en los distintos servidores de la comunidad, crear tus propias misiones o descargarlas de la Workshop de steam para jugar con tus amigos o pasar un rato divertido.\n\nLo recomiendo para entusiastas del rol militar!! 10/10","timestamp_created":1643829904,"timestamp_updated":1643829904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109342804","author":{"steamid":"76561198204967768","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4304,"last_played":1654031470},"language":"english","review":"Very good very nice, veryyy good very niceeee","timestamp_created":1643829474,"timestamp_updated":1643829474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109342476","author":{"steamid":"76561198205061897","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":674,"playtime_at_review":5914,"last_played":1660443783},"language":"english","review":"GOOD GAME\n","timestamp_created":1643829130,"timestamp_updated":1643829130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsb723f4CfPCNoQM="}
