If you like playing as the killer, this is your time, till whenever they hit DBD with a newer update. It is nearly impossible to win as a solo queue player. They said that they will bring balanced update to prevent tunneling and camping. Well, they didn't, they made it worse. I've run into killers that just basically made generator progress impossible, without a very coordinated team. I'm not high MMR, but, low to mid, and a solo queue, good luck with this update. As for me, I will be uninstalling, till I can play solo queue survivor again. New update for me 37/43 games, that I've lost since the new update as a survivor. The wins, were from playing as killer, but I am not a killer main, but I still won, because it was actually really easier playing as killer, then it was before.

a jogar ano passado. Até então não conhecia o jogo e quando comecei a ver alguns vídeos, fiquei com um pé atrás, mas resolvi dar uma chance. E vou ser sincero, é um jogo muuuuuito divertido, tanto para quem joga solo ou para quem joga com os amigos. \n\nTem muitos personagens, dos dois lados (sobreviventes e killers), o jogo é bem dinâmico e possuí aquele sistema de perks, onde você monta a sua build. Recentemente, o jogo passou por uma atualização onde teve mudanças DRÁSTICAS de gameplay e diversas modificações em perks, mudando o meta do jogo e deixando o jogo mais balanceado (ou tentando, né).  \n\nIsso é bom, porque todo jogo online e com anos de mercado, tem que se reinventar, até pra não ficar monótono. A comunidade ainda está se adaptando as novas mudanças (e pode ser que venham mais, de acordo com o feedback dos players). \n\nEnfim, recomendo. É um jogo viciante, principalmente se jogar com os amigos (mas solo vc se diverte muito também, vai por mim) e que tem muito potencial ainda, seja com a chegada de novos personagens, seja com as mudanças, etc. Acredito que seja o melhor do gênero. Ahhh, e sempre jogue com os dois lados, pra sua diversão ser ainda mais completa. \n\nSe possível, pegue numa promoção (o jogo direto fica com desconto, e as DLC's também). Aproveite e diverta-se!","timestamp_created":1658497861,"timestamp_updated":1658497861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119259902","author":{"steamid":"76561198415234532","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1658361492},"language":"russian","review":"ночью

it all started in late 2018 when a friend recommended the game for me saying its fun where you play as survivor or killer you either being chased or you're the one doing the chasing, I was like yea that sounds fun I'll get it ( That friend is no longer my friend jk xd), We started playing the game and indeed it was fun, But what was good was the ppls we met along the way some were just randoms we met during the trial and some become real friends, It was all good playing dbd and having fun whenever we have time to do it until the devs started making their own changes to the game regardless of the community critics and recommendations, They started messing around with everything from animations to the core of the game were it makes the game fun to play for both sides, But we endured just for the sake of having some fun with friends while playing this game until again they released the latest update when they screwed everything and I think for real this time. So to answer the question 'Do I recommend this game ?'

One minute you want to kill yourself and the next minute you are having the time of your life. If you want to play killer good luck because survivors nowadays just drop a pallet down and then run to the next one. For the first chase the survivor will drop 7 pallets before you get a hit off. For survivor unless you are inna survive with friends just dont play because its not fun at all. But at the end of the day you will probably come back to the game over and over again.
