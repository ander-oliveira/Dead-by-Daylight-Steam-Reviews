I would recommend it in a heartbeat back then as long as you weren't easy to tilt since the community gets kind of toxic.\n\nWell, not anymore. \n\nThe latest patch nerfed pretty much every survivor perk that was used to the ground and nowadays the game is an absolute stomp for any killer that didn't just start playing. Also, as if the survivor nerfs weren't bad enough, generators ALSO take longer to fix. There used to be wins, losses, middle ground games, nowadays it's always 4K wins for killers without survivors even powering up doors. Heck, with level 1 wraith I was able to 4K survivors before they got to their 4th generator. The game is incredibly frustrating for survivors as it is, and incredibly boring for killers.\n\nTo top it all, we have an amazing Attack on Titan collab ongoing, where the only free thing you get is this crappy charm, the rest is all paid skins. No new map, no new killer, survivor, free outfits, just nothing. You either open up your wallet for skins that look ridiculous (Eren with glasses LMAO) or be thankful you have this stupid charm. After Stranger Things collab I had high hopes for this but nah.\n\nDon't bother with this garbage until they revert back all the stuff they did.
