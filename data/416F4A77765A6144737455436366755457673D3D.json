Да, он ещё там немалую популярность снискал. Внешне игра привлекала, задумка была интересна, но реализация хромала, но тогда это была лишь бета [spoiler] хоть по опыту знаю, что часто бета с релизной версией не имеет внушительной разницы[/spoiler]. Но вот игра выходит в стиме и сразу со скидкой (К слову, до этого была скидка и на предзаказ), цена составляла 377,10 рублей, не больше, не меньше. О да, для нашего с нами, друзья, региона цена очень привликательна, когда на фоне все остальные новинки стоят 2 000, а на консолях вообще 4 000 рублей. \n               [h1] Time spending!\t[/h1]\nВот я приобретаю данный [strike] завод кирпичей [/strike] продукт развлечения, начинает идти загрузка. Мои руки уже \"чешутся\" от желания разделки ни туда попавших людишек [i]Да, да, больше всего было желание сыграть за убийцу\t[/i] [spoiler] И нет, у меня нет склонности к причинению боли живым существам\t[/spoiler].\n               [h1] Первый впечатления\t [/h1]\nЗапуск - фпс крайне низкий, захожу в настройки, вижу стоит ультра, убираю ультру на высокие, всё равно мои комфортные для игры 60 фпс не достигнуты, сбавляю до средних и вуаля, 60 фпс, можно играть [spoiler] GTX 770 4GB, i5 2500k разогнанный.\t[/spoiler]. Первые несколько игр мне подарили смешанные чувства, после двух часов я вышел из игры с одной мыслью - вернуть деньги за этот лагованный симулятор ожидания своих жертв. Приходилось ждать больше 30 минут, что очень плохо! Подумав, решил всё-таки не возвращать деньги (всё равно за эти копейки ничего не купишь), подождать, может патч будет, а может у игры входной порок высокий и лишь по больше поиграв я смогу вкусить и почувствовать этот не запретный плод.\n               [h1] Первый патч, он ожидаемый самый\t[/h1]\nЧерез день захожу в Steam, вижу обновление для Dead By Daylight на 300 метров, как свезло! [spoiler] не считая того, что у меня потом не было интернета из-за одной интересной истории, но сейчас не о ней\t[/spoiler]. Захожу в группу по этой игре, читаю список фиксов, он обширен. Ну и решаюсь я зайти ещё раз в игру ([i] Честно говоря, я бы и так зашёл, т.к. желание вернуться в неё всё-таки было\t[/i]), либо это из-за патча, либо ещё от чего, но в этот раз у меня складываются совершенно другие впечатления. Они меняются из смешанных, в положительные. Я получаю совершенно новые эмоции, которые давно уже не испытывал. Yes, эта игра даёт некоторые уникальные эмоции, этим она хороша. Поиграл за убийц, за выживших и геймплей за обе стороны интересен и отличается. Не заставляло зевать игра за убийцу, не заставляла засыпать игра и за выживших. Мало того, они ещё приносят совершенно разные чувства.\n[spoiler]           [h1] Контент (то самое, чего нет в SWBF)\t[/h1]\nСейчас игра имеет, как я помню, 3 или 4 карты, про них много и не скажешь, интересны, со своими особенностями.\nИмеется 3 вида убийц, один умеет ставит медвежьи капканы, второй становиться невидимым, третий, а вот у третьего есть бензопила! [strike] Прям как у того маньяка, который за Фирамиром бегал\t[/strike]. Выживших 4 штуки, две женщины и два мужчина (чёрный есть, не беспокойтесь). Больше рассказывать не хочу, лучше ознакомитесь сами.\t[/spoiler]\n               [h1] конец близок\t[/h1]\nИгра за 6 часов оставила исключительно положительные впечатления, могу вот что сказать за 6 часов впечатлений:\nИгра явно не на долго, не на 1000 часов уж точно, слишком мало контента для того, чтобы она не успела надоесть за это время, хотя, фанаты найдутся, которые смогут и 2к часов набегать. Но! Разработчики уже сказали, что добавят нового персонажа и убийцу, так что контент должен будет подъезжать.\nБаги есть, кривые моменты имеются, анимация не самая лучшая, игра не отполирована до блеска, но, будем надеяться, в будущем её отполируют ещё больше.\nИгра своих денег точно стоит. По эмоциям отбивает, впечатления \"впечатывает\".\nИгра раскрывается по времени всё лучше и лучше. Чем больше ты в неё играешь, тем больше она доставляет.\nМожно резать своих друзей, пригласив их в своё лобби. Опыт в своём лобби не идёт. В будущем разработчики обещали запилить Party-систему и [i] великий и могучий\t[/i], который, кстати, сейчас отсутствует.

It's accomplished exactly what the people who designed it wanted to accomplish. First couple of days it was hard to get a game going. I think it was a very different game style for a lot of people to get use to, much like a stealth game is in exactly the cuppa tea for everyone who just play shooters. I've been playing for a little while today as a killer and a survivor and it basically jumped from match to match to match with barely the time to look at my loadout and read through what the new perks I've earned give me.\nI think all the killers are basically the same as far as playability. I know there's a lot of talk about the wraith, he can go into stealth but it takes just as long to come out itself as it does to go into it so if you can get away from them it's your problem. Neither side is easy to play. You can have fun playing either side. Right now you can't party up with your friends I think that may be coming, but also bring group cheating and stuff like that to.\nThe only bug I've encountered was one time I could not pick a survivor up that I had knocked down next to a closet and after I mistakenly opened the closet instead of picking him up I was unable to pick him up and even as he crawled out the exit I still couldn't pick him up.\nI would like to see voice chat in the lobby for the survivors to kind of strategize a little bit. I would also like to see proximity voice/text chat within the game as well. So other than some friend play capability and voice proximity chat I really don't see anything I change with this came at all.\nThose that don't like it will probably never like it but it's certainly worth the ticket, and it's a hell of a lot of fun.\n","timestamp_created":1466279642,"timestamp_updated":1466279642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523434698581695557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23638330","author":{"steamid":"76561198049303357","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1469133577},"language":"german","review":"Top, macht jede menge fun !! \nleider bisher nicht mit freunden gespielt, dass würde sicherlich alles nochmal Toppen :) \n","timestamp_created":1466279169,"timestamp_updated":1466279169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23638235","author":{"steamid":"76561198212238804","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1344,"last_played":1482684092},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist so geil","timestamp_created":1466278836,"timestamp_updated":1466278836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23638146","author":{"steamid":"76561198004697017","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1639171431},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight - это когда ты обсираешься от стука сердца","timestamp_created":1466278498,"timestamp_updated":1466278498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23638084","author":{"steamid":"76561198026319210","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2238,"last_played":1527222216},"language":"english","review":"6.5/10 needs major improvement.\n\nAll in all the game is still fun to play but it needs major balancing for issues on both sides.

[/b]\n\nLet me preface this by saying that the concept of the game is original and the gameplay is very fun and atmospheric, and this review will be changed to positive after the developers fix the numerous bugs and balancing issues that currently exist. However there are a few things in the actual game that also feel inadequate.\n\nBugs:\n----------------------------\n-Graphics bugs everywhere. Weird clipping and graphic anomalies are abundant.\n-The trap door (a secondary wincon) will sometimes bug.\n-There are several bugs that involve the player characters getting stuck in some way, these range from minor and temporary annoyances to literally gamebreaking, forcing somebody to disconnect to fix.\n-Bugs associated with intended balance, such as certain items or perks not functioning correctly in all  relevant situations.\n\nBalance:\n----------------------------\n-Wraith is glaringly superior to the 2 other killers, as the Wailing Bell has a neglible downside for it's benefit.\n(it makes his terror radius 0, essentially breaking the game, the 1 second immobility is child's play)\n-The sound signaling the skill checks is essentially a non-factor on some speakers as it is drowned by the other vital sounds of the game, such as the generator or terror radius.\n-Infinite survivor vault loop is in no way discouraged and if not meriting a win, gives several thousand points with no downside.\n-Likewise killer hook camping is not discouraged, and is the premier strategy netting no less than 1 sacrifice in the majority of situations often due to the next issue.\n-Literally 0 matchmaking. Level 30's with 4 ultra rare perks are facing off against killers on their first game, and vice versa. Some matches are complete shitshows as a result, (to the point where survivors do generators after the doors open because the killer is so bad).\n-Disconnects are not addressed on a balancing level at all. If a survivor is inclined upon being grabbed/hooked due to their lack of skill or some anomaly, to alt+f4 there are no consequences and the killer receives no points. It is scummy to the killer and gamebreaking for the remaining survivors.\n-Linking consumables to the Bloodweb, (in-game character progression), feels wrong and oftentimes leads to consumables being horded. I propose making offerings and add-ons more unique or powerful, or implementing a charge system. Even an offering/add-on shop, leaving the Bloodweb to only perks would feel better.\n-Several systems in the game go downright unexplained(i.e. The chance to free yourself from the hook, and the downsides for attempting) and some item descriptions are also vague or mum on actual functionality, (i.e. the toolboxes sabotage mechanic)\n-The way points are gained in certain categories versus the amount given feels off. (i.e. objectives are less worthwhile than playing around with the killer)\n\nNon bug/Non balance issues:\n----------------------------------\n-The game is obviously unfinished, and not released as early access. It feels rushed and this really reflects poorly on developers.\n-10% discount is not by any means substantial for the aforementioned problems.\n-First patch didn't address the most game-breaking bugs.\n-No communications from the developers on the current state of the game and what they're doing/progress they're making.\n-No dedicated servers also has the potential to be gamebreaking. Since the killer hosts every match and is not guarenteed to have relative ping to the survivors, some matches are unplayable.\n-The crude anti-cheat plugin doesn't work. Hackers are abundant enough to be an issue.\n-The often-addressed 'no way to play with friends' issue causes matchmaking to take forever as people fervently try to scum the current system. I agree that 2-4 coordinated survivors against a rando killer is out of the question in a ranked game. \n-The private/public lobby system is obviously a developer afterthought. Clicking join lobby doesn't put you in a queue, it simply polls every lobby and attempts to shove you somewhere under some conditions. It's archaic. No room list means that unranked games require 4 friends instead of an amalgum of friends and randos. This oftentimes leads to even longer matchmaking wait times as you're bombarded with 'failed to join lobby' or sent back to the home screen with no message at all.\n-Character specific daily quests contradict the current character development system. As you spend all of your Bloodpoints (currency) on a single character to become more competitive as a player, and your daily quests are loaded with quests specifically for a different character. This problem is only really exacerbated by the fact that characters are unique and specialized from one another. Killer-specific quests are in the same boat.\n-The skill check system seems unfair to an extent. The number of people I play with who can consistently succeed them are few. I understand it's implementation and how it corresponds to player fear, but it makes the survivor role feel less tactics driven and more like a carnival game.\n\nEnd notes:\n-------------------------\nThe concept of the game is phenomenal, and the supporting lore is interesting and unique. The IP has a lot of potential that is being squandered by amateur-hour developers that make the game seem like a cashgrab. The lack of a cash shop is refreshing, but the framework is there to put one in, and it wouldn't surprise to see it added. I hope the game will shine, as it has every opportunity to, and I would implore you to buy it, yet the asking price is downright wrong for the number of problems. There will be disagreements with my balance issues and propositions, but I merely look out for the best way to make the game fun for the most people. Because right now a lot of instances make the gameplay feel cheap. No developer should want that for their product and their silence on the matter is unsettling. Needless to say I will continue to play the game and watch it's development, changing this review if the time comes where the game's problems feel reduced enough to warrant it's asking price.","timestamp_created":1466276946,"timestamp_updated":1466277938,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":104,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631081163883209229","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23637675","author":{"steamid":"76561198115941096","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1100,"last_played":1498727351},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing survival game.

Já vi reaparecer 15 segundos depois do sobrevivente ser sacrificado. Tinha uma habilidade que fazia eles voltarem depois de 2 minutos, mas advinha, agora volta sempre, NUNCA vai dar para sair do ombro do assassino, só se alguém te salvar.\n- Em contra partida, paletas nunca voltam, tiraram as \"Jungle Gyms\" e tiraram árvores estratégicas alegando ser um bug de \"fat shamming\" nos assassinos.\n- Tiraram a visão do mapa inteiro, e informação nesse jogo é essencial, e colocaram umas habilidades de aumentar o campo de visão só para os Assassinos.\n- Colocaram penalidade por queda para sobrevivente, mas não para assassinos.\n- Pular janela não pode, pulou 3 vezes, corre, já era, ela fecha.\n\nResumo - Ganchos sempre voltam, pallets não, penalidade por queda, por pular janela, assassino que era uma porcaria (Freddy) teleportando, colocando slow à rodo, invisível, som 2D pra não ter como saber onde ele tá.

Graças à Deus tiraram o da Stranger Things, que era um dos se não o pior mapa do jogo. Infelizmente, ainda sobraram muitos mapas licenciados, como o do Silent Hill, o do JigSaw e até mesmo o do Myers, todos mapas horríveis de se jogar.","timestamp_created":1466263162,"timestamp_updated":1639771607,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23634035","author":{"steamid":"76561198280651442","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":14144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1656096266},"language":"schinese","review":"先不说游戏性，为毛一加入大厅立刻就弹回菜单，或者就是加入失败，差不多两小时我有几乎六成时间是卡在菜单和主界面，痛苦无限循环T T","timestamp_created":1466263104,"timestamp_updated":1466263104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23634033","author":{"steamid":"76561198079177599","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":1499987879},"language":"brazilian","review":"plis guys remove the ghost killer because is too much op","timestamp_created":1466263103,"timestamp_updated":1466263103,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23633993","author":{"steamid":"76561198003919647","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1631355064},"language":"french","review":"Bonjour à tous.\nSincèrement une très très bonne idée, le fait d'incarner soit un survivant qui essaye de s'enfuir, soit le tueur qui poursuit jusquà tous les tuer.\nOn se croirait vraiment dans une des séries à la scream, scary movie, souviens toi, massacre et j'en passe.\nAprès évidemment, il y a des bugs, ton personnage qui revient en arrière quand tu te fais courser, ou même que le tueur camp le survivant devant le piquet, donc oui c'est pas parfait.\nMais cela dit, c'est vraiment une première dans le monde des jeux, et à part le manque de contenus, skins, mode de jeu, entre amis, d'autres personnes et d'autres map, oui à part tout ça.\nCela reste un jeu vraiment sympa et prenant.\nEspérons que le contenu sera rajouté rapidemment et régulièrement.\nPour finir, je le conseille à tous ceux qui aiment ces petites séries où on aime bien s'imaginer à la place du survivant, savoir qu'est ce que nous, on aurait fait pour s'échapper du tueur et pas mourir comme la pauvre blonde...
