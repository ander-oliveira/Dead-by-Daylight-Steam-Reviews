I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.","timestamp_created":1655817354,"timestamp_updated":1655817354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117353210","author":{"steamid":"76561199071950107","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2091,"last_played":1657394594},"language":"swedish","review":"I

За сурвов работает фраза \"easy to learn, hard to master\", когда как за манов все наоборот. С самого начала сложно очень, а уже чуть позже легче, потом опять тяжело и опять легко и так по кругу. \nИгрой за маньяков я занялся почти сразу, ибо компания, которой покупали дбд быстро развалилась и я остался один. Я преисполнился, пока учился играть на манах. Столько убитых нервов из за токсичности в игре у меня еще не было, но и преисполнился в этом плане и заимел несколько принципов на этот счет. Каких то особенностей рассказать не могу, потому что ощущения непередаваемые, когда все таки делаешь в поте -4 и идешь некст на позитиве сделанного -4. \nИгра же за выживших по большей части не напряжная и фановая, как мне показалось. Я почти не играл соло на выживших, ведь для соло тут есть отдельный режим игры. Играть за них я почти не учился, а просто на опыте за манов пытался что то делать и получалось. Для игры на сурвах, когда стало ее не хватать, я знакомился с новыми людьми, с которыми до сих пор очень хорошо общаюсь. Соло играть за сурвов я перестал хотеть, зная какие могут попасться руины или, еще хуже, токсики, а может и новички, с которыми играть не появлялось желание.\nОттолкнуть меня могли следующие вещи, если бы я знал заранее, это концепция (наверное, хз), система прокачки, токсичность игроков и куча длс, без которых геймплей будет далеко не таким интересным, по крайней мере при игре на маньяках (насчет багов спорно, ибо из за которых пропадало желание играть я не помню, но многих может смутить что-либо, на что не наткнулся или чему не предал внимания). Прокачка сделана наигениальнейше и более рандомную, затянутую и долгую прокачку не могу вспомнить нигде. Но этим затянула, зараза, и уже 1000 часов я провел за прокачкой сурвов и манов. Длс все купил еще давно и продолжаю покупать новые. Можно, конечно, и без них, но надо воздерживаться от покупки скинов (второстепенное) и очень очень долго играть. Насколько я помню часам к 50 я смог накопить на ОДНОГО персонажа. Зато это было нечто, когда я все таки его купил. Я покупал на радужные осколки только Духа, Они и Микаэлу, а остальных не ждал, пока накоплю, а покупал длс. Про токсичность я упоминал в рассказе о манах. \nВывод: игра может многим оттолкнуть, но тем кто все преодолеет и преисполнится геймплей на тысячи часов обеспечен. По моему сегодняшнему мнению и мысля позитивно могу сказать, что игра 11/10","timestamp_created":1655807397,"timestamp_updated":1655807397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117347229","author":{"steamid":"76561199039110457","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":78138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1178,"playtime_at_review":71967,"last_played":1660389330},"language":"english","review":"This Game is not for everyone, depending on many factors you may stomp or get stomped for 10 minutes.

Channeling the slasher movie spirit, each match feels like a mini horror movie on both sides. Whether you’re the efficient and unpredictable killer, or one of the strategically elusive survivors, the thrill of the chase and the ever-present threat that even the best-laid plans can go awry keep Dead by Daylight feeling timely, even after five years of thrill kills.\n\nIn Dead By Daylight, what you get depends on whom you play with. This is one of the game's most enchanting aspects. Despite my praise for the game's tremendous competitive dynamics, it can also be enjoyed by a group of idiot friends—people who might be playing for the first time—just looking to escape Leatherface for a few hours. The intrigue of Dead By Daylight's game-theory intrigue quickly fades into the background, leaving only the hushed conversations between you and your brother to matter. \n\nA lot of games possess both sides of that dichotomy, but I cannot think of many others. There is simply no way to bring a newcomer into a game like Dota 2 without having them view an hour-long tutorial video. League and Overwatch are far too steeped in stately precision to ever be charitable to bad play. In contrast, Dead By Daylight excels at both, combining gory slasher flick pleasures with a highly competitive gaming experience. In addition to being a Halloween pastiche, it is a psychodrama based on Hereditary. That, my friends, is a blockbuster. \n\nI recommend it 100% beware of the tunnelers and campers as well as the flashlight clickers.","timestamp_created":1655787011,"timestamp_updated":1655787011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117337515","author":{"steamid":"76561199085442657","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":85390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4873,"playtime_at_review":65603,"last_played":1660575245},"language":"english","review":"I can mainly recommend this game if you plan on playing with other people.
