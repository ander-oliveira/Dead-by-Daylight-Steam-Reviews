Вырваться почти нереально. Хотите нормально поиграть? Х*Й, попадется сраный Легион который через 1 минуту после начала игры уже расхитовывает ВСЕХ, носится по карте как сраная ракета, под абилкой перескакивает опрокинутые палеты и окна быстрее чем сурв. Сраный Фредди который телепортируется к генам которые вы чините, и хер вы сука убежите, особенно когда вы во сне (Чтобы снять сон нужно или искать 1 ЕДИНСТВЕННЫЙ будильник на всю карту, или повисеть на крюке, или нарочно промахнутся на проверке реакции с аптечкой). Бл*дские лужи которые замедляют и так медленных сурвов. Дофига читеров (Easy Anti-Cheat - считайте что анти-чита нету). Майерс который себе стакает третью стадию (Которую можно сделать бесконечной) и просто раздает мементо (Игра длится минуты 3, весело? НЕТ). Если хотите полный разбор почему игра - дерьмо, посмотрите видос с канала BesPolezny о ДБД и почему это помойка. Баланс просто сломан нахрен, сбежать вчетвером реально если вы убер задрот с 10к часами и с сыграным пати с таким же количеством часов. Поиграв за Маньяка несколько раз, БЕЗ ПЕРКОВ ВООБЩЕ, я просто обосс*л лица сурвам, даже не напрягся, нету абсолютно никакой сложности при игре за мана. Палеты? Пффф похер, \"Ярость духа\" и \"Жажда Крови\" вам в помощь. Тактика Ген-раша тупо не работает потому что сука зарядов на инструментах хватает едва-ли на 1\\5 гена, даже с новой деталью. Ослепить фонариком можно если у Мана сенса на мышке 0.40 или около того, слепить можно пока ман в стане, только какой в этом смысл? Ослепление не мешает на звук определить куда побежал сурв, в то же время ман вообще никаких звуков не издает, ты не можешь физически понять, откуда он идёт, только примерное расстояние и то бл*дь не факт (Так как некоторые маны могут уходить в инвиз и террор просто пропадает, иди гадай где он). Абсолютно конченные хит-боксы, бывали случаи когда я падая с 3 Этажа (На свалке) приземлялся пробегал два метра, и ман доставал меня замахом оттуда, откуда я выпрыгнул, такая же срань с топорами Аннушки, можно вообще в воздух топор кинуть, попадание гарантировано. Перки с чтением ауры сурвов - п*дорство чистой воды, какой смысл прятаться если ман тебя видит через стены и прочую срань? Итого: спрятаться нельзя, убежать почти невозможно (особенно если ман упоротый и бежит за тобой даже если ему подсрачники дают еще три сурва сзади), навыки дающие временное ускрорение уходят в кд на 180-90 секунд, и то особого отрыва не случается, ман тебя может пробить с*ка с километра через окно или палету, причем через палету можно получить хит, даже если ты её уже скинул и оглушил мана. Хотите веселого геймплея? Сыграйте с друзьями в настолку, потому что эта игра заставляет твою жопу полыхать как крейсер \"Москва\".","timestamp_created":1655931683,"timestamp_updated":1655931683,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117427270","author":{"steamid":"76561199179702468","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":208,"playtime_at_review":6007,"last_played":1660167635},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1655931461,"timestamp_updated":1655931461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117427228","author":{"steamid":"76561198076718332","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":344,"playtime_at_review":53923,"last_played":1660508638},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego para pasar el rato","timestamp_created":1655931399,"timestamp_updated":1655931399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117426529","author":{"steamid":"76561199003483800","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":828,"last_played":1655986760},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1655930425,"timestamp_updated":1655930425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117426381","author":{"steamid":"76561198133992087","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1806,"last_played":1656873922},"language":"english","review":"you can only play this game at night or you die. great game. made the mistake to play at noon a few times. died by daylight. 15/10 would recommend. fun game. kill your friends.","timestamp_created":1655930227,"timestamp_updated":1655930227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117425613","author":{"steamid":"76561198431853382","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5900,"playtime_at_review":644,"last_played":1660601233},"language":"english","review":"nuts - beerserk","timestamp_created":1655929133,"timestamp_updated":1655929133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117425605","author":{"steamid":"76561198091889434","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1655999748},"language":"english","review":"One of the best horror game and If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2. 1/2 cup white sugar\n3. 1/2 cup brown sugar\n4. 1/4 cup water\n5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n6. 1 pinch salt\n7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced\n8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie\n\nDirections:\n\n1.

I like the gameplay, community (for the most part) and the reporting system. Luckily it gets updated constantly. Unfortunately it crashes a lot. With crashes becoming more prominent after updates. So it's biggest strength, - frequent updates - is also it's biggest weakness due to some instability following certain updates.\n\nOnce every four games or sometimes on back to back consecutive games it will suddenly freeze, or just close and there is no way to reconnect. Nor does the game differentiate from a crash and you quitting. So if you are playing and it crashes even if you re-launch it right away there is no mechanism for letting you rejoin and also you aren't allowed to matchmake because the game interprets the crash as you quitting and now you have a leaver penalty. \n\nEven with a really great rig frequent disconnects and crashes seem to plague this game before getting patched out and then coming back with the next update. It's insanely frustrating to have a great round ruined by the game crashing and then being punished a second time by finding out everything you took into the round was deleted. Then punished a third time as you stare at a counter telling you matchmaking is locked behind a 10+ minute timer because the game thinks you quit during a match.

After a viscous shootout with the police, I returned to my house and set the card on my desk. I decided to take a shower to wash the gunpowder and blood off. After I’d bathed and listened to 30minutes of solid white noise to calm the voices in my head, I returned to my room to find the card missing. In the corner, my 8 year old brother was redeeming the card for himself before I could stop him he punched the last digit in and was awarded 800 robux to his account. In a fit of primal rage, I leapt the 25 feet between us and pounced on him, tearing him to shreds. His screams only fueled my rage. How dare he be surprised by my attack. I proceeded to rip the door off my truck and without turning the key and through pure willpower forced the vehicle to spontaneously appear in front of the main Roblox office. My molecules, refusing to coexist with any known law of physics, phased through the door. Again, through pure willpower, I molecularly reconstructed the front desk lady into a pile of Duracell rechargeable AA batteries. The people getting into the elevator saw this and started pressing the close door button. I telekinetically forced the doors back open and got inside while they screamed and begged. Their screams annoyed me so I growled at a frequency that irradiated their ions to the point of deconstruction. Once to the top floor I kicked the door to the CEO’s office open and sat down across from him. I summoned a photo of his children at gun point and demanded that he deposit 800 robux into my account. He did so earnestly. As I got up, he roared “all of this for $10!?” I smirked and said “the mitochondria is the power house of the cell” and leaped out his window from 87 stories up, stretching my skin into a wing suit, flying the 1,300 miles back to my home. I settled into my chair and surely enough, there were 800 robux in my account. I bought a pair of cosmetic wings and a cool hat.","timestamp_created":1655912635,"timestamp_updated":1660308638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117413452","author":{"steamid":"76561199079919844","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":453,"last_played":1660233865},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1655912490,"timestamp_updated":1655912490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117412910","author":{"steamid":"76561199261139385","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2577,"last_played":1658646227},"language":"tchinese","review":"網路沒問題還顯示斷線，回頭血點全無，還消耗道具","timestamp_created":1655911704,"timestamp_updated":1655911704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117412771","author":{"steamid":"76561199194243287","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1964,"last_played":1655998766},"language":"koreana","review":"처음하는 사람들은 플레이하는 동안 '공포 영화의 긴장되는 장면'을 보는 기분이 들거라는 생각이 듦. 생존자는 3인칭이고 살인마는 1인칭인데.. 개인적인 취향이지만; 게임을 순수하게 즐기고 싶다면 생존자를 먼저하는게 재밌을 것이라고 생각함. 생존자 퍽(스킬비슷한것)중에는 자힐이 거의 필수라서 클로뎃 키우는게 효율적일것입니다. 캐릭터마다 전승할수 있는 스킬은 다른걸로 알고있음. 케어하는 걸 좋아한다면 빌할아버지의 시계를. 빠른 속도감이 좋다면 메그의 스프린트가 유용할것. \n\n술레(살인마)_에게서 도망치면서 발전기를 수리하거나,  역으로 그들의 발전기 수리를 방해하는 등 탈출 전의 그들(생존자)을 잡는 형식의 게임인데 퍽이나 맵이 그리 많지는 않아서 빠르게 고이는 건 비추.

Que dire ?\n\nUn jeu qui aurait pu être intéressant et qui l'a été à une certaine époque mais qui devient de plus en plus injouable. Plus il y a de mises à jour, plus les problèmes se multiplient.\n\nPremièrement, le nouveau système de matchmaking qui vous fera tomber que ce soit en tout jeune survivant ou tueur avec des joueurs très expérimentés et avec toutes les améliorations. Certaines parties sont telles que l'on peut voir un survivant promener (et je n'exagère pas mes propos) le tueur comme un vulgaire clébard ... Aucun challenge, aucun amusement. Vous avez également des parties où le tueur clôturera la game en 2 minutes montre en main. Encore une fois, aucun fun.\n\nDeuxièmement, les mises à jour qui font apparaître des survivants et des tueurs de plus en plus pétés les uns que les autres. Un jeu devrait être fun dans n'importe quelle condition. Personnellement, j'avais arrêté le jeu il y a un moment, je m'y suis remise pour l'event. Après une heure, le constat est là, je ne me suis pas amusée, le nouveau tueur est plus qu'OP. Et ce n'est pas la peine de me dire, c'est parce que tu n'es pas une PGM. Vous oubliez que bon nombre des joueurs/joueuses sont des personnes normales sans super réflexes et dépourvus d'un septième sens. La pire mise à jour pour moi a été celle où le brouillard et l'obscurité des maps ont été enlevées. Impossible de se cacher... Un comble dans un jeu basé sur la discrétion.\n\nTroisièmement, la communauté, comme bon nombre de ses homologues, Dbd (Dead by Daylight), n'échappe au groupement de serveurs avec la communauté russophone. Les joueurs sont toxiques, cancers, passent leur temps à insulter dans le chat de fin de game et font n'importe quoi en jeu. La plupart du temps, côté survivant, vous serez seule face au tueur. Nombre de partie, j'ai pu voir les survivants accrochés avec le dernier d'entre eux en train de faire son générateur alors qu'il en reste trois sur cinq.\n\nQuatrièmement, le jeu dispose d'un système de challenge, c'est bien et ça permet de gagner des points d'expérience, oui mais ... Combien de fois je n'ai pas vu des coéquipiers ne pas jouer au jeu mais juste faire leur challenge quitte à laisser tout le monde mourir.\n\nAlors oui, le jeu est correct graphiquement, la maniabilité est bien, le son aussi mais il n'est plus que l'ombre de ce qu'il a été. Toute son essence a disparue et pour cette raison je ne peux que vous suggérer de passer votre chemin.","timestamp_created":1655903631,"timestamp_updated":1655903631,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630597233772277832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117407300","author":{"steamid":"76561199322885211","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1659253766},"language":"german","review":"Its like a reward.","timestamp_created":1655903353,"timestamp_updated":1655903353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117407172","author":{"steamid":"76561198035495353","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":17596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":16146,"last_played":1660141939},"language":"english","review":"Boring for Killer players, as the game caters 100% to survivor side.","timestamp_created":1655903112,"timestamp_updated":1655903112,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117406856","author":{"steamid":"76561199091654919","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":61766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55391,"last_played":1658072766},"language":"koreana","review":"야이 시ㅡ발 게임 개발자 새끼들아 너스 블라이트 스피릿 너프시켜라\n데하 너프 아윌 너프 고양이 너프 이러면 너스 블라이트 스피릿 어떻게 상대하냐 개씨ㅡ발새끼들아\n뚜벅이 버프시키고 너스 블라이트 스피릿 너프 시키면 되잖아 이 씨ㅡ발새끼들아","timestamp_created":1655902615,"timestamp_updated":1658072511,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117406773","author":{"steamid":"76561198047497209","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1832,"playtime_at_review":13192,"last_played":1660594710},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Игра супер интересная если Ман не играет на килы и не кемпит тебя в тупую ,рекомендую играть тимой из-за того что часто против вас будут попадаться сильные игроки за манов ну и иногда ваши тимейты могут просто прятаться в шкафах всю катку, читеров лично за 200 часов видел раз 5 и то в основном за сурвов , рекомендую попробовать понравится всем любителям пощекотать нервы особенно когда против вас будет ведьма или Майкл Маерс","timestamp_created":1655902482,"timestamp_updated":1655902482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117406755","author":{"steamid":"76561199145378943","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":136,"playtime_at_review":1599,"last_played":1659803222},"language":"koreana","review":"돈 돌려주세요","timestamp_created":1655902457,"timestamp_updated":1655902457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117406539","author":{"steamid":"76561198255741985","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1847,"last_played":1659031854},"language":"turkish","review":"2016'nın sonuna doğru abimin hesaba aldıydım.
