Before introducing even more broken or underperforming Killers, actually take the time to fix the numerous Killers we do have. BHVR only ever fixes a problem after months (and sometimes years) of bitching from the community - and almost all of the times it takes an even bigger outcry if it's from the dwindling pool of Killer players. It only took basically an eternity to nerf SWFs and rework Haddonfield (which is pretty okay now).\n\nI know it's hard to balance a game like this, but like I said above, fix your fucking Killers. Killers like Spirit overperform and causes the Survivor community to retch, and Licensed Killers like Ghost Face and Myers are so poorly made it feels like a slap in the face to not only the players, but the company/creator the IP comes from.\n\nAnd I'm not going to start on MMR. Rank 1 Survs with 300 hours going against a newbie Killer with barely 4 hours? Happens more often than you think. And it plays out exactly how you think it would, too! (This game is like Hockey. So if you don't know it, then this won't make sense either. haha... right guys? ;)))))))\n\nNot to mention the horrible community (on both Killer and Survivor side) perpetuating BM'ing. That's not entirely BHVR's fault much more so on the people who choose to log on and go \"Oh boy! I'll bully a baby Killer today!\" or \"Oh boy! I'll bully solo/baby SWF's today!\" and making an exact build for that purpose. Both sides do it. Let's not act like either is a saint in that regard.\n\nOn another note related to BHVR, spaghetti code! You'll hear this term often! And in most cases, it's true! This game breaks frequently. If not a completely unbalanced Surv perk that will ensure agitation in Killers, it's a Killer power that works too well under the wrong circumstance/intent that it screws over entire Surv teams. I do think Kill Switches are a good idea, but it's such a common thing after almost every major update that something will get Kill Switch'd for a week because they didn't notice an intern clipped a blade of grass an inch off the ground that has an active hitbox and unintentionally creates a deadzone (hyperbole, of course. but I'm still shocked it hasnt happened yet.)\n\nIt's frustrating. The current 'meta' of the game is frustrating and the Lead's on this projects constant blithering about and dropping nonsense from their mouths are frustrating. If you listened to a dev talk, it's like we're not playing the same game and they refuse time and time again to even listen to the players that play this game religiously. And when one of their \"beloved\" content creators make a fuss or a splash, they try to silence those arguments. It's best just to play this game ignorantly and rolling with the punches than passionately attempt to be vocal about change, but here I am anyways.\n\nI don't want to end this on a negative note for a \"Yes\" review, so here's some positive things I had with this game:\n\n- The fact we get to play as Licensed Horror Movie Killers at all is fantastic and it's a joy to see them in-game.\n- Pretty good expanding lore/story. Using the Tome and Battle Pass systems to enhance previous lore (even from licensed Killers) and introducing new elements through something completely optional and not in-your-face, yet still always there to read when you want is awesome and I love it.\n- Okay-ish events. BP gains is nice and you can unlock all Original Killers and Survs through in-game Level Progression Currency. (however, you will have to pay real money for the licensed Killers).\n- Some are silly and some are stylish. I like cosmetics. I love seeing a masked Neon/Glow-In-The-Dark Lite Brite sprinting at me in the darkness. Makes me chuckle every time.\n- Killers and Survs all have very clear origins. I enjoy a bit of diversity and I love playing as my mans, Adam.\n- Being a good sport against Scratched Mirror Myers always results in both parties having a laugh.\n\n[ Anyways. Thanks for reading. See you all in the Fog, my friends, ]","timestamp_created":1649442691,"timestamp_updated":1649442691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113536564","author":{"steamid":"76561199152865614","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":91419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":553,"playtime_at_review":90527,"last_played":1660323720},"language":"english","review":"The game itself is fine. It's the community, matchmaking system and amount of people using cheats to win. It stops being fun. If you're a survivor, it's hard to play with anything other than the meta builds and friends because you get killers constantly camping hooks and tunneling people out. If you're a killer, you get nothing but survivor teams (bully squads) with meta builds being incredibly toxic during and after the match. The matchmaking is a joke. High ranked killers get paired with lower ranked survivors and vice versa. Let's not even mention the amount of times I see killers and survivors both using cheats, like lag switching. \n\nBefore the current MMR, you could play and not see as many campers/tunnelers, but these days it's almost a given. \n\nWould I recommend this game? As it stands, no. Maybe in the future if things change. I guess we'll see.\n\n*EDITED TO ADD*\n\nGood job Behaviour, you managed to make the game EVEN WORSE. No wonder so many are quitting now.

I both love it, and hate it. I remember tons of fun matches with friends where we would just loop the killers for the whole game and gen rushed the hell out of them. I also remember matches where the killer would give us a real run for our money, and it would be a huge struggle, but escaping would feel incredibly rewarding. These are the absolute best matches you can get in DBD, but that's not why I'm giving it a negative review. The state of this game is just... so stale. More than half your games as survivor are you just getting totally merc'd by a killer running a really sweaty meta build, or being super toxic and camping. On top of that, doing the same repetitive objective only becomes more frustrating when nearly everyone plays with sweaty perks. Same goes for if you play killer too only all of the survivors are able to lead you into areas where they can loop you for the entire match while everyone else does generators. Am I bad at the game? Yes, even after 160 hours of playing. But what frustrates me the most is the current matchmaking system. While I don't think the previous skill based matchmaking system for the game was the best, I think what they changed it to is FAR worse. Almost EVERY match now puts you against a pool of the highest ranking players in the game. And while many people argue with me that \"Rank doesn't reflect skill,\" what it does reflect is experience, and dedication. In what world is it fair to pit causal players against the people who have been playing the game for months or years? It's incredibly defeating, and at the end of every match it just makes me feel as though I had little chance to begin with. This game is N O T casual friendly, and even after getting deep into the game and learning so much about it, I still feel like I barely gained any experience in the process. And without more fun incentives to play the game, at this point I feel like this game is on it's way out.  6/10 It can be fun, but only half the time.","timestamp_created":1649398039,"timestamp_updated":1649398039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113509893","author":{"steamid":"76561199039488622","num_games_owned":288,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3199,"last_played":1651001799},"language":"english","review":"I'd have to say this game is pretty fun to play with friends, but it can be pretty frustrating especially if you're playing as the killer.

New perks deffo made the game quite a ways different. I personally can't play the game for two reasons. The sensitivity is insane. I have mine at 5 and an inch of mouse movement is 3 rotations at least. The other reason is the competitive nature. The \"Killer\" is supposed to chase people down and hook them. 3 hooks and they die. However if you get into a game with a good survivor team. You'll find yourself getting one or two hooks and the game is over. Or, you get an okay team, and maybe you get one kill. But one kill doesn't feel like you did your job at all. The last option is getting a terrible team and you stomp them into the ground, which also isn't fun for me. It's not expensive, so it's worth picking up, but you may have some issues with the gameplay loop feeling awkward.","timestamp_created":1649369454,"timestamp_updated":1649369454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113496534","author":{"steamid":"76561198073277017","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":12253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3738,"playtime_at_review":1823,"last_played":1660602157},"language":"brazilian","review":"-
