support team is braindead. Devs have included a feature in a game where you cant see players' steam profiles. Thus, the only information you have is their name, thats it. Also you cant spot them in previously played with, because apparently steam does not keep track of dbd players (Obviously the devs have messed with it). Having that in mind, I encountered a group of survivors whom steam profiles I could not access to. They were cheaters, like speedhack, they have disabled my killer's ability and also I could not pick them up when they went down. The moment I saw suspicious gameplay I turned on NVIDIA's recording. Btw almost for 10 mins I was getting infinite loop by survivors on the killer shack. They had also disabled bloodlust, so I could never catch them. Anyway, having the video and also reporting them using the in-game chat, it was time to find where to send the video. After 1 hour of looking where to send the additional information and fill the form, I get a message from a guy in support saying: \"we need the steam id to link to the player\". I asked him very kindly, how is that possible when you yourselves have included this feature that hides steam profile. I even asked him, cant you just link my report in-game with their id, because I also showed in the video I reported them and they could see their names and they had my own steam ID. I mean that f* report must send some info, right? Apparently, they need ME to send their steam id of players whom I met in a game which HAS THE FEATURE TO HIDE THE STEAM PROFILE. At this point I am wondering, how is this game is not filled with cheaters.\n\nConsidering that I wasted 1 hour of my life (not including the game with the cheaters, who dragged the game as long as possible), I provided any information I could and the support guy responded to me like this, I am saying f@ck you to this game. I mean that answer is equal to trolling, I cant describe it as something else. Apparently the in-game report system is total garbage and having not a proper report system and being themselves so morons (excuse me) and incompetent I cant recommend this game.\n\nI did not even mention the other issues that it has in terms of game design, but this is not the point. It was not a perfect game but still was a game you could enjoy. But not after this, when devs clearly dont give a damn, I wont be a fool playing a game where they have a report system doing shit and support team that answers to me worse than a troll.

Сейчас же и за ту и за другую сторону находится игра за минуту две, кроме вечера, вечером онлайн падает и игра ищется долговато. \n-Убийцы стали играть намного лучше, чем раньше, играть стало намного интереснее.\n-Выжившие так же не теряют хватки, бывают конечно козлы, которые дисконектятся с самого начала игры, но и в троем бывало мы могли затащить и свалить.\n-Коллекция убийц и выживших пополнилась, и это радует, больше выбора, дает больше вариотивности. \n-Баги есть,но они бывают лишь от проблемы движка, а те которые могли бы произойти из криворукости разрабов не видел не разу. Большинство тех кто говорит, что разрабы не следят за игрой, просто не знают разницы между проблем кода, слияния текстур, и работы движка.\nВ эту игру можно не донатить, всех персонажей можно купить за валюту которую дают за уровни, да и стоят они не дорого 133 рубля за персонажа, пф проживу без одной пачки сигарет.\nЯ редко играю в одного, и за убийцу так же редко.\nИграть в нее намного интереснее с такими же комрадами как и вы. Так что если решите ее взять, подарите и друганам, будет намного веселее.\nОценка от меня для этой игры: 9 из 10.\nНе добавил лишь балл из-за того, что врядли я буду в нее играть вечно.

BHVR (the developers) prioritise making money over making the game playable, forcing out chapter after chapter with very little but expensive content that comes with a massive amount of bugs that they leave months to fix. It genuinely takes them almost half a year each time to produce actual meaningful balance changes and even then they either don't really work or it's only for a handful of things in the game. \n\nEven more so, the way they balance this game is by having things that are extremely powerful in one situation but useless in the next, which just ends up in having unfair match ups where you can't do anything at all and then your opponent can't do anything at all against you. It leaves winning feeling incredibly unsatisfying, as half the time you only win because the game is poorly designed. And when you lose, it feels worse than normal, as most of the time you only lose because the game is poorly designed (again). This kind of thing is told incredibly frequently to BHVR through their twitter posts and through instagram and countless other communities, but they ignore it and push it back so they can milk more money from their playerbase and continue to produce flawed and buggy content. \n\nEven if the gameplay itself wasn't very inconsistent and unfun, the coding team at BHVR seems to have no idea what they're doing. Each chapter releases with hundreds of gamebreaking issues that take ages to be resolved, each update takes several hours because the spaghetti code has to be patched in it's entirety for even the smallest updates, and the hackers and just general server issues make trying to play the game (in its already flawed and inconsistent state) impossible at times. \n\nIn essence this game is incredibly mistreated by a terrible development team that only wants to make money from the game and doesn't really care about its success. I still play this game because I hope, dearly, that one day it will improve, and that one day it will finally live up to the potential it actually has. The gameplay elements are interesting and the characters are much more so, but the game never lives up to the idea it presents itself as. \n\nI hope one day that Dead by Daylight will finally be treated right, but I know deep down that it never will.","timestamp_created":1610645658,"timestamp_updated":1638724522,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467289716005325317","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84682116","author":{"steamid":"76561198982517601","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1756,"last_played":1658789729},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1610645455,"timestamp_updated":1610645455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84681935","author":{"steamid":"76561198435819590","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1501,"last_played":1643289443},"language":"schinese","review":"没有游戏体验","timestamp_created":1610645211,"timestamp_updated":1610645211,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84681876","author":{"steamid":"76561198194728309","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":119763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110755,"last_played":1658791762},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Daylight is a exciting, innovative game.
