I had the game since it came out, sadly it had a phase (towards the beginning) were it was unable to play. Since this issue got fixed I've started playing active again. But sadly, as I've noticed, the higher you've got with your rank, the more it got frustrating to play. The killers get worse and worse with each rank. Don't get me wrong, its not because they are actually bad players. Just the way they try to win the game with pure focus and camping. It's horrible and it's just ruining the fun. Another point is, the killers, perks and offerings are horribly unbalanced. There are some killers that require a lot of skill to handle, but others blindly kill everything around them, no matter how good the survivor is. As example: the cannibal. Basically same as the hillbilly, but his \"ult\" is just totally op. You don't get a chance at all to get away from him, and I've heard already people say \"stun him with a pallet\", well jokes on you. Anyways, same with some other \"abilities\": I recently was in a round were the killer, nurse, camped on a hooked survivor. All three of us tried to save or, but the killer wouldn't attack, instead, she waited for one to try and unhook her, but simply pulled that survivor away and on her shoulder. No chance to rescue! There would be so many ways to balance this game and do something against the campers, but apparently dlc killers are more important to develop (hint: they cost a lot. Are there perhaps some Ex EA developers hiding in the team?). Anyways, rarely we get into a round with a fair killer, and those are the rounds, that are still keeping me to this game.\n\nAnd please, for the love of god, invest more time into fixing bugs and to balance this game. You can publish dlc's when the game is at least playable, then its worth its money.","timestamp_created":1512824257,"timestamp_updated":1512824257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38178986","author":{"steamid":"76561198027169038","num_games_owned":826,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":143896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27747,"last_played":1658345609},"language":"english","review":"Mega-Updating the review for the start of 2020!\n\nThis game had a lot of promise once. Shame the dev team are so inept they can't do a patch without breaking something in a gamedeciding way, sometimes reviving bugs patched out half a year earlier in the process, it's so bad it's almost funny. But it really really isn't when you end up on the receiving end of it.\n\nLike most other asymmetrical team games (4v1) it's basically impossible to FULLY balance this game, but it's in a decent state balance-wise. The devs are trying their hardest. Basically if a fully geared out team uses voice comms, they're at an unfair advantage (because lack of information is literally a core game mechanic, that you can easily bypass through Discord/Teamspeak). Other than that, it's in the best place it's been in a long time.\n\nUnfortunately i still have to leave it on a thumb down though. Because while the game balance in theory is in its best state ever, the developers decided to add Dedicated Servers to the game four months ago. And these dedicated servers are a catastrophy to a point that makes me want to go back to the Peer-to-peer hosting which birthed a FLOOD of hackers and cheaters, which led to the original thumb down in my review. That's right, i'd RATHER go back to an environment where every 5-10 games i get utterly destroyed by a hacker, than playing on the current environment of dedicated servers. \n\nThey cause two to three DOZEN lag-based game deciding problems in each individual match. Meaning you're likely to eat anywhere between 8-10 game deciding lag messups yourself in each match. It's just utterly unplayable, and a shame.\n\nAverage player count is down despite the third massive sale on the game in three months, and for a good reason. As long as those dedicated servers stay enabled, you should stay away.\n\nMy heart bleeds for the obvious potential this game has.","timestamp_created":1512823489,"timestamp_updated":1577449745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480979591608047485","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38178935","author":{"steamid":"76561198314056184","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":33097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21392,"last_played":1638650250},"language":"polish","review":"nostalgia","timestamp_created":1512823390,"timestamp_updated":1602410852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38178731","author":{"steamid":"76561198349812467","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1700,"last_played":1546709509},"language":"russian","review":"Очень топовая игруля","timestamp_created":1512822840,"timestamp_updated":1512822840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38178642","author":{"steamid":"76561198330177084","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16125,"last_played":1563086346},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1512822577,"timestamp_updated":1512822577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38178623","author":{"steamid":"76561198452276720","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":886,"last_played":1658761269},"language":"polish","review":"Dobra gra","timestamp_created":1512822543,"timestamp_updated":1512822543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38178191","author":{"steamid":"76561198118728257","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1558785453},"language":"turkish","review":"lobiden atıyor. invite sistemi leş. kısaca buglı oyun","timestamp_created":1512821382,"timestamp_updated":1512821440,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477798998355865479","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38177869","author":{"steamid":"76561198259453410","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":22868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1639084926},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo Fajny Horror!!!","timestamp_created":1512820420,"timestamp_updated":1512820420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38177668","author":{"steamid":"76561198005332665","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":32410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12991,"last_played":1556149698},"language":"english","review":"Very Fun, Very Toxic, Very Salty, \n\nYou play as either Survivor or Killer.
