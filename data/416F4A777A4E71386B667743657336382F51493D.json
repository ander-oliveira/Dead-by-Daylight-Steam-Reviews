But there are different ways of this replay, for example, you will be stupidly beaten, and as soon as they are off the hook, the killer will stupidly follow you and wait for the \"borrowed time\" to end. After playing 600 hours, I did not get any pleasure fixing generators, because every now and then stupid players in the team and imbecile killers with noed and devouring hope are constantly being selected... I only enjoyed playing in a team with friends and running 5 generators from a maniac, watching how he stood offended in my face at the end of the game and realized that he could do nothing. Then there was only a sense of satisfaction. Because the game turns into who humiliates whom - either you run 5 genes, or a maniac stands in the basement and camp. I do not advise downloading if you are not ready to spend more than 1k hours on the game, because only after 500 hours you more or less begin to read the actions of maniacs and dominate them (which brings pleasure), but at any moment everything can spoil your partner)))) And so the conclusion is: The game is for those who want to run 5 genes every time, and then squat in the gate with a satisfied face and for those who will nod at nyurs with noed when they do -4, while showing off that they did -4 on the strongest killer, although it should be by itself... If you spend time learning how to run from a maniac, then the game is quite good, I think it's worth it to watch people leave the match when they can't catch you or you save the teammate with a flashlight)","timestamp_created":1632690798,"timestamp_updated":1638220827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100013284","author":{"steamid":"76561198374977035","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1322,"last_played":1653786406},"language":"english","review":"Hell","timestamp_created":1632690752,"timestamp_updated":1632690752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100013064","author":{"steamid":"76561198979163327","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":15901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":78,"playtime_at_review":13677,"last_played":1660558713},"language":"english","review":"ks","timestamp_created":1632690408,"timestamp_updated":1632690408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100013040","author":{"steamid":"76561198274447501","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10662,"last_played":1656343149},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun first 5 match, after 5 match you get cancer and you start becoming toxic.","timestamp_created":1632690371,"timestamp_updated":1632690371,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100012788","author":{"steamid":"76561198854389929","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":249,"playtime_at_review":12721,"last_played":1660096947},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo Bom!","timestamp_created":1632690000,"timestamp_updated":1632690000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100012736","author":{"steamid":"76561199097487013","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":9197,"last_played":1660253123},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely ruined after the update, do not play!

W większości są to retardy osoby, które jak tylko zostaną ograne (gdy grasz jako killer) lub zobaczą, że nie poszedłeś zdejmować ich z haka (bo np. wisiałeś już dwa razy, jesteś ranny i nie chcesz zginąć), wykorzystują bardzo przydatną funkcję przejścia na Twój profil Steam do napisania w komentarzu na Twoim profilu kilku wulgarnych i/lub karalnych bardzo miłych zwrotów typu \"zabij się\", \"umrzyj\", \"zgiń na raka\", \"spędziłem miłe chwile z Twoją mamą\". Zdarzają się oczywiście również słowa uznania od graczy, natomiast mam wrażenie że znacznie rzadziej - i mówię ogólnie, a nie tylko opierając się o własne doświadczenia. Trzeba się po prostu do tego przyzwyczaić.\n\nZaczynamy grę\nW Dead by Daylight rozgrywamy krótkie \"mecze\", w których udział bierze czterech ocalałych (zwanych również survivorami, survami) lub mniej, bo któremuś akurat mama wyłączyła internet w trakcie ładowania rozgrywki i jeden morderca, mordulec, killer, zwał jak zwał. Gra może się skończyć zanim się zacznie jeżeli zabójca się rozłączy... i zgadnij kto wtedy leci z rankingiem w dół... killer ocalały! No dobra, mordercy też ranking spadnie, ale karanie ocalałego za wyjście z gry z której wyszedł przymusowo, ponieważ host (czyli zabójca - btw. serwerem meczu jest toster komputer zabójcy, więc oczekuj pingu na poziomie 20ms 150ms i wcale nie bagatelizuję) się rozłączył jest conajmniej zje*ciach* pomysłem niezgodne z fair-play. W grze nie ma natomiast nierankingowego trybu matchmade, co dolewa oliwy do ognia, ale cóż, przemilczę. Gdy już przebrniemy przez ekran ładowania modląc się, żeby gra zaczęła się tak jak powinna, czyli w pełnym składzie, rozpoczyna się mecz.\n\nPerspektywa mordercy\n\nZ perspektywy mordercy gra jest w teorii prosta - zabić wszystkich pozostałych. I jeżeli myślałeś, że będziesz niczym wkur*ciach* zdenerwowany nadczłowiek chodzić i kłaść wszystkich na ziemie jednym puknięciem młotka w łeb, to nic z tych rzeczy. Gra zabójcą w uproszczeniu sprowadza się do bycia szukającym w grze w chowanego, a jak już kogoś znajdziesz to musisz go uderzyć, potem pobiegać za nim przez pół mapy od czasu do czasu obrywając paletami w ryj aż w końcu skurczybyka dopadniesz, położysz na ziemie, podniesiesz albo jeżeli team survów jest ogarnięty to dostaniesz teraz (albo już wcześniej) paletą lub latarką w ryj i zabawa w chowanego zacznie się od początku i zawiesisz na haku, bo przecież jesteś seryjnym zabójcą i nie potrafisz zabijać (chyba, że dasz odpowiedni dar dla Bytu [pseudobóstwa tej gry] i będziesz mógł wykonać coś na wzór Fatality z Mortal Kombat, ale (a) jako nowy gracz nie wiesz, że coś takiego istnieje (b) i tak żeby móc takie coś wykonać nasza szanowna ofiara musi raz zawisnąć). Na tymże haku ofiara musi sobie trochę powisieć, ewentualnie może zginąć w ułamek sekundy jeżeli ma IQ 0 nie ma przyjaciół, albo jej nie kochają, albo jeśli będzie chciała pokazać, że jest idiotą dziś wygrała główną kumulację i zaryzykuje kilka prób samodzielnego zejścia z haka (z szansą 4%). Oczywiście jeżeli będziesz campił pilnował tego przepięknego rytuału śmierci zostaniesz, jak już wcześniej wspomniałem, zlinczowany na swoim profilu (więc nie zapomnij ustawić go jako prywatny). Reasumując, najlepiej będzie jeśli po prostu dasz innym uratować kolegę z haka, bo wtedy będziesz przecież dobrą mordą i napiszą Ci \"GG\"... no problem tylko w tym, że będziesz musiał bawić się w chowanego dwanaście razy, a nawet nie, bo zanim uda Ci się powiesić kogoś drugi raz, gra zakończy się ucieczką wszystkich czterech osób.\n\nPerspektywa ocalałego\n\nI tutaj znowu w teorii wszystko wydaje się proste - musisz przeżyć, ale problem polega na tym, że morderca i czasem również reszta ocalałych będzie robić wszystko żebyś umarł. Aby zakończyć mecz z zadowalającym rezultatem musisz wraz ze swoim teamem naprawić 5 lub mniej, jeżeli jeden z kolegów się nie połączył generatorów (zwanych również silnikami), otworzyć bramę i uciec przez nią albo ewentualnie poczekać aż wszyscy pozostali zginą i wskoczyć do klapy w podłodze, która pojawia się w losowym miejscu na mapie. Przez większość gry musisz więc dobrze się chować, wychodzić gdy nikt nie patrzy i \"robić swoje\", no chyba że jakimś pierdo*ciach* cudem zrespisz się zaraz obok zabójcy i się na Ciebie uwieźmie, wtedy masz drogi kolego przeje*ciach* przewalone, i Twoja gra zamiast przypominać chowanego, zamieni się w coś na rodzaj berka. To samo się stanie również jeżeli morderca nie jest idiotą ślepy/głuchy i (a) w trakcie naprawy silniczek, który naprawiasz Ty lub jeden z Twoich przyjaciół współocalałych przypadkiem zrobi *bum* (b) przeskoczysz szybko przez przeszkodę (c) Ty lub ktoś w trakcie leczenia Cię skaleczy. Jeżeli grasz z przyjaciółmi i o ile tylko Twoi przyjaciele nie są debilami trollami, komunikacja z nimi powinna znacząco zwiększyć Twoje szanse na przeżycie. Gra sama w sobie podczas rozgrywki nie umożliwia głosowej komunikacji, ba, nie ma nawet zwykłego czatu. I nawet jeżeli ma to swoje plusy - nie musimy słuchać darcia ryja niewychowanych dwunastolatków pięknych głosów młodego pokolenia ani czytać obraz komplementów na czacie w trakcie gry (co pozwala się lepiej skupić na grze), to niestety nie możemy również uzyskać od naszego teamu informacji dla nas kluczowych (gdzie znajdują się pozostali ocalali, co aktualnie robią, gdzie jest morderca, etc.).\n\nSystem progresji\n\nTeraz czas na trochę poważniejszą część - progresja. Po każdym ukończonym meczu dostajemy \"punkty krwi\" (ang. bloodpoints), które możemy spożytkować na levelowanie dowolnej postaci (nasz \"stan konta\" jest współdzielony pomiędzy wszystkimi postaciami, czyli punkty zdobyte np. grając mordercą możemy użyć do rozwoju jednego z ocalałych). Aby podnieść poziom wybranego bohatera, należy przejść w jego \"drzewko krwi\" (ang. \"bloodweb\") i muszę przyznać, że system progresji jest bardzo dobry, a jedyne co boli w oczy to - przyspieszone w ostatniej aktualizacji, zupełnie niepotrzebnie - animacje. Wbicie maksymalnego (50) poziomu na jednym bohaterze nie zajmuje wcale długo, dlatego twórcy wprowadzili system prestiżu - po wbiciu maksymalnego poziomu, możemy go zresetować i w zamian otrzymujemy jedną z 3 części ekskluzywnego skina. Podsumowując, jest co \"maksować\" więc grinderzy będą w siódmym ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nZaskakujące podsumowanie\n\nMimo wszystko polecam Dead by Daylight. Jest to całkiem dobry i oryginalny tytuł, a cała ta recenzja jest tylko półserio. Jeżeli nie doszukałeś się w niej ironii, przeczytaj ją jeszcze raz.
