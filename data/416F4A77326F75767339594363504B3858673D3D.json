Es werden ein paar Inhalte vom Spiel erwähnt. Es ist vlt. zwar nicht wirklich Spoiler dennoch möchte ich dies hier schonmal erwähnen.\n\n\n\n\nDead by Daylight ist eig. ein super Spiel, aber es macht nur mit Freunden Spaß ! In Spielen sind 8 von 10 Killer erbärmliche Camper. Verstecken sich in einer kleinen Ecke und warten darauf das jemand sein Opfer zur Hilfe eilt und Ihn rettet. Als Geist ist es besonders unfair da man kein Herzklopfen hört. Erfahrene Spieler meckern zwar das Spieler im High Rank bereich sich das nich leisten können, weil Sie zu wenig Punkte kriegen, aber dies ist bei den kleinen egal. Dieses erbärmliche Camping macht das Spiel für den erhängten kein Spaß da er definitiv stirbt und sogar für den Tod anderer mehr oder weniger verantwortlich ist. Ich als Opfer quitte sofort damit andere nicht mal versuchen den Killer zu folgen. Wen ich jemanden helfen möchte rette ich ihn und lass den Killer mich aufhängen und verlasse dann das Spiel x). Kriege für sowas paar hundert Punkte aber egal xD. Nur flüchten und Generatoren reparieren ist einfach langweilig. Es würde es vlt. einfacher wen die Überlebenden durch Voice-Chat miteinander reden könnten, aber einen eingefleischten Killer sollte man einfach selbst aufhängen :D ruiniert den Spiel Spaß. Es werden sich vlt. welche Fragen, wen es mit Freunden Spaß macht wieso ich den Kauf nicht empfehle. Ich habe mitbekommen das die Entwickler die Spielart \"camping\", begrüßen bzw. erlauben.

It brings to mind the classic slasher flicks from the 80s like Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street.  \nI'm always tense and on the edge of my seat when I play as a survivor, praying the killer keeps away from me long enough for me to restart this piece of junk, busted generator.  \nConversely, playing the killer is a huge rush.  I love watching the survivors scatter like cockroches when I come out of the dark night. I can't help cackling madly as I chase them down and hook 'em.  Gotta catch 'em all!\nThat being said, there are some issues with it.  Camping someone that's been put on a hook, is an understandable but annoying strategy that many killers tend to use.  I'd like to see the killer get reduced points for corpse camping, or the victem get more points for occupying the killer's time or some combination thereof.\nAlso, the game lobby seems to be seriously wonky.  Sometimes you'll get dropped from a lobby or get stuck on 'searching for a match' for what seems like forever.  It can sometimes take over 5 minutes between finishing one match and getting into the next.  \nI still recommend Dead By Daylight, because once you get into the game it really is a heck of a lot of fun.  Hopefully we will see improvements with the connection and balance issues in future updates.\n","timestamp_created":1470604829,"timestamp_updated":1470604829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24766698","author":{"steamid":"76561198126721654","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":5108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1652079543},"language":"english","review":"this game is cool","timestamp_created":1470604256,"timestamp_updated":1470604256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24766680","author":{"steamid":"76561198128164546","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1297,"last_played":1638824032},"language":"czech","review":"Chcel som to hrať s kamošom, boli sme 2 a cakali sme 30 min a nedočkali sme sa.\nNetuším čím to je ale rad by som bol ak by nam to išlo.
