With your friends this game is great. With people online it's a real crapshoot. As a survivor you find hardly any trolls and for the killers that face camp it's only at the lower ranks (I'm considering 20 as low because it has, you know, lower skilled players) and even then I have not really seen it a whole lot of camping (DISCLAIMER. Big *** difference between face camping and patroling but more on that later) And the other survivors don't often block your esacpe from the killer. It's usally calm and cheery even with killers somtimes with everyone saying gg and good job and all that.\n\n BUT.....BIG FREAKING BUTT If you go as killer that's where the toxicity appears suddenly as you are frequented by low ranked veterans who only stay low to troll noob killers. Each match will probably have someone ranting how you were camping. This being you as a killer just standing in front of them not even moving untill they die (but as I said ranks higher than 19 don't do this because it gives the survivors SO MUCH TIME to get generators), but really ,as smarter killers tend to do, you were patrolling around the area of the hooked survivor However the most extruciating thing of all follows this set of patterns. Whenever you go into a new rank with a pip and think to your self ,\"Well I got nuthin better to do let's see what kind of players are in the next rank\", and then proceed to click to create lobby...... You will get chewed up spit out and pitied ,trolled, and worst of all........................ they still lose thier shit at you when you \"camp. Even worse the killers all get shit perks *ahem* they get good perks at first but Devs quickly nerf them down because of the outcry of bitchy trolls and \"Elitists\" who play as survivors. I don't really know wether to recommend or not. It's great with friends with the gentleman's agreement to not use perks or at least not op ones, but that is it unless you like reading a book as your charecter fixes a generator and everyone else trolls the killer and you know there is almost no way you can die.\n\n\n\nAfterthoughts\nSo overall dont come into this without friends. It's almost a requirement to practice with them as a killer if you don't want to chuck your computer at the wall in frustration. It's a great game and there are some really chill and friendly people in it, but as always the few shitheads who find no other enjoyment in life then sitting behind a screen ,wasting away to troll others who ,as they say, sit behind a screen and waste away.\n\nI hope this was informative, and I sincerely hope that my expierience as a killer main was just an unlucky one and not reflective of the expierience of others. Particularly the killers.\n\nSigned\nSome chick with a moustache\n\n\nP.S.\nOnce again I fervently urge you to buy this game with others or at least know some people who already have it so you can play and have fun as both survivor and killer.","timestamp_created":1510279973,"timestamp_updated":1513458647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497990459203720093","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36409270","author":{"steamid":"76561198117854913","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3506,"last_played":1620137309},"language":"english","review":"simple game with simple rules, yet highly addicting and challenging!\n\nplay as a killer or one of the survivors.\n\nplay it smart and win the game!","timestamp_created":1510279814,"timestamp_updated":1510279814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36408998","author":{"steamid":"76561198065577998","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2316,"last_played":1645422204},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight has to be one of the most engaging horror title I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1510278646,"timestamp_updated":1510278646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497990459203720093","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36408875","author":{"steamid":"76561198059508082","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":11484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4204,"last_played":1658399409},"language":"english","review":"Normally I never make a review, but this game is an exception.

Hexes are garbage dont bother using them. Not only can they be disabled at the begginning of the round but hex ruin can STILL be powered through. They are not hidden and survivors can easily disable them with no skill checks.\nNext trash killers.\nIm glad they are fixing the wraith but freddy didn't need these nerfs.\nThey made trash even trashier and fire up doesnt do anything either its a terrible perk.\nThere is no reason in buying the nightmare on elm street DLC unless you want a killer you will be harrassed with at rank 1.\nI honestly think they listen way too much to the survivors that are terrible or dont understand this game.\nJust like many other games like DARK SOULS 3 the devs listen to the players and make a very unbalanced game.\nILL MAKE THIS CLEAR.\nRELY ON NUMBERS NOT PEOPLES COMPLIANTS IF YOU HAVE EVER DONE THAT THEN YOU WILL REALIZE HOW UNFAIR THIS GAME IS.\nI honestly think the devs dont play this game.
