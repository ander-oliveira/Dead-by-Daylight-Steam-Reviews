Played on and off for 2-3 Years. I can say it achieves the goal of being a thrilling hide and seek experience with perks and abilities that innovate the game every new expansion pack/Update. I think for most people will really enjoy it the Community isn't too bad a lot of experienced players will give advice and help out new members very inviting community. For me personally it falls short with the very strict Dev team. unreasonable/Impersonal  way they handle violations of their EULA.\n\nOverall 7/10 Rating because you will find bugs or glitches that will make you laugh and dont ruin the game. Repetition sorta hits after 9-10 games of playing in 1 day. Average game length can be anywhere from 10-20 Minutes. Game now uses a battlepass progression of content. To unlock Cosmetics which is neat. All Killers are unique and enjoyable. All Survivors are pretty cool.","timestamp_created":1604121429,"timestamp_updated":1604121429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78440590","author":{"steamid":"76561199055541363","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7255,"last_played":1639430634},"language":"russian","review":"Нормальная игрушка.","timestamp_created":1604121207,"timestamp_updated":1604121207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78440473","author":{"steamid":"76561197967497947","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":22991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15869,"last_played":1635057729},"language":"english","review":"This game can be insanely fun, or frustrating. After some hours the panic feeling of being chased or the thrill of the hunt kind of goes away and it starts to get that \"playing a game\" feeling though. DBD has events pretty regularly, is always being updated, and also having things added to it. Also, with the connection of the console versions, the game has seen a pretty large boost in players overall. I would recommend it, and if its on sale, you would be silly not to pick it up.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the community seems to play predominately survivor or killer in waves. Time zones also seem to affect this. So for instance, if you are having a long cue time as a survivor, hop over to killer and you will get almost instant games, and vice versa. So if you want to \"main\" as one and only one, that might be a downside for you.","timestamp_created":1604121015,"timestamp_updated":1604121015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78440456","author":{"steamid":"76561199011716060","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1869,"last_played":1605455513},"language":"russian","review":"Очень интересная и увлекающая игра","timestamp_created":1604120986,"timestamp_updated":1604120986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78440371","author":{"steamid":"76561198888135018","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1637727936},"language":"english","review":"Its even better on pc.

Lets get into the actual review now. The game is probably the best 1v4 \"horror\" survival game out at the moment. Currently there are no competitors and HSH is a bit janky at the moment of this review being written. However, the game takes A LOT of grind.\n\n The game is not beginner friendly at all. If you are a beginner to the game, I recommend watching youtubers and streamers such as otzdarva, pain killer, scott jund, etc. They teach you a lot on how to get into the game.\n\n When you buy the game with no dlcs, you start out with 6 survivors and 6 killers. The survivors are Meg, Dwight, Jake, Bill, Claudette, and David. Meg, David, and Bill give you some of the best perks in the game to start out. These perks are adrenaline, dead hard, sprint burst, unbreakable and borrowed time. For killers you start with Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse and Huntress.\n\n If you bought this game on console, you also start with 2 dlc's. Those 2 are Of Flesh and Mud and Spark of Madness (Im pretty sure). I will not be going in detail about these.\n\n The game is a bit like Rainbow Six Siege but not in a gameplay aspect. Its not \"pay to win\" but paying real money def helps with the grind of the game. In order to get a new killer you must pay with something called \"iridiscent shards.\" These shards are used to purchase killers, survivors, and perks from the Shrine of Secrets (will mention that a bit later)\n\nYou need a total of 9000 shards to unlock a killer or survivor. You gain these shards by leveling up your account level. The amount of shards you get differ from how high of a level you are. The process of getting these shards take a VERY VERY long time. This does not help with the grind of the game which I will also be mentioning shortly.\n\n You may also buy killers and survivors with \"auric cells\" which cost real money. It takes $5 to get 500 auric cells which is enough for ONE killer or survivor. If you wish you can also buy the whole dlc's for 1 survivor and killer from a chapter. These cost around $6.99 saving you around 3 bucks if you bought the killer and survivor separately.\n\n This is where I talk about the grind aspect of the game. In order to get a certain survivor or killers perks onto another survivor or killer, you must get that character to levels 30, 35, and 40. How do you do this? With something called bloodpoints. You get these bloodpoints after every game of playing Dead by Daylight. If you have a so called \"perfect game\" you get 32,000 bloodpoints. That is very unlikely to happen every time you play so you can expect around 22,000 bloodpoints after every \"trial.\" It takes around 1,200,000 bloodpoints to get to level 40 in a SINGLE characters bloodweb. This will take a while depending on how often you play, how well you play, and how you manage the bloodweb. \n \n Well now you have that characters perks unlocked on every other killer or survivor right? WRONG. Now you have to level up EVERY OTHER CHARACTER you want that perk on. This means even more grinding. Depending on how many perks you do have unlocked, it may take over hundreds of bloodwebs to get the perks you really want on that character.\n\nThe Shrine of Secrets is a weekly rotation in the store featuring 2 different survivor perks and 2 different killer perks. It takes 2000 iridescent shards to unlock a perk in the shrine of secrets. Then you have to level up the character you want to get the perk on. The chances of you getting perks you want are very slim however.\n\n Oh wait, you didn't want to play your favorite horror movie slashers and video game characters right? Well you cant get those with grinding with iridescent shards. You HAVE to pay for them with real money to buy auric cells, or the dlc they come in. These killers and survivors also come with their own perks. Some of the killer perks are basically THE meta. You want bbq and chili to figure out where survivors are after hooking someone? Well too bad you have to buy the Leatherface dlc first. You want to block off generators and know which gens are being worked on while carrying a survivor? Well you need to buy the Ghostface dlc. \n\n Now we get to the cosmetics. The cosmetics are very nice looking and very well made. Too bad most cost OVER 20,000 SHARDS. Also for some reason you cant buy some cosmetics with shards, and can only be bought with auric cells. Non licensed cosmetics btw.\n\n Lets talk about survivor objectives. The main objective is pretty simple. Work on generators and escape. It takes around 80 charges to repair a generator. You repair a generator with 1 charge per second. You can work on a generator with multiple people to speed up the process. While doing this, you will get interrupted by the killer. This is when you have to get to a loop and start looping. There are many guides you can watch on how to loop. There are guides made by the YouTuber Ussylis on how to loop.\n\nSurvivor Items: The main Items carried by survivors are the Medkit, Flashlight, Toolbox, Map, and Key. The medkit allows you to heal yourself (which otherwise you can only do with the help of perks.) You can also heal others faster with a medkit. A flashlight lets you shortly blind a killer for a certain amount of time. If you blind a killer whilst they are carrying a survivor, the killer gets stunned for a couple seconds and the survivor breaks free. This is called flashlight saving and Ussylis also has a guide on that. The map lets you see the aura of generators, traps, totems, etc when being used. The key is a very special item. Without add ons the keys do nothing, until the hatch spawns. When it does you may escape right there without having to open up a gate.\n\nThe killers objective is to catch and hook the survivors. Unlike most games like Identity V, the killer doesn't have a specific win condition. If you think getting all 4 survivors and killing them is the win condition, it is. If it's getting as many hook as possible, it is (btw it takes 3 hooks to kill 1 survivor). If it's getting the survivors mad at the end game chat, then it is.\n\nAdd On's: I would watch an otzdarva guide about add ons and how they affect items and killer powers.\n\n Even after all this I said about the game, I personally think that Dead By Daylight is a very good game. It has its flaws and its share of bugs but overall, its a very good game. It's fun to play despite the grind. I think the most important thing that DBD is missing, is competition. As I said in the beginning, the game currently has no competition beside HSH Survive. Because of this, BHVR knows that we will still be playing the game at the end of the day. And that, is bad for the health of the game.\n\n Video games need competition. Competition drives the devs to make the game better than ever. They want to keep us playing the game. I am not saying the devs are smoothbrains just looking for some extra cash. That is not true. The devs are great people who care about the game. The lack of competition however, is bad.","timestamp_created":1604117456,"timestamp_updated":1623102868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78438277","author":{"steamid":"76561198054510172","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8236,"last_played":1611120590},"language":"english","review":"10/10

There's something for everyone. Whether you feel like being alone and tormenting survivors as they esacpe the fog, or you want to work with friends/strangers and get chased by various evil, it's got a lot of replayability. I also appreciate that there is a lot of nuance to a \"win\". You can have a great game as a killer if everyone lives, and being sacrificed doesn't mean you lost as survivor. If you're into lore, the world is especially rich, and every character has a backstory. The new Archives add a lot more backstory with animatics and it's fun collecting charms and skins from all the events. CROSSPLAY! That also rules! You are able to get matched with players of all gaming types from console to PC, and that makes for a lot of interesting play. There are GREAT corners to the community, both for killers or survivors or both, you just have to seek them out.\n\nCONS: It's a bit of grind. Okay, it's a LOT of a grind. However, you can use your favorite killer and spend those blood points on killers whose perks you want that you don't enjoy or aren't good at playing. And there's a lot of perks. SO MANY PERKS.

Along with newer characters like the Demogorgan and Jigsaw. This game is so pleasing to horror fans everywhere. My biggest issue with it though is that once you get into the higher ranks the killers seem to be outrageously broken with perks, making the game nearly impossible for survivors no matter the perks you have on a survivor. If there was an equal balance between the two it would make for a much more challenging experience on both sides at the higher ranks.","timestamp_created":1604098176,"timestamp_updated":1604098176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78425632","author":{"steamid":"76561199024627294","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":13874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1654368417},"language":"english","review":"fun from the start","timestamp_created":1604098130,"timestamp_updated":1604098130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78425403","author":{"steamid":"76561198364108272","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1604096409},"language":"russian","review":"Я уже все расписал в запросе о возврате средств.Не советую игру,лучше купите что-то действительно стоящее.","timestamp_created":1604097806,"timestamp_updated":1604097806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78425307","author":{"steamid":"76561198338614932","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":12245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1655770445},"language":"brazilian","review":"me deixa muito nervoso e com medo, mas eu gosto","timestamp_created":1604097676,"timestamp_updated":1604097676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78425261","author":{"steamid":"76561198121361048","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":40557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":368,"playtime_at_review":4504,"last_played":1659825469},"language":"english","review":"very fun with friends as survivor, or killer when solo","timestamp_created":1604097613,"timestamp_updated":1604097613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zOPqvfUCfcqVqwI="}
