decided to re-write my review on this and my opinion hasn't been changed this game still sucks despite playing it for so many hours. Balance is the major reason, not to mention the same objective kinda sucks only option is either find the generators as survivors and get to the exit. If your the last one standing you can either activate generators to exit or find a trapdoor if your lucky. Survivors are given only two ways to defend themselves by either using a flashlight (Which you have to find), or by using wooden pallets hoping it stuns the killer which doesn't do much. Escaping a killer pursuing you is next to almost impossible specially if the killer is either Shaper(Micheal Myers), Nightmare(Freddy Krueger), Hag, Doctor, or Pig(Saw). Also some players will camp your dying body as you crawl or are hooked to see if anyone tries to save you. Which sadly if your lucky to get saved. Some of the perks are barely helpful either since not many of them really do jack shit for survivors. Oh and if a survivor is hit twice they are down or due to a killer's perks or add-ons they can be instant downed. Oh forgot to mention killers can execute you with a perk under special conditions.\n\nPlaying the killer you think would be fun, but it gets dull as well or if your with asshole survivor players who stay at an open exit to taunt the killer making the game less enjoyable. Not to mention some killers are beyond broken in the game such as Shaper who litterally has almost no heartbeat to alert survivors. The Hag who can have a trap set which when a survivor sets it off she can instantly warp to that spot. The Doctor who can cause players to alert where they are at with his ability to electricute. Nightmare who puts a player to sleep and is next to almost impossible to escape like most killers (Good luck trying to wake up survivors in time.) The Pig is even more broken who can place a beartrap on a player's head and force them to either use puzzle boxes to get it off or die trying to escape. Pretty much DLC killers are beyond broken.\n\nOverall worst horror game that is pretty much hide and fuck with player simulator that is beyond unfun. I would rate it a 4 out of 10. Even with Bill from Left4Dead this game sucks. No thought or so called play testing was put into this game don't even bother buying it at full price your better off with other multiplayer horror games such as Friday the 13th. They also keep releasing more useless dlcs that really don't make the game any better. It's like a half-ass worded mess like some mobile games that are noting more then cash grab schemes.","timestamp_created":1467008525,"timestamp_updated":1537384717,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504781424999237061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23852517","author":{"steamid":"76561198032039482","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":24007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1657663041},"language":"english","review":"This game has its problems, there is no doubt about that.

3* June 2017\n\nThey unlocked everything for kill your friends mode (a mode that lets you have private matches with people on your friends list).\nWith this, you dont have to worry about grinding for the right perks and equiptment to do well against your friends.\n\nIn my oppinion this feature solidifys this game into the category of timeless classic.\nbecause of its peer to peer connection and this feature, it is future proof.\nIll enjoy playing this for many years with my friends.\n\n*edit 2* December 2016\n\nIf there is one thing any game played online with random people have in common its that the games themselves are great, its people that are the real buzzkills.\n\nI still say this game is better enjoyed with friends, only because friends generally wont attack you because they lost. friends generally treat eachother with at least some level of respect.\nIf you dont mind or even enjoy the bitter comments from random people then online play is perfect for you. Im pretty sure only league of legends and the great salt lake rivals the amount of salt generated from this game's players.\n\nA lot of the infinites have been fixed and they even added a mechanic to stop it completely by giving windows a cooldown if used often, closing them temporarily by the spider god.\nAs of right now the devs are working on camping.\nDespite the unpleasable fanbase, the devs have been working quite persistently to fix the problems introduced and discovered by players themselves.\nA large enough sample size will always make the flaws stand out more.\n\nOverall its still a fantastic game. There really are only 3 other games like it and they wont even come out until next october (2017)\n\n\n*edit*\n\nThe salt content in this game is deliciously high.\nIt doesnt matter which side you are on, someone is going to be salty about something.\n\n\nIts a fantastic game.\nIt reminds me a lot of a party game people would play on early fps games called \"Jason\"\nBesides a couple of issues that will be fixed next patch I find this game to be really well balanced.\nThe worst part is people though, because people are generally terrible and selfish they dont like working together.\n\nAs killer my only complaint is the window hoping (which will be fixed next patch).\nMy main complaint as survivor is people, and you cant change people.\n\nNext patch is also going to bring in the \"survive with friends\" feature, which the lack of is the cause of most of the negative reviews. \n\nEvery rare while you run into an honorable opponent, and this game really shines through its flaws.\nIts a fantastic game and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this type of game.","timestamp_created":1467005782,"timestamp_updated":1498662824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851931","author":{"steamid":"76561198044148521","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1467009368},"language":"english","review":"cant play with friends in matchmaking.. what a shitty idea to release a co-op game without a party feature\ngame might be worth it whenever they fix that but right now its pointless","timestamp_created":1467005506,"timestamp_updated":1467005506,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851674","author":{"steamid":"76561198072305615","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":10907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2648,"last_played":1657856068},"language":"english","review":"Just like trying to hide from my dad.","timestamp_created":1467004590,"timestamp_updated":1467832720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851650","author":{"steamid":"76561198149153382","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1567,"last_played":1483267067},"language":"schinese","review":"遇到有毒的屠夫 ，自己菜一个人都弄不死然后被开五台发电机，就强退。也是服的不行。","timestamp_created":1467004504,"timestamp_updated":1467004504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851444","author":{"steamid":"76561198240205768","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":96009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3623,"playtime_at_review":1415,"last_played":1660535266},"language":"english","review":"This game is extremely fun with friends or just playing alone on multiplayer","timestamp_created":1467003757,"timestamp_updated":1467003757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851414","author":{"steamid":"76561198267380780","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":57,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1467002714},"language":"english","review":"While the concept is interesting and the lore (and items) have a wonderful Lovecraftian feel to them... I cannot reccomend this game in it's current state as of 6/27/2016.\n\nI play competitive PvP quite frequently and I know when a game is unbalanced. They need to buff the survivors a little bit more and find a point of harmony. It takes no skill to play as the killer and it takes a lot of luck to be a survivor. In my personal opinion, this game is not fun. It suffers from being \"boring\" on one side and \"too difficult\" on the other.\n\nMechanics need to be balanced and the game needs to be amusing (enjoyable, fun), regardless of difficulty cap. Because that's what the word \"game\" essentially means in the dictionary. I don't feel this game manages that.\n\nDead By Daylight will likely be worth another look at when it's fully released and has been around long enough for the developers to do more balancing, but right now, quite a few players may find the game frustrating - particularly if they only play as survivors.","timestamp_created":1467003645,"timestamp_updated":1467003645,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477111548185348511","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851407","author":{"steamid":"76561198034936937","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2297,"last_played":1528742840},"language":"french","review":"beaucoup de plaisire le stresse est au RDV ^^ :)","timestamp_created":1467003612,"timestamp_updated":1467003612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851292","author":{"steamid":"76561198156299752","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":117239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3434,"last_played":1655571508},"language":"russian","review":"Игра просто БОМБА!!!\nТакаго удовольствия от игры я давно не получал.\nПлюсы:\n+ атмосфера, адреналин - просто зашкаливают;\n+ звук в игре (биение сердца, крики, стоны выживших,  карканье ворон и т.д.) - это просто шедевр (Уважаемые разработчики поблагадарите от меня лично ответственнного за музыкальное сопровождение игры);\n+ продуманая и очень интересная система прокачки как выживших, так и маньяков;\n+ каждый выживший и маньяк уникален по своему, у каждого свои индивидуальные врожденные и приобретаемые навыки;\n+ цена (400 рублей за такую игру это мало);\n+ игра за все время не разу не вылетела.\nМинусы:\n- частые вылеты из лоби\n\n\nПриобретайте не пожалеете!!!\n\nОценка: 9,9/10","timestamp_created":1467003194,"timestamp_updated":1467003194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492307692766189575","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23851019","author":{"steamid":"76561198066862228","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":113385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":991,"playtime_at_review":11319,"last_played":1660543466},"language":"english","review":"*EDIT*\nI think the game has been great overall.

Our team tried our best to win, but the killer had been outplaying us the entire game and eventually, it led to a hook fiesta where eventually everyone on the team was downed in the same area. The killer, seemingly satisfied, starts to pick up the survivors.\n\nSuddenly.\n\nOne by one, the survivors DC. The killer, helpless, watches as the fruits of his hard work slip away, as the survivors, in a fit of salt and rage, all disconnect. Meanwhile, I'm still on the ground, watching this happen. I'm considering disconnecting when he picks me up. Instead of hooking me on the hook right infront of him, he rapidly shakes his head, cloaking and uncloaking. He takes me to a generator. He starts furiously beating the generator with his club. He lets me wiggle free, and repair the generator. When I finish, he swings and downs me. Perhaps he wanted to give me a little more points before my defeat. However, instead of hooking me, he takes me to another generator and beats that one with a club, too. We repeat the process.\n\nOnce I'm finished repairing the generator, the killer downs me once more. I'm sure he just wanted to give me a couple more points so I don't lose my rank. He carries me in the direction of a hook. Just as I thought the journey had ended, he walks right past the hook, and plops me down on the trapdoor. \n\nI spin circles in the ground, trying to indicate that he deserves a victory. He just looks at me solemnly and slowly nods, looking as I'm still spinning on the ground. He turns away, cloaking, and leaves me alone. I escape. \n\nBless you, Gaz.\n\nThe game is great, with a few bug fixes and a few balance reworks, I can feel that the game will be much better in the future. Devs also seem to listen to the players, and party queue and window cheesing reworks seems to be coming soon. Few issues, like disconnecting problems, but overall game is fun and very enjoyable.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1466999533,"timestamp_updated":1466999533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23850002","author":{"steamid":"76561197983611170","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2296,"last_played":1467039308},"language":"english","review":"Besides

bugs that ive encountered include: not being able to pick up someone you've downed as the killer, having no prompt to try and free yourself when in a bear trap, fast vaulting over walls when you arent sprinting, clipping into sections of the ground when downed as a survivor making it very difficult for the killer to see you.\n\nWith polish this game could be really great, but as it stands i can't

What more could you want?\n---\nNOTE: The Development team is commited and engaged - but they're also noobs at running a networked multi-player game.  And it shows.  They tend to screw up launches.  Matchmaking is pretty much a disaster right now.  If you can join a game (not always easy!), it's likely you'll be mixed in with players of all levels.  Kind of like trying to go on an RPG raid with a random group of players who may or may not even qualify for the minimum requirements.  MAtches can be ridiculously lopsided as a result.\n\nThe easy (and obvious!) fix is to filter players based upon their experience with the game as reflected by total character levels or by their total bloodpoints - but the developers seem committed to doing things the hard way (by Rank - which is completely irrelevant to a players earned skills, perks, or abilities) when it comes to matchmaking.\n\nI'm sure that things will get better... but be prepared for lots of ongoing frustrations as the dev team figures out how to cope with their game's unexpected popularity and succees.\n\n---\n\nThis game's primary appeal is how it makes you feel like you're part of a horror flick.  It does a great job doing this via its music, visuals, sound effects, and user interface.  \n\nThe game is unique in that it is asymetrical by design.  You can play as either be the unstoppable brutal killer intent on sacrificing your vicitms or you can be one of four clever survivors attempting to escape the killer's wrath.\n\nLongevity comes in the form of earning \"blood points\" based upon your performance in a match.  Those blood points can be used to buy various upgrades and perks for either your survivor or your killer.\n\nBalancing an asymetrical multi-player game like this is quite a challenge.  There continue to be many problems and frustrations.  However, the developers are committed to improving things.\n\nI originally gave the game a thumbs down review, but they've made things much better (when the lobby matchmaking is actually working!) and I am revising it to be a thumbs up.

If they want to keep their population up, they better do something to mix up everything other than adding new characters, because until then I won't be touching this game again.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1466985474,"timestamp_updated":1466985474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23846000","author":{"steamid":"76561198210669263","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1684,"last_played":1648807398},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1466985423,"timestamp_updated":1466985423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23845907","author":{"steamid":"76561198115739516","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1477814141},"language":"english","review":"Very nice game, Has a couple issues. It feels sort of like a beta almost because not everything is there. You can't play with friends (as for now) unless its a private 1v1 (which gets boring). \nAll in all I'd give it a 7/10 - It gets repititive but lots of games can be repetitive and fun at the same time.","timestamp_created":1466985135,"timestamp_updated":1466985135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uZfIx9UCc8H7Wg=="}
