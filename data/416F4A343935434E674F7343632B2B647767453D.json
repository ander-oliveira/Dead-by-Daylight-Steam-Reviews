Basically, it's a hunt-or-be-hunted multiplayer online game based on some of the classic horror movie tropes of the last few decades... a group of four survivors being chased by an unkillable, and somewhat overpowered killer in a closed environment.  The survivors must repair 5 generators placed throughout the map, ultimately powering an exit gate that leads to freedom.   The killer is there to kill all four survivors before they do just that.  On the plus side, as an online multiplayer game both the survivors and killers are real people, so there's never really a dull AI whose behaviors can be learned.   Also, you can play as either survivor or killer, each with a distinct gameplay experience, so it's like getting two games in one.    On the downside, there's a lot of bugs.  To the developers credit, they tackle most of them with fairly frequent updates.  But new fixes often beget new bugs, and the cycle  goes on and on.  Also, the game's ranking system is a bit pointless.   There are month-long seasons where each player is ranked by both their survivor and killer skills.  But problem with how rank points (called \"pips\") are given or taken away can been very very frustrating.   For example, four survivors may join a match, then one or more may abruptly disconnect, making survival odds for those remaining extremely difficult --- ultimately resulting in a loss of pips.  The player's overall character level, completely separate from the season ranking, isn't really used for anything, and just grows and grows the longer you play -- with no actual connection to the gameplay itself.   Lastly, you get a lot of unsportsmanlike players that will camp hooks or use 3rd party voice chat apps and really take all the fun out of the game.   Oh wait -- one more thing -- the game queuing system is a disaster.   When you're waiting for other players to join your match, sometimes the matchmaking system fails and you're left hanging forever, or it simply disconnects without warning.  Still, despite these shortcomings, the games is pretty addictive when it works.   Simple gameplay.  High intensity.  (There's nothing like a killer jumping out of nowhere when you're fixing a gen.)  Definitely recommended.","timestamp_created":1559152362,"timestamp_updated":1559152362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50932537","author":{"steamid":"76561198205263356","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":73689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":15343,"last_played":1660068002},"language":"polish","review":"its ok i guess","timestamp_created":1559151663,"timestamp_updated":1658061710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50932345","author":{"steamid":"76561198375994870","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1648996157},"language":"english","review":"nice, if ranking system suitable for newbie like me was nicer; rich character & story, like little thrill & fun game must try!!","timestamp_created":1559150924,"timestamp_updated":1606394584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50932323","author":{"steamid":"76561198955158460","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":40081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31694,"last_played":1642240869},"language":"russian","review":"10 сурвов из 10","timestamp_created":1559150843,"timestamp_updated":1608019853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50932288","author":{"steamid":"76561198950064102","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2721,"last_played":1587577098},"language":"russian","review":"Разрабы этой игры уроды","timestamp_created":1559150697,"timestamp_updated":1566832830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50932121","author":{"steamid":"76561198388203006","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":6729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3680,"last_played":1653046937},"language":"english","review":"много добра игра. 10/10","timestamp_created":1559150120,"timestamp_updated":1559150120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50932115","author":{"steamid":"76561198172188981","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1170,"last_played":1642964957},"language":"swedish","review":"very nice game","timestamp_created":1559150092,"timestamp_updated":1559150092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50931988","author":{"steamid":"76561198202575132","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1631710614},"language":"schinese","review":"刚入手，每次都是，被追卡、修理卡、进房卡，这次我畏畏缩缩的靠着野队活到最后，刚打开出口又卡死。。。我心情都开磨没了","timestamp_created":1559149620,"timestamp_updated":1559149620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52061927318572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50931646","author":{"steamid":"76561198870513509","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13939,"last_played":1561208085},"language":"russian","review":"Игра топчик рекомендую.

Not fun, frustrating. :)\n\nIf that doesn't sound bad enough and you actually want to feel the frustration instead of turning around and spending your money on something better, then go ahead, buy it.\n\nMost of the game is balanced to the survivor's side (including the current winter event, which the only \"event mechanic\" it introduces is literally hindering the killer), there's like 4-5 perks on each role that are actually worth using, the maps are extremely unbalanced or outright broken, the devs don't, and I can't stress this enough, the devs DON'T listen to the community in any regard be it balance wise or anything like that.\n\nInstead they brush off the player base criticism with \"well the statistics say otherwise\". There was this perk in the game for survivors that was being completely exploited to screw over killers, for years, right? Decisive Strike is the name of the perk. It was infuriating, and killers would tunnel those survivors that exploited it. But because \"the statistics shows that survivors who use this perk, usually don't make it alive\" (I wonder why) they took, 4, years, to fix it.\n\nAnother great one as well is removing every event from the game aside from halloween and christmas, \"so they can better work on those events and make them better\".

Release came and went and I played my fair share.  Taking screenshots of my stat screens when I did well, and just overall having a great time playing.  I even bought it for my wife so we could play together.  Had loads of fun.  \n\nFast forward to 2019, 5/27/19 to be exact.  I had a sudden itch to play.  So i reinstall and load it up.  All my character progress was gone.  Everything had been reset.  I figured something happened with the game requiring a wipe or something so I didn't think anything of it.  Then my wife finally logs in to play and she still has all of her bloodpoints and items along with survivor levels and killer levels.  \n\nI immediately go to the forums thinking that maybe her account was bugged or something only to find out that my account was the one with problems.  I shouldn't have lost my stuff.  So I make a ticket as it says to do, not really worried because it asks for screens of your characters with points and levels showing, which I had, since I was taking screenshots every time I did well.  The screenshots I supplied weren't \"good enough\" and I needed screenshots from my character screen, even though everything they require to be in the picture as in the picture.  Yes because normal people who have no interest in streaming or making videos would have random screenshots showing their progress.\n\nQuoted directly from the email \n\n[b][i]\"Full-screen images of your Killer and Survivor characters with levels where all of the game's currency (iridescent shards and bloodpoints), your in-game name, and player rank are visible.\"[/i][/b]\n\nEverything they asked for was in the screenshots EXCEPT iridescent shards because there was no such thing in 2016.\n\nAll in all I lost 44-48 hours of progress.  We put our trust in to these companies and this is how they treat us.\n\nNow for the actual game.  It can be a lot of fun.  There aren't any dedicated servers, and the killer hosts the game.
