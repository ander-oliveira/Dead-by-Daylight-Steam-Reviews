A generator takes 80 seconds to power alone with 1 second taken off for each time a great skill check is landed, this game requires patience and is not as action packed unless playing killer.\n\nKiller is a considerably stressful role, requiring arguably the most in game knowledge to prosper. It is strongly recommended to start the game on survivor and transition as more game knowledge grows. The role feels unrewarding at times with some maps having vast amounts of god tier pallets and loops, playing against organised teams.\n\nThe game does not have communication between survivors, the game is balanced around this however this is easily bypassed by playing with friends and the use of popular discord servers. \n\nI have encountered a few hackers but many keep it low key such as knowing what the killer is from the lobby or wall hacks, many of these things can be obtained through the object of obsession perk so it does not break the game to badly.\n\nThe various bugs in this game are to vast to count with multiple cosmetics constantly being introduced it would be nice for the \"devs\" to spend 10% more time to just fix the bugs than to push cosmetics constantly. \n\nThe Game is so broken you are required to go to the website to report bugs instead of being able to do it in game, this is processed and feels super unsatisfactory as if you are just being \"palmed off\" and from my vast experience reporting multiple under the floor bugs and glitched pallets very little is ever done to solve them with the list growing over time.\n\nThe game is not pay to win however certain cosmetics definitely are harder to see with the famous \"blendette\" making life very difficult for the new killer.\n\nAfter Reaching Rank 1 In Both Cues (Before it became SUPER easy) I rate the game the following:\n\nGeneral Gameplay: 7/10    Unique, Crisp and Addictive\nGraphics: 6/10                   Often Difficult to Make Out Even On Ultra Settings\nBugs and Glitches: 2/10    Vast and Counting\nReplayability: 10/10          New chapters, Rift system keeps it \"fresh-ish\"\nCosmetics: 5/10                Half of them look good, some can be obtained for free.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nIf your a horror fan and are willing to pay for DLC like nightmare on elm street, halloween, texas chainsaw and the likes definitely worth a shot, but make sure you buy it on sale as it is frequently greatly reduced. The base game comes with enough killers to make it entertaining. Take into account that the following DLC's are required to access some \"meta perks\" Texas chain for BBQ, Laurie Strode for DS. The Developers have shown no interest in fixing the game from my experiences and I have even got a warning for trying to contact them and sharing details of the events and bringing attention to certain bugs, however the game has so much potential i will still recommend it only if on sale.","timestamp_created":1586835152,"timestamp_updated":1587865277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67269857","author":{"steamid":"76561199037087126","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":30256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1659935003},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor

I think I paid 40$ for this, its awful, would highly recommend you don't get it.\n\nEdit: for the people saying that ive only played in 30 rounds, how the hell can you only play 30 rounds with around 10 hours of play time.... especially when the rounds last no more than 5 minutes for everyone to die to the killer. yes the game was 40$ when I got it.","timestamp_created":1586807575,"timestamp_updated":1586987958,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446166694164276123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67250333","author":{"steamid":"76561198442781676","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":61138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":410,"playtime_at_review":4086,"last_played":1660520011},"language":"english","review":"Лайк коммент репост","timestamp_created":1586807002,"timestamp_updated":1637940971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67250064","author":{"steamid":"76561198868768830","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":983,"last_played":1592839289},"language":"russian","review":"Игра чисто что бы , поиграть с друзьями по кричать , бесится и всё такое.На одного я эту игру не советую , но если вы прям очень хотите поиграть в эту игру то впринципе можно зависнуть на 1-2 часика норм .
