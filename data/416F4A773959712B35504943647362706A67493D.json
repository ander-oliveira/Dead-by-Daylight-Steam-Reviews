The game is SUPER unbalanced, and i often say to myself \"thats fine, i didn't feel like playing anyways\" while playing. The game has a large variety of perks and play styles that are lots of fun to play with and against. However, once you get into higher MMR, you will only see the same like 10 perks on survivors, and the same 6 killers over and over again. Playing solo survivor is a dice roll, either you get teammates who are pretty good and have fun, or you get the glue sniffers and you die because of their shortcomings. Playing in a group of survivors is better, but it is hell for the killer. Playing killer is either the most fun you will have, or the least fun you will have, Survivors will usually have pretty good coordination, and will almost always be running Dead Hard, AKA the Get out of Jail Free Card. Despite all of these negative qualities, i can't help but adore this game. Maybe its just the fact that i'm addicted, but i can't get enough of my self hatred. The best way to play this game is to not take it too seriously, if you do then you become a sweat lord with stretched resolution that also runs all meta perks because \"Its just how i play\". If you run off-meta perks like Mettle of Man or Flashbang, i find it to be WAY more fun than running your usual Dead Hard, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike, and Circle of Healing. It is also important to know that the MMR system is dogshit and will pair you up with that one guy who mains Nurse because they totally don't play her because she is busted as fuck. Try not to take it too seriously and just have fun with the game is the only real advice i can give.","timestamp_created":1592521078,"timestamp_updated":1638695618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841253757476807","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71001336","author":{"steamid":"76561198264032850","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1638377765},"language":"russian","review":"отличная игра в прятки с друзьями","timestamp_created":1592520609,"timestamp_updated":1592520609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71001280","author":{"steamid":"76561199046880892","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2498,"last_played":1658185979},"language":"spanish","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1592520488,"timestamp_updated":1592520488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71000913","author":{"steamid":"76561198189872661","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":23235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12251,"last_played":1658140227},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, whether you play by yourself or with friends!\nConstantly being updated, too.","timestamp_created":1592519789,"timestamp_updated":1592519789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71000791","author":{"steamid":"76561198410407852","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":55140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":295,"playtime_at_review":51141,"last_played":1660377204},"language":"koreana","review":"인디게임 슈듄","timestamp_created":1592519555,"timestamp_updated":1638362063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71000606","author":{"steamid":"76561198159369958","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":1260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1653529180},"language":"brazilian","review":".","timestamp_created":1592519196,"timestamp_updated":1652920899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71000560","author":{"steamid":"76561198799017230","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1608615533},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mt bom","timestamp_created":1592519121,"timestamp_updated":1592519121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71000336","author":{"steamid":"76561198882286141","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":700,"last_played":1645772297},"language":"russian","review":"В начале оооочень сложно,будет тильт.

More addictive game than I thought when I bought it. I enjoy playing as a survivor, but I love playing as the killer. Four people play trying to fix generators that will power the escape doors. One person plays as a killer who has to hunt them all down before they escape. The game takes a few times playing as both killer and survivor to create a strategy for play. Games are only 5 to 15 minutes on average.  I have a favorite character I play as and even though I have got him down pretty good the game is always a challenge and always different. Sometimes I come up empty, sometimes no one escapes death. Most of the time it is a mixed bag. Survivors must use team work to make it out alive. \n\nYou earn blood points in the game that you can use to buy perks. Most of them are 1 time use, some you keep to customize your play style. They can be switched out between matches. \n\n Most players are good, but some get really nasty in the post game chat. People are people and some are jerks. Overall I like the post game chat feature. Even playing as killer most of the time, people enjoy the game win or lose.\n\nThere are some maps with tricks or strange spots and small gltiches  where it is hard to get to players, and experienced survivors can make use of these. As the killer you learn from playing against the experienced survivors and learn to plan ahead.

DBD's new release of the Silent Hill DLC, I had to put out a review that I've been sitting on for awhile now. If I could give this game an 'eh' rating with a 'maybe if it's on sale buy it if you feel like a few good games' I would. Now I don't have hundreds of hours on DBD like others do but I have a fair amount that I feel like I should say something. \n\nThe game is a mess at times, pushing cosmetic items that you pay real money for instead of in game currency, to releasing DLC's for killers that sometimes are good, sometimes are bad. This game has always had issues. Or grinding how ever many hours just to unlock a killer with in game currency or a singular cosmetic item. \n\nThe game is  buggy, preventing you from ranking up, sometimes it's the hit boxes, sometimes it's you DCing unintentionally and losing your rank that easily. It's annoying and disappointing at the same time considering how fun the game is when there isn't bugs preventing you from being downed or even getting into the game. \n\nThe matchmaking is beyond annoying when it comes to the ranking. Being put in with greys to purples and reds when you aren't anywhere close to that rank. Then those people diss you at the end of the match or choose to not help you if you accidently stab them after missing a skill check to heal them(because you're clearly a grey rank and just getting the hang of things) \n\nWith that being said, don't get me started on the community. That's one reason why I haven't played it as much as I had prior. You do such a small thing like loop a killer, or manage to get out of their sight and YOURE suddenly the bad guy for playing your part as the survivor. Some will camp you on the hook, some will DC on you, some will tunnel you. I'm a survivor main and at this point it's just plain frustrating to be completely honest. It kills the game for me.\n\nNot to mention how much crap people give you if you play with friends. Despite the game HAVING THE OPTION, it's looked down upon to other players for whatever reason. Claiming it's an 'unfair advantage' but the game offers it, expect people to use it. Learn from the experience and move on. Don't diss them after the match is over if you lose or win it's honestly that simple. \n\nThe devs don't care and I've honestly been waiting to see if this game turns out like Deathgarden, although with the game going into the 4th year, part of me doubts it, but the toxic community is going to kill it, at least for me anyways. \n\nThat being said, there are some cool factors to the game, the whole horror idea is great, the classic horror icons is fun, the whole IDEA of the game is great. I loved it, had a lot of fun with it in the past but recently the bad out weigh the good for me and I launch the game to immediately close it after one match because I'm reminded of how annoying the game is to play.\n\n I know the community is a bit hard to fix in a game but I've had the conversation  many times with friends of how they could stop the hook camping, or tunneling etc and it just seems that the Devs don't care in that sense. They make the money, they release killers/survivors and don't fix many bugs just a few to get everyone to shut up and carry on. It just kinda sucks from how fun the game used to be, turning out like this and a lot of camping and DCing because people get frustrated with it. \nPart of me just wishes the  Devs would sit down and realize (if they hadn't already) the flaws of the game and community and attempt to put into play how to fix certain things instead of just being focused on DLC's and cosmetic items. Because I'm sorry but that might bring new players but it won't keep them for long once they realize how faulty the game actually is.","timestamp_created":1592510267,"timestamp_updated":1592510267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619750559329986572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70995367","author":{"steamid":"76561198271098020","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1640297791},"language":"spanish","review":"es bueno\n","timestamp_created":1592510092,"timestamp_updated":1592510092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70995330","author":{"steamid":"76561198091365683","num_games_owned":739,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1595626958},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1592510048,"timestamp_updated":1592510048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70995228","author":{"steamid":"76561198983352035","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1620917543},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok iyi oyun\n","timestamp_created":1592509870,"timestamp_updated":1592509870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70995180","author":{"steamid":"76561198186661770","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":28078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27677,"last_played":1616147971},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是不错 很棒  我很喜欢 但是...不支持3440*1440 画面拉伸我也服了...","timestamp_created":1592509815,"timestamp_updated":1592509815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70995125","author":{"steamid":"76561198821387962","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":4367,"last_played":1660351606},"language":"spanish","review":"esta wena esta wea\n","timestamp_created":1592509739,"timestamp_updated":1592509739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70995046","author":{"steamid":"76561198383774513","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":101352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1583,"playtime_at_review":39480,"last_played":1660594136},"language":"french","review":"Le meilleur jeu du genre, un classique","timestamp_created":1592509618,"timestamp_updated":1592509618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Yq+5PICdsbpjgI="}
