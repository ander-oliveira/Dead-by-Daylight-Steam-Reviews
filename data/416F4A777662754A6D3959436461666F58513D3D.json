Especially with items that change light levels and fog in the game.\nCouple that with a kind of misty backstory of a web of blood and you have a weird, awesome, near-lovecraftian experience of confusion, heart-racing, and momentary relief from danger that normally only comes from single-player horror games like FNAF or Slenderman multiplayer.\n\nFor those considering buying the game, do it now, as you will need to grind up points for additional perks that make the game more enjoyable. And hey, its $20, not like other high-graphic $40 games that are multiplayer only.  [u]You can't expect the quality to be the same for what you pay.[/u] Plus, you help influence gameplay changes in its continuing development.\n\nok, enough preaching.\n\nYou might want to hold off buying the game if you want a more finished, bug-free game, as the devs are working still on game-balancing, new content, bug-fixing and the like.  \nA recent patch helped to balance infinite escape spots for survivors, so it is easier to play the killer now in a sense (less abuse of arena).   \nPerks on certain characters are overpowered versus others, meaning these perks almost never see play.  \nThe ranking system is different from other games and takes some adjustment, as it is not enough to simply win the match while hiding in a corner watching everyone else work.  [u]Ya gotta be brave to get pips.[/u]\nDisconnects ruin the fun (when has it not in multiplayer gaming?).  Perhaps some adjustment to disconnecting so that if a survivor disconnects at very start of match, a generator gets taken off the count or something.  \nThe connections in games vary by match, meaning some matches are laggier than others, [b]your connection is not going to be stable every game.[/b] Very frustrating when as a survivor you glitch into the view of the killer, or as the killer you can't hit a lagging survivor.","timestamp_created":1469855341,"timestamp_updated":1469855389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24608477","author":{"steamid":"76561198173773113","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":56689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56452,"last_played":1655173412},"language":"english","review":"The current state of the game is completely survivor sided. Killers have been getting the short end of the stick with perks and the newest killers have been pretty lack luster. They decided to nerf characters that didn't need nerfing at this point the game is impossible to play as killer. You can hit someone and 10 seconds later they are healed because of boon. If you try to destroy the boon you're wasting time that could be used in applying pressure to the game. Killers no longer have any sort of slow down to the game and the games passive slow down is null with recent survivor perks. A lot of balancing needs to be done in this game. Sad to see a once amazing game be so terrible, as well as being a tyrant in the killer survivor genre of games. One last issue is lighting, my screen would be so dark in some maps I can't see where people are when they are 4 feet away from me. I hope to see a lot of changes to balancing and bugs. This is my official resignation from DBD.","timestamp_created":1469855028,"timestamp_updated":1644737538,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24608410","author":{"steamid":"76561198131280922","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1647007617},"language":"schinese","review":"买买买 没别的好说！","timestamp_created":1469854606,"timestamp_updated":1469854606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24608215","author":{"steamid":"76561198152587582","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1573321381},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sensacional, parabéns aos desenvolvedores !!","timestamp_created":1469853468,"timestamp_updated":1469853468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474560856819152832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24608071","author":{"steamid":"76561198122926087","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":101456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3433,"last_played":1655485823},"language":"english","review":"Please fix this bug.

El juego esta terminado pero aún tiene mucho para dar y es algo bueno porque los desarrolladores continúan agregando parches para corregir bugs y mejorar aún mas la experiencia.\n\nA FAVOR:\n* El juego tiene personajes diferentes con habilidades diferentes estas habilidades comienzan a tomar forma a medida que subes de nivel\n* Gráficos y ambientación espeluznante realmente quieres salir de ahí o si eres el asesino saca tus instintos destructivos\n* Los perks son bastante creativos y no te convierten en un ser invencible, digamos un personaje de bajo nivel puede escaparse de un asesino en niveles altos o viceversa\n* El juego funciona bien en pc's de gama media\n* Posibilidad de jugar con amigos creando partidas privadas\n* El sistema de rango hace que las partidas no sean repetitivas \n* Diseño de estrategias para ganar partidas que no necesariamente te obligan o hacen que dependas de las otras personas\n* Los mapas se generan de forma aleatoria lo que hace que no puedas memorizarlos para tener una ventaja, cada partida es una experiencia un poco diferente\n* Tutoriales muy sencillos que te hacen entender la lógica del juego muy rápidamente.\n* Elementos sorpresa como baúles, el uso de casillas, factor niebla que pueden ayudarte o afectarte en cada partida.\n\nEN CONTRA\n* Aún tiene algunos bugs, gráficos y de jugabilidad, personajes que quedan flotando o aun después de haber escapado los colocas como si hubiesen muerto\n* La historia así como los factores que hacen diferentes a cada personaje no es clara dentro del juego se debe investigar por fuera para saber quien es cada uno y por que están ahí\n* Poca cantidad de mapas aunque tienen la extensión adecuada después de un tiempo te acostumbras y le quita un poco de tensión al juego.\n\nEn resumen es un videojuego que vale bastante la pena no es tan costoso y si te generara horas y horas de diversión, si miras vídeos en youtube sobre el juego te vas a encontrar con miles y miles de experiencias diferentes, un recomendado total, espero que este pequeño análisis te sirva, gracias.","timestamp_created":1469827942,"timestamp_updated":1469827942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.711801767349243164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24603227","author":{"steamid":"76561198253379577","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1196,"last_played":1503028920},"language":"english","review":"Game will not stop freezing, I have to power off my system because it won't fucking fix itself.

When someone got me down, I was stuck behind it and the killer couldn't get me. I crouch over and over and eventually got out and won the game.
