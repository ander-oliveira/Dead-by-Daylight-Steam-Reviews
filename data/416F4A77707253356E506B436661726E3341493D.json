I've also introduced many friends to this game and they love it as much as I do.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most are the simple and intuitive game mechanics. There are no special key combos to master and you can actually focus entirely on your game play strategy. Combining perks from the different characters allows you to further improve your strategy. Each game lasts anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, and though you get a few jump scares from time to time: it's nothing to be afraid of. \n\nBecause it a multiplayer game, no two games are identical. As with any other multiplayer game, you sometimes be paired with an annoying other player or two. Luckily the game end quickly and you can move on to the next one. Playing with friends definitely makes it all the more enjoyable.\n\nThe developer has published fixes, improvement and new content every other month since I have started playing it, continually improving the game in itself and continually adding to the already vast roster of characters and killers. The game would however, benefit from the addition of a few more maps.\n\nWhat the game itself still lacks is a reward system for players that achieve high monthly rankings or reach higher devotion levels. Most aesthetic character changes must be purchased with real money and aren't either visually pleasing or even practical. You may also encounter a player with a specific skin that you like, but won't be able to obtain yourself because it is no longer unlockable.","timestamp_created":1620158334,"timestamp_updated":1620158334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91438646","author":{"steamid":"76561199125228487","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3801,"last_played":1657813633},"language":"english","review":"1 out of 10","timestamp_created":1620158268,"timestamp_updated":1620158268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91438626","author":{"steamid":"76561198982073930","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":20207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1779,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1660164947},"language":"english","review":"POGG","timestamp_created":1620158244,"timestamp_updated":1620158244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91438297","author":{"steamid":"76561198147274735","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20368,"last_played":1637192530},"language":"russian","review":"this game is suitable for the first time to feel a thick male **** in ur ass.

The problems are only really noticeable to people who understand many of the games mechanics and, if possible, master them.\n\nGraphically, it is coming along better, with each rework to a map coming out between seasonal updates, and most maps now feel like a genuine horror movie, some better than others. Even the music is made with a vision in mind for each killer, giving them chase songs that fit their themes and backstories, with lore you can unlock from challenges in the archives giving the game more meaning and goals you can set for yourself as you master the game over time from both the survivors and killers sides.\n\nWhile the game gets full marks for just looking and sounding good, gameplay wise its a bit of a hit and miss. You get a selection of items, perks and offerings through a bloodweb you can get bloodpoints for by just playing the game, letting you build your survivors/killers as you see fit before unlocking their teachable perks, which allow you to use those perks on the other characters bloodwebs to give you a variety of playstyles from meme builds to actually viable goals. The problem is a lot of perks are locked behind DLC, and if you dont want to pay for them, there is the shrine of secrets which cycles in 2 survivor and 2 killer perks every 7 days, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if it didn't show the same perks more often than not, and can only obtained through a second currency which you get for every account level.\n\nA bigger problem this game suffers from are the perk balances, some perks are just straight up useless, being so situational that you'd have to either have a friend to help coordinate to even use the perk, others being absolute safety nets for survivors that help them get away for free most of the time. The game in its current state is super survivor sided, half of the killer roster have trouble getting 4k's consistently, even in the right hands the random choice of maps, types of pallets (and the new addition of breakable walls) make it difficult for killers to get their footing before the first two gens are done. While it isn't to say you cant completely style on survivors as often as possible, its hard to have fun as killer sometimes and its often frustrating, leading to dealing with toxicity that the games community inherently has. It isn't the entire community, but it happens enough (in my experience).\n\nAnd to close this off, I don't think the developers understand the game they're making sometimes. The recent change (as of the writing of this review) to Lucky Break says that to me, making it broken and easy to just end the chase by running away after the initial speed boost from getting hit. And despite community trying to communicate with the people behind dead by daylight, its difficult to reach a middle ground where we can all be happy, as some changes they enact always have a drawback to something else, like a nerf in one aspect of a perk will mean they'll buff either a different aspect, or an unrelated perk. Where we want meta changes to give this game a breath of fresh air for a change, they want to change the HUD when it was just fine the way it was (yes I'm still petty about that)\n\nAll and all, I dont want to recommend this game solely on the fact that I'm just burnt out with BHVR and their decisions that annoy me, and the design of the game gets more and more shaky with bugs, hit detection, map design and perk changes nobody really wanted. It just isn't fun anymore.","timestamp_created":1620157545,"timestamp_updated":1620157545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437948","author":{"steamid":"76561199046290485","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8455,"last_played":1659137836},"language":"spanish","review":"divertidisimo el juego muy completo","timestamp_created":1620157462,"timestamp_updated":1620157462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437918","author":{"steamid":"76561199094861372","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1536,"last_played":1625253529},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun, I could play for hours.","timestamp_created":1620157432,"timestamp_updated":1620157432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437889","author":{"steamid":"76561198318467106","num_games_owned":586,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":25517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":437,"playtime_at_review":11868,"last_played":1660367146},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bueno","timestamp_created":1620157407,"timestamp_updated":1620157407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437864","author":{"steamid":"76561198873420938","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2243,"last_played":1657654741},"language":"english","review":"is good","timestamp_created":1620157378,"timestamp_updated":1620157378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437850","author":{"steamid":"76561199115787611","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":13814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1850,"last_played":1658550477},"language":"english","review":"not sussy","timestamp_created":1620157362,"timestamp_updated":1620157362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437802","author":{"steamid":"76561198047445993","num_games_owned":704,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":33627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1468,"playtime_at_review":6084,"last_played":1660577638},"language":"english","review":"let me see swf so i can dodge them as killer and as a survivor, im tired of them ruining this game and incompetent devs refusing to do anything about it.","timestamp_created":1620157309,"timestamp_updated":1658017632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485553771257400513","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437742","author":{"steamid":"76561199122014084","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5968,"last_played":1659239301},"language":"english","review":"gud\n","timestamp_created":1620157247,"timestamp_updated":1620157247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91437741","author":{"steamid":"76561198087918909","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":69647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":278,"playtime_at_review":44985,"last_played":1660602120},"language":"russian","review":"Stop playing killer after October update","timestamp_created":1620157244,"timestamp_updated":1634736600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwprS5nPkCfarn3AI="}
