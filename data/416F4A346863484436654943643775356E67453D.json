Частые обновления и добавления в игру новых вещей не дают заскучать.\n\nМинусы: комьюнити. Весь поднимаемый шум по поводу неиграбельности Dead by Daylight происходит именно из-за части игроков. Они не умеют проигрывать, не желают понять других игроков, тем самым портя раунд и игру. Баланс тоже оставляет желать лучшего - к высшему рангу может попасть низший, и наоборот. Ну и вишенкой на торте- использование маньяка и его ПК как хост-сервер для раунда. Некоторые умные хосты намеренно понижают качество соединения в игре, чтобы упростить себе жизнь, что тоже не красит игру. Баги, незначительные и чаще всего возникающие по вине багоюзеров, не портящие игровой процесс, но всё же баги.\n\nОбщий итог: со стороны разработчика всё выполнено в лучшем виде, игра развивается и не забывается после первых 20-50 часов, проведённых в ней. Всё остальное возложено на игроков, на их отношение к миру игры. Игра определённо стоит своих денег, позволяет отрешиться от реального мира с его проблемами и погрузиться в Атмосферу.

This game is always very repetitive with the only changes being map decor and killer tactics, there was always very little in the way of variation, but it worked for Dead by Daylight.\nThe emblem change was a fantastic idea in that you get credited based on your preformance, rather than just shoving your in game currency and rank into one mechanic. However, coming from being a fairly decent survivor in the past, now unless you play selfishly and decide to absolutely screw over your teamates you will only get a safety pip (if any). There have been games where I have rescued all survivors off of the hooks and done all but one generator solo but still didn't get a pip towards ranking up. The game punished survivor mains when its a 4-1 ratio to be able to play the game. If a killer leaves the survivors get punished, if a survivor leaves the killer gets a quitter bonus. This leads to survivors being hard stuck at rank 16-20 while killers can pip just by playing the game while survivors have to try-hard and play selfishly to get anything.\nWith this theres killer mains who can decide to face camp, which literally prevents survivors from being able to get altruism points throughout the game. This also prevents pipping uip, and the killer can still rank up while face camping. This game is catering to the 20% (the killers) and is making it not even worth playing if you want to be a survivor.\n\nIf you want a game you can feel accomplished in, main killer and never touch survivor.","timestamp_created":1524110137,"timestamp_updated":1524110137,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41564940","author":{"steamid":"76561198044334013","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10991,"last_played":1657315573},"language":"english","review":"This game was honestly a super fun game.

It's so one sided and unbalanced it super stressful and that's really dissapointing. With all the new killer perks it completely ruins the the stealth portion of the game, and you can't do much else. You can't outrun the killer because, depsite what anyone says, the killers ARE infact, faster. The killer's also seem to think that it's unfair that the survivors can even run at all, no matter how bad you nerf the survivors it's never enough, and I think the game develpers are listening to the wrong people.

This game has developers who actively disregard the opinions of the community. The ego on these devs to think that every decision they make is gold and everyone else just doesn't know better. Claiming that a small update every 1.5 months is a \"break neck pace\". They actively lie to the community and make ridiculous excuses to divert the uninformed away from the problems that plague this game.\n\nAs a long time member of this community I simply say this. Don't buy this game until the devs fix these problems. Now I don't mean buffing or nerfing anything in particular. I mean fixing the communication issues that allow for two completely different responses to come out on if people will get banned for a visual bug. Fixing the ignorance they have to the communities hatred of the new Hud. Fixing the lies they spew about how they \"want to see how console players like the Hud\" or that they can't ever bring back the old Hud because they \"changed it on the back end\" which means they would've literally deleted every previous version of the game for no reason. Fixing the process by which you make changes at all, by simply having a small team of trusted community members that can give ideas and feedback on changes. (which you already have a program like that it's called your FOG WHISPERS, but you never let them give feedback so what's the point anyway?). And fixing the staff like Almo, who actively insulted and ignored colorblind players, causing the company to panic and go on massive damage control.\n\nThis all frustrates me because I know these devs can do great things, but with no competitions pushing them to do better they have no incentive to improve of listen.

Разработчики вместо того, чтобы как-то привлечь новых игроков или же заработать больше денег, банят старых игроков без предупреждения, не на время, например на месяц, а навсегда, и причину бана не скажут, как будто её нет. Так же были забанены 2 моих друга и всё так же без причины. Если короче, то если вам игра очень понравилась и месяцами задротите только в неё, то ждите бана, чтобы купить игру снова.\nЕсть ещё причины, почему игру я не рекомендую. Во-первых очень долгое ожидание в лобби. Если вы решили сыграть за убийцу, то советую приготовить чай или что-нибудь поесть, так как ждать выживших придётся очень долго (на рангах 20-10, иногда было и на 9-6). Если вы не хотите играть за убицу, значит придётся готовить систему охлаждения для заднего прохода, так как в игре много д**илов (Кемперы, фейс кемперы, лагсвитчеры - особые дегенераты общества, которые ни как не дадут вам выйграть). Во-вторых баги, множество багов в этой игре. Например: был и есть баг с решающим ударом персонажа Лори Строуд, когда вы 10 раз попали по нужной зоне в проверке реакции, но ничего не произошло. Или уже новый баг с перком Адама Френсиса \"Освобождение\", когда ты безопасно снял человека с крюка и у тебя засветился перк, то с ним сам должен без помощи других выживших слезть с крюка, но это же DbD, на каждой игре перк будет включаться, но сам ты слезь не сможешь, никогда. И ещё 1 баг, который сюществует в DbD очень давно - это \"3 чела в лобби\". Когда в лобби убийцы сидят 3 выживших и ждут 4, но 4-й не зайдёт, он просто не сможет попасть в это лобби.","timestamp_created":1524027465,"timestamp_updated":1539459021,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41549692","author":{"steamid":"76561198330883394","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":6584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2990,"last_played":1658843275},"language":"schinese","review":"第一次玩的时候我选的9妹，然后我被追的拔网线了，然后剩下的将近50个小时我都在玩屠夫...","timestamp_created":1524026702,"timestamp_updated":1524026702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41549254","author":{"steamid":"76561198104113886","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1529140055},"language":"schinese","review":"我这个人很实在的，只要有官中汉化，我都会好评。而且网易搞得哪个第五人格是个什么垃圾东西？","timestamp_created":1524023383,"timestamp_updated":1524023383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563997805118560791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41549182","author":{"steamid":"76561198276132418","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":29618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1970,"last_played":1646455304},"language":"brazilian","review":"mt bom","timestamp_created":1524022830,"timestamp_updated":1524022830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41548901","author":{"steamid":"76561198097887629","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5657,"last_played":1654465628},"language":"english","review":"In its present form, I do not recommend Dead By Daylight.\n\nThe developers have instituted a massive change with the addition of emblems and it is NOT a good change. You can recognize that by the amount of low rank people you now see. I can't remember the last time I came across anyone with a rank beyond level 15. Prior to the update I saw a variety of ranks but now it's basically all 17-20. That should tell you that either the entirety of your playerbase is really bad...OR...your scoring system is absurd. I'll side with the latter.\n\nThe survivor side is ludicrous! Why should I have to intentionally expose myself to the killer or stay in their radius to get points towards an emblem that affects my rank? I should be skillfully evading the killer around the map and focusing on objectives! I've completed 3 gens before and still only received a Silver ranking for Lightbringer...WTF!? This new ranking system is totally flawed - especially for survivors. This is coming from someone who never pallet loops or uses map advantages against the killer..I run, I try to break line of sight and hide - the way the game is intended to be played. I'll admit I'm not that great - but by playing the game the proper way (ie. not exploiting)  I still would manage to at least get to rank 16. Now I can't even get off 20.\n\nAs another reviewer pointed out, this game is balanced poorly. The killer has an awful time playing, especially against people on Survive With Friends mode. One person can lead the killer around over and over in a circle and barely get caught, while everyone else does gens. If the killer leaves that person to go try to find the others, then that person will run off to do a gen. So it's lose/lose. The game, at present, when looking objectively, makes survivors more powerful than killers and that simply makes no sense when it's 4v1. The only killer who I'd say has a great chance at map control and keeping pressure on survivors is the Nurse and she is considered a difficult killer.\n\nUntil changes are made, this game will continue to suffer and the community will leave. So I suggest fixing things properly - adjust the balance so that survivors can't exploit the map and pallet loop/infinite without consequence. Consider removing SWF or making it a mode that is not for ranking, because there is no way to ensure outside comms are not being used (this game was intended to be about feeling isolated and unable to communicate with people beyond the 2 gestures provided). If something isn't done soon, it might be too late and by the time you make changes your community will be gone and won't give you the undeserved second chance. Having put money in for the original game as well as 4 DLC, I feel ripped off, to be honest.","timestamp_created":1524020761,"timestamp_updated":1524020761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533482134342193604","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41548287","author":{"steamid":"76561198155266922","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2449,"last_played":1608130224},"language":"schinese","review":"朴实的农场主与4个狡猾的偷电贼的故事","timestamp_created":1524016357,"timestamp_updated":1524016357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41548280","author":{"steamid":"76561198096976455","num_games_owned":440,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":11920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1941,"last_played":1658467369},"language":"english","review":"If you want a game that has been absolutely eradicated by the passage of time, here it is.

Все равно заебет. Дело в однотипности. Маньяки на высоких рангах одни и те же. С перками в аддонами такая же тема. Так же со стороны маньяка. 4 адреналина и прочее. Это не вина игроков, а скорее разрабов. Гемплей на красных рангах за суров скатывается тупо в генраш, ибо если ты не успел завести, то вы сосете. Так что будьте готовы к бомбежке из-за кемпинга,туннелинга и генраша. А проще говоря, не идите дальше 10-го ранга, ниже разнообразия - нет. Я предупредил.","timestamp_created":1523993833,"timestamp_updated":1561354149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41543758","author":{"steamid":"76561198142540301","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":45854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21474,"last_played":1655695694},"language":"thai","review":"+","timestamp_created":1523990893,"timestamp_updated":1523990893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41543624","author":{"steamid":"76561198104601426","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":218,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1583955625},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo bom....mas faltou finalizacoes.","timestamp_created":1523990261,"timestamp_updated":1523990261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41543488","author":{"steamid":"76561198345913464","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1683,"last_played":1647964031},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego en sí esta bien pero le falta que cuando juegues con amigos te deriven otra vez al mismo grupo no que te pongan de forma individual, un formato de mejora en las rankeds para que sea mas competitivo y otra para la gente que solo quiera jugar normales para entretenarse por lo demas bien aunque de vez en cuando te encuentras algún camper.\nRecomiendo comprarlo si lo juegas con amigos sino no lo hagas.","timestamp_created":1523989676,"timestamp_updated":1523989676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41542375","author":{"steamid":"76561198449068893","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1361,"last_played":1598252162},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME its all about the thrills and wits of the survivor before the killer finds them and its like a complicated and exciting hide n seek but no matter what role you are you still have to have your gaurds up as the survivors have few but unpredictable ways\n of messing up the killers plan and speed","timestamp_created":1523985023,"timestamp_updated":1523985023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41542218","author":{"steamid":"76561198120626028","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1480424848},"language":"schinese","review":"就这一堆DLC就给差评，工作室的吃相太难看了！恶心到我了！","timestamp_created":1523984451,"timestamp_updated":1523984451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.355789989233016968","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41541798","author":{"steamid":"76561198289124463","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5450,"last_played":1591037801},"language":"english","review":"There are many Camper from china in this game. lol","timestamp_created":1523982641,"timestamp_updated":1524077239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438596516847610474","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41541637","author":{"steamid":"76561198334211279","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":62726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54780,"last_played":1654691558},"language":"schinese","review":"就凭开发商对玩家的态度。这款游戏我会支持到最后。","timestamp_created":1523982006,"timestamp_updated":1523982006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41541460","author":{"steamid":"76561198297880746","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":60352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15699,"last_played":1613169361},"language":"english","review":"It was fun they said.\n6 months ago IT WAS !
