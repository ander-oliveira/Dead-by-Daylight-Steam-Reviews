It was everything you could have asked for in a horror game. I remember crapping my pants for the first 100 hours every time I heard a heartbeat. Then things got easier, I got better, I leveled my guys up, and I started wreaking havoc as killer. I began enjoying myself more and more.\n\nSure, things were glitchy then too. But there was nothing truly gamebreaking. Hell, some of the glitches were even funny too, such as the old glitch where as Hillbilly you could chainsaw into the side of a harvester and be shot up into the sky. Others were useful, such as the oldest so-called glitch in the game that was recently removed (which prompted me to stop playing this game) where the Hillbilly could turn his chainsaw at the end of his chainsaw sprint. This tactic itself is, as every truly skilled Hillbilly knows, indispensable to excellent gameplay with him. Now, guess what's coming up soon? The devs are going to shorten the lunge of killers and prevent you from turning at the end of them. Great, now every survivor can just walk around you and avoid your swing. Thanks!\n\nThe point is, these devs pretend to care about the community by posting incessant stupid updates with un-thought-out new content (such as the disastrous new DLC which is so broken it hurts) and making \"balancing changes\" where they go from one extreme to the other, instead of making the much-needed minor tweaks necessary, and removing glitches that literally nobody complains about while neglecting to fix issues that were actually detrimental to game performance and fairness.\n\nAs always, this is a classic case of cheap developers looking to capitalize short-term on a brilliant idea that should have been developed over the long-term and done RIGHT. Instead, they decided to opt for short-term profit at the expense of quality.\n\nI'm going to be sad to see this game go, but I will if I have to. Oh well, Friday the 13th beta comes out tomorrow, so that'll be my new fancy!","timestamp_created":1482134228,"timestamp_updated":1482134228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540498793125152588","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28463308","author":{"steamid":"76561198341671064","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":20111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1656021316},"language":"russian","review":"good","timestamp_created":1482133988,"timestamp_updated":1482133988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482926815748214722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28463301","author":{"steamid":"76561198156101614","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":822,"last_played":1576618646},"language":"czech","review":"Best game +steam level","timestamp_created":1482133959,"timestamp_updated":1482133959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28463231","author":{"steamid":"76561198293724778","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":41257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38389,"last_played":1657872862},"language":"russian","review":"Спасибо разрабы за все слитые бабки людей на скины в том числе и мои которые теперь совершенно бесплатны.

I have about 30 hours on record.  Have 1 Survivor sitting at Level 31 only made it to rank 19 as a survivor but have a more firm understanding of the ins and outs of the game (I'm just not amazing at it):\n\nSo here is my breakdown of the Good, Bad, and Ugly:\n\nGood:\n- Game is super easy to learn and play.  No steep learning curve (Good for us old guys)\n- Graphics and level of detail is on par with some of the top line games.\n- Ability to play with friends has been added, so you can enjoy surviving with or killing off your friends.\n- Leveling up system is unique from most games where you use points you've earned from games to collect items on a \"Blood Web\".  These items are perks or items that are used for your killer or suvivor in future games.  Once all items from the Level 1 \"Blood Web\" are collected, you become level 2 and a new \"Blood Web\" appears and so on and so forth.  Each Survivor and Killer is leveled up individually.\n- Killers are fairly balanced across the board.  Although the person playing the Killer can make the game not fun through camping bodies on the hook or placing traps under the feet so the rescuing survivor has no chance at rescuing.  Everyone knows the rule, if the Killer is camping the bodies, everyone run for the other engines to get them running.  But, for the person on the hook it makes for a very boring and frustrating game.\n\nBad:\n- The player base tends to lean more on the unfriendly side, giving it that League of Legends community feel to it (Name calling before the game, foul language, cursing at each other, talking crap after a match, etc.). \n- (Some may consider this good or bad) The ranking up system is very difficult and tedious and im not sure the ranking system has any major effects aside from bragging rights.  The ranking system works on bloodpoints earned in a match and you are ranked seperately as a Killer and Survivor.  The way the system works is this:  Your earned bloodpoints are calculated at the end of a match which fills a meter with 3 \"diamonds\" along it (checkpoints in essence).  The first \"diamond\" is black.  If you get enough blood points to reach this point, you don't gain or lose any rank marks.  The 2nd and 3rd \"diamonds\" are white.  If you earn enough points in a match to reach them you will fill 1 or 2 empty rank circles, respectively.  You have to fill all 3 circles to reach the next highest rank, 20 -> 19 -> 18 -> etc, etc. Most match wins will get you high enough to reach the first lit \"diamond\", filling 1 rank circle and meaning you will have to win 3 times in a row to rank up 1 time (Sounds easier then it is).  If you don't win (and you die pretty early in the match, normally you won't even reach the first black \"diamond\" which means you lose 1 filled circle from your rank (if you had any).  If you were rank 19 with no circles filled, you move back to 20 with 2 filled circles.  So, as you can see you need to continuously win or at least score enough points in a match to not lose any rank.  So, to those guys who are rank 1, congrats because its extremely difficult to do.  I can say personally my survivor was level 31 before i each reached rank 19.\n\nUgly:\n- The queing system is incredibly unstable.  You might be fine getting in a game for 5 games, but then the next few games you'll keep getting \"Failed to Join Server\" messages.  \n- \"Failed to Join Server\" messages appear quite often and it means the game has frozen on you.  The only fix is to close the game through your Task Manager and reload the game to try to requeue, taking the chance that the same thing happens again. \n-During Survive with Friends, you occasionally find yourself having 3-5 Min queue wait times (For what reason, I don't know).  \n- Once in a game, if any player doesn't \"Ready\", you will be stuck on a long loading screen and you will either have to wait it out (Approx 2-3 min) or you have to close out the game again through the Task Manager. (This happens quite often).  The reason for this is that a player has just dropped from the game, and the game has to wait for him/her to timeout and you are now without 1 (or more) survivors in a match.  With teamwork being an essential part of being able to win against a Killer, losing anyone from a game can make it a lot more difficult. Losing 1 person is still doable, but 2 or all 3 more makes it nearly impossible.  Most just drop from the game and requeue for another match.\n\n\nOverall this is a fun game to play.  As you can see, there are very frustating things with the game that need to be tweaked to make the game perfect, but if you are looking for something fun and simple to play with friends or even with random strangers, this is the game for you.\n\nRated 8/10.","timestamp_created":1482132594,"timestamp_updated":1482820291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28463045","author":{"steamid":"76561198212787243","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1754,"last_played":1658745109},"language":"thai","review":"เกมสนุก","timestamp_created":1482132291,"timestamp_updated":1646674042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28462994","author":{"steamid":"76561198045279564","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1575365265},"language":"russian","review":"Не плохая игра для веселья с друзьями.","timestamp_created":1482131907,"timestamp_updated":1482131907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28462701","author":{"steamid":"76561198340899150","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1675,"last_played":1641643816},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра для любителей острых ощущений!

If nothing else, I would say that you'll find it more unbalanced with some approaches vs others. One thing that I will say is that there's 1 MAP (I think it was the asylum) that annoyed me because it made it far too easy for the killer. He had a clear line of sight to a hook I was on from almost the other end of the map, & just stood there waiting for someone to try taking me off. My opinion, that's a bit cheap. There's also still the much loved issue of killers that wimp out when the survivors are about to win, shutting the game down in the process as the killer always hosts. That's fun.\n\nTo me, the most glaring issues are technical ones & I wasn't playing for long before I started seeing all kinds of bugs. Matchmaking is frequently a tremendous pain when it goes to a grey screen when I click join a lobby, & just permanently hangs there. I can't back out or do anything & I have to ctrl+alt+del & manually kill the process, re-start the game & hope it doesn't happen again... & it happens a LOT. Hell the game itself doesn't even start properly. It only seems to semi-launch or something, because I have to click or press a key otherwise it just hangs on a black screen for eternety.\n\nI applaud the devs for adding so much new content since release, but they're doing so while ignoring a lot of issues that range from minor annoyances to completely game breaking. They really need to look into the technical problems, move on to addressing things like having a penalty for people that avoid finishing a game so they don't lose.... THEN worry about new content.\n\nIf you're not bothered by the bugs, go for it, but I can't in good conscience reccomend this in it's current state. The game itself is a fantastic concept & incredibly enjoyable.... WHEN IT WORKS, but there are still too many problems that cause it to become an exercise in frustration & tedium.","timestamp_created":1482128183,"timestamp_updated":1482142285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504040837287902832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28462229","author":{"steamid":"76561198007092090","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":2718,"last_played":1660532413},"language":"english","review":"Game

I planned on playing it for the free weekend for some free entertainment. \nI played over 13 hours of this game during the free weekend. It was insanely addicting. \n\nAs survivor, the game is pretty intense, hide and seek, cat and mouse, no weapons to defend yourself so you need to out-think the killer to repair the gens, open the gate and survive the night. As survivor, I highly recommend playing with friends with voice connection so you can communicate- sharing screams and laughter as the killer hunts you down.\n\nAs killer, the game is equally intense. New survivors can be easy prey for cheap thrills. Veteran survivors test your skill, as they will have perks that allow them the occasional burst of speed or equipment such as flashlights to blind you temporarily (so you walk backwards towards brave survivors, turn around and swat 'em)\n\nEach match is relatively unique. You face different people with different strategies both as killer and survivor. Different people have different perks, which give them different strengths, bolstering different strategies. I had a match where I was killer, and someone had gone around and taken down all my hooks in one corner of the map- so they would always wiggle free before I could get to the other side. They also had perks allowing them to sprint at 150% speed every 40 seconds, so dropping them generally meant they escaped. \n\nThe equipment you have as a survivor is lost on death. Big incentive to stay alive- maybe even motivation enough to abandon your fellow survivor for the sake of keeping your medkit or toolbox. \n\nKiller gets 'add ons' to their ability that always disappear at the end of each match. So you have to be somewhat successful each match to continue getting random buffs from the blood web (a tech tree style of exchanging earned blood points for item add ons)\n\nThe community, at the time of this review, are mostly fun people. The occasional troll, such as people with nasty comments at the end of a match, to be expected on the internet, but far fewer than other games I've played. Also one game a survivor AFK'd for 40 minutes hiding in a box somewhere on the map, which was infurating but hey, one bad match vs 30-40 fun ones. \n\nSome downsides: the server went down for a few hours unexpectedly during the free weekend. \noccassionally I got a loading error that seems to be common knowledge among the community, but it affects maybe 1/10 games where I need to restart the client to continue playing. \n\"Cheesy\" strategies such as fence hopping back and forth, or camping survivor after you have them hooked are an inevitible part of the game, and whiny drama insues on the forums considering these \"exploits.\"\nHonestly the only thing I would change is maybe having an afk timer because 40 minutes of searching the woods for someone hiding in a box was seriously frustrating. \nOther than that, the game is perfect*\nThe killers have their own intimidating form of scariness, the survivors have their own style of how best to survive, the cat and mouse gameplay is invigorating, and the climax of a takedown is orgasmic. \n\n'nuff said: buy this game, it's awesome.","timestamp_created":1482113347,"timestamp_updated":1482113347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28459791","author":{"steamid":"76561198088630363","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":48545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":20,"playtime_at_review":26713,"last_played":1659675043},"language":"english","review":"I said I would change this review if they fixed this issue, and they did, so I have.

At $20 this is a great game.    I'm buying it at $14.   I played it for free over the fre trial weekend and it worked.  I was hooked.....  : 0   \n\nYou play as either a survivor or the killer.   I was surprised when I que as a survivor and I had to wait to get in a loby.  I figured everyone would want to play as the killer.    Then I started to play as a killer and found game more quickly.   And my preference is to be the killer.   I would suggest hillbilly for newer killers.   Try survivor a few times to get the jest of the game down.   \n\nOver all I had a lot of fun once I figured out how to play.   Took 2 games.   I wish steam had a 1-10 scale instead of up or down.   I would give this game a 7.    Most the game is rinse repeat but that could be resolved with new objectives and maps if they plan to add more in the future.

However, the lack of support for game-breaking issues since it's release makes me give it a negative review.\n\nFor starters, the Solo Survivor does not work. You must go around it by using Survive With Friends and Escape from the in-game overlay and then click Ready in order to start searching for lobbies.\n\n After doing so, you may join a lobby, but 80% of the time you will be thrown back to a menu screen. There is a Join A Lobby button. It also does not work. If you choose it, you will get a bouncing logo, which is an endless loop that will not stop. This also applies to Quick Play at the main menu. \n\nYou cannot back out, you cannot Alt+F4. You can only CTRL+ALT+DEL and close the game manually via Task Manager. Then, you can relaunch the game and try again. So, Solo, Quick Play and Join A Lobby are broken and have been since Day 1.  That was June 14 2016. It's going on February 2017. Any questions? Good! Moving forward.\n\nNow, let's say you launch the game and select SWF (Survive With Friends). Select friends to play with or Escape out to Ready up for Solo Survival. Make sure your friends are in the party before clicking Ready or you will have to repeat the process. (Or them)\nNow that you and your friends (if any) are in the party, it's time to ready up and begin searching. This is where you either wait for 6-10 minutes before joining a party or you get a loading screen that ejects you from the party and sends you back to the main menu. \nOnce again, you must repeat the process. You will do this 7 out of 10 times, guaranteed.\n\nNow let's say you get into an actual lobby (hosted by the killer). You won't know who the killer is until the match is over, but that's not important. If the killer decides to not play, you will be ejected back to the main menu where the process will have to be repeated again for joining a party and a lobby.... Painful, right? There's more!\n\nIf you're in the lobby and not all people are ready, you can chat to them. Are they there? Probably not. They are most likely in the infinite loading screen (as stated above) and they do not know they are in that lobby. They cannot Ready Up. \n\nWhen 4 players are present (whether they are actually there or not won't matter) The Timer will count to 0:00 and thus launch the match. If only 3 people are ready, the 4th will cause the game to show the loading screen to Ready Players until he/she is either dropped from the match or they have manually closed the game, in turn allowing the match to proceed with 3 survivors. \n\nIf only 2 are ready and the other two are on hiatus, the wait will be longer and you may even be thrown back to the main menu and have to begin the process all over again. Yes, again.\nRemember the timer counting to 0:00? If all players are ready, the timer will jump to 0:05 and continue to 0:00 and the game will start. Maybe. If all players are NOT ready, my suggestion to you is to leave the lobby at 0:10 and begin searching for a new lobby all over again. Yes, again.\n\nIsn't this fun!? I know, right? We haven't even played the game yet and we've already spent 15-20 minutes just trying to get it started!","timestamp_created":1482107780,"timestamp_updated":1485679660,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28458582","author":{"steamid":"76561198351487345","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":133096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1699,"last_played":1574933797},"language":"schinese","review":"很好","timestamp_created":1482107456,"timestamp_updated":1482107456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoKGfitkCduXHbA=="}
