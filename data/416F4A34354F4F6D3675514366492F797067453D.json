I know I'm not some \"DbD VeTErEn\" with copious hours to say how the game has changed over time, but there's problems that get in the way of making it a great asymetrical multiplayer game. I would only pick this up if you're able to play with friends when playing as a survivor, which is the only circumstance that I bought it. \n\nFrom the survivors' perspective, this game feels just bad for the majority of the time I've spent on it. Queuing solo is the worst way to play a survivor. There is no way to communicate with other survivors in-game with the exception of only two emotes to \"follow me\" and point (so if you play with a novice player, there's no kind of direction that you or others can give to them in order to help out the rest of the survivors). Although the experience of getting matched with constantly horrible teammates is from my perspective, it seems consistant with what others have said about this game. Killers and their annoyance can vary greatly, but the more experienced killer mains popped up than novice killers;   some of the dlc killers feel more cheap in their abilities, especially players that have commited to using them ie pay to win. The largest complaint towards killers are the fact that some player just love camping and there's really no good way of rescueing another player. Sometimes it just feels as if every killer I played against for a time had the most annoying perks on, which felt like a constant string of games where I'd be killed swiftly regardless if I was playing cautiously. \n\nPlaying as killers on the other hand feels for the most part fine, as in no new player is going to dominate over survivors from the start. It does take time to get decent in order to be a good killer. Playing as killers feels like there's at least some learning curb, while survivors on the other hand feel really punished by actions of toxic survivors and killers. There are more than enough times to play as a lone survivor with no generators done because of either incompitent survivors, or (mainly) killers that have wiped out anyone that can get enough generators to get a hatch to appear on the map (in these senarios, which is easy for killers to patrol undone generators making the task of escaping nil to slim).\n\nWhat really hurts this game is the part of the player base that I've played with, most of them being toxic. I do like how it's a horror movie themed game, plus it's a funner experience when playing with friends. You're playing Rainbow Six Siege toxic 2.0 electric horror boogaloo minus a voice and text chat. For the people that say \"Oh YoU CAn PlAy SelFisH aAnD EsCapE\" or \"YoUr NOt SuPPoSe To WiN EvERy TiMe\" or \"YoU HaVeNt SPeNt EnOuGh TiMe WaTchIng YOuTubE StRAt VidEoS\", there's plenty of multiplayer games that have a much better sense of balancing and learning regardless whether or not it's an \"asymetrical\" multiplayer game. In a compitent game, if I loose I can change how I play and eventually win at some point because I learned, which is an occurance I have never had with this game especially when considering the survivor gameplay. Bad killer = a really good chance you'll escape, good killer = quit the game there's no way to outsmart them because of the game's perk system and killer's abilities. Only buy this game during a sale and when you have three other friends ready to play DBD with you when playing a survivor. Or better yet, play gmod murder. Playing with friends is the only way that I've managed to get almost 50 hours out of the game.","timestamp_created":1532600922,"timestamp_updated":1532608202,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487947076559066772","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43754697","author":{"steamid":"76561198144128492","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":12463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2789,"last_played":1652538962},"language":"english","review":"LOBBY SIMULATOR\nBut is so good","timestamp_created":1532600471,"timestamp_updated":1537647920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539875566959381104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43754691","author":{"steamid":"76561198053218822","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":48435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40387,"last_played":1617047473},"language":"english","review":"I have played this game for a long time now, almost 2 years, it had it's ups and downs but right now you can finally see the devs going in the right direction of balance.

First-off let me say that when you buy Dead by Daylight you essentially get two games for the price of one. You can play as a murderous killer or a cunning survivor. Each game mode has drastically different playstyles. Whether you're looking for a casual game with friends or the isolated horror experience with strangers that's advertised there's something here for everyone.\n   Play as a survivor and use quick thinking and caution to escape the Entity's trials where random strangers take the roll of one of twelve murderous killers as they chase and hunt you until you're dead. Choose from atheles to average Joes as you learn the ropes of the trials. With procedurally generated character progression your progress will be one of a kind. After reaching the highest level, prestige for rewards and bragging rights as you continue to explore. Experience a game where you find new allies and enemies amongst the other survivors and the killer. With every character controlled by another player you will experience horror like never before.\n   Play as a murderous killer driven to kill by the Entity. Explore the world from the eyes of a beast as you hunt and kill the survivors. Experience a new level of mind games as you anticipate survivor movements to catch more evasive prey. Control the action with the best connection as you host the trial on your turf and your terms. Use a variety of killers, abilities and add-ons to craft a unique horror experience.\n\nNotes:\nThe game is constantly in development, view the development roadmap at Dead by Daylight.com . Killer is locked in first person whereas the survivors are locked in third person. There is an in-game store where cosmetics and killers can be purchased with playtime points.

Меня зовут Дмитрий, и я хочу рассказать вам о такой игре как Dead by Daylight, хотя думаю вы и так это поняли. Обзор будет достаточно объемным и информативным(на мой взгляд), так что усаживайтесь поудобнее и, если хотите, читайте до конца, чтобы сделать для себя вывод: покупать эту игру, или же нет. Хочу также сказать, что у меня было множество аккаунтов с этой игрой и суммарно наиграно у меня в этой игре более 1500 часов.\n\n[h1] ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ [/h1]\n\nГеймплей(игровой процесс) в этой игре оригинален, и похожего вы мало где найдете. Здесь вам предстоит убегать от убийцы, заводить генераторы, изучать историю(по желанию), вешать на крюки выживших, прокачивать своих персонажей, и конечно же... платить за DLC, но это уже отдельная тема. Вообще, геймплей на любителя, не каждый любит кровь и мрачные картины, однако... Эта игра затянула многих, и я в их числе. Затягивает тут то, что локации постоянно разные, а все объекты на карте появляются случайно, и в игре достаточно много персонажей с их уникальными способностями. Кстати, о персонажах. В игре присуствуют убийцы и выжившие, на данный момент выживших, как и убийц, больше 5, и добавляются они каждый сезон(весна, лето, осень, зима).

Though I'm a killer main I do frequently play survivor with my friends every weekend and has been this way for months. Now as most comments recently say this new update Is \"killing the game\" though a common misconception is that the killer would run the game. \n\nSurvivors before pre-patch could determine millions of avenues with certain things that have changed. (You can check patch notes). A further issue that some survivor mains, or really players in the general populus is that the killer shouldn't be OP. You're going to be buying a game that is a 1 v 4. By the logic the killer should be 4x stronger than the survivors making the game exceptionally harder as people would die, where previously 1 death would not effect the team if you had a good runner. Now things and times are more limited and the intensity factor has too be increased.\n\nIf you're reading these comments to the idea of buying the game, don't give any attention to the down voted posts that have been spamming the location as with any update there will be salt and with something so drastic in change you're going to see some people leave and some people stay. The ones who have stayed are adapting to the current game, the ones who are leaving find the game either to far the killers direction or just dont like the patch.\n\nWhat I can tell you though, is give the game a shot.the learning curve at the start will be steep, and will be difficult to climb over with some of the new changes. (this applies to both killer and survivor). It is still very much a great game people just don't like the new ways, and in no way are they bad it's just balancing and with balancing some people have their favorite perks have to be used differently.
