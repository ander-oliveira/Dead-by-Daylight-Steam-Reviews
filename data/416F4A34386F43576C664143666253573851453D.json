my review on this game because between the time I originally wrote this review (Around 200 hours of playtime) and now, i've had far more experience with the game and i'd like to update my review based on that.\n\nDead by Daylight, while being a fun game, is too:\n\nA) Poorly optimised\nB) Poorly balanced\nC) Clunky\n\nto actually be a game you can consistently enjoy. The developers, while doing their best (albeit, not a great 'best') to polish the game and create an experience we can all enjoy, initially made this game as a little fun project that wasn't planning on getting much attention. As a result, the inner workings of this game became a ticking time bomb once DBD gained plenty of attention from the Internet.\n\nWith each update to the game, comes more bugs. They fix one thing, and break another 10. See, this isn't because the developers are incompetent; sometimes the game would receive an update that is received well by the community, and little to no complaints are made. The problem is that the game was very simple in the beginning, but as they continued to pile more and more updates, the coding turned into spaghetti heaven. They can't seem to add new things without breaking everything else, and unfortunately, rebuilding the game from the ground up would take years.\n\nDead by Daylight is known for it's below average optimisation. In this regard, the developers have made significant progress towards the game running smoothly on an array of devices. This is mainly noticed in the new map reworks, the FPS has increased on essentially every platform for these new maps. I appreciate these changes and cannot wait for the graphic overhaul project to be completed. \n\nWhile improving on the performance of the game, the developers have made little to no progress on actually balancing the game. The 'meta' perks have not changed in a long time now, on both sides (although with the introduction of Hex: Undying, the killer meta perks have shifted into something quite tedious, usually dragging games out if the killer is high mobility, such as the Hillbilly, or the Blight.) with their flaws being evident, yet the developers just don't know how to go around them. If you choose not to run the meta perks, you usually end up doing far worse than the rest of your team (Note the word 'usually'; you won't always be outperformed by your team if you choose not to run meta perks).\n\nThe same goes for the Killer side of things, if you choose not to run the meta perks, you are usually overwhelmed by the survivor team due to your lack of slowdown perks or information perks (Save for killers like The Nurse or The Spirit, who are so strong that they essentially play completely different to the rest of the cast).\n\nOnce these issues are addressed + resolved, I dare say that Dead by Daylight could be the perfect asymmetrical horror game. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but with that comes a lot of anguish. There are so many times i've slammed my desk in rage because i've been cheated out of an escape as a survivor, or lost a potential 2 or 3 kills as killer due to the overpowered second chance perks that 95% of the survivor playerbase run every game.\n\nI can't recommend buying this game if you enjoy having consistent fun in your games. You will get angry a lot, and you'll ragequit a lot.","timestamp_created":1581272622,"timestamp_updated":1601647662,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63235250","author":{"steamid":"76561198167945085","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":107779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":655,"playtime_at_review":56033,"last_played":1660603999},"language":"english","review":"I've had this game since it was just released and I'm glad to see it's come such a long way. They've expanded on so much and continue to do so. The game is fun, it captures an almost adrenaline-inducing feeling that feels so rewarding to win because it really does capitalize on player skill so successfully outsmarting someone always feels great. The whole Hide'n'Seek aspect of the game as well as it's constant unpredictable situations keep the game fresh since no AI is involved, it's all PvP. The main three gripes I have with the game though are the constant fluctuations in balance between the two sides which make it so one side will ALWAYS have an inherent advantage, whether it be killers because of a major buff to map layout or survivors for having an overtuned perk to use. It's never fun to constantly have game balance flip back and forth and never really having a \"middle ground\". Secondly and this is as of Feb 9th, 2020, the game has a ranking system which is heavily influenced by ONE specific playstyle for both teams, no matter your skill nor what you accomplish, if you don't accomodate that playstyle favored by the ranking system, your ranking progress will be considerably slower or even nonexistent. Lastly, and certainly most importantly, this game has one of the most toxic cesspools of a community I have ever seen on Steam, it's vile and unforgiving because it's inhabited by people who both treat the game like it's an esport and behave as if the developers owe it to them to take their advice on game balance. This accounts for both sides, killers and survivors, if anything affects them in the slightest such as a certain tool to aid them or a perk, there'll be basically these forum protests which amount to nothing more than temper tantrums. Basically, the community is just outright awful, there's a couple of good people in it but they are far and few between. Great game, Bad Community, and Ugly Game Mechanics.\n\nEdit 2/10/2021:\nI don't know what happened behind the scenes halfway through last year but something happened and this game is currently in a death spiral. Between the half-assed Hallowed Blight event of 2020 and the completely broken and buggy release of both the Binding of Kin chapter and the completely tone-deaf changes implemented in the mid-chapter patch, I have no clue what is happening but this game is being choked. I don't know if the devs have just gotten full of themselves and just change whatever they think is for the better but I can tell you right now that they no longer listen to the playerbase, in fact, they go a step further and prevent you from critiquing them as open discussion and critique of the devs results in a ban. So between tone-deaf devs who clearly just want to run their own show on a asymetrical multiplayer game and a constant flow of patches that seemingly turn the game in a worse direction, I am changing my review to Not Reccomended, this game might've been toxic before but that was just the playerbase, now its the devs too.\n","timestamp_created":1581272596,"timestamp_updated":1612976205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63235090","author":{"steamid":"76561198988218467","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4593,"last_played":1652037911},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра!","timestamp_created":1581272362,"timestamp_updated":1581272362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63235040","author":{"steamid":"76561198974768589","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1607,"last_played":1654378063},"language":"russian","review":"АТЛИЧНА","timestamp_created":1581272312,"timestamp_updated":1581272312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63234795","author":{"steamid":"76561198877902171","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12381,"last_played":1643916926},"language":"english","review":"Great game, especially fun when you can bully the killers","timestamp_created":1581271991,"timestamp_updated":1581271991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63234659","author":{"steamid":"76561198141306172","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2335,"last_played":1612653940},"language":"english","review":"Nah Nah B","timestamp_created":1581271806,"timestamp_updated":1581271806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63234629","author":{"steamid":"76561198134964979","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1593105438},"language":"english","review":"Lenore\nEdgar Allan Poe - 1809-1849\n\nAh broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!\nLet the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;\nAnd, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear?--weep now or never more!\nSee! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!\nCome! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--\nAn anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--\nA dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.\n\n\"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,\n\"And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!\n\"How shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung\n\"By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue\n\"That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?\"\n\nPeccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song\nGo up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong!\nThe sweet Lenore hath \"gone before,\" with Hope, that flew beside\nLeaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--\nFor her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,\nThe life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--\nThe life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.\n\n\"Avaunt! to-night my heart is light.

I've played this game for (only) 12 hours as of writing this. 100 hours later, everything I said might sound stupid retrospectively. But for now? It's pretty gud.\n\nRelatively balanced (at least for now), Gameplay is good, and the community is somewhat nice. It can be very repetitive once you got used to the fear and thrill, but being able to switch between killer and survivors can spice things up a bit. It's a bit grindy, and they do ask for more of your money if you want to obtain a new killer/survivors (at least in a reasonable amount of time), but at least they don't ask an unreasonable amount of money (especially on discount).\n\nThe game can be a bit frustating at times, but for the twelve hours I've played it doesn't seem to me like the killer nor the survivor has a Game breaking advantage/disadvantage. While from a perspective one side can seem better and/or worse than the other, once you tried both of them you'll realize the game IS UNFAIR, but for both sides. Killer can camp and just be a huge dick, but survivors can help each other and can be arseholes. The way for you to win is complete the obj, if you camp that hooked survivors for the entire game, most of the generators would be fixed by then. If the survivors work together the killer is at a very big disadvantage, but the survivors will be at a higher risk of losing the game entirely.\n\nThe visual however is a very hit and miss for me. I confess that I'm an absolute man child that think anime is the best thing ever since sliced bread, thus the artsyle and \"realistic\" character design isn't my forte. But it's at least very on theme. I don't like it because it all looks grim and vile, but that's also kind of the point. It's a very well presented game, but perhaps too well.\n\nThe community and devs are fine. It got some toxic filled corners, as to be expected for an asymmetric game. The game is unfair, that's kind of the point. I did notice some good samaritans once in a while. I also got a lot of DMs (especially when playing killer). The community is still thriving well and good, content can be a bit slow but at least it's still getting update. I have nothing to add in this departement really, I'm just trying to pad out the review.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a solid 8/10\nUnique and fresh gameplay\nEnough content for casual to moderately hardcore player\nNot enough waifus and girls with revealing clothing\nWith a Decent community and
