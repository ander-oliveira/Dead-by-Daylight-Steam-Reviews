Plus whenever they add something or change something, at least 5 things break in the game that shouldn't break if they didn't decide to fuck up the coding of shit that don't need to be touched. If they had an update that just fixed bugs, that update would probably be a whooping 20gb. That's how many bugs are in the damn game.  I don't even know why they have beta tests cuz they literally add all the bugs from the ptb to the release plus they dont listen to community feedback.

Meta Patch] A lot of playtime has passed, my old review didn't age well. So it's time for a new review! So do I recommend this game? ... Yes, but... there is a huge BUT! So fasten your seat belts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride... or was it night? Well anyway, here we go...\n\nNote: This review is aiming towards players that are willing to spend some time in the game. I play this game casually, not competitive.\n\nFirst of all, it's not a bad game. You can have a lot of fun with it. There are lots of things to explore and learn if you play either the survivor or the killer side. My advice: Just don't make the mistake and take interest in just one side because it will narrow your understanding of the game.\n\nAfter a while you will get to know DbD's design flaws because no game is perfect... except for Assassin's Creed 2... I really love AC2. But back to DbD.\nFirst of all, the matchmaking currently isn't and never really was that great. It can happen that you get matched with completely inexperienced players or players that are way above your skill grade. Be also aware that the difficulty of matches depends more on the daytime than anything else. The later the hour, the sweatier the matches.\n\nSecondly the progression of this game is rather slow... however the grind will probably become healthier with the upcoming prestige fix. You will still have to somewhat grind tho.\n\nThere is currently a meta on both sides. All survivors play the same, they are just skins basically. But there are a bunch of survivor perks that are just much stronger than others... mostly perks that give second chances. Most good killer perks are just there to stall as much time as possible by keeping down generator progress. Because without such perks the matches for \"simple killers\" would end too fast. There will be an upcoming perk overhaul. However I'm sceptical if it will change much. Because there are other deciding factors for the game balance as well. The killer powers also make a huge difference. Most killers that are based on the simple concept of normal movement without abilities that allow them to shorten chases fast are considered weak. Others that break the core gameplay are the complete opposite. This also applies for addons. Some killers have a good range of viable addons and others don't. Even maps are part of the meta. General rule of thumb: The bigger the map, the harder it is for killers to control. That's not all there is to it but explaining maps would take too long. There will probably always will be some kind of meta, it just changes. Getting rid of it will probably be impossible, but adjustments can hopefully make it better.\n\nThe dbd community itself can and will be very toxic in some cases and it doesn't really matter which side you pick. I think it's best if you tell yourself to just not care too much. You will certainly grow tired or become frustrated sometimes. A lot of players are pretty selfish and especially the gap of expectations between more experienced and less experienced players can be pretty huge in comparison. And even if you are open for other opinions, people will probably block you because they do not appreciate your opinion as much as their own, even if you are polite. You can be called sweaty, bad, too stealthy, too annoying or too friendly on the same day. That being said, I met some of the most kindhearted people through DbD, so it's pretty much a mixed bag.\n\nIf you want to talk about money; is this game pay to win? Well, it depends... Licensed killers WILL cost you money unless you win keys in things like streamer giveaways. The original characters can be bought with ingame currency as well but it takes time... Either way if you plan on playing this game without buying dlcs it will definitely be harder once you play against more experienced players, so at some point you will most likely have to decide if you want to spend money. Especially if you play killer and want variety, because all killers are different while survivors all play the same. Also if you don't get new characters it's hard to get new perks. There is a mechanic that allows you to get perks independent from characters but it displays 4 random perks per Week out of the 200 perks and you really have to grind for it. On the plus side, the \"rift\" (DbD's \"battlepass\" with cosmetics) can be rebought with the same money you spent to unlock it for the first time. Because you gain your money through ingame currency back if you get to Tier 70. The dlcs are sometimes for sale. I really suggest buying the game when it's on sale. If you are having trouble to decide which dlcs you should buy/unlock there are tons of videos that showcase all features of each chapter. There are definitely games with worse purchase mechanics but you won't get around paying money at some point. So in short: DLC's are not necessary but probably a fine addition to your collection *caugh*\n\nAnd at last the developers... honestly, my opinion is pretty mixed. There are certain problems that exist since \"day one\" of dbd. For example the grind problem was known for a long time. But the prestige rework is coming this year. For most long term players this issue could have been adressed earlier. That being said, a lot of things already have changed for the better (early moris, 99% hook sabotaging, double shack window...). I don't really think that Bhvr does a bad job, however I think a lot of problems that experienced players encounter are maybe brushed off as \"comp things\" but they are basic problems that definitely make an impact in normal matches. I think the devs know about most problems that are present in the game but have difficulties to adjust the game because from their view it's hard to keep \"old players\" happy and still appeal to new players. And once you implement a new mechanic you want to double check if the time you put into development for it was really worth it and not change it on the first day. At least that's what I mostly get from Devstreams (example: boon adjustments). This can and has led to disappointment in the community since it can definitely be pretty annoying to wait for a patch and it feels like a disconnect between players and community. As part of the community I'm also disappointed if it takes several months to push out a relatively small change.\n\nSo do I still recommend this game? Yes. But there are people out there that point out the same issues and come to a different conclusion. If you pick up DbD just make sure you get to know other people so you don't feel alone and have an easier start. There are a lot of kind people to connect with out there. This counts for killer but especially for survivor, too. Matches with random teammates can tought because the lack of communication can really hurt you. Again: I don't really trust the matchmaking. \nYou can definitely spend a couple hundred of hours in this game and have a lot of fun... What happens after that is totally up to you.\n\nI could have gone way more into detail but this review is already long enough. And to the few people that actually read this whole thing: Thank you very much! <3","timestamp_created":1612919846,"timestamp_updated":1658924445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86304615","author":{"steamid":"76561198264063120","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":49220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26212,"last_played":1655923786},"language":"english","review":"gud\n","timestamp_created":1612919833,"timestamp_updated":1612919833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86304358","author":{"steamid":"76561199105892870","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3830,"last_played":1626132579},"language":"brazilian","review":"O JOGO É MASSA","timestamp_created":1612919440,"timestamp_updated":1612919440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86304280","author":{"steamid":"76561198155790562","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":303073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259457,"last_played":1657699919},"language":"english","review":"UI Hud is complete garbage\nThe game was fine as in the UI. in the past 4 years it hasn't needed to change and it's too distracting while I'm trying to play.
