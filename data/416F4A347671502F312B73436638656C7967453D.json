With an expansive and varying fan base that ranges from people hiding in bushes, to people taking the killer head on for their friends sake or the killer's torment. My personal experiences range from me playing as Mike Myers and Freddy Krueger, people usually either run on the spot or take a minute to laugh at me and have a fun time. On the survivor side I main a survivor called Claudette, she is a healer oriented survivor that always gets joked about for how well she blends into the environment (she's black and the games are dark). I have some good words of advice for starters and people looking into the game. The games on occasion will take an extremely long time to load and it may seem as if it will never load. Just wait, the only downside is that you will have three people. If you get into a really infuriating situation or if you're about to die, don't disconnect. It is very irritating to the people on the opposing side and you will get less point and you run the risk of getting reported and banned. Besides that, this game is some real fun and if you play your cards just right... You might be running out there or making sure no soul goes out alive real easy.","timestamp_created":1562032830,"timestamp_updated":1562032830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53047660","author":{"steamid":"76561198839553909","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":105191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10669,"last_played":1657748311},"language":"english","review":"Honestly pretty fun to play with freinds","timestamp_created":1562032744,"timestamp_updated":1562032744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53047651","author":{"steamid":"76561198801444241","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1621127601},"language":"brazilian","review":"tope","timestamp_created":1562032738,"timestamp_updated":1562032738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507462680339813232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53047536","author":{"steamid":"76561198131591514","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":46126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":11034,"last_played":1659694275},"language":"english","review":"Great Game!

The game is not very intuitive for new players, consisting of both a barebones out of date tutorial, and an incredible grind of a progression system. That being said, once you know what you're supposed to be doing and have put several hours into the game, the gameplay loop is astounding. The tension during a chase is incredible, whether playing killer or survivor. All in all, I suggest grabbing a couple of friends to play with if you're new because thats where the game shines the most.

The overall lack of sportsmanship will be enough to (small-r) ruin more than a few matches, and you hope, sometimes in vain, that those matches won't be *too* consecutive. Maybe that sounds like a rough place to start, but you need to know that much right off the bat. It's a crapshoot--but when you finally jump into a good game, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more exciting experience. There's really no other multimedia project that better understands the fundamentals of American horror (and beyond), the concepts and implications that made the famous characters they utilize so terrifying in the first place. Even when you know the game cold, even when you anticipate every meta-perk, every drop and lunge and stab and death, the in-game heartbeat will always match your own. No foolin'--in terms of thought and thrill, DEAD BY DAYLIGHT is essential for anyone with any interest in the modern icons, the classic expressions, the general idea of horror.
