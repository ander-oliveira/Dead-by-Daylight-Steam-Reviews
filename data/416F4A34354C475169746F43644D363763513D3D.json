GOODBYE AFTER OVER 2500HRS:\n\nI've wasted too much time for Dead by Daylight...\n1st September 2016 - that was the first time I run this game. And I had so much fun. Was playing this game everyday, every free hour. But now? Now it's not funny to play this game anymore. Year by year devs are destroying it bit by bit. It's sad cuz Dead by Daylight had so much potenial and idea was amazing. Also devs are making players play one side - killer. Cuz playing as survivor isn't possible anymore. It's not fun in every aspects. And playing with randoms? Damn, I've never wanted to uninstall game more than when I'm playing with them. SWF? It's not as fun as it was before.\n\nCamping and tunneling - devs are saying it's \"strategy\". They're banning survivors for \"toxic\" playstyle and making game unfun to play. What about campers and tunnelers? Are those making gameplay fun? I don't think so.\n\nAlso I've spent so much time and money for exclusives. After chapter 14th everyone got what I was working for so hard. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT . Are devs really like to ♥♥♥♥ with players!?\n\nAnd once Mathieu answered when someone said that he doesn't have fun to play this game anymore - \"go play something else\" . Well, it's obvious devs have their players in their asses. That's why they're losing so many great players (72hrs we still miss you so much, dad).\n\nThat's why IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE to DbD.

Love the game very addictive and fun to play only when you get a fair killer and fair survivers. Best for actual friends to play with/against is the better choice as to not get harassed by rude players looking for reasons to bad mouth someone for whatever reason they can think of.\n\nThe infinate loading screen is a real problem though, mainly happens for me when trying to join as survivor so I don't get much of a chance to play that role. You will come across people/killers who will camp, survivors who continuously jump over baracades, windows, run around obsticles non-stop. \n\nBeing able to take down the hooks should be limited to a few and not all that aren't in the basement because players will continuously run to the far end of the map and create an endless game of back and forth until someone decides to  disconnect or the killer gives up their rightful win. Some will camp the hook when they catch players taking down hooks, and I was harrased by another player for that reason alone for their past experiences and accused me of playing unfair/cheating even though I had barely played as a survivor because of previously explained loading issues. \n\nPlayers lose tempers when singled out as survivor for any given reasons. Going for a player knowing they can be killed is not unfair, survival of the fittest the weak are reasonable to go after. When on the virge of escape going after a player again because you know you can kill them instead of the others is not unfair either.\n\nWill come across players who will accuse you of camping if you don't go to the other side of the map when hooking a survivor. Checking the immediate area for players is exceptable. Some players will disconnect when caught and ruin the games point of playing as a killer and survivors but there are points given to the killer because of quitters.\n\nBeing harrassed by players/survivors for playing as you are supposed to as a killer and \"camping\" in their unfair perspective of not leaving the area even though you know players around and attemping a save kills any enjoyment of the game. Being harrassed by the player/killer for playing as a survivor fighting to survive is absolutely ridiculous and also kills any enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere are a number of types of people named that will ruin the game for others, and probably a number more that weren't named also.","timestamp_created":1486457553,"timestamp_updated":1486457553,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29757641","author":{"steamid":"76561198105193304","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1630,"last_played":1563544873},"language":"english","review":"bugg","timestamp_created":1486457369,"timestamp_updated":1486457369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499792098999023438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29757543","author":{"steamid":"76561198321347486","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":27625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16198,"last_played":1560238973},"language":"schinese","review":"BUG满天飞，游戏 可玩性还是可以的","timestamp_created":1486456825,"timestamp_updated":1486456825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29757017","author":{"steamid":"76561198163161730","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1597543697},"language":"schinese","review":"杀鸡这款游戏很好 但是bug和优化这个问题咱也不能不说。","timestamp_created":1486454139,"timestamp_updated":1486454139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29756982","author":{"steamid":"76561198195486623","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":86952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":129,"playtime_at_review":9643,"last_played":1659707856},"language":"english","review":"So how can I start? I love this game so much, it's so fun, especially with friends, however, if you ever decide to buy this game, think about what you're getting yourself into, this game is a roller coaster and a half.\n\nPros: This game is absolutely to die for, this game will take over your Horror gaming for sure, there's so many things to come from this game, it is so fun playing alone, playing with friends, playing for yourself or playing as a team to escape or die, you can choose, every game you get yourself into you don't know what map it is, who you're playing against, every game you can be safe working around the killer, fixing generators, and escaping others you can just hide for a lot of the time, and others you will have to run for your life all game as the killer can choose to either go for you only or spread the killing field, you can choose from many characters, perks, add-on things  and offerings as a killer or a survivor, you can change the game style by using specific offerings as it can change from how many things are in the level, to how much mist is in the level to changing the map completely, The game concept of a 4v1 Horror game is a very interesting  for future online Horror games, as this is a factor the execution is fabulous for a Horror game, however it is very complicated to pull off with the balancing of the game play.\n\nCons: This game is a mixture of good and bad things, this game runs flawlessly, very fluid, and very visualized and sound coded, however many issues break these, as there are a lot of lag spikes, fps drops and glitched visuals until you get close to objects that have been glitched, many of these can be fixed however can come back, for a few examples, cabinets will be black until you get closer and sometimes if you get picked up by the killer your character sometimes gets put on his shoulder other times the character will fly around the map/ screen.\n\nNegs: This game has many, many, many bugs and loading times are ridiculous, loading screens take for ever to load to not even load, game can crash for no reason whatsoever, the devs announced that they were going to fix the bugs when the game released they have not, as each update comes along the bugs keep coming, and ruining the game experience in which the game is practically rendered useless, I don't know what else to say but this game is a range of thoughts and opinions, I won't be able to choose which I want to pick if I do want to recommend this product or not, you can decide what you want to choose for this game but my recommendation is going to be recommended but in fact I can't

Please read to understand why me as well as many others who reviewed the game negatively have hundreds of hours in a bad game.\n\n1: Those hours are heavily incorrect. I have just short of 500 hours as I write this, but I've spent many hours with the game open but not being played. Probably a good 30 - 50 hours of that. You also got the issues of wait time inbetween matches, glitches that make the game not load, games that load but aren't a normal 1 v 4, games that load but end early, etc.\n\nJust some examples of what I mean by \"aren't a normal 1 v 4\" is the killer being a bot where he just has an auto clicker to constantly swing to point farm with survivors that comply. Games where some people don't disconnect. Games where you have survivors trolling. Games where the killer just isn't playing. \n\n2: There's countless bugs and with each update, especially the ones that are seemingly good, another batch of bugs get tossed in due to badly if at all tested gameplay. When big bugs become an issue, I guarantee you without a doubt in my mind you can expect to last MUCH longer then any bug should. Few examples: Infinite loading screen which did exactly what it's called, cause an endless loading screen until you restarted the game. This last for months, then I believe got fixed and a few weeks later was back for a few months. Killer terror radius bug which is the most recent one I can remember. Only happened I want to say 2 months ago but last around I think 2 weeks. I believe if ANYONE was in the terror radius, EVERYONE got the same audio from it. Made it impossible to tell when the killer was near and in many games made it impossible to avoid the killer since you could never tell if he was or wasn't chasing you still.\n\n3: Although a bug, this deserves a point of its own. Data resets. This is the single reason why this game deserves to not be purchased by anyone until fixed. You can spend ANY amount of time you want on the game, and randomly with seemingly 0 reason your progress can get completely wiped and unless you went out of your way to make a backup of your save data, it's gone. Developers will refund your blood points ONLY if you send them an email, give them months in some cases to reply, then hopefully get everything refunded properly. It's safe to assume any limited time event items won't be refunded because they can't be refunded meaning any time you invested to earn something limited is gone if it happens to you.\n\nThere's many more reasons I could add, but I'm going to hope any sane human being understands these developers are some of the literal worst developers in the gaming industry. I'm getting to the point that with all these bugs, the game should be given the batman game treatment and taken off steam with refunds provided until it's made into a more playable state.","timestamp_created":1486446273,"timestamp_updated":1521451559,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515418469905853271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29755597","author":{"steamid":"76561198102832674","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":15034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2651,"last_played":1657133677},"language":"schinese","review":"bug多，改档多，挂多，不解释.","timestamp_created":1486446119,"timestamp_updated":1486446119,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29755383","author":{"steamid":"76561198226706116","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26147,"last_played":1559080511},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite games ever, if only I didn't lose all my progress because of the game reset xc","timestamp_created":1486444968,"timestamp_updated":1486444968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29755199","author":{"steamid":"76561198058970349","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8026,"last_played":1646745735},"language":"german","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1486443877,"timestamp_updated":1486443877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29755142","author":{"steamid":"76561198279481802","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1788,"last_played":1596550637},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是款好游戏，体验到了猫抓老鼠的乐趣，但是配置较低，游戏体验很差，但还是要给一个好评，听说这是一个小工作室做的游戏，能做到这样已经很不错了，游戏卡也是自己的原因，不能怪制作组","timestamp_created":1486443568,"timestamp_updated":1519367208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29755107","author":{"steamid":"76561198069798639","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":101784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16343,"last_played":1659385548},"language":"german","review":"Muss meine alte Rezension umbearbeiten.

Dead by Daylight being one of the most polished, optimized masterpieces of our generation, I thought it would be appropriate to treat you all to Marth's meatball recipe.\n\nFor this recipe, you will need:\n\n* 1 pound ground beef\n* 1/2 pound ground veal\n* 1/2 pound ground pork\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 eggs\n* 1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese\n* 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley\n* salt and ground black pepper to taste\n* 2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled\n* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water\n* 1 cup olive oil\n* and a dash of bm\n\nDirections:\n\n1: Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.\n2: Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.\n3: Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)\n\nto see what this recipe creates, be sure to visit http://www.twitch.tv/marth88","timestamp_created":1486428758,"timestamp_updated":1486428758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449678778648376465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29752312","author":{"steamid":"76561198296231712","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1629882845},"language":"schinese","review":"恩，太好玩了，几局瞬间团灭，买这真是买对了，不过游戏的bug还是要修复一下下","timestamp_created":1486428616,"timestamp_updated":1486428616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29751946","author":{"steamid":"76561197997073170","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6952,"last_played":1649895075},"language":"english","review":"the game looks a bit brighter. but i find myself at the beggining of the game having to alt + tab to fix the mouse issue. i find that killers kicking gens is kool but thats about it. it looks a bit better but i feel like the brightening the game makes it worse. the wait times to get a match weather it is killer or surviver is still bad. dont think anyone needs to waste time in a lobby simulator.","timestamp_created":1486426592,"timestamp_updated":1486426592,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29751733","author":{"steamid":"76561198101633031","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1486431803},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾游戏  \n进房间都进不去","timestamp_created":1486425448,"timestamp_updated":1486425448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29751685","author":{"steamid":"76561198357926480","num_games_owned":568,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1583396452},"language":"schinese","review":"和朋友们玩了几轮，还是感觉挺有意思的，反正我是第一个死。。。","timestamp_created":1486425203,"timestamp_updated":1486425203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29751620","author":{"steamid":"76561198347897956","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":53038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37355,"last_played":1623845844},"language":"russian","review":"игра очень радовала, но её ломают с каждым обновлением","timestamp_created":1486424882,"timestamp_updated":1618328963,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29751533","author":{"steamid":"76561198274123930","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":7609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1658917104},"language":"romanian","review":"Is a nice game.

planteadas y un tema que podria tener suceso si no fuera por las cosas anteriores.\nEste juego tiene unas mecanicas MUY curiosas como que si los supervivientes se desconectan por algun motivo (usualmente tirar del cable) no pierden los items y el asesino gana los puntos, pero si el asesino se desconecta los supervivientes pierden puntos al igual que el asesino.\nOtra cosa para destacar de este horrido juego es que el asesino de mierda siempre es el host de la partida, lo que es retrasado porque le da control totalitario de que tanto lag tienen los supervivientes, de aqui se originan los ¨laggers¨.\nUna mecanica MUY BIEN APLICADA de este MARAVILLOSO JUEGO es que el asesino no es penalizado por campear, ademas de que los asesinos solo necesitan 1 superviviente muerto para contar como victoria, esto hace el climb de los asesinos a rango 1 extremadamente facil y sin esfuerzo, ademas de la mecanica de ejecucion QUE TAMBIEN ESTA MUY BIEN PLANEADA, la cual te permite poder matar a un superviviente sin esperar un solo segundo Y IGUAL CUENTA COMO VICTORIA (solo pierdes un par de puntos pero)\nEl meta de los supervivientes tambien esta demasiado fijo a un par de perks, estas son SELF CARE, SPRINT BURST, SABOTAGE, SPINE CHILL, PREMONITION (estas ultimas dos son un poco mas para supervivientes novatos o con mal sentido de vision de juego o simplemente que les parece util).\nEl balance en el juego es horrido, ademas del meta ajustado para los supervivientes, el meta tambien es super ajustado para los killers, como pickear al trampero y a la enfermera (el trampero viene con exploits abusables como las trampas invisibles), mientras asesinos como HAG y WRAITH siguen estando en un estado mediocra/deplorable.\nEntonces para resumir, un juego con bastante potencial de diversion y competitividad arruinado por un monton de bugs, glitches, problemas de balance, problemas de servidor y hosteo y exploits.\nConclusion: no recomendable hasta que arreglen el juego en un 70%\n\n\nActualizacion: Bueno, aqui estamos, despues de un tiempo, tadaaaaaaaa: el juego es POR FIN JUGABLE. Ahora cuando el killer se desconecta cuenta como un escape para los supervivientes, las nuevas perks que agregaron (cosas como devorador de esperanza, hex, etc) + la reduccion de puntos hecha alrededor de muchos parches hicieron que el campeo sea reducido, pero lo mas importante: POR FIN te puedes unir a un lobby sin que se bugee el menu o te expulse 10000 de veces antes de entrar a un lobby.\nGracias a estas condiciones, ahora recomiendo el juego para los que quieran comprarlo, por el simple hecho de que ya es jugable.","timestamp_created":1486409606,"timestamp_updated":1488323134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29747571","author":{"steamid":"76561198025091216","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2754,"last_played":1605815577},"language":"spanish","review":"It's a great game but 90% of the time it doesn't find games so it's impossible to play","timestamp_created":1486409145,"timestamp_updated":1486831695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29747546","author":{"steamid":"76561197993424445","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1656698978},"language":"german","review":"Super","timestamp_created":1486409016,"timestamp_updated":1486409016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29747529","author":{"steamid":"76561198153502152","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":121989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":303,"playtime_at_review":4451,"last_played":1659702476},"language":"russian","review":"Господи,эта убогая игра будет когда-нибудь нормально сук работать?!
