Keeping in mind I'm not asking to swing the pendulum back to a killer sided scenario; just balance the fucking perks already.\n\nExamples:\n- Iron Will completely removes 1/2 of the audio/visual cues required to play, with unconditional 100% uptime, as well as being a total counter to Stridor (which was kinda \"meh\" anyway). \n\n- Now Boil Over has now gotten the same treatment as Iron Will, but now trashes on 3 killer perks; Agitation, Iron Grasp, and Mad Grit. \n\n- Survivors get to pick from 7 perk options to increase their movement speed depending on their need; Hope, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Lithe, Overcome, Smash Hit, and Sprint Burst. Most of these are completely viable as is. And yes, some of these are only effective in certain scenarios of a chase, but they're still an interactive part of the chase mechanic. Killers get 1; Play With Your Food, and they literally have to give up the chase to benefit from it, and isn't even an option if the obsession is dead. (Technically you could add the minor Hex: Devour Hope boost here, but let's get serious).\n\"But they're exhaustion perks, you generally only get to use them once in chase!\", they may cry. You also get pallets, windows, jungle gyms, loops, lockers, flashlights, flash grenades, body blocking, and a speed boost if one hit doesn't down.\n\n- Of the 9 Obsession based killer perks, 3 require the killer to ignore the obsession or get penalized. This requires tunneling, which supposedly is frowned up and discouraged, and so can be penalized further by super popular anti-tunneling perks like Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike. Also, 3 of those perks don't even effect the obsession or outright gives them bonuses.\n\n- The new boon totems, while taking time away from generators for (potentially) just one person, can be INFINITELY replaced, STACK with each other on one totem, can be used on dull OR hex totems (with the latter being cleansed automatically in the process btw), and can be seen by ALL survivors ALL the time. Slap that shit on something like Hex: Ruin and NOED and I'll be a happy non-camping killer.\n\nI could go on, but I really don't want to. Until then, enjoy getting rofl-stomped by shitty tea-baggers on crutches with no reason to respect the killer because it takes next to zero effort to escape now. I really couldn't care less about what 8 pro-players say about it either. I've known players to purposefully sandbag matches to reach lower brackets because it's more fun without having to professionally sweat all the time just to get a \"GG\" in the end game chat. This wasn't a \"get gud\" rant, it's a \"get fair\" one. Oh yeah, and the totally ineffective anti-cheat system. And then partake in this shit show for as long as it takes to farm an absolutely ludicrous amount of Blood Points to unlock 50 tiers worth of perks, THREE TIMES, for EACH CHARACTER to max tier. I'll give you a hint; it is still more than 460 hrs of playtime. And then have the developers beg for a \"Labor Love\" award or some shit on Steam. You know what, fuck this game.","timestamp_created":1643354373,"timestamp_updated":1643354416,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108926912","author":{"steamid":"76561199153806349","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1654334775},"language":"spanish","review":"j","timestamp_created":1643354165,"timestamp_updated":1643354165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108926786","author":{"steamid":"76561199080147616","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":229,"playtime_at_review":3566,"last_played":1660371130},"language":"english","review":"nice

got a ton of hours, why? because when I first got this game years ago it was perfect.\n\nBut now.. Unbalanced, killer sided; rare to have a game where a killer or survivor dont say \"gg ez\" to eachother. t-bagging, camping, proxy camping. this game isn't played how it was made to be anymore.\nAnd when calling someone out for being extremely shitty and not making the game fun for others, you're met with \"you mad?\" or \"stay salty\".\n\nYour fellow survivors often throw you under the bus or leave you to die on hook. Killers tunnel you so all your games last about 5 minutes. The match making is currently broken and you get paired with those with lesser skill or greater skill than your own despite what BVHR claims it to be.\n\nSurvivor perks are met with nerfs while Killers get buffs. A NOED totem to make sure you die, another to make you exposed for up for 3 minutes. Perks that cover generators from the very beginning of the game for 5 minutes where all you can do is sit on your ass and not do anything until it goes away.\n\nThis game is full of toxic players who abuse the most OP perks. The devs again nerfed the only perk survivors really had to succeed (circle of healing) but decide to buff Plague so her mechanics aren't even worth doing anymore.\nBlight and Freddy can slap you from across the map and the killers abuse that power.\n\nIn the couple days since the new rift started. I had exactly ONE game with a killer who played as intended. The rest made me want to uninstall because they manage to take away the entire gameplay from you.\n\nWhatever killer complains this game is survivor sided must be new, because survivors never escape.\n\nThis review will change, if BVHR fixes how unbalanced, how insanely broken some killers are (AHEM, LEATHERFACE), how it's pointless for survivors to even try.\n\nThey wonder why their game is dying? they cater to the killers.\nwhich statistically only about 30% of players play.\n\nOnce I get what I need from the rift, i'm off again.\n\nOnce VHS gets fully released, I guarantee most players will be jumping ship.

You'll meet survivors that will raid \nyour discord server and call you slurs (true story) or go onto your profile and leave hateful things because you did \nsomething that they thought was \"mean\" or whatever. You may meet some cool friends but they will never stick in your \nmind as much as the bad apples.\n\n The devs are GENUINELY the most AWFUL people I've ever seen make a game. They go \nout of their way to not listen to their community, one of the main devs literally once said \"if you don't like our game, go \nplay something else\". People at that time were complaining in mass that the game was just blatantly broken and one-sided. \n\nThe devs play obvious favorites and have absolutely no clue what they're doing. Everything is overpriced, nothing is free. \n\nyou get maybe like 5% of the game for the $20 you pay for it. you will then be forced to pay over $100 on DLCs and\n microtransactions.

Basically, survivors can equip certain abilities that make it impossible for the the vast majority of killers to actually kill them on some maps. These survivors will keep teabagging and running circles around you, and you'll be their captive until they graciously decide they've had their fun and complete the map to put you out of your misery. If you disconnect, you'll be penalized. Oh, and the survivors have the ability to force the game into the impacted maps if they want. \n\nIn addition to this, the game has terrible ultrawide monitor support. It uses a Vert- approach, which means that if you have an ultrawide monitor you have the same horizontal FOV as you would if you had a 16:9 aspect ratio monitor, and about a third less vertical FOV. There are no settings to change the FOV for the game to resolve this issue. \n\nI've read speculation that this is because of a concern that giving ultrawide monitor users a wider FOV would be an unfair advantage. I'm skeptical of this argument given ultra competitive games like Counterstrike allow FOV manipulation, but even if that is the concern simply hobbling the FOV of ultrawide monitor users seems like an obviously hypocritical and awful solution. A better approach would be pillarboxing, but after some research it seems this problem isn't a priority for the developers. \n\nAll in all, I would suggest spending your money elsewhere, ESPECIALLY if you use an ultrawide monitor.","timestamp_created":1643337913,"timestamp_updated":1643338163,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108915603","author":{"steamid":"76561198243348214","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":70535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":66599,"last_played":1660579858},"language":"latam","review":"Tremendo juegazo , para pasarla bien con amigos !","timestamp_created":1643337386,"timestamp_updated":1643337386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108915334","author":{"steamid":"76561198296398009","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":74,"playtime_at_review":16839,"last_played":1659423146},"language":"english","review":"yes, game is good","timestamp_created":1643336976,"timestamp_updated":1643336976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108914465","author":{"steamid":"76561199175345397","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":35,"playtime_at_review":1330,"last_played":1660291028},"language":"russian","review":"Разрабы дауны не сдержали обещание я купил канибала открыл маски зачем спрашивается если мне всё равно ничего не дали","timestamp_created":1643335716,"timestamp_updated":1643335716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49824562668800354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108914364","author":{"steamid":"76561198349066310","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":41484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":90,"playtime_at_review":36275,"last_played":1660405999},"language":"english","review":"devs not on their best BHVR","timestamp_created":1643335556,"timestamp_updated":1643335556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534363329410552979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108914280","author":{"steamid":"76561198375655187","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1176,"last_played":1645188365},"language":"english","review":"j","timestamp_created":1643335465,"timestamp_updated":1643335465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108914212","author":{"steamid":"76561198981382628","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":34817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2488,"playtime_at_review":4196,"last_played":1660556372},"language":"english","review":"thought this was the perfect time to review this game, no reason why...","timestamp_created":1643335368,"timestamp_updated":1643335368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108914047","author":{"steamid":"76561199053719572","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8470,"last_played":1656264699},"language":"english","review":"youll be back","timestamp_created":1643335114,"timestamp_updated":1643335114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488377273082733154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108913815","author":{"steamid":"76561197999328378","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":233,"playtime_at_review":16872,"last_played":1660498653},"language":"english","review":"I... wanna like this game.
