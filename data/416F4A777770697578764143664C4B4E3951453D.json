Фейскемперы ( маньяки по каким либо причинам стоящих в упор к крюку и не дают  вас снять ) .

Генраш ( быстрый завод генераторов ) который выплывает зачастую с первого пункта . Проблему так же частично может помочь решить кемп и туннелинг на ряду с патрулированием 3 оставшихся генераторов которые розположены не далеко друг от друга ( перед этим нужно заставить выживших завести генераторы так что бы получился так называемый триугольник )                                                                                                                                                                             \nВот и все что я хотел россказать о дбд .

It has improved from what it use to be though. I really recommend approaching it casually, and if you enjoy it, competitively later. Improvement takes a couple of hundred hours, and I've met some who will tell you 1k+. Killer is much harder than survivor, though both take skill. It's also good to play both at least occasionally, as it's a big advantage knowing how the other side works.\n-Grindy, grindy, grindy, and I don't mind grind, but it's a grind. I can't remember how long it took me to get one fully prestiged character with all the unlocked perks, but I'm guessing around 500. Survivors aren't so bad in this regard because all survivors play the same mostly (unless you count model advantages), so a lot of people opt to do it to one survivor. However, killers all play differently, so the grind is massive if you want to do it to all killers. I'd suggest just aiming for perks you really like and moving on.\n-Devs think they are \"doing a pretty good job so far\" (the infamous quote) -- and I agree. One of the best games I've played that at least tries to stay close with their player base. Regular events and new content too. There are issues at times but they do compensate often, and all non-linear games have issues. Customer service isn't bad either, and their official forums have people you can talk to straight at BHVR.\n-There is a ton of developer created lore with their own characters / universe, and a lot of franchises are involved like Halloween, Stranger Things (or use to be), Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. \n-Not P2W or gacha-y. Points and perks can only be obtained from grinding. Mostly monetized by new chapters with character / map releases, the tomes VIP version (just for costumes), and the cosmetics shop. Good costumes too for most characters.\n-Very active communities, at least on just about every media platform I'm on. Not hard to find strangers to play with, or get information. Toxicity is a thing, but I don't find it rampant, and you can even turn chats off if it really bothers you. DBD has a huge following on Twitch as well. I'd suggest Otzdarva, and emote him a larva.\n-Hands down, one of my favorite games ever with friends. Second game I've really been able to get my non-gamer husband into, too. Even my kids play on the PS5. The only person I've had play that doesn't enjoy it is not so much of a fan of horror or adrenaline inducing games.\n-You will lose the fear factor for the most part, but at least for me the jump scares are never ending. The initial fear factor though is so fun.\n-I laugh a lot, for better or worse.","timestamp_created":1582925244,"timestamp_updated":1654044943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64262799","author":{"steamid":"76561197963629859","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6113,"last_played":1658255839},"language":"english","review":"Good
