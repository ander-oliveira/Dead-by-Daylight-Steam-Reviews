Frustration and lows outweighs the highs and nice games, things like crossplay made this game miserable, playing both with and against console players makes you always have an advantage over them. Things like certain add-ons and and perks make the game extremely frustrating to play on certain sides as well as overall poor \"balance\". Nobody likes to admit but some killers have zero counterplay, even if it is hard and skillful to use them, and a good portion of killers are so unbelievable useless that you could nearly ONLY lose to them against a try-hard pc killer with 3 console teammates. Toxicity has dropped overall thanks to the console introduction but sometimes is still present. \n\nAs far as actual gameplay killer is sometimes fun, refreshing, but you can be met with people you will never catch while also scoring additional kills. Also if you don't play by a set form of \"inside rules\" then the reality is you are making a game unfun for the other side. There is no proper way of communicating these \"inside rules\" that many people of the community want to keep and even then the majority of people don't always follow them. All these rules are self imposed and point to a large issue of the actual gameplay design itself.\nSurvivor gameplay is truly horrible, as if you play to do the objective you will be bored, and if you play to try and run the killer and waste their time (only effectively 1 person can do this job at a time) you are at the step where the \"cat and mouse\" dichotomy is swapped in which you chase the killer in hopes you waste minutes of their time to give your teammates breathing room. (Not avoiding hits and getting downed easily is where you will notice the biggest struggle for console players, as going down is something they do quite often and when they do that very much harms the progress of your team).\n\nWithout a tiny bit of joke I would highly recommend playing another game. The draw in this game to me that kept me in it is the absurdly high and mostly pointless grind and the reality is every game is samey. For 5 dollars if you don't tryhard or look into broken \"strategy\" I think this game would be good with 4 other friends to play with, or if you intend to only play killers (even though its highly unlikely you ignore the other half of the short lived experience) otherwise I would highly recommend skipping. I don't think multiplayer and true horror ever works as this game hasn't been scary since the first 2 hours I played, and I would recommend something like Subnautica for a horror experience as it's spooky grindy and there is decent depth, no pun intended, to the content you can get out of it and it frequently goes on sale for less price then this. \n\nThere is more to go into like bugs, breaking of things like the most recent map added but I no longer care, I really wish I had not spent this much time in the game even if I good portion of it was afk or in menus.

C'est frustrant. \nLes hits à retardement aussi sont devenus un vrai fléau, un bon mètre séparant le survivant de l'arme du tueur. Le Bluetooth semble fonctionner apparemment.\n\nLes compétences sont variées, il y en a pour tous les goûts ; de la confrontation, de la discrétion, de la diversion, de l'altruisme, de la mécanique ... Il y a largement de quoi s'amuser ! \nNéanmoins, petit bémol, d'expérience personnelle, des compétences un peu moins utiles comme Viande glissante ( les 4 % étant très, très rares ) ou encore On n'abandonne personne ( entrant un peu en conflit avec le Endgame ) ; peut-être qu'un léger rework s'imposerait, mais ce n'est pas gênant. \n\nEt enfin, la toxicité de la communauté ... Une toxicité comme je n'en ai jamais vue. Supportant les LGBT, il m'est déjà arrivé de me faire camp ou tunnel pour cette raison ; un comportement homophobe qui n'a l'air de déranger personne, pas même mes coéquipiers ( lambdas ) qui soutiennent les propos du tueur. \nL'utilisation de Prophylaxie, d'une lampe de poche, ou de toute compétence pouvant freiner le tueur dans son but résulte d'insultes, de commentaires haineux, racistes, homophobes, et j'en passe. \nL'altruisme du jeu est lui aussi sanctionné par du tunnel, du camp ou des insultes ; les joueurs décident donc de se la jouer solo, ils n'aident plus, ne soignent plus ou ne protègent plus, et c'est nous les fautifs quand on essaie d'être un minimum altruiste. Autant jouer avec des BOTS dans ce cas. \n\nDans le cadre actuel du jeu, je déconseille de jouer solo, prenez quelques amis et tout ira bien. Dans le cas contraire, changez de jeu, la frustration vous aura sinon.\n\nMise à jour - 20 juillet 2022\n-> Un changement de compétences assez inattendu, coup de frais pour certains ou douche glaciale pour d'autres. Et tant qu'à râler, autant y aller franco, c'est l'Antarctique que j'ai pris en pleine face. Certaines compétences n'avaient absolument pas besoin d'être changées, par exemple Dead Hard, certes, c'était OP, ça faisait gagner du terrain, ça permettait de gagner la palette ou la fenêtre la plus proche ; tout à fait d'accord. Mais y'a une seule chose qui me trigger, à quand une réévaluation des hit-boxes ? Parce que malgré le fait que Dead Hard soit OP, c'était aussi une façon d'éviter les hits Bluetooth, pas constants, mais bien présents ; Blight, Huntress, Nemesis, ou encore la Nurse. \n-> Je reviens encore une fois sur ce point, la communauté HAUTEMENT toxique. Même le jardin botanique le plus dangereux du monde n'a pas atteint ce niveau de toxicité et je parle des tueurs comme des survivants. Des messages envoyés afin de trigger, des messages homophobes, haineux, racistes, et j'en passe ; le chat de fin sert à 70% à s'insulter, à s'autoproclamer \" libre de tout faire puisque je suis le tueur \". Des survivants au comportement toxique en jeu ( qui clic-clic, qui t-bag, qui tuent leurs propres coéquipiers ... ) qui n'hésitent pas une seule seconde à déconnecter quand rien ne va dans leur sens, qui préfèrent pourrir la partie des autres en se tuant eux-même sur le crochet ou qui se laissent tuer même. On se fait également lyncher bien comme il faut si le tueur réalise qu'il joue contre une SWF ; \" c'est injuste \", \" toxiques \", etc. \n-> La mise à jour du système de Prestige. Ah, la fameuse ! La seule chose positive que j'en tire à l'HEURE ACTUELLE, c'est qu'en ayant monté ses personnages Prestige 1 avant la mise à jour, on était automatiquement ajusté au Prestige 3 ; un gain de temps considérable donc, étant donné que désormais, on doit être Prestige 3 pour débloquer le Niveau 3 de chaque compétence de personnage sur CHAQUE personnage. Sinon, c'est inutile, le temps que l'on a investi dans le jeu est récompensé par des charmes de personnages ( survivants et tueurs ) griffonnés de l'icône des compétences ainsi qu'un léger arrière-plan rouge scintillant. C'est tout ? Oui, c'est tout. 2 000 heures de jeu toutes plateformes confondues pour me retrouver avec des charmes et un arrière-plan qui brille. \n\nMon verdict reste le même, jouez avec des amis, et vous aurez moyen d'avoir du fun, de passer du bon temps ; si vous êtes solo, passez votre chemin.","timestamp_created":1482814342,"timestamp_updated":1658273229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516008913516998291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28698963","author":{"steamid":"76561198035182123","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1655772821},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pra min o melhor jogo de terror multiplayer atualmente, o jogo te prende de uma forma sinistra, tem alguns bugs sim, mas nada que não possa ser resolvido, a equipe do jogo ainda é pequena e boa parte dela trabalha pras novidades do propio jogo, eles estão de parabéns pelo trabalho !!

Grinding through early character levels to get skills  is necessary to even ATTEMPT to compete with other players with full perk loadouts, who you will frequently be matched with despite the huge imbalance in chances of you winning; bugs are very common and often slow to be fixed; dev streams can be disheartening for players realizing how certain team members actually feel about broken aspects of the game. That being said, it's a fun experience in a niche genre, and it keeps me coming back for more despite all of its flaws. If you plan to play, frequenting r/DeadByDaylight and the community page here on Steam will be your best bet for not suffering from some of the worst bugs.\n\nDbD is an 4v1 asymmetrical PUG PVP 3rd person horror survival or 1st person hunting game, depending on the role you choose. Overall, the gameplay is pretty simple: survivors rush to complete generators while avoiding the killer and saving their friends from the killers' hooks; either ends in all survivors sacrificed, or a few—or even all—the survivors escaping the desecrated grounds only to relive the Entity's nightmare another day.\n\nThe world building is decent, but if you are looking for an interesting story, this is not the game for you. The vast majority of the lore exists to justify gameplay mechanics, and the rest is just a dash of background info on the characters. Game comes with a few characters to play as, and you have to pay to unlock other characters in pairs of twos.\n\nIssues with the game? We have to deal with a lot of bugs. This is the studio's first major game, and it shows. They try, but bugs take a while to fix and they often release content that just reintroduces the exact same bugs as previous DLCs have added (as if they didn't even try to playtest their own game). Additionally, there has been a bit of an imbalance in content being added to the game that is exclusive to streamers and their fan base. So if you don't like most of the cosmetics being exclusive, this also isn't the game for you. The matchmaking is also just bare basics \"let's get 4 survivors and 1 killer\" and doesn't do a good job at all of making sure players have similar skill levels or perk availability.\n\nWhat do I mean by \"perk availability\"? Simply put, you start out just as a killer or survivor using your basic kit of skills (survivors run, fix generators, pull levers, perform first aid to heal allies, and pull friends off of meat hooks; killers have their supernatural ability, can see where survivors have ran, smash pallets, attack survivors, and hang them on hooks). But as characters level up, they can acquire perks: skills that alter gameplay in some way. In theory, all of these perks make it easier to meet the win condition for your role (some do this much better than others). But when I first started playing, I lost the majority of games I played because my bottom-rank, perkless character was being matched with rank 10s (even sometimes rank 1s) with a full quadra-perk loadout. Translation for those who don't play the game: they had incredible buffs to their role while I had none AND barely knew how to play, so it was nearly impossible to win. The game is a lot more fun now that I've spent the time grinding characters up to get their perks and unlock teachables, but there are still times where the matchmaking (when it isn't buggy and crashing) still completely fails to even ATTEMPT balancing player skills.","timestamp_created":1482809495,"timestamp_updated":1482809602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28697250","author":{"steamid":"76561198200155173","num_games_owned":956,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":30551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":408,"last_played":1609592387},"language":"english","review":"This feels like adult tag/hide and seek with the adult consequences for getting found and \"tagged\".

Not an awful game but spend your money elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1482807396,"timestamp_updated":1482807396,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28696185","author":{"steamid":"76561198118828650","num_games_owned":400,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1482424392},"language":"schinese","review":"这款躲猫猫游戏十分适合开黑\n","timestamp_created":1482806557,"timestamp_updated":1482806557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538866937160491943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28696073","author":{"steamid":"76561198083935401","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":13728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2103,"last_played":1635844289},"language":"schinese","review":"2016年黑马作品\n8/10","timestamp_created":1482806286,"timestamp_updated":1482806286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28695914","author":{"steamid":"76561198005500098","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":143412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":853,"playtime_at_review":20189,"last_played":1660533494},"language":"english","review":"Devs cater to their biggest audience - their survivors.

新DLC更新：\n杨教授杀人的能力并不强而且技能比较依赖挂件。但是他却是玩起来最爽的屠夫，因为你能听见人类满场的尖叫声萦绕在耳旁，电到人还会发出爽朗的笑声，这种折磨的快感远不是其他屠夫能比的，慢慢的折磨一个活人，电的他生不如死远比直接杀死他更令人享受——这或许就是杨永信沉迷电疗的原因吧！\n\n以下评测写于20161227，游戏时间37小时：\n第一次知道这个游戏是看主播在玩，看了一眼感觉比较符合我的胃口，于是我放进了愿望单。\n至于为何不买？\n1、对Steam上的联机游戏延迟担忧；2、看起来只是风格比较合胃口，但游戏看起来并不是很想玩；3、等打折；4、看其他玩家的评测也是喜忧参半，多观察下也是好的。\n直到前段时间，这游戏推出了一次周末免费，于是果断下来试玩了下，然后发现根本停不下来！2天的时间我就玩了20个小时！\n首先，这游戏国内裸连一点都不卡，就这一点我就很惊讶。其次，游戏玩起来远比看起来好玩多了，而且很符合2大类主流玩家的游戏风格：一种是喜欢和好友一起组队开黑的，那么可以选择玩人类，而且玩人类最紧张刺激。另一这就是喜欢单干的独狼风格，那么玩屠夫也能很好的满足这类玩家！所以说，在这游戏里你都能找到自己的游戏风格。\n试玩了之后，刚好也打折，我也就顺便买了下来。\n游戏的优点自不必说，典型的规则简单易于上手，又有足够的深度难于精通，丰富的道具系统，独特的天赋/技能树系统，多种人物，这些都能让你花上很多时间去做，同时也会觉得乐在其中。\n\n下面来说说缺点：\n1、这游戏对萌新确实不太友好，萌新经常会遇到对手是4技能全满而自己只有1个技能的尴尬，而且有时候也会遇到一堆老司机虐萌新，总之这匹配系统就是很迷（毕竟还是算单机游戏的联机模式，和网游的匹配能力比不了）。不过好在这游戏升级还算快，技能缺陷能够比较快的弥补上（如果你坚持玩一个人物的话） 再说，前期被虐也是种锻炼啊，苦尽甘来，我现在玩起来感觉比最开始要舒服多了，原因是对手水平没什么变化，我的技能越来越多了\n2、游戏优化不太好，bug太多\n    游戏内的bug就不说了，有些bug反倒挺喜感。最影响玩家体验的是，进出游戏房间的时候经常会卡住几十秒钟，还有就是评论里经常提到的错误代码1。这个错误代码1，我试玩的时候玩了20个小时都没遇到，直到我买了游戏，且游戏更新之后就弹出来错误了。不知道是不是版本更新的时候的问题。错误代码这种网上已经有很多解决方法了，很好解决也方便\n3、改档作弊的。也许我遇到过改档的，不过说实话对游戏本身并没有多大影响，至于别人提到的加速等各种外挂我是一次都没遇到。作弊这种东西还是靠自觉吧，网游几乎都有外挂，这游戏的所谓挂真的很少了。\n\n总之，在这37个游戏时间里，除了偶尔卡下界面外，并没有遇到其他问题（看差评里提到的那些bug，70%我从来没见过，剩余的也是极少出现，bug确实存在，但瑕不掩瑜），游戏很好玩，感觉和文明系列一样，总是忍不住再下一回合。喜欢恐怖风格的玩家值得一试！","timestamp_created":1482792392,"timestamp_updated":1494599389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511382520198822021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28689810","author":{"steamid":"76561198069531855","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":27001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18736,"last_played":1659301014},"language":"spanish","review":"Me
