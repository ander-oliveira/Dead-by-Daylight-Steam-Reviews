Well there is the Friday the 13th game heading its way but before that comes out, why not try Dead by Daylight\n\nDead by Daylight is developed by Behavior Interactive and published by Starbreeze Studios and the game basically follows a killer and four innocent victims. As the killer you have to track down the victims and kill them by hanging them from a spike and waiting for a weird spider creature to consume them and as the victims you have to either power up the generators which in turn activate the gate for you to escape or find the hatch to escape easier whilst trying to avoid the killer's grasp\n\nIt's more or less like Friday the 13th where you have to try and survive and the game is terrifying no doubt about that especially when you are the victim, however I did feel that there was not enough content to satisfy my needs whilst playing. All you have to do is survive, power up generators and escape and if you're the killer, just kill people. The game doesn't spruce things up a little, sure there are a few maps which get repetitive after a while and the game does randomly generate (to my knowledge) but nothing else\n\nDead by Daylight doesn't offer different objectives especially for the victims, it just throws you the same quick time events over and over again. Hopefully and thankfully the developers have promised more content in the near future but I am worried (knowing that Behavior is developing it and Starbreeze is publishing it) that new maps and additional content will be locked away via a high priced DLC pack and it will be plagued with DLC content just like Payday: The Heist and even worse Payday 2\n\nDead by Daylight is a mixed bag for me, it was fun to play but after 3-4 hours of playing, I've kind of experienced everything the game has to offer for me and sure it is fun to play with friends but sadly I'm a loner and don't have any friends. Hopefully the developers will add new content, but how much of that content will be free?\n\nAnd as you know if you've actually bothered to read my reviews, I hate DLC. Much <3\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]","timestamp_created":1467835151,"timestamp_updated":1467835151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450720727443695068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24141949","author":{"steamid":"76561197993786134","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":73295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2039,"playtime_at_review":14883,"last_played":1660597564},"language":"english","review":"November 2021\nIt's fixed now, playing with friends is easy, no disconnections anymore, runs great.\nNice work DBD crew!\n\nMay 2020\nCame back to this game after almost 2 years...\nStill a flaming pile of crap.\nConstant disconnects, glitched parties etc. This game has been out for a few years now, and has made a massive amount of cash... and it still has the same network issues it had at launch.\nHad the game disconnect with an \"unknown error\" multiple times, I lost my items, and 2 of the times I was one generator away from escaping...\nIt's a multiplayer game, and you still can't reliably play multiplayer in it...\n\nJuly 14 2018\nCame back to the game after a very long hiatus...\nStill so broken. Takes forever to get a game as killer, and as survivor you are at the mercy of the killer's internet connection. 4 out of 5 games I played multiple people got booted from... why not have dedicated servers for a game like this? How is this game still a laggy/unstable mess??\n\nLatest:\nDespite 3 updates since my last change to this review, I'm still getting disconnected.\nI've since moved, gotten a new ISP, new router... and still the game disconnects me when playing with friends.\nI'm done, fuck this shit.\n\n30 minutes to get a game with a buddy, and get disconnected 5 minutes into it for no reason...\nEvery night it's the same shit with this game, takes 10-30 minutes to get a game, then get disconnected a few minutes into it, over and over again.\nCan't play survivor anymore... so no playing with friends really, just being a killer.\nIt's half a game....\nSpend more time trying to get a co-op game then you do actually playing one.\nThe disconnects are at the core of the game, you can't fix that, then you don't have a game at all.\n\nI love this game, but it's one of those that once I put it down I'll never pick it up again because of this.\n\nUPDATE 3.1:\nSince the content update, they've done a ton of small updates, and I haven't experienced a single disconnect personally.\nOnce the lobby queuing is fixed, I can confidently give this a recommendation.\n\nUPDATE 3.0:\nNew content is awesome, new features are great, especially the ability to chat with your group and killer post game.\nBut, since the Last Breath Chapter update, the bugs are still really bad, disconnections mainly.\nJoing a lobby solo as a survivor, keep getting kicked back to menu.\nJoining lobby as a group, 75% of the time drops one of the players randomly.\nDisconnection still happening mid game, no reason given.\nHaving to hit \"ready\" everytime the game fails to find a game is a bit obnoxious and tedious, especially after 10+ attempts. This is especially disheartening when it takes 20+ minutes to find a game, and then that host is incredibly laggy... it def ruins a game session quickly to spend that much time just to get into a game, and then it's unplayable.\n\nUPDATE 2.0:\nIn the evenings now takes 15-20 minutes to get a game with a 2-3 man group.\nOut of the 3 games we've gotten into in the last 1.5 - 2 hours, at least 1 of us have been disconnected each game...\nI get it's a $20 game, but even for $20, I would expect something that works.\nI'd gladly pay $40 for this game if it actually worked...\nStill a negative review.\n\nUPDATE:\nI changed my recommendation to a negative now.\n\nI love the concept of this game, and the gameplay, art style etc. is all executed incredibly well... but the bugs are so ample in this, it makes playing this game a lesson in patience.\nBeing disconnected mid game, having to constatnly \"ready up\" in a lobby with friends, instead of it just auto searching until it finds a game, clipping into the ground and getting stuck etc etc.\nIt would be fine if these happened rarely, but the disconnects happen in Survive with Friends almost every round we play as a 4 man group, one of us will disconnect almost every game.\nIt's gotten so bad now, many of our group refuse to play this game anymore, especially when you now lose rank when you disconnect.\nThey need a line of code that can tell if you lost connection legitimately or by clicking the \"quit\" button and punish accordingly, not to mention you also lose your one time offering.\n\nOld Review:\nLove this game and the overall concept/theme.\nI have had to force-quit and end task this game though more than any other game in recent memory, that and the disconnects that myself and 6+ of my other clan mates are having. Normally I'd give a negative review for that... but I just can't bring myself to do it.\n\nLooking forward to them adding the \"Survive With Friends\" feature, although it's puzzling why they wouldn't include that from the get go, considering it's what everyone asked for throughout Early Access too...\n\nAnyway, everything is almost there for a great game, just needs some heavy bug fixes and the ability to play public games with friends.","timestamp_created":1467835112,"timestamp_updated":1636492490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24141934","author":{"steamid":"76561198154860428","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5156,"last_played":1469142835},"language":"english","review":"recently got bored of the game because there STILL is no survive with friends mode! we've waited dead by daylight we want it!

All that money down the drain  (Explained below)\n\nThe marketing: So you purchase the game and it was fairly priced - sometimes being steam discounted 60% off.\n\nBut they needed a source of repeat income to keep the servers running and further development thriving - Not an issue, a lot of competitive games like this use Cosmetics to get that income and I love that method.  It does not break the game and it allows the company to grow.\n\nThey have that cosmetic shop but before they got it... they went with the DLC route, every new hero or killer or combination is a new paid DLC ( I think we got 2 free ones ever?).  And even with the cosmetic in game cash shop they are continuing with the paid DLC model as well!\n\nNew players don't want to walk into a game, get killed by some killer they don't have and decide oh man that killer was sweet I want it - To then open up the DLC page and find 20 DLC's they need to purchase for $8-15 a piece to get around the fact that otherwise they will not have access to the basic game... And in a game about unique killers... having access to them I consider a basic feature that should not cost extra.\n\nSTOP THE PAID DLC - CONTINUE THE PAID COSMETICS\nBefore you ruin it for those who actually purchased the DLCs.... 15 minute queues during a FREE WEEKEND... \n\nAlso - There isn't even a \"Buy all\" discount or any kind of sale to make it easier for people to come back and catch up.    I did see an Incomplete bundle that was on sale - but you couldn't buy it for yourself if you already had some of the DLC or the game it was for new players only, a nice fk you to those who spent money in the past.

If you don't like slasher type games or time consuming games dont buy it. Also if you do not have the time to sit down and rank up your character then you will be at a huge disavantage. There are a few glitches and annoying things like survivors using infinite window spot so it is impossible for you to catch them (kinda fixed in new update but not really). Or when you kill a survivor while they're vaulting and then you can't pick them up. Here is a pro con list since im terrible at reviews:\n\nPros:\n-Great atmosphere\n-A LOT of varity between killer and survivors\n-New map every game\n-New spawning areas(for the most part)\n-Amazing rank and skill tree system\n-Great design of lobbys and menus\n-Great graphics\n-Amazing sounds\n -Varity of perks and upgrades for both killer and survivor are good\n\nCons:\n-Stupid window juke which made the survivor uncathable(kinda fixed, but not really)\n-1 game type(wasted potential unless DLC)\n-Can't configurate settings like mouse sensitivity, brightness, keyboard bindings\n-Servers are Shitty\n-If you kill everyone fast and get a brutal victory thats good right? no, the game deranks you. You have to prolong game, THEN kill to rank up\n-Killers camp the hooks which makes you unsavable\n-For the game it is, could've had more blood and gore\n-I cannot stress this enough, SO MUCH potential was wasted unless there is DLC\n\nBut overall I reccomend it if you love horror games and is one of the best multiplayer horror games youll find out there.

One takes the role of the killer and the remaining four are the survivors.  The game has what appears to be some extensive lore and background hidden beneath it's menu's, items and perks but it's hard to properly decipher it.  Suffice to say the story works as a decent frame for the action.  \n\nAs a killer you serve the entity, a malign presence that demands sacrifice and that means you hunt around the games procedurally generated maps looking for the other players.  The maps are based currently on 3 tile sets of a creepy mansion grounds, abandoned farm and a wreckers yard.  You can play as one of three different killers, each with their own abilities and style of play.  The trapper is the cover killer of the game, the poster boy so to speak.  He is a hulking brute who uses bear traps to stop his prey from fleeing.  The wraith can become invisible but lacks the ability to attack while hidden so he requires a little tactical planning on when you decide to strike.  The final killer is the hillbilly.  Armed with a sledgehammer and a chainsaw he rapidly moves around the map scaring the crap out of players by revving the saw.\n\nThe killer simply has to down the four survivors by hitting them twice with their weapon.  Although the hillbilly chainsaw will one shot any survivor.  When they are down he has to pick up the downed player and hang them on one of several hooks dotted around the map.  After a while the survivor will be taken the by entity and you search for the others.  \n\nThe survivors on the other hand (four different characters being available) have to avoid the killer while repairing generators scattered around the map.  This requires you to hold the mouse button down while repairing but always be alert for skill checks or else you damage the generator and alert the killer to your location.  Survivors can work together to repair generators, sabotage hooks (if they have a toolbox), rescue hooked survivors, heal each other and eventually escape once 5 generators are up and running.\n\nThe tension is high, the game really nails the atmosphere of being hunted and being the killer is a more cerebral tactical experience of guesswork and prediction depending on your opponents and the killer you have chosen.  Your characters (killer and survivor) gain bloodpoints after each match based on their actions in game.  These can be spent on unlocks in the blood web such as torches to blind the killer temporarily, medkits, toolboxes, perks, offerings and item modifiers.  There are plenty of items to unlock and the game can become very different as perks open up ways of play for both sides.\n\nThe drawbacks the game has at the time of writing are twofold for me.  The first is a lack of group lobby play.  Currently you can't go into a public ranked lobby with friends, so it's impossible to play a 5 man game with all friends, a major problem on BHVR's part.  They are adding this feature though and hopefully we will see it soon.  The other is the fact the game runs off the killers computer, so a laggy killer means a laggy game for everyone.  I would like to see BHVR add dedicated servers one day as that would make finding and playing games much quicker and smoother for everyone.\n\nOverall though the game is good and most importantly fun.  Once they add the group lobby system it will be even better.  Future content includes new killers, survivors, levels, perks and more so it's got some legs in it for a while yet.  I hope this helps and any question let me know.","timestamp_created":1467814959,"timestamp_updated":1467814959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24135026","author":{"steamid":"76561198119980516","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":184694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":933,"playtime_at_review":1331,"last_played":1660587051},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра","timestamp_created":1467814791,"timestamp_updated":1467814791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46706584095954895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24134823","author":{"steamid":"76561198107315363","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":16132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":12364,"last_played":1659884229},"language":"german","review":"Ein Spiel was anfangs echt toll war, inzwischen nicht mehr spielbar ist.

Но есть несколько отрицательных моментов,которые могут оттолкнуть покупателя. К ним можно отнести крайне паршивую оптимизацию, кривой подбор игроков, ливеры и читаки (о как я вас, урoдов, ненавижу!). Надеюсь разрабы исправят технические косяки и начнут бороться с нечестными игроками. Покупать или нет - решайте сами. Для меня положительные эмоции перевешивают отрицательные.\n\nUPD: Лаги, баги и прочие проблемы технического плана разрабы исправлять не собираются.
