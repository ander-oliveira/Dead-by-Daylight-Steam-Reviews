The game rewards being disrespectful to other players. You can be nice and help your fellow players earn their progression, but the developers will ban players for farming, not for bullying though because that's allowed. The developers are intentionally making the game easier for killers, feeding them extra rewards and faster progression to the point it is not worth playing survivor unless you're already one of the toxic tryhards that can bully killers. If you can't, you're not earning jack. I hate the developers of this game. I really do. Molding it into the perfect example of rewarding toxic bullying of other players and catering to the growing plague of disrespectful narcissistic trash that is polluting our online PvP gaming.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis game is one of the first and easily the most content-rich A-symmetrical PvP multiplayer games on the market. I won't waste time repeating what the description tells you aside from that. In the simplest terms you have one core mode and that's ranked play. There's custom mode often referred to by its former name Kill Your Friends (KYF) where you earn nothing, but can train with friends, test builds, or just screw around. This is where most if not all your actual fun playing will likely be... unless you don't have friends. A typical match is made up of five players; one killer and four survivors. The goal of the game is simple; earn Blood Points to buy perks, items, add-ons, and offerings for the simple act of building your own custom kit on a match by match basis. The goal of the individual matches though... can be taken a number of ways.\n\nThe killer player has the per-match goal of ultimately killing the survivors. How they do this can be accomplished in a multitude of ways. The survivors on the other hand have the per-match goal of trying to get out alive. This can be accomplished in few ways, and tactics change drastically based on which killer is being played - there are over a dozen now - and what perks and tactics the killer is using. Ultimately the goal is to either get all 5 generators powered and at least one gate open so you can escape, or if you are the last one remaining to find and leave via a hatch that spawns randomly in the area. If you are prone to jumpscares, and want to stream your freak-outs on webcam; then this game certainly has you covered.\n\nThe short and sweet of it is the game's balance is and has always been broken since inception. How do I know for an undeniable fact the balance is broken? Simple; KDR and average Blood Points rewarded. I would like to see developer proof to the contrary as in all my playtime over the last few years of playing; I have seen a dramatic increase in the disparity between killer and survivor average blood points earned, as well as kill/survive ratios, since I started playing. Many of the changes since I started playing, as well as planned changes coming, are favoring killers. Changes that even I, playing as killer on occasion, find way too advantageous. As things stand now, killers can often earn around 25k average blood points per match, while survivors are often stuck around 15k unless they manage to escape. Average match results from my experience are in order of commonality: #1; All survivors die with a range of 5-20k BP between them. #2; One survivor escapes, usually via hatch adding 5k to the typical BP earnings. #3; One survivor dies, often with a BP range of 5-20k still in spite of the 5k bonus for surviving between all survivors (including the kill). #4; All survivors live, typically with 10-20k BP. #5; A tie where two survivors die, typically with the usual 5-20k bp range. Let me briefly use all caps to highlight a point here:\nNONE OF THAT IS INDICATIVE OF ANY SORT OF FAIR BALANCE!\n\nIt should be, on average, consistent BP for all players, and it should be hard to get more than two kills as a killer, and for more than two survivors to get out alive. That is balanced. That is tie, and it should be a challenge to get more than that on both sides. On top of that, the learning curves for both sides are dramatically different. Can certain things be exploited by survivors like stacking item kits? Yes. But just like survivors having to deal with exploitative tactics of killers, killers should have to deal with exploitative tactics of survivors. Tactics in question? For killers it's tunneling and camping. What is tunneling? When the killer singles out a survivor fresh off the hook to down and re-hook them right away. Let me be perfectly clear: This tactic is taboo, and will get nothing but anger from the majority of the people playing the match. What is camping? When a killer guards the hooked survivor. Also taboo. Why are these tactics taboo? Because they are detrimental to the experience of that player and by extension everyone they are playing with. This is why I listed those minimum typical BP rewards so low. And just getting out is half their BP. Meanwhile the killer is sitting on around at least 15k, usually 20k or more. Even when using these taboo tactics trying to end the matches as quickly as possible. And yet, it's happening more and more now. So much so that the medals awarded at the end of the match have been reworked so that killers can get their pips for ranking up even if all they do is hook all four survivors straight away with minimal effort. This is not balanced. It should under no circumstances be this easy for killers. And any killers that think otherwise can literally shove it. I play killer too and I refuse to either tunnel or camp. I still get my 20k BP without a single kill (trying not to kill). I easily hit 30k if I get everyone to death hook. I can take a killer with no perks or addons and perfect game with all four kills, and do it with relative ease. Short and simple of it is that recent changes and planned future changes have played killer-favorite. I detest it. I refuse to support it. I will recommend everyone avoid spending their money on this game. And if you've already bought it; stop spending money on it.\nBalance needs fixed first. Bugs (the game crashes a lot for a lot of players) need fixed second. VPNs need blocked and auto-banned (yes Chinese players will VPN into US servers). Last but certainly not least; stop showing favoritism for lagging killers on hit detection. Then add more cosmetics and DLC. FIX THE GAME FIRST! Do this developers, and I'll rework my entire review.\n\nPersonally I feel the role of the killer should be akin to a D&D DM; trying to make the game enjoyable for everyone. I frequently end matches with survivors thanking me, calling me nice, or generally being nice to me. With exception to the occasional toxic tryhard wannabe. Every PvP game has those though; and if you're one of them, Kindly stay away. Go back to your battleroyals and your CoD: Advanced Warfish.\nDevelopers, please. 80% of the match is getting shafted. Stop it. Fix it. Make killers earn their BP in all categories; not just from kills, and force them to give survivors a chance to earn their own.","timestamp_created":1586895611,"timestamp_updated":1628251643,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555555522441864014","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67319521","author":{"steamid":"76561198401081237","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":66613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6446,"last_played":1635538747},"language":"english","review":"vui basi qkoto manqk <3","timestamp_created":1586895388,"timestamp_updated":1586895388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67319507","author":{"steamid":"76561198289463682","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1993,"last_played":1607729806},"language":"russian","review":"not bad game","timestamp_created":1586895371,"timestamp_updated":1586895371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487013012170791626","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67319221","author":{"steamid":"76561198127972090","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1640992645},"language":"english","review":"Very brutal game.

If you want a game where everytime you lose it does not feel like a fair defeat, but instead, an excessive lack of vision in development and balancing, then this game is for you.\n\nIf you want a real game that knows what it is and does itself perfectly, just go play some singleplayer masterpiece and dont think about wasting money on a live service game that is leeching off of the crowd of p(l)ayers, while failing to deliver an experience that would justify even the 20 bucks this game costs. The small bits of dopamine I get here and there from this game just arent worth it anymore compared to the large amount of Frustration I get all the other 99% of the time. The devs dont know what they want to do with the game themselves, So theyve just completely focused on solely working on cosmetics now and new characters because that means more cosmetics.\n\nI had fun with this game. Met some friends. But its time to realize, That in The Fog, There IS an Escape. Its called playing something else.\n\nPerhaps there was never a possibility of making a game of this type enjoyable.... But who knows. If theres one good thing this game has done for the world, Its that it has helped to spawn a New Genre of videogames, along with that Friday The 13th game. And now we have the new Resident Evil \"Mastermind\" game mode and Predator: Hunting Grounds.

Preispolitik der Entwickler\nJa, die Entwicklung eines Computerspiels kostet Geld. Darüber sind wir uns alle einig und das sollte auch angemessen entlohnt werden. Nun gibt es für dieses Spiel (regulär 19,99€) aber mittlerweile 19 noch kaufbare DLCs mit einem Gesamtpreis von 127,80 € ... Ist dies gerechtfertig? Ich denke nicht. Klar, ich muss sie ja nicht kaufen, aber viele der DLCs haben nun mal spielrelevante Inhalte. Nicht zu vergessen, dass es natürlich noch hunderte optische Veränderungen gibt, für die man viele weitere hunderte Euro ausgeben kann...\nFür mich ist das keine positive Preispolitik und ich habe mir bereits ganz am Anfang überlegt, ob ich das Spiel überhaupt kaufen will, weil ich das sehr frech fand. Leider habe ich mich dafür entschieden und dementsprechend nun viel Lebenszeit verschwendet, bis ich zu dieser Einsicht kam... (Ich habe übrigens das Hauptspiel inkl. 7 Erweiterungen.)\n\n2. Die Community\nIch bin ein Zocker. Ich spiele seit mehr als 20 Jahren mehrmals wöchentlich, in vielen Perioden auch täglich. Ich habe viele Communitys kennen gelernt und auch viele negative \"Vibes\" erlebt. Trotzdem, so eine erbärmliche Community wie bei DBD habe ich noch nie gesehen. Und dabei möchte ich klar sagen: Sobald jemand deutsch spricht, ist es meist ein eher vernünftig denkender Spieler. Deutsche Mit- und Gegenspieler stellen aber deutlich die Minderheit in dieser Community.\n\nMeiner Erfahrungen als Survivor: (ca. 20 Spielstunden)\nDie zugelosten Mitspieler sind durchwachsen. Manchmal trifft man auf positive Menschen, viele flamen aber im Afterchat (gegen Teammates oder Killer), machen im Spiel Murks... Letzteres nimmt natürlich ab, je höher man im Rang kommt. Killer denken häufig lediglich an ihren eigenen Spielspaß. Es wird gecampt, getunnelt und im Afterchat geflamed was das Zeug hält. Wie immer gilt: Ausnahmen bestätigen die Regel.\n\nMeine Erfahrungen als Killer: (ca. 110 Spielstunden)\nEs gibt als Killer 3 verschiedene Runden, die man spielen kann:\n1. Die Survivor sind völlig Banane, teilweise gibt es DCs beim ersten down, lassen sich direkt am Haken sterben, das macht weder für deren Mates spaß, noch ist es eine tolle Erfahrung als Killer.\n2. Die Survivor spielen ernsthaft und sind dem Killer überlegen. Das läuft dann auf 2 verschiedene Ausgänge hinaus:\na) Der Killer ist vom T-baggen genervt, fängt an zu tunneln, zu campen oder DCt. Bei den ersten beiden Möglichkeiten gibt es härteste Beleidigungen bis hin zu Todeswünschen im Afterchat.\nb) Der Killer spielt normal weiter (meine Taktik in 95% der Fällen) und \"verliert\". Bekommt also maximal einen Survivor mit normalem Spielen und zahlt \"Lehrgeld\". Auch in diesem Fall wird geflamed im Afterchat. \"Babykiller\", \"noob\", wer das Spiel gespielt hat, der kennt die zahllosen Kosenamen für einen Killer, der eben einfach  schlechter ist als die Survivor - eigentlich keine Schande. \nGerade wieder als letztes Spiel (meines Lebens) erlebt: Ich verliere deutlich, campe aber nicht und tunnele auch niemanden, was bekomme ich im Afterchat? \"hattest Du Spaß? Mir macht es jedenfalls immer Spaß solche Noobs wie Dich zu verarschen, geh sterben.\" (frei aus dem englischen übersetzt)\nJEDER, der dieses Spiel mehr als 20 Stunden gespielt hat, kennt diese Art von Nachrichten im Afterchat zur Genüge.\n3. Es gibt natürlich auch ausgeglichene Runden in denen nicht getrollt, nicht ge-T-baggt und im Afterchat nicht geflamed wird. Diese Runden machen meiner Erfahrung nach maximal 5% aus ...\n\nBesonders der 2. Punkt (die Community) stört mich mittlerweile so sehr, dass ich das Spiel nicht weiter spielen werde. Kein Mensch möchte ständig beleidigt, geflamed oder aber schon im Spiel verarscht werden. Leider ist diese Community sprichwörtlich das Letzte und ich hoffe, dass dieses Spiel noch sehr lange existiert und die Community dort bleibt - denn dann begegne ich ihr nie wieder . . .","timestamp_created":1586883600,"timestamp_updated":1586883600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702630162239074707","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67308280","author":{"steamid":"76561198318111105","num_games_owned":8549,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1646292054},"language":"english","review":"⣀⣾⣿⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠟⠛⠋⠉⠉⠉⠉⠙⠛⢿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠛⠛⠛⠛⠓⠤⠄\n⣿⣿⣧⣭⣿⣿⣋⡀⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄ ⠄🔴 ⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄ 🔴 ⠄⠄⢸\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣤⣤⣤⣀⣀⣤⣤⣴⣾⣦⣤⣤⣤⣤⣤⣤⣤⣤⡶⠋","timestamp_created":1586883413,"timestamp_updated":1586883413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67308209","author":{"steamid":"76561198141275156","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3997,"last_played":1651335338},"language":"english","review":"A good source of adrenaline rush!","timestamp_created":1586883328,"timestamp_updated":1586883328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67308154","author":{"steamid":"76561198126230893","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":21211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15760,"last_played":1653112596},"language":"english","review":"If you have played Dead by Daylight since it's been released, you'll know how much it's been through. The developers haven't always been the best at speaking the truth to their fanbase, glitches have run rampant for far too long, and there's been plenty of issue beyond those aforementioned. \n\nDespite all of this, Dead by Daylight has got to be one of the best games I've ever played. The deceptively simple structure of gameplay is absolutely unpredictable due to the amount of killers and survivors, perks and offerings, and the players and assorted playstyles. Honestly, I can say that every game I've been in has differed somewhat from the last. \n\nDead by Daylight is in a category of its own. I'd classify it as a horror survival game, but it seems to defy generalization at every turn. It's a scary game, but I've laughed my ass of as one of my friends turns the corner only to come kissing distance with the Hillbilly. The playstyles are endless. Based on situational happenstance, you try and stealth your way around the map, and clutch your breath in your throat as the killer passes not inches from your character, or you can head guns-a-blazin' towards the killer, pallet slamming them at every corner. \n\nGod, I love this game!","timestamp_created":1586883276,"timestamp_updated":1586883276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507874011993408203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67307412","author":{"steamid":"76561198178305563","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":79158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40358,"last_played":1655775449},"language":"english","review":"This game is so good i have to tunnel it...","timestamp_created":1586882502,"timestamp_updated":1586882502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67306229","author":{"steamid":"76561198965870529","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":325,"last_played":1613057499},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam gierkę","timestamp_created":1586881317,"timestamp_updated":1586881317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iOnfvPECda/ggAI="}
