The hunters are pretty cool too with my favorite being the hillbilly the chainsaw is scary. The other two both have unique qualities to them as well.

But when you change the balance of the game you don't super buff the killer, nerf all of the servivor perks, nerf the survivor movement.\n\nThere was a problem with survivors DCing from games. So they made it so the Killer gets rewarded if a survivor leaves. The other survivors on the team? No they derank when one of their ally leaves and they inevitably lose.\n\nDid I mention I'm a rank 2 survivor? Yeah I constantly get ranked with rank 20 survivors. I don't think I've seen another Rank 1. Oh wait I have and the killer can see the survivor ranks but the survivors can't see what the killers rank is. So the killer just leaves the lobby if he sees to many high ranked survivors.\n\nBasically a game starts then my rank 20 allies are dead in 2 minutes. I have 3 generators left to fix solo and on a rare grace of god occasion I find the trap door. Even if I  babysit my rank 20 allies to the end of the game eventually i'm going to get caught because I can't do everything and survivor nerfs mean you can't escape. Then the killer just sits and stares at me on the hook until I'm dead giving my allies no opportunity to save me.\n\nIf I was playing with people my own rank I wouldn't mind the nerfs because at least as a team we could overcome but the discordant noob teams literally just ruin the game and throw an even bigger nerf to survivors.

Não vejo muita diferença da versão BETA para o que estamos jogando agora. Às vezes isso atrapalha um pouco a diversão, mas não é algo que me de vontade de parar de jogar ou até mesmo ter me arrependido da compra.\n\nO que mais me deixou desanimada foi o fato de não poder jogar ranqueada com os amigos ou até mesmo ser sobrevivente com eles.\nPor exemplo: eu e meu amigo compramos e até agora só conseguimos jogar uma Private Match que foi 1vs1. Além de tudo, isso não vale nada. Vejo Dead By Daylight como um jogo que pra ser ainda mais divertido - até engraçado ou tenso - você precisa estar com seus amigos, um ajudando o outro e transmitindo a mesma tensão. É horrível quando o assassino te coloca no gancho, fica \"guardando caixão\" e alguém vem tentar te salvar mas acaba morrendo junto. Tipo... Falta de comunicação.\n\nTenho problemas pra entrar no lobby e só consigo jogar uma partida depois de 10 minutos tentando. Entra na sala, mas quando dou ready, volta pra tela do personagem. Isso é outro ponto que incomoda bastante.\n\nSe você for comprar o jogo, esteja ciente de tudo que citei acima antes de xingar os desenvolvedores.

Some times of night it takes a while to join a game so the servers might be having trouble keeping up but the game has never crashed on me and some times like 1 out of 30 games I woulld say have been laggy some times not a problem but one time my character was moving the killer was like 20 feet away and then I jumped through a window and got downed when he had to have been like 15 feet away but besides the rare glitch or lag this game is perfect like really 9.5 outta 10 if they add voice chat without it like 9.0 outta 10! Hope this helps anyone deciding on buying this game the devs have been releasing patches which is nice to see that they want their game to do well!","timestamp_created":1467561103,"timestamp_updated":1467561103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24052393","author":{"steamid":"76561198041383159","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1587039495},"language":"russian","review":"Разработчики потрудились сделать ту игру, которую многие игроки ждали и дождались.

It has a mixture of intensity, strategy and excitement.\n\nYou can either play as a hunter which hunts 4 survivors or be one of the 4 who are hunted.Your objective as a survivor is to escape through one of two main gates which must be powered by a certain amount of generators.You have to repair these generators without being cought. \n\nOh, did I forget to mention that if you get cought by the hunter , you can be hung by him if you cant wiggle out of his grasp.Your team can either save you or continue with repairing the generators. If you happen to be last alive by deaths of your team or by them escaping , you can escape through a secret hatch if you manage to find it.\n\nThe game has a very good upgrade system with which you can unlock items to be used in games as well as perks.I am yet to find different clothing for characters which may come through an update later in the game.\n\nThis game does have a few bugs which do affect the game a little but the good qualities outweigh the bad.
