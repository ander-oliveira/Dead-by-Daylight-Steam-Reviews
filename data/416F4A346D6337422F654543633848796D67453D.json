Кривая оптимизация, отвратительные хитбоксы, баги, которые чинятся долго или не чинятся вовсе, проблемы с матчметингами(подбор, бесконечные загрузки, неизвестные ошибки. Закрывала глаза на все эти проблемы и косяки разрабов первые 2 к часов, но с меня хватит, все. Игра НЕ ЧИНИТСЯ АБСОЛЮТНО, выпускаются одни высерные главы, у которых способности смешанные со старыми главами, ничего интересного. Когда вышел Легион, то я поняла что это провал, но в глубине души я все таки надеялась на годноту, верила что дальше будут годные главы и игру починят, но нет. Бхвр ссаный не играет в собственную игру, они все меняют по прихотям плачущих анскиллов. Кормят обещаниями(пример: обещали выпустить выделенные сервера к лету, но в итоге они были выпущены только к осени, и то они кривые, за 3 года не сделать  адекватные сервера, нормально? Нет конечно). Конкретные лжецы(пример: говорили, что никаких клоунов и монстров, в итоге выпускают клоуна и Демогоргона б.лядь). Я разочарована, очень, ведь я до сих пор люблю эту игру, за хорошие воспоминания, за лор, он прекрасен,  но отношения создателей этого свинарника полный отстой, поэтому она заслуживает название \"мусор\".\nМнение о гемплее:  интересный и впечатляющий, но однообразный, особенно за сурвов. За киллеров можно разнообразить его, потому что у каждого своя уникальная  способность, зато за сурвов можно поиграть с друзьями по связи, позабавиться, расслабиться. Хочу отметить еще о комьюннити в данной клоаке - это неадекватные анимешники, токсики и просто свора ноющих олухов, которые не умеют думать здраво и самое печальное, что люди в этой игре не хотят ничему учиться, абсолютно. Разрабы разумеется, слушают ту аудиторию, которая  больше всех ноет, ноет на баланс, на какие либо способности киллеров, чаще всего визжат сурвики, яркий пример: новички наныли на Порчу:погибель. Этот перк был мастхевом для всех убийц, особенно против дискордного пати. Даже если его ломали за минуту, он хоть как то выигрывал время, а у киллера каждая секунда - это  золотое выигранное время. Нынешняя порча теперь абсолютно бесполезна, даже на зеленых рангах.  Разрабы совершенно  не подумали о тех, кто играет на красных рангах, а зачем? Возвращаемся к тому, что игроки не хотят учиться играть, попадать в отличные скиллчеки. О общении в чате после катки: ничего хорошего, непостоянно попадаются конечно такие индивиды, которые пишут \"gg ez\" или обычные гадости, но словесный поток обычно исходит от сурвов в сторону  хукеров. Маньяки меньше вые.бываются, это лично я заметила за все 3 к часов.\nДумаю, стоит усугубиться более детально о гемплее:  мне нравилось играть за обе стороны одинаково, но думать нужно чаще за киллеров, ведь многое зависит от тебя, но не все. За сурвов нужно надеяться скорее больше на команду, ну и на свои умения собственно. Больше половины перков - шлак, но с ними можно порофлить и собирать билды, это мало кому интересно к сожалению и больишнство играет с одинаковым набором перков (адреналин, часы, осколок, перк на усталость).\nУмозаключение: не рекомендую на данный момент игру, в ней слишком много проблем, которые не исправляются, у них в конторе куча людей, но игра до сих пор сделана из гов.на и палок, 3 года делалось адекватное лобби(раньше надо было постоянно приглашать друзей после катки), 3 года делались выделенные сервера, и то они работают через жопу, оптимизация на дне, с каждым патчем все хуже, даже на средних пк относительно у достаточно игроков лагает, на минималках еле дотягивает 30. Не уж то за 3 года это не исправить? Раньше рекомендовала эту игру, так как была хомячком, которой все утраивало, розовые очки скажем так, причем на проблемы натыкалась в упор, но мне норм было го.внеца похавать.

I thought I update it the review. Then I read my review over, and everything is still the same. The ranking system needs some work - it actually dont believe the hype THERE IS NO MATCH MAKING SYSTEM. Survivors rank up way to quick, they are the more vocal majority, the game is stacked for them. I play both survivor and killer, and I can tell you, survivor is easy street. If you are not piping, you really just need to get better as a survivor. , The queue times were crazy but now its fixed because there is no matching system.  They still have bugs though, and keep rushing new content, I get it that its a business and you need to keep moving forward. But I feel the new content they need to do is take the current game and add a different game mode, maybe using some of the previous events or instead of fixing gens that they have two killers, and all the survivors have to do is get totems. Or go more outside the current game and have a keep away with a item or something. Just to freshen up instead of just new survivors and new killers. \n\nTheir is still some long lasting bugs, which the Developers can't figure it out - spaghetti code. This is a great cat and mouse game. Anyone who plays SWF has to know they have the advantage that they carry a great deal of perks extra (just based on the ability to communicate). Some people only play with SWF groups think they are great players but really are not when put into a random PUG (all their supports fall away they fall flat on their face). Survivor swf groups should give a bonus to killers, lets be honest the developers could at least do that. But they don't want to admit that swf groups are talking, so why not just voice in the game for everyone. But swf groups were the money is, were the players are at. But that is why killer queue takes 2 seconds to get a game, and survivor queue takes so long. Eventually they will swing the other way hard to encourage more killer play, then it will swing the other. I highly doubt the game will every be balanced. But since swf has been in since the start of the game, you think they would at the very least give bonus blood points to the killer (I am a killer who doesn't care about blood points [700 hours all killers maxed level and multiple times at that] but hey at least its something for others). But developers have said on multiple ocassions. If you got a complaint play something else.  - Waiting for a competitor game to come along now.

If killers didnt feel so bullied by people running Borrowed Time, Desisive Strike Sprint Burst and so on, then survivors would feel less pressure to run these perks. Now as for gameplay i find the game to be pretty fluid (at the lowest settings) and the mechanics are probably a key element to this game. But as someone who just wants a fun experience I cant have that when im running meh perks. I have played killer and i have to say it was very enjoyable when nobody has great perks and you had to rely on stealth and skill instead of how well you can run around pallets or desperatly tunnel one person just for a kill. This does not mean the game isnt enjoyable, however it does mean that i am not enjoying it 75% of the time.
