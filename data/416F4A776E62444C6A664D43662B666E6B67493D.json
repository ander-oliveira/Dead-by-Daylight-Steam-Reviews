It's a fast paced frenzy when you are running from the killer and deep unsettling tension when you can't see them at all. The fact that the killer is also a player makes for a fun aspect. I've been against killers who just have fun with the mechanics, killers that let the last survivor go and show mercy if the game was a slaughter, and killers who are so sweaty the game is over in a few minutes as they mercilessly hunt you all down with no quarter. All are fun to play against in their own way.\nThe levelling up process is dynamic and different for each survivor and killer, making each level 50 build different by the time you reach it.\n\nPlaying the killer on the other hand gives you a feeling of power unlike most other games. Knowing that, if you are good enough, the players are completely at your mercy... Or if the players are organised enough, they will make a complete mockery out of you; Duking, dodging and stunning the ever loving Bejesus out of you. Regardless of the game type always end with a wholesome GG in the after game chat. This brings me to my last point...\n\nThe community, especially in the higher ranks is utter human trash most of the time. All acting like prepubescent, freckled step-children who's father didn't give them the belt enough when they were younger. If you happen to be the only survivor, despite your best efforts, having saved many from the hook and personally repaired many generators. Prepare for comments on your profile calling you a 'Hatch camper, traitor, point hunter, useless scumbag'. Just be content knowing if you receive any comment like this...

I really like the characters and the art style but aesthetic can only get you so far. I have never played a game where everyone in the community is at each other's throats. I mean you cannot say anything bad about this game without someone calling you trash. \n\nGameplay\nThe game play itself can be fun when people aren't being toxic, I'll get to that later. This game has a very cat and mouse type of chase system and it's fun chasing or being chased. Now that being said, the chases in this game are very often gimped by bad map design or bad map generation. Some games you can have a loop last over all 5 gens just because the map layout was really good. Some games you go down instantly because you ran into a deadzone where no pallets spawned. \n\nBuild Customization\nOne of the main things that drawed me into this game was making different builds. This game really allows you to find a build you like with the killer's you like and I find that fun. What i don't find fun is the grind. So for me, I like Blight and Oni. For me to get the build I like, with the perks I like, with the addons I like, for both killers, that takes MILLIONS of BP, not even factoring in prestiging. The grind in this game mirrors F2P games but with a P2P model. Ik that the entry cost is fairly cheap, but you need to have majority of the DLC just to have a good/fun build that you like. Another thing I don't like is the meta. I really wish i could utilize the customization but in this game, you really cannot. Almost everyone runs the same builds with slight modifications and if you try something new, you will be stomped. \n\nCosmetic Customization\nThe customization in DBD is really good if you have money. The devs are very strict with in game purchases and there are really not a lot of cosmetic sales. The Prestige skins used to be really cool but now I can become Karampus or a Minotar, so having some blood splashed on you really doesn't give the same effect.\n\nDevs\nThe devs are going to get their own category because I think they need it. I have never seen such incompetent devs in my life. I'm not expecting them to be pros at their own game, I just want them to know what they are talking about. It seems like the devs have really just clocked out and doing the bare minimum to keep the community from collapsing in on itself. Devs will often ask for feedback and never do anything with the info. They will add things into the game that make literally no sense and add nothing to the game whatsoever. They nerf and buff things without thinking it through, causing many items or perks to be disabled because they broke the game. And the worst part is how they don't want any help. Many youtubers have offered to work for them as an insider voice, making sure their decisions are the right ones, but the devs never reach out. All of their reps, Fog Whisperers, are insanely toxic and rude to their fanbases ( Except of Paulie, he's doing a good job). \n\nI didn't want this review to sound winey or overdone but after just under 455 hours, I really don't want people to get sucked into the cesspool that is this game. Spend your money elsewhere or wait for VHS to come out.","timestamp_created":1593896215,"timestamp_updated":1634769239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72046526","author":{"steamid":"76561198985214017","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1593895700},"language":"english","review":"It

However, it does come with major downsides that for some could make the game incredibly unpleasant or even downright unplayable. Now, I do love this game despite my complaints, but that is largely in spite of a lot of things not because of them. I also play killer and survivor equally, for perspective.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- Sound design is great.\n- Incredibly fun to play in custom games with friends.\n- Not only does survivor and killer offer a different play style but different killers do too so there is a lot to learn and lots of room to grow as player.\n- Some really nice content relating to horror franchises that if you're a fan of will make you incredibly happy.\n- There is an in-game currency that you can use to purchase new killers/survivors/extras if you don't want to spend money, but the DLC is also reasonably priced.\n- Maps offer great variety and there is just enough randomisation to keep them fresh.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- One of the most toxic online games you will ever play. Mostly for killers, but all are fair game. Ranges from post-game chat abuse to players queuing with the sole intention of making the game as unpleasant as possible for everyone else in it.\n- Lots of trolling/farming with other players having no intention to actually play the game. When queue times can be in excess of 15-20 minutes for killer at times, when you do get into a game and it's one of those it gets old quick.\n- Matchmaking is flawed and will pit you with/against high level players from your first game.\n- The game and player base at large is unforgiving towards new players. I advise learning as much as you can about the game before you play.\n\nIn short, it's a fun game but while the devs continue to turn a blind eye to the issues within the community and make no attempt to address or fix them, there will likely come a point where the game just stops being fun for you. The problems with the game don't have to do with the game itself, but rather the community and how bad behaviour is left unchecked - there is no real way to report toxicity and the devs don't seem to care so it's no surprise it's got so bad. I would recommend playing on a free weekend or getting it cheap on sale before purchasing full price as it really is that much of a game
