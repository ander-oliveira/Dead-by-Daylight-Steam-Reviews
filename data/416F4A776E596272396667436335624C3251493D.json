juego es entretenido. Está muy bien hecho, las mecánicas iniciales son creativas e inteligentes, las gráficas son buenas y el sonido también. Es genial que lo sigan actualizando con nuevos supervivientes y asesinos cada tanto, así como con gráficos novedosos y dignos del juego. Uno siente que los desarrolladores escuchan y apoyan a la comunidad. Muchas de las personas que juegan este juego son muy amables; buscan divertirse y ser justos para que el juego fluya. El juego es adictivo y las partidas no se sienten eternas porque uno siente la emoción y el peligro en cada una. Algo que puede ser visto como positivo o negativo es que se basa mucho en el trabajo en equipo. Jugar con amigos generalmente es bastante divertido.\n\nContras:\nAlgunas dinámicas pueden ser explotadas y Algunas ventajas de asesino o de superviviente están un poco rotas (teniendo en cuenta el hecho de que pueden combinarse ventajas de varios asesinos en uno solo después de desbloquearlas completamente. Y para los supervivientes igual). Jugar una partida toma demasiado tiempo si uno juega tarde; encontrar partidas toma normalmente de 4 a 8 minutos si uno juega a la media noche. Por otro lado, al medio día encuentra partidas después de 1 minuto. No hay forma de rendirse, entonces cuando algunos compañeros se desconectan, se complica un poco porque toca casi que esperar a que el asesino/ente te mate, pero algunos asesinos son amables y te permiten escapar en esas situaciones.","timestamp_created":1618882202,"timestamp_updated":1624346201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90605800","author":{"steamid":"76561199131748339","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1924,"last_played":1656911193},"language":"english","review":"very good if you good","timestamp_created":1618882202,"timestamp_updated":1618882202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90605686","author":{"steamid":"76561199007460486","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1981,"last_played":1659165185},"language":"english","review":"It is fun and exciting.

review is something I've really had to debate whether or not I wanted to talk about, but here we go. Coming from someone who has played the game since late 2017 (around November of that year if you want to get into specifics), I've most certainly seen a handful of this game's ups and downs and I've for sure experienced how addictive it is. In total I probably have around 1400 hours between console and PC, and from this time I've learned to just not really care about what the devs do to the game; I've just learned to accept the fact that sometimes there will be fixes and other times there wont be. Personally I feel that this game gets more hate than it deserves, at least in recent times, and all I can say to those of you reading this is that you shouldn't try to point out what the developers have done wrong and get upset about it. No game is perfect and that most certainly includes this steaming cluster-fuck, but rather than get upset about it just try to enjoy it for what it is because whether you like it or not I'm sure you've made memories down the line thanks to this game, bugs and all. For those of you considering purchasing this game, I recommend it because even if you don't have a party to banter with and share the experience of Dead By Daylight together, I promise you that you will have no greater feeling of bliss after successfully pulling off your first 360 or moonwalk (that is if they still even work anymore lmao)","timestamp_created":1618876658,"timestamp_updated":1618876658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90602901","author":{"steamid":"76561198940066014","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3543,"last_played":1657936515},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1618876640,"timestamp_updated":1618876640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90602886","author":{"steamid":"76561198317416921","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1655438071},"language":"english","review":"Gaming\n","timestamp_created":1618876615,"timestamp_updated":1618876615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90602819","author":{"steamid":"76561198102431218","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":100956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1902,"playtime_at_review":9221,"last_played":1660360510},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bueno pero banean hasta por jugar una ptb","timestamp_created":1618876448,"timestamp_updated":1618876448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505617976188659668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90602280","author":{"steamid":"76561198354504378","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44324,"last_played":1656477767},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy divertido, ya lo llevo jugando meses y aún me falta aprender.

And i don't really care.\n\nthe biggest problem have with this game comes from the developers side. They are awful. they're always changing bits and pieces that was previously great or a mildly annoying element that wouldn't have really ''needed'' a change to begin with. like the new UI, the new animations, add ons, changes to certain offerings etc. some of those things which in my opinion were already at it's peak. and not only that but, every time they fix a glitch, 6 new ones always appear. and sometimes the SAME exact glitch from a previous version, will come back in a newer patch/update. If these points i've come up with don't spark something in you or weren't enough, then hear my last critique. 99 percent of the time, you're gonna have to put up with it, cause the developers don't care for your opinion. so if  you ask me if I would recommend this game, then the answer is yes and no, if you can tolerate/endure the things i've talked about, then yes I recommend this game, and would love for you to try it. this game is really addicting. if not, find something else, because this game is not for you.\n\nPS sorry for any grammer mistakes that might have interfered with your understanding of my text/critique, I am afterall writing this in a very annoyed state of mind.","timestamp_created":1618861634,"timestamp_updated":1637264268,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190507411956787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnYbr9fgCc5bL2QI="}
