Которая прекрасно может скрасить ваш досуг. Однако, существует ряд проблем которые, по моему скромному мнению, заводят игру в тупик, медленно, но верно.\n\nПодробнее о +/-\n+Интересный сеттинг - сам формат который уже давно успели избить, в фильмах и прочих художественных произведениях, в игре обрел свежее дыхание и не выглядит вычурным.\n+Затягивающий геймплей - простой и не разнообразный, но, все равно, затягивающий!\n+Веселый и увлекательный кооператив - разнообразные тактики с друзьями, троллинг маньяка или наоборот, все можно реализовать с парочкой друзей.\n\n-Нет разнообразия в классах, они формальны - когда вы только начинаете, да, классы (выжившие) имеют значения, каждый выделяется своей предрасположенностью в тех или иных вещах, помогая при грамотной командной игре привести вас к красивой и увлекательной победе, в дальнейшем, при получение перков которые способны изучить все, они теряют абсолютно всю индивидуальность. Спринт? Адреналин? Самолечение? Удар в спину? Все эти перки от разных выживших вы легко запихнете в одного.\n\n-Полное отсутствие баланса - вытекает из первого минуса, из-за модели которую избрали разработчики, мы не просто потеряли индивидуальность и возможность складывать разные сильные стороны, разных выживших, чтобы придти к победе, но и получили чудовищные имба билды, на момент написания, для выживших, это Спринт+Адреналин+Удар в спину+Самолечение, для маньяков, соответственно, свои, у них так же есть имба билды. В итоге, командная игра превращается, на 90%, в соло забеги под спринтами и тд, и тп, без особой надобности коммуницировать со своей командой.\n\n-Чудовищная неиграбельность некоторых классов маньяков - Вытекает из первых двух минусов, к сожалению, вся игра строится буквально на 2 классах, на момент написания отзыва Траппер и Деревенщина, реже, Майерс и Призрак, Медсестра попадается с частотой нахождения кейса с миллионом долларов на пороге своего дома.\n\n-Количество разнообразных багов - в данный момент, правда, их стало гораздо меньше, но все еще очень много.\n\n-Отсутствует система репортов - читы, я вашу мамку ласкал и прочие прелести \"взрослого\" комьюнити данной игры. На момент написания мнения системы репортов еще НЕ БЫЛО.\n\nВ итоге хочется сказать следующее, надеюсь, что разработчики реабилитируют 80% контента который, по выше описанным причинам, игроки не используют и в будущем мы будем видеть разнообразных маньяков, а не 1-2, и разнообразные билды с перками, а не как сейчас, 1 имба билд на выжившего, 1 имба билд на маньяка. Не успели собрать нужные перки?

Typically the balancing of the game is screwed up in one way or another. Most players would have you thinking the game is agonizing and they'd be right. Solo survivor is one of the worse experiences in this game if not the worst, while surviving with friends is one of the most fun experiences. Killer is hit or miss usually. Climbing your way towards the higher ranks means harder and more annoying survivors, you really must use all time stopping tools.In my opinion they're is a steep learning curb for this game, but very little mechanical skill involved.There's various terms and communication humps you have to pass, having an experienced friend helps the rough beginnings in this game as well .I Would not recommend killer to people who tend to get overwhelmed easily as you have a more than a full plate as killer. Survivors on the other hand are almost the complete opposite with times you'll be doing almost nothing ,but waiting for skill checks, and if you're getting slugged you literally have nothing but crawling to do.

I find games almost instantly with no waiting. From time to time you will get killers from other parts of the world that will give you a bad game experience, but that is a given. It does not happen as often as before, but it still happens. The game still has promise, and is still fun to play. I am a survivor main, but love to change it up from time to time and play as the killer. My only concern are the levels, I wish the levels were more thought of carefully. Most of them are repetative, same shit but diff name and slightly different look. When you think of a Junk yard, you would expect a junkyard, not some open field with cars laid out creating a jungle gym. I remember as a kid growing up, junkyards were mazes that I would walk through with my father. An asylum is suppose to be a huge hosipital like facilty, from the time you walk in to the place your skin starts to crawl all over the place, but no instead you get this stupid circle in the middle of the map, and they slap on a Penn. Asylum name on it. The levels are not original, if anything poorly thought up. If the developers ACTUALLY took the time to put in effort in all of the levels, we would have an f-cking amazing game in our hand. The swamp was almost perfect, until I noticed that they added the same stupid small shack out in the SWAMPS! There are broken down WOODEN shacks out in swamps, not f-cking tin houses. I hope one day the levels get re-done to what they should really reflect, but that is a wish that might never come true. Maybe in the sequel they will do it right? In the end I recommend this game as it is fun, and always a challenge. \nI give is a 8/10 and nothing more due to poor level design, and no imagination for level design.\nSo grab the game and get hooked, literally, and pray that someone takes you off that hook!","timestamp_created":1481330795,"timestamp_updated":1493934082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528795838356018066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28279583","author":{"steamid":"76561197992433043","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2376,"last_played":1582320388},"language":"german","review":"Thx for destoying this game.\n\nSeit the Hag ist das Spiel ziemliches Glück.\n\nDa ist Michael Myers ja harmlos dagegen...schade!\nOhne diese Sonderscheiße hat das Spiel Spaß gemacht.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1481329820,"timestamp_updated":1481329820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489889264106750488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28279417","author":{"steamid":"76561198341968975","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":36295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":94,"playtime_at_review":2963,"last_played":1659816021},"language":"russian","review":"игра класс советую!","timestamp_created":1481328811,"timestamp_updated":1481328811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28279393","author":{"steamid":"76561198304151937","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1269,"last_played":1511169810},"language":"schinese","review":"这个新女怪得改，增加画标记的时间，并且在钩子下话的时候是能救人的。本来就是个守尸怪，还这么多bug,弄个举报系统，弄一堆没用的，只要一条举报 ，就是举报不要脸的守尸怪。真是脸贴脸不带动的，草了。这游戏，这么游戏没法玩了。","timestamp_created":1481328692,"timestamp_updated":1481328692,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499500513076782227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28278885","author":{"steamid":"76561198080887713","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2764,"last_played":1498044442},"language":"english","review":"Old: 0/10\nNew: 8/10\n\n#3 Update: after another gamebreak about 1-2 months they have fixed the bug that you cant join\ngames.
