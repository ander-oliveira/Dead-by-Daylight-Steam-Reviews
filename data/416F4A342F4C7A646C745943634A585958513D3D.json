I got more spooked by the Left 4 Deads then this game so the jump scare angle doesnt really anything to make up for the bland gameplay... Im sure theres more too it. But Im just not seeing it myself.\nI'd imagine killer gameplay is far more entertaining then survivors but after queueing up with friends (the matchmaking is pretty bad in the game right now but I'm not docking points for that largely because its unfortunatly par for the course anymore and we WERE able to get into a few games) If I'd be stuck playing survivors in order to play with my friends then I'd rather hoist myself up on the killers hooks myself.","timestamp_created":1469687357,"timestamp_updated":1469687357,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523580253124237061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24569566","author":{"steamid":"76561198197612535","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":11880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10326,"last_played":1658012996},"language":"russian","review":"в жопу баланс для манов, конечно, да. \nв целом игра топ, однако каждое длс добавляет имбового убийцу, которого успевают занерфить только к выходу следующего .","timestamp_created":1469687157,"timestamp_updated":1592862108,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24569556","author":{"steamid":"76561198044284044","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1469686764},"language":"english","review":"Not yet.

And  the bad far outweighs the good. \n\nThe dark storyline, as vague as it was actually pretty cool.  I'm a huge  cosmic horror fan and  I'm thrilled to finally see the genre get some love  in  the more recent years.   \n\nThis  was a genre making game along with it's cousins, Friday the 13th, Evolved, and Last year.  The  group v monster  is  fun in concept,  but if your not careful you can have a very sloppy execution.  Something Dbd tends to skid on it's face alot with since  it's early days and it's only gotten worse  as the community has aged. \n\nWith  Group V Monster games, balancing  correctly is a huge issue.  \nFor Dbd in particular, this game  favors   the killers heavily and zeros in on points and  a highly competive atmostphere.  I do not like this .  But then again I'm not competitive by nature so take   the dependancy on a point system with a grain of skeptical salt.  If your into that thing, this game could be for you. \n\nIn the game, if you are a survivor  now  a days you'll probably find yourself  the subject of  a tunneling camping killer.   \n\nTunneling is when  you are basically  mowed down  by a killer until you are dead.   This means injuring you, putting you on a hook,  usually  diddling  around  near by ( 8 or 12 feet which is camping  I don't care what any of you guys think) ( When you can move as  quickly as most of the killers  it's  still an enormously @**h*** move #fightme)   until one your friends pulls you off a hook to get points and your injured self is  a target again and the process  is repeated into your  dead by being hooked.   Which honestly wouldn't be so bad except ( well no... it is bad from start to finish never mind.)   \n\nGranted I'm not saying   that  hard focusing on a player in a game  should be against the rules.  But  after  the  20th game in the cycle where you see this behavior either against you or  one of your  fellow team mates,   the charming unpleasantness that you dug into this game for   just stops being charming.  It  starts being irksome.\n\n Then you really start  hating everyone that's elected  to play a killer.  But  honestly is  it really their  fault they're playing killer now?  Why are they playing killer? Probably because  the Dev's have made it next to impossiable to  escape as a  survivor and they just want some points  dammit.    They would never admit this though because  the troll like  portion  of the killer  mains  that  enjoy  camping  and  tunneling for the sheer purpose of  making survivors mad ( you know who you are)  will accuse you of being salty and  numerous instructions   of them telling you to \"git gud noob\" .  Then you start  remembering  the  few and far between matches that  you actually had fun in.  At first they were  2 in five roughly.. then  2 in six.. then 1 in eight.  Then  the number stretches from there while you  witness all  the  toxic  crap the killers  continue  pile on you because you are a survivor, and thusly aren't here to enjoy the game. Your here to  give them points.  So tunnel tunnel camp ... ded.  \n\nThen  it starts being  incredably tiresome.    Then you start to notice the   enormous grind  of the game.  The points you need to gather to purchase  things like perks for your character  become very noticable.  \n\nSupposedly  the  survivors can be toxic.  I don't know, I admit freely I only played a killer  a few times and I can believe this.    When I do  offer to get lunch for the entity   I did  notice the survivors  tended to crowd  around  the hook,  seemingly not noticing  I could see them quite plainly as I was dropping their friend on their hook.   And yes, afterward I was accused of camping. I've been in groups were  t-bagging the killer was a thing in the era of palette spam . I'll readily admit I've done it  once or twice   just to get the killer to chase me.  Next to the palette spam it was one of the only things I could do  to in my defense and have my teams back.Obviously  this isn't a thing anymore with almost all of the palettes  gone from the game . Along with a harsh  window leap  option   so if your a survivor you only have the option of leaping through a window twice.  Wish they would  up that at least, I understand why it was put in kind of. It got kind of tiresome having  to chase a survivor in circles. But  it just kicks the teeth in of the rare  persons that didn't do that. ( I didn't or at least tried not to. I got my ass handed to me a lot but  my main focus was   making sure the killers were having fun. Back then.  I was  pretty naive and assumed most of the killers felt the same. ) \n\nSo  in short, both sides  are toxic.   The killers way more so, because they have the favor of  the devs, and most of every update you'll notice is  killer mains either  crabbing because the survivors got a tiny  boost, or  them  gloating because the killers  got  up upgraded and  something on the survivor side got nerfed.  Again.  And again.    I've noticed   alot of gloating lately and   enormous joy of  making  the survivors salty.  Like  just  an uncomfortable amount of  ill will  towards the opposition usually in the  forums.  \n\nI'm all for  killers having a huge leg up against  survivors.  That's  part of playing the part in a horror movie right? Traditionally only one or two survive.  But  when none  survive,  and all  I hear after a match  how easy it was  to camp me or my friend and  we  lose  the points needed to  purchase items and upgrade ourselves with ( unless we want to spend money on a toxic repetitive game #paytoplay)  and  if we  are pissed because  this is the  20th killer in a row that night to play this way   we are  just being salty....  well.. it just  stops being  fun.  I suppose I could reinstall ,  go over to killer and  experience  all the toxicity   the  survivors  in the game have to offer. But  I've  gotten to 1st rank before in the survivor character  that I enjoyed playing and that was enough for me. \n\n  I think  would rather just get off my computer, step out of the fog  put on some ambient music and  curl up with some tea outside.   I think I'll go do that, and enjoy the day light.  Cheers all.","timestamp_created":1469683450,"timestamp_updated":1562542841,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504291832447052002","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24568989","author":{"steamid":"76561198039032145","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1471557714},"language":"english","review":"if this is really a team game then the party should get points even if one person makes it, to easy for the hunter","timestamp_created":1469683400,"timestamp_updated":1469683400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24568884","author":{"steamid":"76561198133637482","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1524714481},"language":"english","review":"this game is broken. it's an early access game without the label. matchmaking can just sometimes not work for no apparent reaosn at all. no party system forces you to play with complete strangers who go about on their own way while you walk around aimlessly. not to mention the ONLY player who can host the game is the killer. incredible balancing issues, hilarious and stupid glitches, a broken rank system, and a hacker's paradise. buy this game in 15 years when it's finally out of early access. or you have 5 other friends who don't mind a buggy mess.","timestamp_created":1469682716,"timestamp_updated":1469682716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24568718","author":{"steamid":"76561198048278757","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1585791635},"language":"english","review":"This is maybe 20% of a game.

If you can get over the lobby system and don't mind a long wait the game is worth it.","timestamp_created":1469676799,"timestamp_updated":1469676799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24567831","author":{"steamid":"76561198193688175","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1937,"last_played":1584746104},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игра \n","timestamp_created":1469676430,"timestamp_updated":1469676430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24567808","author":{"steamid":"76561198098030355","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9508,"last_played":1508737492},"language":"schinese","review":"能管管外挂么？我屠夫一刀追不上一个人类 而且是越追越远 直线距离。","timestamp_created":1469676323,"timestamp_updated":1469676323,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546124637126922607","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24567694","author":{"steamid":"76561198320052356","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":50110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1604240920},"language":"schinese","review":"看了很多直播才买了这个游戏，挺刺激的，但还有待改进，游戏中还是有比较多的BUG出现，并且语言设置为中文后，角色的英文名无法显示；另外个人等级说明不清，引导过程不足。","timestamp_created":1469675550,"timestamp_updated":1469675550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455215632915496826","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24567465","author":{"steamid":"76561198117566943","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":24493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4908,"last_played":1605629185},"language":"english","review":"gud game would bell again","timestamp_created":1469674276,"timestamp_updated":1469674276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24567413","author":{"steamid":"76561198140882857","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1636801976},"language":"english","review":"K this game has glitches or bugs or whatever.

I've left my old review below which you can take a look at, although I don't actually think it's much helpful today. That being said, Behavior Interactive's stance towards this game is actually mindboggling. They are insistent on making the game buggier every single patch since they're completely unwilling to spend development time untangling their spaghetti-code. They only development time they spend on anything that isn't directly related to printing money is visual updates, since large graphical updates probably bring in new players and keep the game looking fresh for them. It's painful because Dead by Daylight has a lot of potential to be a good game, it's just that the developers are complacent keeping players perpetually frustrated with it because it's more profitable to do so. The Play the Beta they released for this patch brought in a ton of critique before it released and not a single major complaint was addressed before it went live. The only reason DBD is successful in its current form IMO is because there's no other meaningful competition with this particular type of gameplay. As such, I can't recommend this game, and it's the reason that despite my absolutely astounding amount of hours I haven't spent a single penny on this game beyond the initial purchase. They have proven that they don't deserve my money. I hope if you're reading this, you also take a similar stance in rejecting any paid content they inject into this game. Yes, that includes new killers, survivors, etc. Thanks for reading!\n\nOLD REVIEW: (Yikes, I was even saltier back then.)\n\nTo sum up Dead by Daylight (DBD) in a nutshell:\n\n-really wanted to recover instead of hop through escape hatch, thx game\n\n-really enjoy constant survivor nerfs cuzz 2 OP 2 EZ\n\n-really like killing 3-4 people on average when I play killer, much fun\n\n-horrendous UI problems over a month into the game, seriously?\n\n-developers that vehemently argue that flashlight is useful in the hands in a skilled survivor\n\nOVERALL\n\nDead by Daylight is a fantastic game idea completely botched by the messed up vision of the developers, combined with what I can only describe as utter laziness. The fact that there are still game-breaking bugs that me and my friends experience over a month into release is crazy, especially when people spam the forums with them and complain about it constantly. I'm not sure exactly what the developers have been doing since the game has been released, considering that the only thing they've actually done is add survive with friends (which was supposed to be in before release, by the way.) and nerf survivor every patch with miniscule overall changes. No keybinding, no sensitivity options, no brightness options, absolutely nothing. Despite having sinked so many hours into this game already, I'm utteraly dissapointed by what I've seen and the latest patch has officially broken my back. I'll be waiting until the game is actually a finished product to actually take it seriously again, since it should really still be in beta.","timestamp_created":1469671264,"timestamp_updated":1613574036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508261144161224365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24566859","author":{"steamid":"76561197979072683","num_games_owned":847,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":13209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9928,"last_played":1495858580},"language":"english","review":"Loved it, great game idea ruined by poor balance, missing vital features, and broken matchmaking / the number of people hosting servers in china.

They recently patched it though and it's still got a wealth of bugs to be incredibly frustrating.  On top of that, the killer now has some really heavy aim assist on his attacks, making it far more difficult to borderline impossible to evade their attacks unless you're turning a corner (then they auto attack into the wall and are briefly stunned).  To give you an idea, the game has pallets which you can throw down to try and block (or stun if timed right) the killer.  As of this latest patch I've stunned 0 killers successfully, even those who were chewing on the pallet when it got dropped and I've been able to stun only 4 killers unsuccessfully... because the game decided their auto attack trumped the barrier between us, so I took a hit anyways.

I haven't played anything like this and the gameplay always keeps me coming back even before the 1.04 update which drastically improved the game.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to put a lot of hours into the game. You have a level and a rank. As you earn bloodpoints during matches you can spend them on items and add ons for your items in between matches. You also have a rank. It takes 10,500 blood points to earn a \"pip\". Earn x amount of pips and you gain a rank. You start at rank 20 and you work your way down to rank one.\n\nOne of the biggest problems the game had before the 1.04 update was that it was really hard to get a pip as a survivor without getting to the exit. This caused many survivors to resort to infinite juking which is a spot on the map with 2 or more windows nearby that you can vault through. Since i've last played they have made it drastically easier to get a pip as a survivor. They also have removed the majority of the infinite juke spots which is good for people who prefer to play as the killer.\n\nBecause of those two adjustments that came with the 1.04 update hook camping is almost non-existant I've played about 5 hours of games since the 1.04 update and I have only encountered one hook camper.\n\nThey have added a survive with friends mode which lets you and your friends play public matches together.\n\nAlso cosmetics so you can customize your survivor. There aren't many at the moment, but more are going to be added in the future. Presumably for free because the 1.04 update included a new outfit for each survivor for free.\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n\nAs much as I love this game there are a few cons that should be mentioned.\n\nAlthough it is easier to level up as a survivor it's still very annoying when the killer finds you first and then camps you. Luckily that doesn't occur as often and other survivors can save you. If this happens multiple games in a row it can cause some rage.\n\nThe rank system could do better by matching similar ranks together more. You'll occasionally run into high rank killers as a low rank survivor. That being said your level (not rank) [b]does not determine skill[/b] I have won against level 30+ killers as a level 10 survivor before.\n\nYou have to reinvite friends you are playing survive with friends with after every match.\n\nThis is or more like an early access game than a final release.\n\n[b][u]VERDICT[/u][/b]\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1469666145,"timestamp_updated":1469666241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24565574","author":{"steamid":"76561198076088260","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6430,"last_played":1659213279},"language":"russian","review":"ДЕРЬМО ПОЛНОЕ!! не покупайте эту поеботу.Ахеренный баланс ребятушки","timestamp_created":1469663906,"timestamp_updated":1469663906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473799973726272583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24565460","author":{"steamid":"76561198140847610","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":64222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":407,"playtime_at_review":2493,"last_played":1660515429},"language":"english","review":"This is a awesome game.

There are some issues with current patches (check the date of this review before you read into this little part TOO heavily) where the Killer has way more advantages than the Survivor, BUT just before those patches the Survivor had WAY MORE advantages than the Killer. So right now it is just a matter of finding the perfect balance between the two which I believe the DEVs can do.\n\nBesides that the game is VERY fun to play. I personally prefer Survivor more than Killer because I like the aspect of needing to hide while also getting objectives. However, the Killer can be pretty fun to play as well because it challenges you to hunt down survivors. You can have fun playing this game either by yourself or with your friends. If you are playing by yourself the game is very realistic in the sense that you can't communicate with your fellow survivors if they are VERY far away. There is no built-in voice chat nor can you type to one another once you leave the game lobby. You can, however, use gestures as a way to communicate with one another.

Так же не буду упоминать о том, что задумка хороша, но реализация полное фигня: таких отзывов и так несчетное количество.\n\nНо как-то тему локализации никто особо не поднимал. Что ж, попробую это сделать я.\n\nРазработчики отказывали многим энтузиастам, которые писали им с самого начала бета теста, так как уже нашли студию, которая возьмётся за перевод. Не за бесплатно, конечно же. Они долго брались, брались и выдали нам ЭТО неописуемое чудо гуманитарной мысли. НАЙТИ ВЫЙТИ - и не нужно больше лишних слов. К слову, народные умельцы с ZOG'а уже давно сами распаковали, перевели, запаковали БЕСПЛАТНО, но разработчики всё равно отдали перевод китайцам, которые всё через гугл переводят. А знаешь почему? Потому что этим разрабам пофиг на игроков. Им проще заплатить одной фирме, которая переводит сразу на много языков, но через гугл транслейт, чем общаться с комьюнити разных стран. А самое весёлое, что все разрабы потом пишут этим \"переводчикам\" положительные отзывы, мол, \"крутые ребята за один день на 8 языков!\" и другие разработчики видя это и, не хотя особо заморачиваться, идут к этим чуда умельцам да ещё и платят им кругленькие суммы. Удобно устроились, что тут ещё скажешь.\n\nВывод: разработчиков заботят только свои кошельки. Они обещают золотые горы, а потом, когда подходят дедлайны, за 5 минут варганять на отвали.

В остальном ничего не изменилось и отзыв всё ещё точный. Кто-то может сказать, что перевод больше не гугл-переводчик, но сейчас всё даже хуже: 50% текста переведено неверно, особенно это играет роль на тех же аддонах маньяка, которые делают совершенно не то, что написано в русской локализации.

It's been out 6 years and somehow still doesn't have a functional matchmaking system. Progression is even more grindy as the teachable perks grow, and the amount of dlc is starting to make Train Simulator sweat. Survivors still love to waste time t-bagging at exit gates, killers still love to face camp. I can hardly blame them; the game makes no attempt to dissuade you from doing either. The anti-tunneling perks they've added are now meta, and any decent killer will account for it. NOED is still in the game. How is that even possible. Their sensitivity adjuster is a PERCENTAGE slider that only goes in increments of 5%. Killer is played from a first person perspective. Its vomit inducing bad.\n\nHow'd this game outlive all its competitors? Who knows. Got here first and bought up a bunch of licenses to make easily identifiable characters. These licenses are probably temporary too, if the Demogorgon is anything to go by. So don't count on being able to buy a lot of this licensed DLC in 5 years. FOMO on your character variety baby, what a clown shit company. \n\nI hope someday we will see the death of this game or the devs get struck by lightning and suddenly learn how to make a half decent video game, but today is not that day for either of those.\n\nMaybe they'll make another Deathgarden to compete against themselves, but maybe next time that one will kill this game instead.

Sounds fun right? \n\nUnfortunately this game has little to do with a powerful killer versus four weaker survivors. \nIt's about 5 people grinding hundreds of thousands of blood points. \n\nTo keep this game \"Scary\" it is heavily favored to the killers.\n\nFor new players. \n\nThe Killer will find someone. \n1/4 chance of getting found... Once found, you will be killed. \nYou will ONLY get away from newbie killers... \n(Unfortunately, high level killers and low level players are regularly matched.)\nNew Killers will camp the hook, which means at low levels no one helps anyone. If anything bodyblocking and failing skill checks means other players are a liablity... only good to keep the killer busy while you farm blood points. \n\nNow for experience players there is a WHOLE other set of issues... \n\nThe experience killers will pick you off one by one, However, they don't care about \"winning\" they want to farm blood points. Some \"friendly\" Wraiths will spam appear to you for points. Hunters will exploit traps to farm you for points. Hillbillies will tag and leave you as bait to farm other survivors. \n\nSo again... NOT the deadly game of cat and mouse you hoped it would be. \nIt is ONLY the perk system that keeps the existing players playing. \nMost players will tell you in chat, they aren't enjoying the game... they are farming blood points to get perks (so then its fun?).... 500k to get to lvl 15. Likely as a new player you will get 5-9k per game. \n\nOnly plus... this game is fun as hell to watch good streamers play. Watching survivors out manuever killers is (was) thrilling. Watching the killer streams is just watching someone mow down survivors.","timestamp_created":1469641867,"timestamp_updated":1469975187,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24559952","author":{"steamid":"76561198119043831","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1637325173},"language":"russian","review":"игра сама по себе хороша,но ещё сырая рано для покупки","timestamp_created":1469641517,"timestamp_updated":1469641517,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517658889293670654","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/LzdltYCcJXYXQ=="}
