Also, if you're a completionist and want to max out all killers and survivors in this game, prepare to invest over 1000 hours, depending on when you buy the game, as once every few months a new killer/survivor is released.\n\nBut the main issue currently is balance. Unless you're playing nurse, pallets are currently the bane of killers. By pallet looping, even sitting at pallets and wasting them will give other survivors enough time to complete all 5 generators and escape. Furthermore the map design at the moment is terrible, with some maps heavily favoring survivors and others favoring killers. The game is currently the survivors game to lose, unless you are exceptionally good at playing killer, which takes a long time to achieve, unless you are a natural. The devs do seem interested in fixing the major balance issues, however, but this obviously takes time.\n\nSo to conclude, is the game fun? Yeah. Is the game entertaining? Yeah. Is the game fun to play for the first 20 or so hours? Yeah. Is the game fun to play in the beginning? Yeah. Is the game fun to play after that? Not at the moment, and thats why I can't recommend the game.\n\nAlso, I almost exclusively play killer, so some of my opinions on the game are skewed by that.\n\nEDIT: 11th July 2018\n\nSince I originally wrote this review, the developers seem to have given the game new life, with solid, consistent updates that improve the game as a whole. New killers have also been added since this review was written, specifically the Pig (I think) and the Clown. Both DLC's are strong as a whole, and in the Pigs case introduces a new solid mechanic which changes the game drastically.\n\nOverall the game has made a great turnaround over the past couple of months, and appears to be continuing along this path. With more balance updates around the corner, I am excited for the future Dead by Daylight holds.","timestamp_created":1516448706,"timestamp_updated":1531331456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476889550685882568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39480742","author":{"steamid":"76561198311817718","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":20137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9818,"last_played":1586443555},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Daylight gehört seit einigen Jahren zu den Kulthorrorspielen auf dem Markt.\nVielleicht liegt dies daran, dass die Entwickler keine Kosten und Mühen scheuen, um immer wieder neue Updates, Killer, Überlebende und Maps auf den Markt zu bringen.\nSehr positiv ist, dass es mittlerweile viele Lizenzkiller gibt, die uns schon in den Kinos das gruseln gelehrt haben.

Каждая новая катка происходит на новой карте с новым маньяком. На каждой карте геймплей разительно отличается и при игре за сурва, и при игре за маньяка. Нужно ли объяснять, что разные силы маньяков требуют совершенно разных тактик.

Survivors get Borrowed time, and camp the hooks which make it impossible to win as a killer with premade survivor teams\n\nMaps have gotten \"better\" with infinite loops with blood lust giving speed to the killer, but the devs shot that to hell by increasing the number of palletes in the map.\n\nHit boxes are shit, billy gets stuck on a pixel and interupted in a sprint, pallete stuns at arms length away. \n\nServer (host issues, P2P standards) lag with massive rubber banding, causing issues chasing or hitting.\n\nI played when it first came out and deleted the game after 30 hours of play. Reinstalled with the \"balances\" and played a bit more and will uninstall again and never play. Wish big game devs give out long term demos to really get an idea of the shit game you buy.
