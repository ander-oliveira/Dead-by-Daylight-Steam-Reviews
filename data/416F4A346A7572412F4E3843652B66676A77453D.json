Each round is something new and presents unique challenges, from one of the many killers and their abilities to the teammates you hope are even remotely competent, and especially as you rank up can all be swayed simply by how you play. There's a fairly expansive deal of survivors and killers alike that can be customised to your liking via perks and/or cosmetics, which for myself personally means i can enjoy playing who i want without having to jeopardise my survival.\n\nHowever, this is by no means to say it's a perfect game. With each update often comes a barrage of new bugs, with such classics being getting stuck on rocks, or having a temporary boost becoming permanent. As well as this, the licenced survivers and killers often bring with them a wave of unhappy players due to limits to cosmetics, the player models, or the like, and whilst this has never been an issue for myself I can certainly understand the dissatisfaction.\n\nOverall, I believe that Dead by Daylight is certainly worth your money so long as you're willing to put in the time to learn. Whilst many features can cause discord amongst the community, normal gameplay is often enjoyable and the replay value is almost infinite, especially with the fairly regular DLC's that introduce new gameplay mechanics, survivors, and killers which can often be bought without spending money if you play enough. It's a game you hate to love and love to hate.\n\nPro's\n- Excellent replayability \n- A vast array of characters\n- Regular content updates, be it aesthetic or characters\n- Most DLC's can be bought via in-game currency\n\nCon's\n- Consistently a bit buggy\n- The community can be rather toxic","timestamp_created":1511720489,"timestamp_updated":1626810064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37702036","author":{"steamid":"76561198390811698","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2261,"last_played":1637282090},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna gra Polecam dużo zabawy ze znajomymi :)","timestamp_created":1511720414,"timestamp_updated":1511720414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37701911","author":{"steamid":"76561198418992774","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1656689686},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy bueno en el sentido de pasar el rato con tus amigos , jugando de una forma divertida...\n\n","timestamp_created":1511720348,"timestamp_updated":1511720348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37701811","author":{"steamid":"76561198343022812","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2582,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1660253621},"language":"russian","review":"топ","timestamp_created":1511720298,"timestamp_updated":1511720298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37701247","author":{"steamid":"76561198038133946","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":31632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5462,"last_played":1620141867},"language":"russian","review":"Дайте мне значок на распродаже плиз","timestamp_created":1511719992,"timestamp_updated":1511719992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37700987","author":{"steamid":"76561198136806472","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7223,"last_played":1612880082},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарно","timestamp_created":1511719840,"timestamp_updated":1511719840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37700840","author":{"steamid":"76561198084390506","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":403,"playtime_at_review":10732,"last_played":1660275790},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would spook again","timestamp_created":1511719763,"timestamp_updated":1511719763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37700684","author":{"steamid":"76561198083644425","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1605351974},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu qui a su donner des frissons, de la peur et une frustration inimaginable !

Те из них, которые добавлены из фильмов выглядят здорово: \nпереданы их способности,звуковое сопровождение, лор.\n- Веселье. Если играть с друзьями, то можно получить кучу положительных эмоций. \n- Персонажи. Каждый выживший и киллер имеет свою историю, уникальные перки, также присутствует кастомизация, которой не всегда достаточно. Очень расстраивает озвучка. Она тут как бы есть, но её мало. Выжившие могут только кричать и стонать, а маньяки смеяться и кричать.\n- Геймплей. Весьма спорный момент. Поначалу вам будет нравиться всё происходящее, но спустя десятки часов это превращается в рутину.\nМинусы\n- Однообразие. Так как на данный момент в игре один режим, в котором вам нужно заводить многострадальные генераторы или класть сурвов, то многим людям это не придётся по душе. Повторение одного и того же из игры в игру надоедает.\n- Оптимизация. Большое количество багов, глитчей, зависаний. Порой из этого выходят забавные ситуации: маньяк или сурв застревают в текстурах, проваливаются под землю и т.д.\n- Баланс. В подобных играх трудно уравновесить две стороны и разработчики это понимают. Но они редко предпринимают что-то серьёзное, чтобы изменить положение. Некоторые убийцы очень слабы и даже скилловому человеку трудно за них играть, а другие же- наоборот.\n- Комьюнити. Одно из самых неадекватных сообществ. Фейскемперство, поддавки, выход из игры при первой поимке- все это говорит само за себя.\nИтог\nНо всё же имея такое количество минусов игра остаётся оригинальной и интересной в своём жанре. Я бы скорее рекомендовал её остальным.\nМоя оценка: 7/10","timestamp_created":1511718392,"timestamp_updated":1511718392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558592021465301514","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37698338","author":{"steamid":"76561198116496264","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4659,"last_played":1634909358},"language":"russian","review":"Верните старые задания!!!!","timestamp_created":1511718382,"timestamp_updated":1511718382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37698140","author":{"steamid":"76561198070834954","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2679,"last_played":1609363557},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego para divertise entre amigos y pasar un buen rato, lo unico malo son los campers pero bueno nada es perfecto xD","timestamp_created":1511718285,"timestamp_updated":1511718285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37697719","author":{"steamid":"76561198145761576","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1336,"last_played":1563457253},"language":"russian","review":"Игра ОГОНЬ","timestamp_created":1511718060,"timestamp_updated":1511718060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37697525","author":{"steamid":"76561198151010053","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1605995578},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, которая заставляет поднапречь ваши нервы","timestamp_created":1511717949,"timestamp_updated":1511717949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37697047","author":{"steamid":"76561198398135734","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21687,"last_played":1562437965},"language":"english","review":"malo juego pero grande giros para grande gana","timestamp_created":1511717686,"timestamp_updated":1511717686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37696901","author":{"steamid":"76561198118384037","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":240,"last_played":1563730693},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito divertido!\n","timestamp_created":1511717611,"timestamp_updated":1511717611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37696759","author":{"steamid":"76561198210993033","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":19646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3627,"last_played":1641402071},"language":"english","review":"Good game.

A lot of the community is divided into either a \"survivor main\" or a \"killer main\", but I enjoy both sides. This game has some performance issues and this is coming from someone who built a beefy $2,000 computer. These issues can be fixed but you have to go through the %appdata% on your computer to turn off the framecap and vsync(what causes the fps drops on certain maps) and the fact that I have to look up some stupid tutorial on youtube with some 12 year old kid explaining to me where to find this stupid fucking settings document on my computer is ridiculous in 2020 and the devs either need to optimize their game better or make this stuff accessible from the main menu of the game. \n\nDespite that long winded rant, that isn't even my biggest problem with the game; Its the pip system in high ranks. As you get higher in ranks(rank 8 and above in my experience), it gets harder for you to pip(earn rank points) as both killer and survivor. This makes sense from a game design standpoint, as it separates the good players from the great. But the way they calculate these points at high ranks, ESPECIALLY on killer, is fucking ludicrous, and it makes no sense sometimes. I deleted my old review on this game to write this one because of a match I had about a half hour ago. I thought I did everything the game wanted me to. I got a 4k(killed every survivor in the trial), I didn't hook camp or even proxy camp(even going as far as to chainsaw to anyone I saw on BBQ even if i knew someone was right next to the hook hiding), I won chases quickly, i destroyed pallets, i broke gens, and I sawed survivors quite a bit(was playing billy). How many pips do I get for this? none. i get a brutal killer for a great 4k match where the survivors played well but I played better. The fact you can even get a brutal for that is fucking stupid. The reason for this brutal? the chaser emblem. this emblem punishes you for tunneling and hook camping, which is a great thing. When you hover of the emblem, it will even show you where you lost points in red. I hover over the emblem and guess what? no red text, but still a bronze.\n\nIf BHVR can fix this issue with the chaser emblem, then I think that would help killers a lot and maybe pacify some of their frustrations with the game. Maybe if it wasn't nearly impossible to get a merciless in high ranks then these killers wouldnt be so upset when they get a 1k against survivors with thousands of hours when they only have a few hundred. BHVR, I've been playing your game on and off for 3-4 years now, and I've been here through all the crazy bugs and overpowered items and perks. That being said, if im wrong about this whole chaser emblem thing, im leaving the comments on so the more experienced players browsing the reviews can explain it to me. Overall, I recommend this game for a bit of fun at the lower ranks playing with friends on survivor or trying your hand at killer. But at the moment, I cannot recommend climbing the ranking latter, as the game just gets more frustrating and unfair as you climb.","timestamp_created":1511714013,"timestamp_updated":1585620706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37690115","author":{"steamid":"76561198060600963","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1656981632},"language":"english","review":"I only have 2 hours of the game, but so far i REALLY love it, this review will be updated for every milestone i get, 10 hours, 50, 100 etc etc, so a more detailed review on the way!","timestamp_created":1511713981,"timestamp_updated":1511713981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37689853","author":{"steamid":"76561198201213485","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3000,"last_played":1658522890},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeu !

Dead by Daylight, to its credit, eschews these in favour of real horror--a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakeable sense of impending doom. That it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what is truly impressive about it.\n\nDead by Daylight features two teams--four survivors and one killer--and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles: The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors, knock them down, put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods. The odds are skewed heavily in favour of the invincible killer, and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve-rattling, sweat-inducing, terrifying experience.\n\nAfter queuing into a game with three other survivors, Dead by Daylight puts you in one of several eerie horror environments--a dilapidated farm, a run-down manor, a rickety junkyard--and tells you, very simply, to fix the generators to escape. When you find the generators, you then need to repair them--a painstakingly slow process, where you hold the left mouse button down while crouching in front of it. If you're alone, repairing the generator can take more than a minute. As you crouch next to the very noisy generator, the game will throw skill-tests at you by way of a rotating bar--if you fail the QTE, the generator will backfire. This creates a noisy explosion, and the killer is visually alerted to the location of the backfire, turning you into a target.\n\nIf the killer does find you (and he probably will) your options are limited. If you have a flashlight you can blind him temporarily, but your best bet is to run away. The killer moves faster than you can run, maintaining the traditional horror movie 'ominous walk', but you can slow him down by leaping through windows, or pushing down pallets to block his path. You want to put as many of these obstacles in between the two of you as possible as you flee for your life.\n\nFortunately for the survivors, a sixth sense mechanic alerts them to the presence of a nearby killer--the closer the killer is, the faster your survivor's heart beats. Unfortunately the sound is obscured by generator revving as you repair it. When 90% repaired, the generator nearly drowns out the heartbeat entirely, forcing you to rely solely on your eyes to see the killer.\n\nWhen you play as the killer, you're able to see all the map's generators at all times, allowing you to patrol them. If any of them are making noise, you know at least one survivor has been working on it, and you can hunt for signs that the others are nearby. Panicked survivors will sprint away, leaving scratches on nearby walls and breaks in the grass, and you can follow these markings to find your prey. Once you find your prey you chop them down, pick them up and put them on a hook, sacrificing them to your god after 60 seconds.\n\nThe scoring system initially encourages players to create exciting gameplay opportunities by rewarding risky play. Survivors who engage in lengthy, drawn out chases escaping the killer will earn more points for their boldness, and you can rack up the points by rescuing other survivors who have been captured but not yet sacrificed. As a killer you're rewarded for killing more of the survivors, although a single sacrifice is counted as a victory. Inevitably though, this scoring system leads to immersion-breaking actions like exploiting the killer's slow movement past obstacles, as survivors earn huge points by taunting their hunter.\n\nAnother problem for Dead by Daylight is its matchmaking system. The game is entirely peer-to-peer hosted, with the killer hosting the survivors at all times. Unfortunately there's no way to tell where in the world the killer is or whether they're capable of hosting five people in a game until you're playing. There's no ping indicator and no regional matchmaking, so you have to roll the dice each time you join a new server--and if you crap out, you'll warp around the game world barely able to work out what's going on. Further, there's no group-based matchmaking, so you can't queue with friends. This results in players lobby-hopping until they are grouped with friends, which is a terrible experience for all involved.\n\nDead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well, but only to a point. As players become more familiar with both roles, the horror dissipates and they begin to play for the competitive element alone. The poor matchmaking and the highly exploitable scoring system make Dead by Daylight less competitive than it should be, resulting in gameplay which doesn't resemble the horror experience it sets out to be.","timestamp_created":1511712322,"timestamp_updated":1515557244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37686902","author":{"steamid":"76561198314094119","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":809,"last_played":1638031133},"language":"russian","review":"ss","timestamp_created":1511712286,"timestamp_updated":1511712286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37686794","author":{"steamid":"76561198355862545","num_games_owned":1143,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":174239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2003,"playtime_at_review":37043,"last_played":1660553430},"language":"tchinese","review":"跟朋友一起玩排隊的派對遊戲","timestamp_created":1511712234,"timestamp_updated":1638017716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37686459","author":{"steamid":"76561198406287811","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":74598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":289,"playtime_at_review":8682,"last_played":1659871293},"language":"thai","review":"nice game.","timestamp_created":1511712067,"timestamp_updated":1511712067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37686417","author":{"steamid":"76561198123151854","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11961,"last_played":1638722264},"language":"thai","review":"goodd","timestamp_created":1511712044,"timestamp_updated":1511712044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37686065","author":{"steamid":"76561198113266594","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1501,"last_played":1582712895},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра рекомендую","timestamp_created":1511711893,"timestamp_updated":1511711893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37685949","author":{"steamid":"76561198212327620","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1036,"playtime_at_review":2028,"last_played":1660479265},"language":"english","review":"This game really good...sometimes you get good player sometimes you got bad one either survivor or killer...i enjoy the game so far","timestamp_created":1511711833,"timestamp_updated":1511711833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37685695","author":{"steamid":"76561198335310300","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":3078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3078,"last_played":1623686896},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1511711695,"timestamp_updated":1637901462,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531693518161773682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37685436","author":{"steamid":"76561198256614257","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2028,"last_played":1639264325},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая","timestamp_created":1511711578,"timestamp_updated":1511711578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37684859","author":{"steamid":"76561198318662852","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1530548017},"language":"polish","review":"Gut, gut polecam.
