Mientras que el asesino debe cazar a los supervivientes estos deben reparar todos los generadores para escapar del recinto. Es un título que hace de las películas clásicas de terror de \"grupo de chavales huyen de asesino\" un juego con sus propias reglas. La premisa no es terror como tal sino ganar siguiendo reglas muy estrictas, es como jugar al escondite.\n \nEn la piel del asesino se juega en primera persona y, sabiendo de antemano la localización de los generadores, tendrás que buscar y elimar a todos los supervivientes aguzando vista y oído y aprovechandote de los fallos que estos cometan (por ejemplo si el superviviente corre en lugar de andar o simplemente va herido dejará un rastro). Pero no podrás hacerlo de cualquier forma, deberás golpear para incapacitar a los supervivientes y después llevarlos hasta un gancho y colgarlos hasta la muerte, podrás resistirse un tiempo y ser salvados por un compañero pero si el tiempo pasa acabarán muriendo. Como superviviente verás en tercera persona y deberás moverte con cautela resolviendo los puzzles de los generadores sin cometer errores o alertarás al asesino, antes de que esté lo bastante cerca una música terrorífica te alertará para que te escondas rápidamente o te vayas antes de que te encuentre. Son acciones no muy exigentes mentalmente pero que se vuelven muy complicadas si le sumas la tensión de alguien buscándote para matarte.\n\nSin embargo más allá de la jugabilidad, que es buena y original, el sistema de progresión basado en desbloquear perks y consumibles me parece muy mal diseñado, cada nivel da la sensación de que te dan cosas aleatorias para desbloquear en vez de hacer que progreses.\n\n¿Que sentido tiene que si quiero usar una linterna necesite un personaje que en uno de sus niveles casualmente desbloquea una? entonces la uso en una partida y la pierdo hasta que encuentre otra. El tema de los perks que dan pasivas al personaje está bien, pero no entiendo que sentido tiene un consumible cuyo efecto es \"si juegas en tal escenario pasa esto\" pero lo usas y si toca otro escenario te jodes y lo pierdes.\n\nEn términos generales la experiencia es buena pero muy repetitiva.\n\nOpino que una tienda de objetos funcionaría mucho mejor, gastas los puntos en comprar el comsumible que quieres y así personalizas tu estilo de juego, y en lugar de rellenar los nivelñes con consumibles y cosas sin sentido centrarlo únicamente en habilidad pasivas que diferencien a cada personaje.\n\nPero lo peor de todo es la nefasta política de dlcs, si todo ese contenido se desbloquease jugando ya habría una buena razón para hacerlo pasadas las 10 o 15 horas que es lo máximo que puede entretener lo que ofrece de base. La vida útil del juego depende de cuanto estes dispuesto a vaciar tu cartera.","timestamp_created":1516743286,"timestamp_updated":1516743375,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39567207","author":{"steamid":"76561198117684314","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":67463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":36591,"last_played":1660339608},"language":"german","review":"Meta perk change spiel ist jetzt kompletter dreck alla guck dir Hart im nehmen an wie gay is das denn bitte PFUIH!!!","timestamp_created":1516743229,"timestamp_updated":1658351839,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39566963","author":{"steamid":"76561198344145569","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":60861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":96,"playtime_at_review":47421,"last_played":1660129107},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1516742513,"timestamp_updated":1582750873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39566882","author":{"steamid":"76561197968551304","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16903,"last_played":1570355831},"language":"german","review":"Hammermäßiges Horror Game!

Sadly, the commuity is far worse than any of the actual in game issues. The very nature of a 1v4 or 4v1 game, depending on which side you play, creates a rift between main's of both sides, each complaining ceaselessly about how the game is stacked against them. The forums are toxic, the pre and post game chat is typically toxic, and salt rains from the heavens no matter the match outcome. That aside, the game itself is actually enjoyable, and for as much as people complain, each profile you see will be demonstrating hundreds of hours spent in the fog. \n\n**PROS**\nSURVIVORS:\n-Escaping a match is satisfying, no matter what Rank you're on.\n-Getting in with a decent team is a rare reward, and makes the experience much more enjoyable.\n-Tense moments trying to rescue, gen work, or explore make the game worthwhile.\n-Learning how to face each Killer is challenging, and fun to master. \n\nKILLERS:\n-There's nothing more satisfying than throwing someone on a hook and watching them dangle helplessly. \n-Harsher and less forgiving learning curve that's satisfying to improve on.\n-Ultra-Rare add-ons take survivors by surprise and make for quick, satisfying matches. \n-Unlike survivors, you have the ability to see your opponents in lobby and plan load-outs accordingly. \n\n**CONS**\nSURVIVORS:\n-90% of your teams will be horrible. Gen ignoring, Yolo saving, point farming, ragequitting, etc, etc, etc.\n-You *need* to rely on the three other people on your team, and they tend to be your biggest handicap. (see #1)\n-A survivor is just as much of a target for post-game salt if you play in a style that others don't agree with. (see #1)\n-You will watch your Rank fall for situations completely out of your control. (again see #1, disconnecting kilers, etc)\n\nKILLERS:\n-Facing a 4-man SWF loadout, though much rarer than claimed, is completely stacked against you.\n-Poor map design in terms of survivor assistance can have you running around for days after one person.\n-Rework needs to be done to assist in Killer loadouts (better Hex totem design, etc)\n-Rank Reset will have new Killers ready to uninstall the game after 20 mins. \n\n**THE GAME OVERALL**\nPROS:\n-Fun and addictive, with a learning curve that's obtainable but hardly forgiving.\n-Prestige gives you targets to aim for.\n-Some really good people in the game, and easy to make new friends in the right circumstances.\n-Tense, close matches between Survivors and Killers make the entire experience worthwhile. \n\nCONS:\n-You can get absolutely steamrolled on either side in certain matches.\n-Bugs are constantly popping up, even when one is fixed, two more show up.\n-No Region lock at all. This means you can spend 20 mins in lobbies trying to find a ping less than 200.\n-Disconnects of any nature throw the game completely off, and something needs to be worked out. \n-The community at large is toxic as hell. \n-Imbalance of Perks leads to specific Meta builds on both sides of the game, creating a very generic experience. \n-Map design needs to be reworked in order to better balance the game. (Currently in progress)\n-Certain Killers need to be reworked in order to make them viable. *cough* Freddy *cough*\n-High Ranks (1,2,3) are basically the same maps, with the same killers, and same perk loadouts on repeat.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\nThe premise and implementation of the game is great, and I understand that it's ridiculously hard to balance a game of this nature to where the majority of players are pleased. There's a reason why so many people have pumped hundreds, if not thousands, of hours into this game. The Devs are visible, they try to keep the community informed, and are always releasing new content, which is great, but I believe that more focus needs to be put into ensuring the core of the game is perfected first. If you're new, you're in for a rough ride, but it gets better, and much more enjoyable. There's alot of great aspects to the game, which makes it worth spending time in. You *will* get frustrated, you *will* have some absolutely horrible matches, but you \"Join a Lobby\" and take another stab at it. Overall, the good outweighs the bad in my opinion, and I trust the developers to keep chipping away at the monumental task that is balancing the game.","timestamp_created":1516720137,"timestamp_updated":1516720137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.713184833526611328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39558467","author":{"steamid":"76561198291810553","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":19931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":926,"last_played":1609793378},"language":"turkish","review":"Tavsiye ederim demek zorundayım 300 saate yakın oynadım.Oyunun çok fazla teknik problemi var hit boxları,server işleyişi,lag switchler,buglar bunlar pek çok teknik problem.Killerların daha güçlü olmasına rağmen killerların daha da broken olması survivorların nerflenmesi oyunun git gide düşüren kavramlar.Ama baktığınız zaman konsept güzel arkadaşlarınızla eğlenirsiniz.Oyunlarda eğlenmek içindir zaten ama bu saydığım teknik özellikler çoğu zaman oynanışı etkilediği için sinirlenip rage quit atmanız fazlasıyla muhtemel bir oyun.Ama her şeye rağmen tavsiye ediyorum belki bir gün düzeltmeyi denerler.\n\nİYİ EĞLENCELER  :)","timestamp_created":1516719919,"timestamp_updated":1556344720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39558424","author":{"steamid":"76561198150024952","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":104101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":72,"playtime_at_review":29330,"last_played":1659740060},"language":"english","review":"This game can be very toxic but at the end of the day i love sitting down and playing this game for a few hours the game is no where near finished but its working on it","timestamp_created":1516719781,"timestamp_updated":1516719781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39558421","author":{"steamid":"76561198363027345","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":88978,"playtime_last_two_weeks":89,"playtime_at_review":53838,"last_played":1659874435},"language":"english","review":"NURSE = 4 DCS = EZ RANK 1","timestamp_created":1516719770,"timestamp_updated":1657713146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39558142","author":{"steamid":"76561198142058547","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5573,"last_played":1650639508},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая и весьма мне кажется перспективная.
