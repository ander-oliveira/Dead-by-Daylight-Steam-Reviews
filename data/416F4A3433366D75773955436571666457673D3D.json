(Kazanmak için illa hepsini öldürmek zorunda değil)\nOyunda birçok harita ve bölge vardır. Bu harita ve bölge her tur rastgele olarak seçilir. Böylece ezber yapıp rahatlayamazsanız ve her maçınızda yine aynı korku duygusunu yaşarsınız.\nOyun, Kazazedeyken 4 kişiye kadar arkadaşlarınızla beraber birleşip, rastgele bir katille oynamanıza izin veriyor.\nVe yine Kill Your Friends oynayıp(Özel Oyun) Katilide kendi arkadaşlarınızdan birisi yapabilirsiniz. Ama bu moddan kan puanı kazanamazsınız.\n\nHikaye:Entity adlı kötü bir ruh, çaresizliğe düşmüş ve yalnız insanları gerçek dünyadan kaçırıp, kendi dünyasına getirir. İstediği kişilere katil rolünü verip ona adak sunmasını emrederken, istediği kişileri kazazede yapıp onları kaçmaya çalışmaya zorlar. Her bir tur bittiğinde yine kamp ateşinde uyanırlar ve yine aynı şeyleri yaşarlar. Bu döngü hiçbir zaman sonlanmaz.\n\nOynanış:\nKazazede Oynanışı: Takım arkadaşlarınızla beraber 5 jeneratörüde yapmaya çalışırken sizi arayan katilden saklanmalı, eğer görülürsenizde haritadaki paletlerin ve pencerelerin yardımıyla katili atlatmaya çalışmalısınız. Eğer katile yakalanırsanız sizi omzuna atıp kancaya kadar gider.(Bu sırada A-D tuşlarına basarak debelenip katilin omzundan kaçmaya çalışırsınız. Başarılı olursanız Katile bir tekme atıp yaralı pozisyonda kaçmaya çalışırsınız.)\nKancaya asılırsanız önünüzde ufak bir kol oluşmaya başlayacak(Bu kol Entity'nin) bu kol oluşmadan önce kancadan kendiniz kurtulmaya çalışabilirsiniz,(%4'lük bir ihtimal) ya da takım arkadaşlarınızdan birinin sizi kurtarmasını umabilirsiniz. Diyelim ki kurtulamadınız. Entity'nin kolu oluştuğunda onu karnınıza sokup sizi öldürmeye çalışacak. Sizde o sırada Space tuşuna basarak elinizden geldiğince karşı koyacaksınız(En fazla 40 saniye civarı karşı koyabilirsiniz) Eğer o aşamada da kurtulamazsanız, Entity size kolunu sokar ve öldürür.\nAynı şekilde diyelim ki bir takım arkadaşınız katil tarafından yakalandı ve kancaya asıldı... İsteğe bağlı olarak onu kurtarmaya gidebilir ya da jeneratör yapmaya devam edebilirsiniz.\nDiyelim ki 5 jeneratörüde çalıştırdınız ve çıkış kapılarının gücü devreye girdi.

Bu işi ister zevk alarak, ister zorla yapmak zorundasınız.\nKazazedeler 5 jeneratörü çalıştırmadan önce hepsini teker teker avlayıp, yakalayıp, Entity'e sunmalısınız.\nKazazedeleri yakaladığınızda kancaya kadar götürüp asın ve bu işlemi kazazedeleri yakaladıkça tekrar edin. Entity'e 4 kurban sunarsanız çok memnun olacaktır. Ama 2-3 tane kurban sunarsanızda büyük oranda memnun olacaktır.\nKazazedeleri bulmak için Jeneratörleri kontrol edin.

Each player picks the add-on items they would like to bring into the match (med-kit, flashlight, killer weapon modifiers) and a one time use offering that will change things about the match for everyone (thicker mist, darker levels, more xp in categories). It's important to note that the killer knows which survivors were chosen but the survivors don't know which killer they're up against until the match starts. Once the match starts the killer tracks down survivors either trying to make them bleed out or sacrifice them on meat hooks to The Entity. Survivors will be trying to start enough generators to open up the exit doors and escape. At its core, this is just a big game of Ghosts in the Graveyard but instead of tagging someone, you cripple them and put them on a meat hook.\n\nThe Good\n-The cat and mouse gameplay works very well. It feels just as rewarding saving a friend stuck on a meat hook and escaping as it does cutting off a survivor and using him as bait to catch the others.\n-The killers all play very different and I've developed winning strategies with all three. On the note of winning, this is a game where you're most likely not going to kill all 4 survivors if they're particularly skilled. You're definitely going to need to lower your standards for feeling good about a match once you're playing against high level survivors.\n-They made the sprint, walk, and crouch all useful depending on the scenario. Sprinting as a survivor leaves behind a marks that the killer can follow for a small window of time, walking is slower but you don't leave tracks, and crouching is very slow but it will help you stay hidden in tall grass.\n-The games will play out very different depending on the group your playing with. As a survivor, playing selfish or self-less universally will get you killed at some point. Each game is balancing act of playing for yourself and keeping the team alive.\n-As a survivor, there are no player markers unless someone is downed. Players can panic and split up on accident just like in the movies.\n-Certain death and certain safety aren't fun or scary. The game currently favors survivors but I think they're close to a balance that feels rewarding and intense on both sides.\n\nThe Bad\n-The only way you can play with friends is through private matches. They're supposed to patch this in soon but what the hell were they thinking? I didn't even consider that I may not be able to play with my friends in matchmaking. Private matches are nice and all but you can't level up your character in non-matchmade games and level ups absolutely matter.\n-As a killer, there's no real solution for catching someone jumping over two nearby windows. If you find this happening don't waste your time. You'll have to let them go and find someone else. This issue makes the game feel like it's tilted in the survivors' favor. If you're playing against any higher level player, they're going to exploit the hell out of it. This just feels silly because I can't help but think that Jason Voorhees wouldn't have too hard of a time finding a way to kill some teenager that was just repeatedly jumping in and out of the same two windows. It's worth mentioning that the trapper can always bear trap a window but the other two killers can't do anything about it.\n-There's no round time limit. If someone wants to be a real piece of shit, they can just hide in one of the many lockers and do nothing. They're not going to win this way but I've had a few games drag on from someone not leaving the map and not interacting with any generators.\n-Sometimes the chase music kicks in as the killer when you didn't see a survivor. It feels cheap even on the beneficial side of it.\n\nThe Meh\n-I'll come right out and say that I despise RPG elements in games that aren't RPGs. The progression system is a little slow for my tastes. I hate that I'm 20+ hours in and I'm just now unlocking my 2nd perk for my most played killer. I would much rather have all the tools available to me to swap out each round as I choose.\n-No control options. The stock controls are fine for me though.\n-No video settings besides choosing \"Ultra\", \"High\", \"Medium\", or \"Low\". I had to go into the config files to uncap the frame limit. I have a GTX 980 and I'm able to run the game on \"Ultra\" at 60-70 fps at 2560x1440.\n-The formula never changes. Survivors fix generators and then escape. The killer tries to kill them. I think this absolutely works, especially for a $20 game, but I can see some people getting bored with it.\n-There's no proximity chat. I like this idea for teamwork as survivors and overhearing them as a killer but I've also played enough games online in my lifetime to know that this comes with toxic players.","timestamp_created":1466870345,"timestamp_updated":1466872154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526614010334014893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23795626","author":{"steamid":"76561197991693224","num_games_owned":1174,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":13008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2924,"last_played":1653973100},"language":"english","review":"If you like old horror films or enjoy a good rush of adrenaline, this should be a game that you'll  enjoy. There are plenty of killers to pick from, multiple survivors with their own unique perks, and a plethora of levels with varied design to entertain yourself with. \n\nThat being said, the community is quite hit-or-miss and the game itself can be buggy at times. The lobby is one of my major complaints about this game. Half the time it'll join a game only to kick me out and make me re-search for another lobby. This is only one of the many problems I've had with this game. Surviving with friends is damn near impossible to get into a lobby for some random reason. (See Edit below)\n\nBut those issues aside, the gameplay is solid and it's good for short bursts or long sessions. It can be something you can lose yourself in.\n\nOverall, I'd say try it out for the price. Play a game or two to see if you like it. If not, refunding is always an option.\n\nEdit: The lobby issues have since been fixed (including Survive with Friends) since this review and the bugs are less prevalent. Definitely worth picking up if a 4v1 type of game is your style.","timestamp_created":1466870173,"timestamp_updated":1497579704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519954383373260498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23795619","author":{"steamid":"76561198174973935","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1482361023},"language":"english","review":"its an amazing game, but i think it needs 2 things, first one is to be able to make a group with some friends to play online, and second one mic communication between teammates during the game, the other things are amazing :)","timestamp_created":1466870162,"timestamp_updated":1466870162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518214762210845947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23795440","author":{"steamid":"76561197962997707","num_games_owned":463,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1801,"last_played":1604116855},"language":"english","review":"If you're looking for a game that perfectly mimics doing a group project over again in high school, this is the game for you.\n\nGet chased around for hours while your team mates do absolutely nothing only for you to be in trouble the entire time.

Resulting in high level players facing unbalanced game experiences.\n\nAlthough this game is listed and advertised as asymmetrical and horror. The vast community and the developers themselves are pretending it to be a symmetrical game between Survivor verses Killer (1v1). Matchmaking and Balance itself is based on this pretension. In addition the only horror DbD emits is its community and playing as \"The Killer\".\n\nThe overall game design is flawed and their only solutions are perks to fix the lack of functionality, making them irreplaceable, or pushing \"The Killer\" to tactics, which are neither fun for both sides. Only response, making the survivor side stronger while making some drastic changes to both sides. For example, \"The Killer\" gets big nerf's, therefore destroying their potential, and receiving small buff's, making almost none difference at all. On the other hand if \"The Survivor\" receives a nerf, they also get some equal worthy compensation(s).\n\n\"The Killer\" pressuring every Survivor simultaneously without the help of perks and abilities is nearly impossible without the right tactics, as mentioned before, making the game unpleasant for both sides. Even though you would think The Killers objects are way easier - you're wrong - survivor doing 5 of 5 gens happens almost every high level game, meanwhile the killers hook counter stays under half process (>=6 of 12). Most high level Killers try to hook each survivor only one time to get the kill on them as fast as possible. As far as matchmaking is concerned, getting more than three survivors dead/killed is a win for the killer, two survivor is a draw and everything under two is a lose. The reason, one survivor doing a generator takes 90 seconds (without toolbox, perks and teamwork) times five (which can be interrupted by perks and sometimes the presents of the killer), on the other hand downing a survivor can take from 10 to 300 seconds and the killer hasn't even hooked the survivor to make process to his objective. After taking the time to hook a survivor (some times not possible; due to pallet stuns, perks, flashlight, body blocks, etc.), takes from 10 to 30 seconds, the killer has to repeat this process 12 more times. Unhooking a survivor takes about less than 5 seconds without taking the walking way to the hook into account. In more than half of those scenarios the killer needs more time to kill one survivors (3 hooks) than the survivor need for their generators.\n\nSurvivors rage quitting, insulting and disrespecting you as you play \"The Killer\" Role is common, as the Killer is viewed as weak and bully-able. \"Baby Killer\" as an example.\n\nThough not yet mentioning gameplay design, such as \"God Pallets\" (= Pallets so good you have to break them), tiles placement and overall map design.","timestamp_created":1466867483,"timestamp_updated":1659868990,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475998997688293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23794256","author":{"steamid":"76561198215474988","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":21842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17509,"last_played":1644260130},"language":"russian","review":"Ну, кроме ебаных кемперов и всякой хуйни с фонарями, зе бест","timestamp_created":1466867381,"timestamp_updated":1511447991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23794106","author":{"steamid":"76561198111587363","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":7355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":921,"last_played":1626955955},"language":"russian","review":"всё это конечно круто да...\nно жопендрус будет гореть постоянно готовьтесь!","timestamp_created":1466867056,"timestamp_updated":1466867056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23793830","author":{"steamid":"76561198053605736","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1508665778},"language":"russian","review":"Ннадеюсь исправят то, что нельзя вдвоем с другом создать пати и играть со всеми.

this is an excellent idea. \n\nCurrently it falls short due to technical execution, while still delivering most of it's purpose: A thrill riding quick played exciting experience within a horror film setting. As it is now though the game lacks so many core functionalities that it is indeed to be considered a beta. Once they have patched this up I can fully recommond it for anyone that loves co-op and mind games.\n\nPros:\n\n- Co-op pays of and is the key.\n- Some nice psychological dimensions.\n- Good sound engineering.\n- You honestly do get streessed as survivor.\n- Many times a tense and exciting experience.\n- Class system with perks.\n- Somewhat random ability tree.\n- A sense of progression via xp even if you do fail msierably.\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics are really horribly unoptimized, at least on NVIDIA: Most games in same engine look better and play at least twice as smooth.\n- As internet have noted, can't queue with just x friends. People pop in and out of lobby all the time.\n- No chat while in game: Why, in a co-op? Not even a pre-defined phrases system.\n- No voice chat anywhere - makes no sense since it gives advantage to whoever gangs up on teamspeak/discord/mumble et.c.\n- Have to manually press the search for lobby button 5-10 times before it finds a game - searching stops when it fails to join a game for some reason.\n- No lobby list, no filters, no nothing.\n- No settings for almost anything in the game: 2016. PC. Really? I can't even re-bind the keys....\n- Too short and generic tutorials, most of the stuff is never explained anywhere.\n- Other info lacking, like for instande a) The \"Hidden perks\" of the classes can't be seen anywhere. Makes no sense since they are always there for each class b) if you can ever break free from a hook by struggling or what that does at all.\n\nSummed up: Doesn't feel finished, shouldn't ever have been released in this state.
