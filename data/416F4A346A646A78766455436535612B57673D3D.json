my original review, as it was written back in 2016, and addressed a lot of issues that are not in the game anymore. However, the game is still a broken mess.\n\nDevelopers clearly cater to survivors side, essentially, making them a power role in this 4x1 game, where the killer is just some poor lad to be bullied (while Killer gameplay, imo, takes much more skill and more variables to operate with and keep in mind while playing). Despite survivors being given clear and unfair advantages over the killer, the fact that theres 4 of them doesnt help either, as 99/100 post game chats is just survivors insulting the Killer, regardless of what the Killer has done. If the Killer won - he is toxic camper/tunneller etc etc. If the Killer lost - he is trash, noob, loser, l2p, gitgud etc etc. \n\n And yeah, inb4 i hear \"noob killer main cry cry\", i play both roles somewhat equally, and i sit in red ranks with mid-low tier Killers.\n\nBut you know, none if these issues are anything new, so i would like to bring up the most important point:\n\nUnlike pretty much ANY other game out there of ANY genre - Dead By Daylight has no casual game mode. It FORCES you into Ranked play, since its the only mode there is. Hence, people take it much more seriously, they tryhard, they bring meta builds and so on.\n\nAlso, if you dig back into 2016, one of the key design points of DbD was that survivors are UNABLE to communicate. There were no SWFs allowed in Ranked mode back then, cause thats what DEVS planned, and the game's core mechanics and balance was done AROUND THIS POINT. \nYou cant design the game around the formula of (1x1x1x1)x1 and then turn it into a 4x1 and expect it to be balanced, my dudes...\n\nWay to fix this: Introduce Casual game mode, where people could play without feeling pressured by the ranking system, and disallow SWF in ranked, or at least, like in some other games - allow only duos in Ranked, AT LEAST... 4 man SWF is a guaranteed victory, unless the Killer plays Nurse and even then, survivors would have to make plenty of mistakes.","timestamp_created":1466685260,"timestamp_updated":1561284837,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.416666656732559204","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23725218","author":{"steamid":"76561198069753792","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1657962606},"language":"schinese","review":"在下爆米花，救人喜欢送","timestamp_created":1466683888,"timestamp_updated":1466683888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48767969012260437","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23725197","author":{"steamid":"76561198137058126","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":88,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1467431673},"language":"schinese","review":"我是从没见过攻击动作跑步动作这么小儿麻痹的杀手。攻击判定是点不是扇形这是谁想出来的设计？杀人还需要放钩子 手电一照就gg？你说逃生者没有攻击手电比你一把柴刀还好用？游戏优化也不好开gta中高都能流畅运行的情况这游戏只能用最低？别去做一些没意义的篝火增加特效，最低的游戏体验都没搞好。这游戏这种程度就能卖这样了？有这钱我不如去买进化了。我不知道这游戏评价怎么会这么高。这游戏就应该做成免费游戏算了。还等级系统。搞笑的1b","timestamp_created":1466683812,"timestamp_updated":1466683812,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23725060","author":{"steamid":"76561198085694261","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1622971484},"language":"italian","review":"Buon gameplay ,\nFinalmente qualcosa di originale .\nAncora un po scarno , dopo un tot di ore si inizia a sentire la necessita' di qualcosa di piu, che sicuramente verrà messo!\nMerita fiducia","timestamp_created":1466683284,"timestamp_updated":1466683506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23725031","author":{"steamid":"76561198025928209","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":48286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":793,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1660313804},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeu, le principe est cool, mais le jeu devient agaçant, quand c'est connard de Tueur camp devant le crochet, car ils n'ont pas de cerveau, j'espère que ce truc va être réglé, y'a bon nombres de tueurs que ça va refroidir.","timestamp_created":1466683177,"timestamp_updated":1466683177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23725013","author":{"steamid":"76561198156402411","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":16063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1821,"last_played":1633193419},"language":"german","review":"Spiel beginnt.\n1er generator fertig.\nkiller kommt und ich verstecke mich.\nkiller findet mich.\nkiller mobbt.\nkann dem killer entkommen.\nkiller jagt mich.\nkiller fängt mich.\nwiggle wiggle.\nkann entkommen.\nkiller bekommt mich wieder.\n......\nstehen blöd hinter einer wand und nix passirt.\nkann nicht wigglen.\nsurvivor will mich retten.\nsteht vor dem killer.\nnix passiert.\nsie entkommen.\nkiller steht immer noch hinter der wand mit mir auf den schultern.\nhappyend!.\noder!\nspiel beginnt.\nEntkommen!.\n...hä?

You play either as a psychopath with 3 different class to choose from, try to find 4 other survivors in an enclosed environment, and hook them up on meat hooks to die. As a survivors, you work with 3 others to try to escape via toggling some switches in the same environment.

Give it a go if you like to try out unique experiences and know what you are getting in to, you may end up liking it a lot and as far as I know there is nothing else quite like this out there right now.  The co op game play can be very satisfying at times.  Grabbing people mid-action and hanging them on meat hooks is also incredibly satisfying if you're in to that sort of thing and let's not kid ourselves, who isn't.\n\nAs far as an objective recommendation though, I'm inclined to steer most people who are on the fence away from this game.  Without going in to lots of details and listing where I believe the game could use polish, etc, I'd say at it's worst it is a frustrating exercise in futility and at best it is a game that manages to have some satisfying mechanics but will ultimately not likely be much fun for most people to play on a moment to moment basis.\n\nA horror game where abusing 3rd person camera angle is the core of the gameplay (as survivor)\n\nFeatures exciting gameplay mechanics such as:\n  -holding m1 for long periods of time while listening for audio cues\n  -resisting the urge to hold m1\n  -holding lctrl for long periods of time while listening for audio cues\n  -getting interrupted by evil within bomb-disarming style mini-game at random moments while holding buttons\n  -some kind of physical training involving jumping over window sills repeatedly\n  -as the killer, feel an overwhelming sense of isolation as the survivors ignore you completely while doing these exercises\n  -hammering the spacebar for long periods of time to literally not die\n  -user friendly controls: nothing in this game requires precision, only the ability to outsmart idiots and use cheap tactics\n  -rare items that change things by 2 and 3%\n  -a convoluted ranking system that encourages people to not want to play with each other\n  -user friendly configuration options (they are simply left out)\n  -character models which you can dress up\n  -wooden pallet stomping\n\nOK I digress; the game really isn't bad and it does have a hell of a lot going for it, but it's obviously and unfortunately currently not for me and I urge you to research it before you buy it.\nI will be going back to check this game out again in a month or so and see what it has to offer at that time because I really wish I enjoyed playing it more than I do and maybe some changes will remedy that for me.","timestamp_created":1466672670,"timestamp_updated":1466672840,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23722583","author":{"steamid":"76561198043683816","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1622875369},"language":"english","review":"Entertaining gameplay however, there are some major flaws.\n\n1) you can't play with your friends unless you have a full 5. This sucks because its rough to get 5 people together. It also means poeple are constantly leaving and joining lobbies to try and find their friends. Making the wait even longer.\n\n2) There is no ranking system. So the rank one players just ruin the experience for killers.\n\n3) It's plagued by a series of glitches. The somewhat clunky gameplay plus loading and joining glitches really just makes trying to get into a game an unpleasant experience.\n\n4) This one is more personal preference but I think having a random number generator in the core mechanics really ruins the game.
