of why you should not buy dead by daylight and why you should avoid it and save your money on something better instead or just hold out until things get better for the game.\n\n1. infested with cheaters and hackers that could hold the game hostage and ddos the servers and also track IPS which playing without a VPN is a terrible idea if you're a streamer (and also another thing to mention but i will let you look up what happened to some streamers that got their ips tracked) and I'm quite sure the devs won't do nothing about it yet, and speaking of devs\n\n2. devs don't care mostly about the games health or performance, plus on their official twitter they just announced they where working and supporting NFTs with the pinhead dlc and want to milk every little penny out of your pocket, legit the most careless and soulless devs besides *some other big name video game corporations*\n\n3. really horrible community that's an absolute wreck and if you don't trust me just look up some videos on youtube about some streamers and random players *and yeah places like twitch really allow that stuff* \n\n4. mostly stuffed to the brim with paid DLC with perks that are somewhat OP or complete trash. and its an awful experience if your a new player and have to go through the grind; BTW there is a battle pass as well that's mostly stuffed with garbage charms and ugly cosmetics.\n\n5. the gameplay gets very stale after at least probably a few hours of play with the same objective aka hold m1 for a thousand years on a generator and watch out for skill checks as well and run if you see the killer and avoid getting downed and if you mess up you get hooked and have to wait for someone to run and help *god i wish there was something you can do while you wait for someone to rescue you on the hook or on the ground* but the devs probably won't change anything about the objective or making the game fun outside of perks and killers.\n\nand that should be about it, there are more better reasons of why not to buy this absolute train wreck of a game but i would rather keep this short and not turn this into a giant rant but over all not a lot of redeeming quality's about dead by daylight besides music in my opinion. but over all ill give the game a 3.5/ 10 the game is just awful mostly and amazed this game even lasted 5 YEARS BY THE WAY or more soon by the time of making this, just what an absolute joke of a game and developers and might as well include the community; reminds me of siege.

Strangers to Dead By Daylight don't understand the game. They wonder: How can a game with such a plain gameplay have thousands of players? All survivors need to do on any map is repairing generators that power up gates that can be opened. Surely, such a game won't keep players interested for a long time? Eventually, players must get bored, right? One might think they should. But the opposite is happening. DBD has even spread to new platforms. Undoubtedly, some players might genuinely like this game. Other players might be suffering from sunk cost fallacy. Remember that DBD is selling many outfit skins for 10 [sic!] bucks each. Now, if you were a player who bought some of them, you might think: \"I can't just stop playing the game\". Otherwise you'd be forced to come to the realization that you fell into a marketing trap, helped by the rise of DBD on twitch and the many streamers wearing fancy outfits. This is not something I want to see in a video game.\n\nEven though the gameplay is nothing special, many players will have many hours in this game since it is an easy get-go game to play with your friends. I have hundreds of hours in DBD, yet I have nothing to show for - only regret. I would say that I spent around shocking 50% of my playtime either in the lobby or spending bloodpoints in the bloodweb. And I have seen DBD at its worst. I'm speaking of waiting times up to 20min, which is longer than a match lasts. I'm speaking of crashes of either you or one of the other 4 players 4 out of 10 times. I'm speaking of crashes that occured whenever any players used the bloody party streamers offering. If you don't know: This is a thing that makes this grindy game a bit less grindy. I and many other players lost millions of bloodpoints because they can't fix their game. There are still ground-breaking bugs in DBD. The devs claim that they have problems fixing the bugs because of their spaghetti code. This might be true, but instead of committing to bugfixes, they are still spamming DLC updates. Also, every single update breaks the game and adds 30 new bugs to it. They don't seem to be testing their updates much at all. This is why every hyped up event they are running is plagued by massive bugs every year. Even the devs started to joke about the bug-ridden state of the game in the loading screens. \n\nGood games are the ones you like to remember. DBD won't be a game where I will look back to all the fond memories and be glad that I played it. There is no rewarding \"sense of pride and accomplishment\". Nothing. And for that, DBD deserves a negative review.","timestamp_created":1548797987,"timestamp_updated":1595836805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.63132023811340332","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48634907","author":{"steamid":"76561198226103568","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":216079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":152,"playtime_at_review":91460,"last_played":1660514564},"language":"russian","review":"Никаких изменений  в игре за 3 года игры, разве что изменены карты, что приятно, конечно, но делать одно и тоже уже 3 года не особо тянет, а разработчики ничего не хотят выпускать нового в игру.

Come at me Legion mains, I will logic your asses out of Mars.\n\nSo you people are telling me a killer with a guaranteed down isn't boring to go up against? If a Legion fully commits to chasing a single person they will get downed no matter what. \"Same goes for every killer\" well let's look at Wraith or even Billy, they could get looped for 5 gens if they are trash, but have you ever seen a Legion who got looped for 5 gens? It does not matter how skillful or trash you are, you simply press right click you get a speed boost, recovery speed (attacking) and the ability to vault over pallets or windows, shutting down the only way a survivor could counter against a killer. \n\n\"Just play stealthy duheuhueheuh\" survivors could play stealthy but have you seen a match where a killer fails to find a single survivor for the entire game? No? Then someone will get downed, and during frenzy the survivors' location are shown to you, \"but that's the role of the killers\" of course it is, and the killers are suppose to be the powerful being that goes against the 4 survivors, so it makes sense for the killer to be strong, but it doesn't make sense to make survivors incapable of countering against killers, you can vault pallets and windows faster than survivors with a massive speed boost that last for nearly 10 seconds, if you can't get someone downed? You're trash, if you can? That is just normal because you're playing Legion.\n\n\"His power has a penalty\" no shit sherlock even a rank 20 would notice that, but the penalty is not enough for survivors to get their bearings, \"Nurse has a much more op power why you not complain?\" because Nurse require skills, you need to predict the movement of survivors and you can't hit them once and wait until they bleed out, not only that, everytime after Nurse blinks, she gets exhausted and look towards to ground, having a very unclear visual of her surroundings and the survivors' location, what does Legion have instead? Just holding his hands up while screaming like the degenerates playing him after getting outplayed, you can still clearly look at the survivors while having that exhausted animation, then proceeds to chase up to the survivors.\n\n\"He only has 110% movement speed\" but that doesn't matter when his power boosts his movement speed to a million percent, you can just use your power and you will catch up and get a hit off in no time, unlike other killers where they have to go all the way around pallets or windows (yes killers can vault windows but it is slower than survivors even with Bamboozled, unless you are T3 Myers or Wraith using shadow dance addon) causing them to lose distance, while Legion just yeets over pallets and window so fast during frenzy if the survivor does not have Lithe it's a guaranteed hit for the Legion then his power gauage just get filled for another easy hit.\n\n\"Survivors can 360 him during frenzy\" they could, but I doubt they can pull it off 5 times consistently every 20 seconds, because the recovery time during his frenzy is so fast that you can actually hit a wall 10 times before the power gauage runs out and 20 times if you are using the duration addon. Plus its not like 360s are easy to pull off.\n\n\"Legion is weak because he can not proc NOED or Devour Hope during frenzy\" I don't think I need to explain this one? Because having a killer with more movement speed from NOED or Devour Hope that runs at you faster than other killers who could also vault over pallets or windows faster than you vault them while also being able to miss 3 hits without penalty can insta down you is straight up retarded, if you have ever had the impression that this would have worked then please I am concerned for you health, get a doctor please.\n\n\"Survivors can still use OP perks like Decisive Strike and they can still gen rush Legion, plus survivors could still use items\" every killer has to go against that, so it really isn't a valid arguement, and items? Insta-heals don't work on deep wound status so its worthless and flashlights don't work because there are no animation that is 3.33 seconds time for Legion except for picking up a survivor, so items won't do much against a Legion.\n\n\"Legion is bad without addons\" no he is not, you can still get guaranteed downs easily without addons, it just takes 5-10 more seconds to do so, time is indeed precious for killers and 10 seconds could cause an entire game, but that is your own problem then for being bad at the game so survivors could counter a Legion. So what if you use addons? Iredecent ones are alright, cooldowns, duration and movement are also decent, but Frank's Mixtape is as broken as a 50 blink Nurse you can down people in 7 seconds if you use your power correctly, a 7 seconds chase for every situation, in killer shack, in jungle gyms and at infinites a 7 second down, yeah sure that's balanced.\n\n\"Legion can not get kills without tunneling or camping\" he can, you're just trash, even Freddy can get 4ks without tunneling or camping, so can a Legion.\n\n\"This killer is fun\" yeah, he is, for the killer only. You can finally dominate the match by playing Legion because there isn't a single way to counter him. But survivors on the other hand, have to deal with a killer that can just brainlessly chase them with next to 0 effort and is capable of tunneling so efficiently that all the killers would be jealous of it. \"Nurse, billy and spirit can also tunnel\" yeah but they require skills to land hits on people, unlike Legion.\n\nTry to use logic instead of insults, maybe that would help you sweaty tryhard Legion mains to win an argument or two, especially those who can't construct a sentence properly, yet decided to come out to poorly insult someone to embrasse themselves. Not only does that indicate that you have a very poor personality (attacking people just because their opinion differs to yours) and how childish you are for using insults instead of brains. Hopefully there is a single \"Legion Main\" with a functional frontal lobe to at least understand what I am trying to prove here. If you want to debunk me, go ahead, if you attack me with immature insults then it simply further proves my point of how I am correct and you are wrong, as you cannot find fault in my logic and have to resort to verbally attacking someone over the Internet.\n\nLegion mains' logic and sentences : lololollololllo leon is week n niid boof niid perma noed to get 1 kiiil XDXDDDDDDXXD if u agre no u bad bad at gam gam me edgy an cool lek I alchoalllllliccc fathar xdddddddddd dab dab lit jake paul is me peepee sucky.\n\nProve me wrong.

La mayoría de partidas encontras un ping promedio de 250ms o 300ms.\n * Los hitboxes están hechos horribles, el killer te puede pegar desde 2 metros en ciertos casos con partidas algo lageadas y no es solo culpa del lag, si no del hitbox. Si sos experto y sabes hacer 360, el killer solo tiene que mover rapido su mouse para cualquier lado prácticamente y te pega igual gracias al Hitbox.\n * Muchos dlc a mi parecer, con ventajas que en parte son PayToWin, (No tengo ds, barbacoa y chile, muerte de franklin, étc) con suerte te sale una perk en el santuario de los secretos, pero casi siempre son perks de personajes no dlc.\n * La movilidad me parece buena, de survivor podés ver por los costados o arriba donde está el killer mientras vos te escondes, mientras que de killer esto no se puede, es en 1era persona.\n * Las partidas privadas están bugeadisimas, el ds no funciona casi nunca, el chungo aveces no funciona, étc.\n * Tiene bastantes bugs, en su mayoría visuales pero también hay otros que salís volando o cosas del estilo, además de que los visuales como uno que te hace sangrar como si te reventaran una arteria hacen que el killer te pueda ver aunque estés atrás de un árbol o roca.\n * Falta muchisimas cosas a mi parecer y el juego sería algo famoso, como más opciones de personalización en privadas (como elegir que perks se pueden usar, poder jugar con más de 4 survivors) \n * Ya dije que el ping depende en un 99% del killer, así que hace tiempo que rogamos servidores dedicados para que no sea molesto el tema del ping/lag. (Supuestamente lo implementan este año)\n * Es increíblemente adictivo, lo único que te quita las ganas de jugar son killers tóxicos o survivors trolls.\n * Sistema de reportes INÚTIL. Reportes por lo que sea a alguien solo está de decoración.\n * Se permite el tuneleo y facecampeo (Solo dicen que se permiten para no tomarse la molestia de banearlos) capaz te bajan de un gancho y te sigue persiguiendo a vos, te vuelve a enganchar y se queda en frente del gancho el resto de la partida.\n * Ganar BloodPoints es enormemente difícil, con una partida algo buena ganas 20K bloodpoints y te los gastás fácil en 4 cosas verdes (Valen 5k cada una) 15 minutos de partida para mejorar 4 cosas de la red de sangre y para pasar de nivel son como 15 cosas que hay que comprar.\n \n En fin, creo que no tengo mucho más que opinar. ¿Recomiendo el juego? Sí, tiene un precio algo bueno y es muy adictivo aunque en la mayoría de partidas quieras partir el teclado contra el monitor por uno de los 40 errores que mencioné anteriormente. Si el juego está en oferta te recomiendo mucho que lo compres. Pese a que la mayoría de cosas que dije eran negativas, igualmente lo recomiendo porque tiene un buen precio, es adictivo y jugar con amigos es lo mejor del mundo acá.","timestamp_created":1548731115,"timestamp_updated":1548731115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491803258657455444","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48619757","author":{"steamid":"76561198112709824","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4646,"last_played":1639713519},"language":"english","review":"The developers have just been trying to milk this game for as much money as possible adding in new characters and maps rather than fixing any of the bugs in this game, but that's fine.
