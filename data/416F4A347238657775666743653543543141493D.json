Overall, I don't recommend DBD unless you're willing to overlook its myriad flaws.\n\nIf the problems plaguing this game ever change, I will gladly edit my review to reflect the changes.\n\n~BALANCE ISSUES~\n\nBalance issues are fixable, but the company behind DBD has proven unwilling or unable to fix them over its 5 year lifespan. Once a killer catches you, they are meant to place you on a hook requiring a teammate to rescue you in a timely fashion, and once you've been hooked 3 times you're out. Sounds simple and fair, right?\n\nUnfortunately, there's nothing in this game to incentivize killers to actually *catch* you 3 times on 3 separate occasions. Killers are barely disincentivized from placing you on a hook and then going out of their way to ensure you're never safely rescued. You can literally play and die in a match having only been caught once and having only controlled your character for a minute or less. The game therefore effectively relies on an honor system where you just hope the killer is willing to play with everyone's fun in mind, and as you can imagine lots of people don't care.\n\nPart of the reason killers feel pressured to play this way again comes back to balance. In a well-balanced game where the killer and 4 survivors are all of equal skill level, killers are unable to catch people fast enough to play according to the aforementioned 'honor system'. Survivors can fix 5 generators and open the exit gates in the time it takes to get 4/12 hooks against competent survivors.\n\nIf this game were <1 year old, I'd say these problems are fixable, but a solution to these problems should have been reached by now and it hasn't been.\n\n~PERKS~\n\nThe game features upwards of 75 perks for both killers and survivors of which you can equip 4 to your character before the match begins. In a better game, this would allow for lots of build options and customization, but in DBD there's a serious canyon in power level between the good and bad perks. The best perks are sometimes gated behind DLC characters (especially for killers), and once you have the good perks unlocked there's simply no reason to experiment with other builds, because 90% of the perks as both killer and survivor suck.\n\nAdditionally, this game has a point redemption system where you earn \"bloodpoints\" during matches, and use them to unlock more perks semi-randomly for each character. Additionally, each perk has 3 levels that each need to be unlocked individually with points. This means that for both killer and survivor, there are over 70x3 perks to be unlocked for each character, and 90% of them are nearly useless as previously mentioned. \n\nThis contributes to an insufferable grind; I have over 300 hours in the game, some of the best tools for grinding, and I've unlocked maybe 25% of the perks across all characters.\n\n~BUGS~\n\nThis game is a buggy mess, like Bethesda levels of bugs. The Resident Evil update causes the game to regularly crash on consoles, and the new map was disabled less than a day after release for bug fixing. The previous character update, the Trickster, broke the functionality of pallets and introduced game-breaking bugs into two years-old perks for no apparent reason. I didn't play during the Twins update last November, but it was apparently even worse. If you play this game, you will run into many, many bugs ranging from annoying to literally game-breaking.\n\n~VERDICT~\n\nOverall, I'd give DBD a 6/10. The core concept of this game is excellent, but balance issues and bugs spoil at least half of the fun this game promises. The devs have had 5 years to fix those problems, but they fix them far too slowly while introducing more along the way.\n\nIf you're really bored and know what you're getting into with this game, you may have fun with it. If you're expecting an A+ multiplayer experience, look somewhere else.","timestamp_created":1616883024,"timestamp_updated":1624758560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89211927","author":{"steamid":"76561198314519923","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4650,"last_played":1655911762},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego es muy divertido para jugar con amigos","timestamp_created":1616882464,"timestamp_updated":1616882464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89211325","author":{"steamid":"76561199080022500","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17373,"last_played":1655958040},"language":"french","review":"ik","timestamp_created":1616881696,"timestamp_updated":1616881696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89211108","author":{"steamid":"76561199136345675","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2191,"last_played":1641859367},"language":"english","review":"good to play but not all the time","timestamp_created":1616881449,"timestamp_updated":1616881449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89210783","author":{"steamid":"76561198068350492","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2679,"last_played":1645580725},"language":"english","review":"I very much enjoy the gameplay loop, I wish the servers didnt take a fucking hour to find a game though","timestamp_created":1616881001,"timestamp_updated":1616881001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89210724","author":{"steamid":"76561198305381611","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":846,"last_played":1639138643},"language":"russian","review":"Главное не скипать..","timestamp_created":1616880938,"timestamp_updated":1616880938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89210537","author":{"steamid":"76561198318512052","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":19378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":492,"last_played":1660568276},"language":"turkish","review":"DLC - Süt Brothers / Şaban oğlu şaban\n\nKiller : Gulyabani\n\nSurvivors: Şaban - Ramazan\n\n\nPerkler\n\nŞaban : Gizli Polis\n\nSelmayı ele geçirip elmas hırsızını bulmak için eline geçen her fırsatı değerlendiriyorsun.\n\nMücadeleye 1 nişan ile başlarsın.

The gameplay itself is really fun - while the atmosphere of crippling terror only lasts for your first few games as a survivor (barring the stealthy killers - the paranoia factor with those guys never goes away), there's a nice level of tension and challenge on both sides, and you never really know if your opponent is going to mindgame you or murder you or maybe even meme at you. Say what you will, but there's a lot of surprisingly wholesome interactions in a game where a big person with a pointy object brutally murders four slightly smaller people who wish they had pointy objects.\n\nThat said, if you are looking at this game, there's two things to be warned about. First is that this game is an immense grind. While it's possible to buy all non-licensed characters in-game instead of paying for the DLC, it will take an immense number of matches to get enough currency for one of them, and the same goes for leveling up those characters so that everyone the perks you want them to. You're looking at several thousand hours of play to unlock everyone and every perk, and that's before even touching the cosmetics. Second issue is the community. While there's plenty of friendly players, you will run into lot of very nasty people that will get angry at you for just playing the game. It's true that some strategies are more fun for the other side than others, and you can stoke more or less salt based on how you play, but no matter what you do, on either side, you are going to run into players who will do their best to make your game miserable and then gloat about it in the endgame chat. There's no way to avoid it. And you will have discouraging matches, especially as a newcomer, when the matchmaking pairs you against players vastly outside your skill level (or, when playing killer, four people in voice chat that will call your every move to each other and absolutely decimate you with their coordination.) Learning the ropes can be draining when this happens, though it's a lot more enjoyable once you hit your stride, and you do learn just from watching how people play against you.\n\nThe game has its bugs, but there's only been a couple of times where I was actually hindered by them. New content and hotfixes come out pretty regularly.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great game to play for fun, but a very frustrating and unhappy one to play to win. If you're fiercely competitive, you're going to have a love-hate relationship with this game, but if you're looking for a good time and some jumpscares, it's not a bad way to spend $20.","timestamp_created":1616876304,"timestamp_updated":1616876304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509116411209106445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89205815","author":{"steamid":"76561199133021045","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1734,"playtime_at_review":1398,"last_played":1660596309},"language":"russian","review":"nice game:)","timestamp_created":1616875001,"timestamp_updated":1616875001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89204919","author":{"steamid":"76561199055854480","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":40916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":423,"playtime_at_review":11316,"last_played":1660558036},"language":"english","review":"Dead by daylight has made many improvements to the game this year and I'm excited to see more progress!","timestamp_created":1616873961,"timestamp_updated":1656804084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89203113","author":{"steamid":"76561198283724225","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5294,"last_played":1655148640},"language":"english","review":"This game makes normally alot of fun, but the toxic community destroys it.

Anyone who's been playing DBD for more than 500 hours knows that any review below that should not count for anything. Why? Because the game is ran by a bunch of immature, microtransaction-obsessed devs with crap customer service, crap community management, who can't even play their own game. And anyone who's been around a few yrs and has seen these devs play their own game know they all SUCK and yet still insist on ignoring balance advice from players with 5k+ hours who have mastered both killer and survivor. These devs keep deliberately messing with the rank system so trash players can make it to top ranks and some streamers and players alike who've been around ages and are actually good at the game know it's most likely also to do with the fact they get tired of being exposed as low-rank and low-skilled players with thousands of hours ON THEIR OWN GAME.\n\nThat being said. I have gotten banned from this game for something I did not do, and from experience with browsing their forums and streams. I already know Behavior Interactive aka BHVR have a very casual, careless, sardonic way of talking to and about their players. They have a very \"I'm right, you're wrong.\" \"Your opinion doesn't matter, our data with no context does.\", we do what we want and say what we want how we want to and if you don't like it play another game cause we don't need you\" type of attitude. So I didn't have much optimism using their \"Ban Appeal\" report system on their site when I was inquiring about them properly investigating my ban. Turns out~ I was basically ignored, and told by someone called Alexander [paraphrased] that the purpose of the ban appeal system is to tell people who have been banned that they don't get a second chance, and then they refused to tell me although I asked TWICE if my ban from steam is a HWID one. This goes back to them being money hungry; because the only way for me to know if I have a HWID ban since they refuse to answer, is to BUY THE GAME AGAIN on another account, and see if I get automatically banned again some day. This game is run by butthole devs who just get their jimmies off on being rude to their player base and ignoring people who genuinely want to make the game more fun for everyone and not just a specific group of people.\n\nAlso, to anyone who says this game is not survivor sided (And I'm saying this as someone who's good with both sides). There was a 2019 or 2020 New Years stream on twitch you guys may find if they left the recording up, where the devs specifically said they care more about balancing the game for the majority of players which just so happens to be low-mid rank/skilled survivor mains. So anyone who says otherwise is delusional and arguing against facts put out there.\n\nAlso I HIGHLY recommend playing HOME SWEET HOME SURVIVAL. It has everything Dead by Daylight gameplay has and more. from looping and coordinating objectives with your team, different maps, survivors and killers, and you can even hit the killer like friday the 13th to stun them or straight kill them if you're prepared enough for that. There's also helping downed teammates like dbd as well and lots of hilarious and crazy situations. It's the closest game to dbd you can find imo not even Identity V caught my interest like Home Sweet Home Survival does. You can also type in the game if you want to and use ad lib stickers to better communicate with your team quickly. It's still in Beta/early access right now but I've been playing it since the 3rd day of my ban and I have a lot of fun with it playing both sides. I'm not spending another penny on dbd because I refuse to go back to playing console, and these devs are arrogant, sardonic assholes who get paid way too much for how disrespectful they are to their playerbase in general.","timestamp_created":1616866263,"timestamp_updated":1616866263,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89197635","author":{"steamid":"76561198870158501","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":30727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":823,"playtime_at_review":13393,"last_played":1660556772},"language":"koreana","review":"조금밖에 해보지않아서 잘 모르겠지만 재미있습니다.","timestamp_created":1616866036,"timestamp_updated":1616866036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89197588","author":{"steamid":"76561198158761630","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5208,"last_played":1639002767},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un gran juego para pasarlo con amigos... \n\n...sin embargo, hay algunas fallas como el emparejamiento en línea (en determinadas horas de la noche comienza a tardar demasiado encontrar jugadores para una partida), los camperos, los supervivientes tóxicos, los servidores en general...\n\nA pesar de estos problemas, lo recomiendo mucho si quieres pasarlo bien.

de este maravilloso juego. Simplemente es un amor/odio, en parte es bueno el juego, su dinamica y su variedad. Pero lastimosamente existe mucha toxicidad tomando el rol como asesino, de hecho los propios supervivientes dan mas terror que los propios killer.Inventado reglas y decir como uno tiene que jugar. Pero en fin... Buen juego para viciar y seguir viciandolo,ah y tambien gracias a dios hay un pase se siente mejor jugar por un objetivo que simplemente jugar.","timestamp_created":1616838597,"timestamp_updated":1656587582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89170869","author":{"steamid":"76561199134960232","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1623062046},"language":"schinese","review":"可以很好玩","timestamp_created":1616837046,"timestamp_updated":1616837046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89170702","author":{"steamid":"76561199109631569","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1659417449},"language":"schinese","review":"很刺激\n","timestamp_created":1616836804,"timestamp_updated":1616836804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89169713","author":{"steamid":"76561198257568885","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":96283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":602,"playtime_at_review":43205,"last_played":1660584373},"language":"koreana","review":"너~무 재밌음 이제 접어야지","timestamp_created":1616835359,"timestamp_updated":1616835359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89168391","author":{"steamid":"76561198075852438","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":26169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23251,"last_played":1654935921},"language":"english","review":"i like being murdered wearing penguin pjs","timestamp_created":1616833412,"timestamp_updated":1616833412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89168139","author":{"steamid":"76561198117517947","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":7377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5771,"last_played":1656348732},"language":"spanish","review":"===[ Gráficos ]===\n❌Muy malos.\n❌Malos.\n❌Clásico.\n❌Pixel Art bello\n❌ Pixel Art malo\n❌Normales.\n❌Correctos.\n❌Buenos.\n✔️Muy buenos.\n❌Excelentes.\n\n===[ Rendimiento ]===\n❌Injugable.\n❌Caída de FPS de vez en cuando.\n✔️ Bueno.\n❌Muy bueno.\n\n===[Precio/calidad ]===\n✔️Cómpralo No seas rata.\n❌Espera a que baje de precio.
