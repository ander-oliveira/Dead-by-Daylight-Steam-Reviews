Sounds easy and stress free, right? Well this isn't like what you played in elementary recess. There is hardly a way to truly \"win\" in this game. Survivors escape by powering five of seven generators, or by jumping through a carefully hidden trap door that only opens if one survivor is left in the trial. The job of the killer is to prevent any from escaping. But there is no clear victory. Yes, you may have escaped, but the rest of your team died. Yes, you may have killed one, but the others evaded you. The only two match ends that are clear success or defeats are either all four survivors dying, or all four escaping. To this end, no one ever TRULY wins, but you also never TRULY lose. \n    Survivor game play is very simple and varies little from character to character. Each character has a max of four perks that can do things like grant an invincible dodge or even spawn flash bangs. Each survivor has three perks only they have access to initially. After reaching levels 30, 35, and 40, you unlock teachable versions of these perks. This makes the perks appear in the skill trees of other survivors(or killers). Survivors use these perks to assist in repairing generators, avoiding the killer, winning chases, supporting each other, and gaining other tactical advantages. Items are consumable, non perk abilities also unlocked with BP(Bloodpoints: AKA EXP) that have two add on slots to amplify/ alter their existing ability. These include but are in no way limited to; Medkits(unlocking self heal and accelerated team heal), Flashlights(capable of temporarily blinding the killer), Toolboxes(Allow accelerated repair speed and unlock hook sabotage actions.), and many more. The survivors must work together to impair the killer long enough to activate five generators, open the exit gates and escape. Simple concept, but when you're actually playing the game, more vast levels of depth can be found in this upscaled tag simulator. More often than not, you have to outsmart the killer on the fly to escape a chase with your life. There is no more satisfying feeling in the game than winning a difficult or challenging chase sequence.\n   Killers are much more individually unique in terms of differing game play to the survivors. Each killer more or less plays different. Hillbilly is insanely fast and can instantly down survivors with his high speed, albeit rather clunky chainsaw sprint. Huntress on the other hand is slow, and makes up for this speed drop by carrying around throwing axes. All killers have three unique perks, two add on slots for their power, and four perk slots max. Killer perks do things that hinder trials, like creating claws to block generators, or seeing survivors through walls, but in return for this power, certain conditions must be met. To win, you down survivors. One hit injures, the second hit downs. Holding down attack will allow you to do a speedy, desperate lunge, and tapping it will do a quick attack or heave oblivious survivors off their feet if they are preoccupied with another task. Then you place them on meat hooks. Each survivor has to be hooked 1-3 times to be killed. There is a timer that slowly runs down on the hook leading to their death. They get hooked a second time, the first half of the timer is excluded. Hooked a third time, and they die. If they reached the second timer state on the first hook, they die on the second.\n  (Both sides have access to an item called offerings, which allow small changes to a game, such as increased XP, specific maps, or hook alterations.)\n  I'll give you an example of a full kit for a killer. Nemesis(My favorite killer) has two AI zombies that infect, injure, or down survivors if they wander too close. Since you see them through walls at all times, you can see if a zombie is chasing someone, and get a general idea of where the survivors are. His primary power is a quick long range melee whip that can hit over pallets, vaults, and some loops. This is insanely useful when a survivor has to use a vault or pallet, and if a Nemesis player attacks during this moment, the hit is almost always guaranteed. Hit enough people or zombies, and you'll mutate to a max of three tiers. Tier two allows the strike to break pallets, and tier three allots the tyrant extra strike range. Any zombies destroyed respawn in a set time-frame. His first perk allows him to see survivors for a few seconds at the game's start, eliminating the phase where you are just hunting the gens for survivors. His second sets a flash bang trap on any generators by kicking them, which detonate once another person gets downed, damage generators further, and reveal anyone who was working on a trapped gen. There is no cap on trappable generators. His third and final perk inflicts the oblivious status effect (eliminating the ability to hear Nemesis' terror radius(music cues that let you know how close he is within a certain distance)) on all injured survivors once another survivor is put into the injured state. His addons alter his power in many ways. Some make his mutation rate go up, others increase zombie respawn time, others do weirder things too, like making any destroyed zombie spawn by the exits once they are powered. \n  The only times DBD wasn't fun to me was due to three specific reasons; balancing issues, item/ add on exploitation, and text chat toxicity. Some survive with friends(SWF) lobbies will abuse an add on called 'brand new part' for the toolbox, allowing four of the five generators to activate mere minutes into a match assuming they all go for different gens.  Certain killers have either perks, add ons, or powers that aren't wholly fair either. Spirit for instance has been the bane of many survivors since her release, thanks to a simple yet quite hard to counter power of phase walking. She can see red scratch marks(a mechanic not dissimilar to tracking footprints) and turn invisible, leaving a physical husk that remains stationary as she moves. The counter play; wear headphones. But these days a minor nerf was introduced that makes her phase in and out of the power, but even that only helps so much.\n  This third reason is not something that can be easily addressed, as people will be people, but doesn't make it anymore infuriating once encountered at a bad time. ANYBODY who has played killer for an extended amount of time will tell you how toxic survivors can really be. It's not just survivor exclusive either - some killers are just as bad, though I have ran into toxic killers noticeably less than toxic survivors. I also primarily played killer for a year, so I might not be the best to use as a scale of toxic survivor vs killer populations. That aside, some people set out to intentionally give the other players the worst experience possible. Kind of like when hackers on R6 would show up, kill their entire team, then the whole enemy team. No one enjoys this on either side of the game. \n   Things like bugs, minor glitches, and poor player matchmaking never bothered me much. I don't like to sweat bullets playing video games, and Dead By Daylight is not to be played super competitively. Sometimes I want to win, other times I just screw around to test things out. DBD is NOT a game you'll have fun with if you only see it as a competitive game. Trust me on this, and take the good with the bad. For many games like Battlefield 2042 and Cyberpunk, the bad vastly outweighs the good. But here, DBD has never been noticeably bad without a lot more good to offer.","timestamp_created":1639248413,"timestamp_updated":1655322657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105656595","author":{"steamid":"76561198988178771","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":127064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":983,"playtime_at_review":86535,"last_played":1659891098},"language":"swedish","review":"Best Ever!! c\",)","timestamp_created":1639248253,"timestamp_updated":1639248253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105656214","author":{"steamid":"76561198795878505","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12674,"last_played":1657913302},"language":"brazilian","review":"dahora","timestamp_created":1639247819,"timestamp_updated":1639247819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105656195","author":{"steamid":"76561198192551205","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":20050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":109,"playtime_at_review":3598,"last_played":1660505384},"language":"german","review":"Sagen wir so, hat minimales Suchtpotenzial.","timestamp_created":1639247805,"timestamp_updated":1639247805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105655994","author":{"steamid":"76561198947234365","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53851,"last_played":1659210826},"language":"english","review":"I really love Dbd. It is and will be my favorite game for ever. But after a lot of games I deleted it. The game is fine itself but there is so so so so much toxic people on this game killers and survivors. Yes this game is super fun to play with friends as survivors but not at all as killer. Some survivors and killers are the MOST beyond toxic I have ever played against in ANY game. I don't mind people t-bagging or flashlight saving or tunneling or camping. Yes it makes the game shitty but you shouldn't be mad about it because it happens. But the last week or so I am beyond suprised with the not needed toxicity in this game and it hurts tbh. I don't care if there are survivors or killers with OP items or add-ons but like bringing a flashlight to only click with it or bring a mori only to tunnel survivors to death is so so not needed for survivors and killers. I am a survivor main and once in a blue moon I play killer but sometimes you go against a team of survivors with flashlights and you think \"oh okay'' and than the only thing they do is using the flashlights to click to just make the game so unfun and the same with some killers that just tunnel and camp because you looped them for a little too long. What I want to say to new players is make sure you have friends playing that can help you and have fun with and please show them toxic people that being toxic is not needed and is making the game not fun for both sides.

Typically, I enjoy playing single player RPG games, strategy games or survival/builder style stuff.  That said, I finally decided to give it a try recently and I have been pleasantly surprised.  \n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that I have absolutely 0 fun playing as a survivor unless I'm playing with my friends.  Trying to play a survivor with a random group of other people just doesn't do anything to bring me joy.  In fact, I find it extremely irritating to get into a group with other people who just don't work together at all.  To each their own, I understand there can be a draw to this type of approach, but its not for me.  That said, if I can have at least one friend with me while I'm playing survivor, it can be extremely fun!  Working together to avoid the killer, repair generators or try to distract the killer when your friend is in trouble is all fun!\n\nWhen I am playing solo, killer is by far my preferred way to go.  The killers feel varied and while I like some more than others, they all seem to have unique quirks to them.  It feels fun and rewarding to be working against a team of four other survivors and even in matches where I am getting absolutely skunked, so long as the survivors aren't exhibiting deliberately toxic behavior, even a lost match where I don't kill a single one is rewarding.\n\nThe grind in the game can very slow.  You basically earn blood points, which you spend on items or perks.  Not a bad system but it can feel slow if you continually get into matches and don't earn many blood points.\n\nThe game's biggest weakness that I can see is the matchmaking system.  I'm not entirely sure how it works but I often get paired up against people who are way above my skill level, whether I'm playing survivor or killer.  It is not uncommon for me to be a bronze ranked player (lower end) and be pitted against iridescent players (top end).

After over 2500 hours of DBD, playing 50/50 survivor/killer, the last patch really broke the game.\n\nBalance & Perks:\nBalance is not existing anymore, the game has become killer-sided and buffed the killers too much. A kiler main can get 4K without being a tryhard. The base BT kit is a joke - it was added to prevent the killers from tunelling, but in the reality this kit doesn't help at all. The killer follows you for 3 secs and downs you again. D-Strike has been nerved once more and now stuns the killer for less than 3s, which means you can't make any distance at all. He will just follow you and give you another hit unless you make it to the next loop spot or pallet. When the gates are powered, the dev's allow the killer to tunnel you to death as D-Strike will be no longer functional. Deadhard has now a very silly animation and is now one of the worst perks just because people used it too much. Why did they remove the extra BPs for WGLF? Solo-Q has become a real pain, you need to have a lot of luck that you either get unhooked or not immediately camped. There are still enough possibilities as killer to bring a very good and deadly meta while survivors are struggling on which strategy they should go. \n\nTunnelling/Camping:\nFact is, if the killer wants you to die, he will make you die. No matter if you are on a SWF or not, the chases have become way too short. Apart from a few loop spots, looping has become too hard.\n\nGame Health:\nRubberbanding still exists in the game, such as the game health stability in general. Even on high performance computers you get frame drops. The netcode is shit, you can get hit through a pallet or get teleported from one side to the other, jump through a window and get pulled back. It already happend twice this year that they killswitched a killer because of a bug they couldn't fix fast enough. Sometimes it takes weeks until a bug get's acknowledged and months until a fix appears out of nowhere. Make yourself an own opinion and check the DBD forums or YouTube.\n\nHacking: \nCheaters are everywhere, no automated detection. You will either have to fill a manual report with evidence or give 0 attention. There would be so many ways to detect cheaters (instant 100% gens, escaping with 5 gens left and 3 other survivors still alive, unlimited item usage, flashligh scripts...). \n\nRank System:\nI don't know how they came to the idea to reset the rank on every 13th each month, earning pips became so hard and when you achieve rank 1 your \"bonus\" will be 1.000.000 BPS. Wow, when there's an event you can get more than 200.000 each match. I earn BPS just to spend them again. No other rewards. The grind is still too high and the prestige level says nothing about your skill or your perks, it's yet another worthless attempt to \"bind\" the people to the game and their favorite characters.  \n\nThe fact that BHVR’s devs invest more effort in creating skins and implementing bugs instead of fixing the game health or the balance says everything. They try to milk this game like a cow and somehow the strategy works.\n\nInstead of switching from 50/50% to 100% killer and celebrating 3-4K every match, I try to stay away of this game as long as possible. Hopefully one day they will realize that they broke the game.","timestamp_created":1639239614,"timestamp_updated":1659285030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105648301","author":{"steamid":"76561199031461691","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1655810545},"language":"schinese","review":"服了，每次更新完要不游戏内出一堆bug，要不就玩着玩着断网，真是bug杀机","timestamp_created":1639239489,"timestamp_updated":1639239489,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105648186","author":{"steamid":"76561198871999252","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1969,"last_played":1657737522},"language":"russian","review":"qwe","timestamp_created":1639239377,"timestamp_updated":1639239377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105648103","author":{"steamid":"76561198406525117","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":25410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2001,"playtime_at_review":10928,"last_played":1660592997},"language":"russian","review":"Помню 90-е когда в фильмах маньяков боялись.

honestly don't know where to start with this. My experience with this game and its development has been a roller coaster, and not a fun one.\n\nDespite the constantly clear fact that BHVR overall seemingly don't care for what the majority of the community want or for the overall health of the game or just overall seem to be trying to put the bare minimum amount of effort in to the game to keep people interested, I for whatever reason still held out hope that maybe they were trying, maybe they did care.\n\nThis was likely due to the fact that, once in a blue moon, BHVR will release an update of some kind that actually suggests that they're listening to the community and shows that maybe they do care and are able to take the steps needed to improve the health of the game. Unfortunately, this was likely just a move to cushion the blow of the next update that would be the new \"worst thing they've ever done\" (although I wouldn't be surprised if it's pure coincidence that these good changes preceded the bad as I have yet to see proof that BHVR know what they're doing, but more on that later).\n\nRemoving a lot of the minor events to put more focus on the larger ones like Anniversaries, Christmas, etc.? Nice, events that are more than just one-off interaction gimmicks would be cool. This was followed by the 5th Anniversary event that was a copy-paste reskin of the 4th, with possibly less to it if I remember correctly. Also, in a cross-over Halloween event with For Honor, while the For Honor devs added a whole new gamemode, an array of cosmetics and generally created an amazing event, all BHVR did for Dead by Daylight was make one... ...single... ...charm.\n\nReworking a lot of the maps to remove infinites, improve visuals and generally make the maps nice to play on? That was cool but now we've got this cool new breakable wall mechanic that no-one asked for and we're gonna fill the maps with these, effectively replacing the infinites but now the Killer can spend some of their valuable time to break the walls to remove the infinites while the Survivor they were chasing runs away with no cost to them. Unless, of course, it's one of those breakable walls where the killer has absolutely no incentive to break it so you just have to wonder what the point of it is in the first place.\n\nWith a game like Dead by Daylight, this happens quite a lot so I can't quite recall all of the relevant examples and of course I'm more likely to remember the bad than the good, but just know that for every good thing that happened for this game (e.g. nerfing Moris, keys, hatch, fixing problematic perks, killers or items, etc.), it was most likely followed by something like the following:\n\n- Remaking the User Interface (despite no-one asking for it and no-one having any problems with it) and replacing it with a far worse one with UI elements all over the screen instead of neatly arranged in the corner like they were before (and clearly made with so little effort that certain elements like buff / debuff icons weren't aligned correctly).\n\n- Introducing horribly designed maps that favour aesthetics over gameplay and aren't fun for either side to play on.\n\n- Constantly releasing killers whose powers are simply shutting down a loop with little to no planning or strategy required, thus making the actually interesting and thoughtful part of chases the in-optimal play.\n\n- Reworking the way that auras look (again, no-one had a problem with them) and making them so hard to see that some auras were basically invisible until you got them against a certain background or got close enough. This was thankfully fixed after enough complaining.\n\nBut the bad doesn't always need the good to precede it, sometimes the bad is just there in all its glory:\n\n- Colour blind accessibility took years to implement as the Devs excused themselves from doing it saying that it could give players an \"unfair advantage\".\n\n- Releasing Chapters and updates that are completely and utterly broken in terms of balance and bugs (with some bugs being so blatantly apparent that you have to wonder if they actually test anything or what the point of the PTB is since people are reporting these issues in balance or quality) because their game's code is filled with so much spaghetti that they'd be giving your local Italian restaurant a run for their money. Seriously, do some research into the release of the Twins chapter (A Binding of Kin) and you'll see what I mean.\n\n- Only releasing updates on a fixed schedule even if things are clearly in dire need of being changed.\n\n- Openly and willingly collaborating in the creation of NFTs but also not notifying people of this until a week or so after the involved chapter was available for purchase (See: Hellraiser Chapter).\n\nMost recently, and the thing that has enraged me so much to write this review, the Winter \"Bone Chill\" event has released. This event adds a bunch of snowmen to the map the Survivors can hide in, similar to lockers, and shuffle slowly around the map. This seems fun at first, but then you look at the Killer interactions where their only choice is to attack the snowmen to try and catch any survivors hiding within. If they catch a survivor, they have to go through the longer successful attack cooldown while the survivor can simply run away scot-free without losing any health states from this attack, meaning that the snowmen effectively act like an extra health state and completely counter some killer's powers. \n\nFor example, Ghostface's power involves being able to enter a Shroud state where they can sneak up on survivors and stalk them to build up a meter to the point they are marked, at which point they can be one-shot for a limited time. Survivors can break them out of this state by looking at him for long enough (although this mechanic is broken enough as is). However, now survivors can hide in a snowman and make themselves unstalkable (and they can possibly still break you out of your shroud although I can't find confirmation of this). Attempting to hit a survivor out of a snowman will remove all your stalk progress on them (this is standard for Ghostface but without the protection of the snowman this would be a trade for taking a health state from them) but if they're marked and hit out of a snowman, it will remove the marked status from them and they won't lose anything (this is not standard as usually when a survivor is marked, the only way to remove it is for the duration to fully expire or for the survivor to be downed).\n\nAs I said, I have yet to be convinced that BHVR actually know what they're doing with this game as their approach to updates feels like they're throwing darts at a dartboard of ideas and the only reason why this ship hasn't sunk yet is through sheer luck and, more importantly, a lack of competition. As far as I know, Dead by Daylight was the first of its kind in this genre (or at least the first to be well made enough to survive long enough to get a strong enough player base and a licensed chapter in the Halloween chapter) and so far any other game that's tried to compete in this genre has crashed and burned (including BHVR's own attempt to make what was basically \"Dead by Daylight but with guns\", which was a massive failure and eventually a scam as BHVR shutdown the servers not long after release and offered no real compensation to anyone who had given them their money (See: Deathgarden)). \n\nThere's so much for me to detail and explain with Dead by Daylight that it's like trying to explain an internet meme with years of internet culture history behind it to someone whose never used the internet but instead of humour and joy at the end, you're simply left with disappointment and frustration.\n\nI am truly ashamed that this was the first game I reached 1k hours on, even if a large chunk of that time was likely AFK or spent waiting for matches.","timestamp_created":1639236556,"timestamp_updated":1639236556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530677378177642822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105645039","author":{"steamid":"76561198107379750","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10603,"last_played":1655823205},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌어요 한국게임은 이런 고어 종류 게임이없죠","timestamp_created":1639236226,"timestamp_updated":1639236226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105644801","author":{"steamid":"76561199057430457","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1659813789},"language":"english","review":"Hi everyone,\n\n I started playing this game in 2019 on PS4.

There are a lot of good players.\nThe game have a lot of dlcs some better than others but all cool at their way, depends on taste too.\nWell I hope this game update more and more every time because we want to see more from this game.\nIt´s really worth it.
