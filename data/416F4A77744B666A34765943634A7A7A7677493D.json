But 5-6 hours of playing and Im already getting matched with red rank SWF teams. If there could be and easier alternative for perk unlocking at this point of the game where there are so many characters, for example, a perk pool where the perks progress is shared with all survivors/ killers after you unlock it with its original character it would probably make this game feel like less of a grind for new players and would let us focus more on mixing and matching perks/ add-ons/ offerings/ killers. Also I believe implementing some kind of point system when mixing and matching perks would add to the strategy, like for example being able to use a total of 8 rarity pips when selecting perks would force people to for example, either max 2 perks, have a 2 pip perk and leave 1 perk slot empty or use 2 maxed out 3 pip perk and and have the other 2 perks be 1 pip, etc. This will give the 1 and 2 rarity perks actual purpose instead of them just being a 1 time stepping stone till you get the perk to  3 pip and never use them again.","timestamp_created":1609653288,"timestamp_updated":1616707761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83879285","author":{"steamid":"76561199046664401","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":65587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":780,"playtime_at_review":15291,"last_played":1660579898},"language":"schinese","review":"来嘛，一起被举高高嘛","timestamp_created":1609653016,"timestamp_updated":1609653016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540572822093963623","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83879086","author":{"steamid":"76561199030633345","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1609652275},"language":"koreana","review":"네가생각한게임이아니네요","timestamp_created":1609652781,"timestamp_updated":1609652781,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83879030","author":{"steamid":"76561198803566769","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1609657258},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩亚","timestamp_created":1609652693,"timestamp_updated":1609652693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83878641","author":{"steamid":"76561198419671231","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":5013,"last_played":1660270444},"language":"schinese","review":"真不戳","timestamp_created":1609652251,"timestamp_updated":1609652251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83878608","author":{"steamid":"76561199074799257","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2131,"last_played":1615175286},"language":"russian","review":"очень

Its solid gameplay and unique style make it very fun. On the opposing side, the game can be unbearable for a variety of reasons. The game is often too team reliant, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it can be difficult because if you get into a lobby with sub-optimal team placements, the game can be over before it even began. Another reason why the game can be terrible is because many of the killers are either easy to play against or are incredibly overwhelming. On the gameplay side of things, toxicity is a common trait many killers have in common. Either the perk combination the killer is running is annoying to play against or the killer will simply camp you when you're hooked so your teammates can't rescue you.","timestamp_created":1609649632,"timestamp_updated":1609649632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83876254","author":{"steamid":"76561198448477317","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":9399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8778,"last_played":1650434081},"language":"english","review":"this game I left for a year, came back and now im fighting the urge not to grind it again","timestamp_created":1609649574,"timestamp_updated":1609649574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83876104","author":{"steamid":"76561199083040292","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1837,"last_played":1655258478},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo bom, foda-se.","timestamp_created":1609649430,"timestamp_updated":1609649430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83876089","author":{"steamid":"76561198866677216","num_games_owned":434,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":185275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1838,"playtime_at_review":137829,"last_played":1660604041},"language":"english","review":"Woah","timestamp_created":1609649416,"timestamp_updated":1609649416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83875948","author":{"steamid":"76561199008578968","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1658605897},"language":"english","review":"fun as fuck. \n\nPs Fuck trapper campers","timestamp_created":1609649238,"timestamp_updated":1609649238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83875836","author":{"steamid":"76561198354960191","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1227,"last_played":1625533421},"language":"english","review":"bob\n","timestamp_created":1609649117,"timestamp_updated":1609649117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83875502","author":{"steamid":"76561198255577452","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12430,"last_played":1653016859},"language":"spanish","review":"De las 100 horas que llevo de juego me parece un juego bastante entretenido, me gusta la sensación de miedo que crea entre jugadores, pero también se ve el nivel de toxicidad entre la comunidad al fallar o no hacer lo que ellos esperan que uno haga.

una mierda de juego sobrevalorado, estupidisimo en todos los sentidos, las persecuciones como killer son aburridisimas, es basicamente un boludeo  de los survivors hacia el imponente killer (si me dijeran que esto solo pasa en elo bajo ok es entendible, pero en el ambiente competitivo tambien pasa y es una de las tecnicas mas confiables para evitar al killer, los graficos son una verga, no soy exigente yo pero es que se ve muy mal, no da gusto ver que pyramid head se ve peor que en sh 2, aunque lo peor siempre va a ser la mecanica de golpear, parece que a los incompetentes de los devs se les acabaron las ideas y no sabian como counterear al killer asi que dijeron: mmm no se ponele una animacion sin sentido que realentice al killer (y ya de paso el gameplay) en la cual limpia el arma o se pone a hacer jueguitos como en el cs go SOY UN PUTO ASESINO EN SERIE EN MEDIO DE LA NADA BUSCANDO GENTE A LA QUE MATAR QUE ALGUIEN ME EXPLIQUE EN NOMBRE DE DIOS QUE ME IMPULSA A HACER TAL

At the time, the game was poorly optimised. Despite having a rig that well exceeded the recommended specs, I would frequently encounter painful slowdowns in performance at random intervals, This often resulted in me losing games, as it would cause me to frequently miss important skill checks, thus giving away my position to the Killer. This was due to the game running poorly for no explicable reason, rather than the intended human error. \n\nThankfully in the time since, there has been some improvement in this regard! Having said that, I would still strongly suggest that newcomers look up a guide on YouTube on how to improve game performance if you encounter random slow downs. It really does make a difference when the game is playable. (It sucks when you wind up throwing a game because your frame rate decides to drop from 60FPS-10 for no reason).\n\nWhen you get together with a group of Friends, DBD can be a lot of fun! Coordinating together, getting generators done and pulling off rescues etc can be really rewarding! (Making the Killer's day miserable is often amusing) \n\nThat said, this game does have a steep difficult learning curve. The game doesnt do a great job at teaching you the various game mechanics. Each survivor/killer has their own unique perks which aren't particulary explained very well, nor are they clearly displayed during gameplay. (Most of the time) \n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of unspoken rules on how to play well and how to get yourself killed very quickly. On the one hand, this allows you to experiment and setup builds that best support your play style. The caveat is that you are thrust headlong into a situation where trial and error (Mostly error) is your best teacher for figuring out how to survive Killer encounters and how to effectively support your team. \n\nRealistically upon starting out, you are going to die a lot and its naturally quite frustrating. Slowly but steadily however, you do improve. You figure out for yourself what works well and what doesn't, allowing you to form up a degree of strategy on how to handle different situations.\n\nOverall, playing Dead by Daylight is a frustrating experience, but if you can grab some Friends to play with you and get to grips on how to play well, you'll find it can be quite a laugh, even if you don't survive the round.","timestamp_created":1609638143,"timestamp_updated":1626100933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83865550","author":{"steamid":"76561199060273780","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":20187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4337,"last_played":1655691284},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é ótimo, muito divertido ainda mais se jogado com os amigos.

Also the map-designing often is in favor for the survivors, because every 2 meters theres a thing called \"pallet\" which are used to stun the killer, so yeah pretty unfair, survivor sided maps that make this whole game much more unplayable for killers.\n\nOh and if youre asking why it always depends on your enemys if the game´s gonna be fun or not, its because the Dead by Daylight community sucks a** on so much different levels, I wont be able to describe it in a 12 page long essay.\n\n\nSo yeah this is just my opinion, there are still people who love this game and pls dont comment down that im a killer main who doesnt know this game. I reached rank 1 with both sides (killer and survivor) and this is my own experience i have so if youre planning to buy this game maybe just read some more of these or watch some youtube videos about the current balance/map issues and decide for yourself, because im not trying to tank this game, im just trying to give people a little overview of the game.\n\nThank you for reading this and hopefully you have a better day than me :)\n(This is only valid for the current dbd version, if it changes, i´ll edit it here if it turned worse/better)\n\nUPDATE: 13th of June 2021\n\nA lot of overpowered/strong/meta perks got their deserved nerfs, some good balance changes. Some very important bugs got fixed and good content went trough. Now im officially changing my mind and recommend the game at the current state. There is still very much to do like killer balancing, and a few other perks that maybe need a nerf/buff or even rework, because they just suck, but other than that its now an acceptable game at the current state.\nEnjoy and i hope you have a better day than me :)\n\nUPDATE:4th of July 2021\n\nTrickster got his buff recently which is quite nice but they gave him an op add-on combo which can make him broken in specific situations. They are gonna patch it soon probably so no worries. Current version is still good to play, Enjoy and i hope you have a better day than me :)\n\nUPDATE:4th of January 2022\n\nA little late but the new MMR which exists for a quite a while now made the game unplayable for killers because you only get hardcore sweating teams as a casual while on the survivor side you get the biggest killer noobs who probably got 4 hours in the game. Again current version is not playable so i dont recommend playing it until new mmr is out.\nEnjoy and i hope you have a better day than me
