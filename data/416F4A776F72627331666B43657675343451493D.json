a llegado el dia donde hago una reseña de este juego, antes de comenzar quiero advertir que no hago esta resaña al pedo, comenze a jugar este juego en consola a partir de 2017 y me cambie a pc alrededor de 2020 ( asi que se podria decir que llevo 4 o 5 años jugando este juego ) e llegado a rango 1 tanto como killer y superviviente y sumando las horas que llevo en ambas plataformas puedo decir que tengo mas de mil horas en este juego, una vez recalcado eso para que no piensen que soy un baby killer o un baby survivor quejandose por ser malo voy a comenzar con mi reseña, despues de estar jugando alrededor de un año a este juego en pc a llegado el dia donde no puedo mas y e decido desinstalar este juego pero explicare por partes porque considero que este juego es un desastre actualmente y me llevo a desinstalarlo\n\n1- Las hitboxes\n\nsi hay algo que me caga de este juego son las pesimas hitboxes, jugando como survivor vas a notar un monton de veces como algunos asesinos te pueden golpear desde mil metros como si nada, pueden golpear el aire y hay veces donde te dara a ti, o incluso hay veces donde te pueden golpear a traves de los pales como si nada ( donde mas se notan las pesimas hitboxes es cuando saltas una ventana con un salto medio ya que los killers pueden golpearte incluso cuando ya saltaste la ventana y ya te alejaste de ella ). antes de que alguien venga diciendo \" es que tus ms son muy altos y por eso te golpean desde muy lejos\" eso es mentira, poseo una conexion a internet con fibra optica y suelo ir a 80 ms estables, pero bueno no creo tener que aclarar este punto ya que toda persona que alguna vez haya jugado dbd sabe lo pesima que son las hitboxes, y lo peor de todo es que la comunidad lleva años quejandose de este problema y los devs (de los cuales hablare despues) simplemente se limitan a decir \"esto no es un juego shooter asi que no necesita hitboxes mejores, las actuales funcionan perfectamente\" asi ni ganas.\n\n\n2-El desiquilibrio del juego\n\neste juego esta pesimamente equilibrado, hay killers que estan simplemente rotos y no puedes hacer nada contra ellos, un ejemplo de killer roto es el espiritu, killer el cual da igual que tan bueno eres tu jugando depende mas que nada que ella la cague, ya que su poder esta tan op que si saber jugar, no podras hacerle ningun counter, y si estas pensando \"pero es que a los espiritus tienes que hacerles juegos mentales\" bueno amigo, intenta hacerle un juego mental a un espiritu que tenga la habilidad de estridor y me cuentas como te va, un espiritu con estridor es casi imposible de parar, hay mas ejemplos de killers rotos pero la cosa no esta fea del lado de los killers, del lado de los survivors esta similar, habilidades rotas que no saben que hacer con ellas, ( como el golpe decisivo el cual lo cambian cada cierto tiempo por que son incapaces de balancearlo ), habilidades como golpe de suerte la cual han bufado hace poco y esta horriblemente rota, y muchas mas habilidades, en conclusion: el equilibrio de este juego es simplemente basura\n\n\n3- La comunidad\n\nno importa como juegues, como asesino o como superviviente, los 2 bandos son sumamente toxicos.\nsi juegas como killer es probable que te toque con una premade ( osea un grupo de amigos jugando juntos ) los cuales te van a fastidiar toda las partidas con su linternita, te haran un genrush ( osea que te reparan todos los motores en menos de 3 minutos ) y se burlaran de ti toda la partida para que al final de esta te pongan en el chat \"ez\" y te digan de todo, o puede que simplemente te toque algun survivor que haga todo lo mencionado arriba el solo, creeme que probablemente te toparas con este tipo de gente al menos en 6 o 7 de cada 10 partidas. pero como superviviente la cosa tampoco es muy bonita, si juegas como superviviente es casi seguro que en una de cada tres partidas te encontraras con un killer campero y tunelero el cual simplemente te arruinara toda la diversion y ahora vendra alguien diciendo \"pero si el killer esta campeando o tuneleando los demas deben reparar en ese tiempo\" y yo te respondo con una pregunta ¿que de divertido tiene eso? es sumamente frustante para el jugador al cual campean y tunelean ya que perdera rango de manera muy injusta, y para los demas los cuales simplemente se dedicaran a reparar y no ganaran de puntos\n¿sera eso divertido para ellos? obviamente no, en conclusion: la comunidad de este juego tanto como killer o como survivor es sumamente toxica y arruina la diversion\n\n\n4- los nefastos desarrolladores que tiene este juego\n\neste juego simplemente los cuales simplemente son nefastos, los cuales simplementes hacen un trabajo HORRIBLE, para demostrar esto dare un par de ejemplos de su trabajo nefasto\n\n-bug de las hitboxes\nen febrero de este año aproximadamente hubo un bug el cual hacia las hitboxes aun peor de lo que ya son, el killer podia pegarte a una distancia simplemente absurda, uno pensaria que al ver esto los desarrolladores resolverian este problema de manera rapida ya que hacia el juego injugable para los supervivientes no? pues no, tardaron DOS SEMANAS, DOS SEMANAS EN QUE EL JUEGO ERA INFUMABLE PARA LOS SURVIVORS y por si fuera poco, que hicieron en estas 2 semanas? LANZAR SKINS EN LA TIENDA QUE VALIAN UNA MILLONADA DE PLATA, supongo que importa mas sacarle la plata a tus consumidores que mantenerlos contentos con el producto por el cual pagaron no? que descaro mas grande \n\n-bug de los pales\nhace un mes y medio ( desde finales de marzo o principios de abril ) habia un bug el cual rompio una de las mecanicas del juego: los stuns, osea la posibilidad de aturdir al asesino con los pales, literalmente era casi imposible aturdir a un asesino con un pale y por si fuera poco habia veces en donde el killer podia golpearte atraves de los pales como si nada, cuanto tardaron los devs en arreglarlo? un mes y medio ( o casi 2 meses )\ny ni si quiera lo arreglaron bien, a dia de hoy hay veces donde puedes aturdir a los asesinos desde el otro lado del pto mapa y hay veces donde los pales no le afectan al asesino, osea que los pales actualmente funcionan muy bien o muy mal.\n\n-bug de los rangos\nel dia 13 de este mes (mayo) hubo un bug el cual hizo que el reinicio de rangos fallara completamente, tu podias ser un rango 1 y quizas te bajaron a rango 15, los devs arreglaron esto a dia de hoy? (27 de mayo dia que escribo esta reseña) pues no, es mas, tal parece se hicieron los tontos y no lo van a arreglar, pero que buenos desarrolladores....\n\n\n-pesimo director el cual dice y hace tonterias\nel director del juego (Mathieu Côté) osea la persona que da la cara a la hora de hablar del juego simplemente hace y dice tonterias, basicamente hubo una vez la cual comenzo a leer las quejas de los jugadores, cosas como hitboxes, bugs, camperos, etc, que respondio este? \"pues si no te gusta el juego por que mejor no vas a jugar otra cosa\" y yo me pregunto, como un director púede ser tan cara dura para decirle a un consumidor que pago por un producto y se esta quejando sobre los fallos con el fin de mejorar el producto este sea capaz de decirle que se vaya a jugar otra cosa? es que no se puede. hubo otra ocasion donde este señor jugo una partida como asesino y lo reventaron, basicamente le toco un grupo de jugadores que lo humillaron y escaparon sin problema de el. uno de estos survivors ( el cual le dio vueltas casi toda la partida ) llevaba una linterna, asi que cuando perdio la partida debido a esto que se le ocurrio? ¡Pues nerfear las linternas! que hombre mas inteligente señores\n\nsinceramente, si me dedicase a enlistar la cantidad de tonterias que han hecho y dicho los devs no terminaria nunca. asi que En conclusion:\n\npara mi este juego es un desastre y no vale la pena pagar tanto por el, quizas sea un buen juego para jugar de chill unas 2 partidas con tus amigos pero si lo vas a comprar, te recomiendo enormemente que te esperes a que baje de precio, por que pagar tanto por esto, no vale la pena.\n\n","timestamp_created":1622099981,"timestamp_updated":1622099981,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501107335090637207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92661032","author":{"steamid":"76561198940761538","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2678,"last_played":1642353471},"language":"english","review":"РЕЗНЯ)\n","timestamp_created":1622099882,"timestamp_updated":1622099882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92660967","author":{"steamid":"76561198148405932","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":232,"playtime_at_review":10531,"last_played":1660101813},"language":"english","review":"I love this game!","timestamp_created":1622099716,"timestamp_updated":1622099716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92660332","author":{"steamid":"76561198320037460","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":21054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9526,"last_played":1658885184},"language":"english","review":"dope","timestamp_created":1622098315,"timestamp_updated":1622098315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92660247","author":{"steamid":"76561199148379751","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":29332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13208,"last_played":1657976786},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра особо круто играть в месте с друзьями","timestamp_created":1622098129,"timestamp_updated":1622098129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92660242","author":{"steamid":"76561198073574084","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":44585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43706,"last_played":1636771968},"language":"english","review":"Community can sometimes get a little toxic, but as long as you just play for fun and ignore peeps its a fun game.

After previously play this on console 2 years ago and re-playing it again (started 3 months ago) \nWorth it.\nThis game feels and it is incredibly different from  many other survival games I've played.\n\nSo to make this easy and round up everything to a short review; pros and cons\n\nPros:\n-AMAZING game to play with friends\n-Different builds to chose from\n-COSMETICS (I'm a fan of cosmetics. And when it comes to making good damn cosmetics DBD really hits the mark)\n-Great Pass (I hate when \"Game Passes\" in other games make you buy the thing every season. With DBD, you can buy it once. And if you complete the whole thing {Just like CoD: Warzone} In the end you'll have all the in-game credits to get the next one for the next season.\n-In-deph strats\n-Even after hours and hours hundreds upon hundreds matches. Every match feels different and fresh. Something cool can happen.\n-Many other things I prolly forget\n\nCons:\n-Slow match making queues during 8-9PM+ EST (at 11PM EST times between matches are usually 3-4mins)\n-Freddie (killer), NOED (perk), & Toxic Bubba users\n-Talking about Toxic (people here are insanely toxic. Not most games. But when toxic people will tunnel, camp you and basically make your life a living hell)\n-Very grind-ish game if you want the \"perfect build\" that suits your needs\n-Matchmaking is a bit wonky.\n-Latency (if you're like me, with high latency in every game because of location.

It's a very unique and interesting idea. A 4v1 horror-esque game where you have different killers with different perks, and you can make cool builds with a vast majority of the perks. However a lot of these killers and survivors are locked between a paywall, if you've played R6 then it's similar to that kind of monetization system. A bit annoying, but all the stuff goes on sale pretty often and they don't release characters super often so you can gradually get them. 7/10 on that front.\n\nThe game can have a good chunk of bugs at times, and those bugs can range from small visual annoyances or literally can't use a core mechanic. It's inconsistent and annoying, and sometimes they will be a while before it's patched out. This is one of my biggest gripes with this game, as it the random drastically of each bug for every patch or content update is..upsetting to say the least. 4/10.\n\nWith every content update they will traditionally have one new survivor and one new killer, occasionally they will have a new map. They used to have consistent new maps but as of writing this they are just reworking the old ones again and haven't released a new map. But back to the main point, the quality of these content updates can range from \"Oh that's pretty good\" to playing as a dumpster fire. A recent example of this would be The Trickster, a knife throwing ranged killer that is one of, if not the most, worst things to play as. Even when he was in the PTB he was weak, people complained, they didn't listen, and shipped him. It was a terrible experience playing him. They buffed him in time, not by much but they did. Not every killer, survivor, or perk is going to be perfect, and I understand that. But I'd at least want something that feels good to play, as that's what I'd really care about. 6/10\n\nThe community is..not the worst? It's fine. There are some cool people and there are some not-so-cool people. If you play in a certain way or did a certain thing you have a 50/50 chance to get yelled at in the endgame chat. Other than that it's whatever. \n\nThe actual game requires a lot of time to learn and really get into. I'd honestly compare it to a fighting game with how much time it takes to really learn. Every mindgame, every loop, what to do in hyper specific situations where you need to down a guy to get pressure, or save a guy from getting downed to not lose the game. Every power, every add on, when you can't use your eyes so now you gotta hear them rustling in some grass. There's a lot of mechanical meat in this game and it feels really satisfying to pull off cool stuff, and it feels really great to juke out good killers. It's a treat to learn, and nothing is handed to you. Some stuff is simpler than others, but it still feels really great to rev up a chainsaw early because they have Sprint Burst, and to barely be able to catch them and get the down. This is a game that will make you feel great for working with your team and playing well. And this is the reason why I keep coming to play more.\n\nTL:DR It's fun, hard to get into but it's fun. 7.8/10.","timestamp_created":1622089996,"timestamp_updated":1622089996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92656608","author":{"steamid":"76561198273964554","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37055,"last_played":1659069012},"language":"english","review":"fun be getting my heart racing ngl","timestamp_created":1622089753,"timestamp_updated":1622089753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92656462","author":{"steamid":"76561198221159004","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1627766069},"language":"polish","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1622089491,"timestamp_updated":1622089491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92656312","author":{"steamid":"76561198406048759","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":48195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":997,"playtime_at_review":17836,"last_played":1660531923},"language":"english","review":"Dead by daylight is by far one of my most favorite games. It has its downs like any other games (the occasional bugs/glitches/toxic players). However, it has its ups too! It's a fun game to play either by yourself (as a killer or survivor) or to play with your friends. There's many different builds you can have for any survivor or killer so it gives players an opportunity to explore what play style and perks (in-game skills) work best for them. I also love that the game is slowly adding in more well-known characters from different action/horror franchises to keep things feeling fresh. I will say that I do wish that there was more variety in the different maps we play on or more customization/outfits for characters, some things feel very recycled.

is enjoyable, but the way the game is monetized is quite disgusting. I have no problem with giving the developers money, but we pay money for the game itself, DLC characters, cosmetics, and battle passes (\"Rift Pass\"). The worst I feel is the characters - putting content that directly affects gameplay behind a paywall is obnoxious. This would be DLC survivors and killers' unique abilities. \n\n(they can be obtained by normal gameplay, but they are time-limited and grindy to do so). Why not just allow us to buy the game and sell us things that dont affect gameplay like cosmetics?...","timestamp_created":1622085159,"timestamp_updated":1622085159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92654405","author":{"steamid":"76561199154616866","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1658813368},"language":"spanish","review":"ta
