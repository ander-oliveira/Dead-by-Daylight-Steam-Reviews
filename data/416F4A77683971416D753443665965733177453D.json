The company still refuses to care about it's player base and control the toxicity. You would have so many more players if you learned how to do this. Behaviour Interactive....just a disappointing company. It's not hard to create a proper reporting/text blocking feature that works.\n\nUpdate: Player base is getting more toxic - I'd like to see more control over at the very least language allowed to be entered into chats. One guy was harassing the killer after his entire team won using every offensive word he could think of. I will not be playing DBD again any time soon after watching this. I have no interest in being part of that type of community.\n\nTo review this is really hard cuz it CAN be really fun. It's definitely made for killers so when you play survivor 80% of the time it really won't be any fun, even being on a team of energetic fun people can only do so much. Playing killer can also be frustrating due to the server problems(after they activated dedicated servers) it can take 20 minutes sometimes longer to find a match cuz I assume everyone is trying to play killer so there aren't enough survivors to go around? It would be nice to see the obviously overpowered killers get a nerf. Either the sound is not implemented well or legit need to make some killers more noticeable. I've watched lots of people, i've played with lots of people, I haven't had it for really long at all but i'm already feeling the depression of boredom set in.
