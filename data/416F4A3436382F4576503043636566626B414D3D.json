А когда играешь за маньяка то тут русская рулетка с тремя патронами, могут попасться очень лёгкие и посадишь их на крюки когда заведено не одного генератора, а могут попасться такие задроты которые будут водить тебя по всей карте пока остальные заводят генераторы со скоростью света, а если удастся положить бегуна, то все сразу прибегут и снимут его не оставляя тебе и шанса на то что бы опять повесить его ведь его снял человек с «одолженным временем» и на него наложена неуязвимость. Циферки справа вверху экрана называются рангом выжившего/убийцы и если вы считаете, что они нужны что бы подбирать вам противников такого же уровня скила то вы глубоко ошибаетесь. Единственное на что они влияют так это на получение достижений. Вам могут попасться на 16-ом ранге как 20-ые, так и 1-ые ранги. А те, кто получил 1-ый ранг имеют реальный скил и много времени. Если увидите 1-ранг в конце матча то не расстраиваетесь ведь у вас не было и шанса.","timestamp_created":1638443127,"timestamp_updated":1638443127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105063785","author":{"steamid":"76561198796496975","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1649949154},"language":"russian","review":"17\n","timestamp_created":1638443071,"timestamp_updated":1638443071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105063702","author":{"steamid":"76561198067757060","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":66988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55054,"last_played":1657456716},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая","timestamp_created":1638442943,"timestamp_updated":1638442943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105063685","author":{"steamid":"76561198244885316","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1658512633},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра советую всем","timestamp_created":1638442914,"timestamp_updated":1638442914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105063435","author":{"steamid":"76561199223335359","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1834,"last_played":1651021449},"language":"spanish","review":"No logro entender cómo en un juego de \"terror\" las víctimas tengan tanto poder hasta el punto de que humillen al asesino.

this game is actually very adictive and interesting, specially when you first start to play; it has positive and (in my opinion) more negative points as time goes by and you go on higher ranks. Let me explain:\n\nYou can be one of 4 survivors that tries to escape from a killer (fixing 5 generators to open the gates and be one of the winner survivors), or be the killer to chase 4 survivors and hook them 3 times each to sacrifice them before they open the gates.\nBoth sides have \"perks\" you can unlock and combine (abilities) and items with add-ons.\n\nI have played both sides, survivor solo and with friends, and solo killer (only way to play killer) and I have seen the same problem from both perspectives: the game it's not balanced at all for the killer.\nNow, don't get me wrong, it's not impossible to win as a killer (especially on lower ranks) and you can give good fight on higher ranks, but there are a lot of factors AGAINST the killer:\n\n1. The SWF issue (\"survive with friends\" is when, as a survivor, you make a group with other friends and, most of the time, voice chat on discord or other apps outside the game).\nAs a survivor that plays with friends, we like to chat and laugh on discord as we play, it makes the game way funnier, but lets be honest, 7 of 10 games we totally destroy the killer. As a team of SWF, we don't need some perks that can help to know where the killer is, because we voice-chat \"hey is going that way\", \"it's on the other side don't worry\", \"hide there or there\", etc. And this let the survivor team to use other perks. Resulting a really strong team against the killer.\n\n2. The \"gen rush\" issue: this is when the survivors mains as unique objective to fix generators as fast as they can. This issue was actually on devs sight and \"fixed it\" making it slower to survivors to fix, because at the first 3-4 minutes there were like 3 generators already fixed making it really frustrating to the killer. Now, the thing is, this is not fixed at all.\nAs survivor playing with friends, we tend to have 2 gens ready at the start of the game really fast and we laugh saying \"haha! nice!\", but yes, the killer at that point rage-quit or start to \"camp\" the only survivor he/she can get because it knows, it will not get more than that. \nAs a killer, once you reach higher ranks it's REALLY frustrating. As killer you learn that if you chase just one survivor you will loose time, but then, the cycles starts:\na) you find a survivor at the beginning of the game.\nb) you chase him/her.\nc) it starts looping (running in circles on obstacles like windows or pallets), and while it's not impossible to reach it, you waste a lot of time because the killer is faster, but it takes a while to get him/her. THEN you change the plan, \"hey, it's starting to loop and I need to hit it 2 times, ok I will not fall for this\" and then go to watch the others gens. \nd) because you go and it's a swf team, the survivor communicate the team \"it stopped chasing me, it went that direction\" and then all the team coordinates.\ne) the killer pass by and find another survivor, if it has luck it hits the survivor two times to take it down.\nf) the time you took doing all mentioned above, the survivor team have already 2 gen ready and a third almost done.\ng) you look for other survivors, find one, chase it and the one you hooked got free and you can return or keep chasing the other, either way the remaining survivors will finish the other gens and as a killer you got 1 sacrificed or maybe 2 if you are lucky. OR you don't get anyone (that happens a lot). Because remember: you need to hit them 2 times and every time you hit them, they get a speed boost to start looping or to escape as the others do their objetives, and each one needs to be hoocked 3 times. A lot of work that requires time that the killer NEVER have.\nh) the doors are open, the survivors not injured know that they can be hit no prob once and escape with the speed boost.\n\nAs a survivor, you learn that if the killer finds you, your objective it's not to escape because it is almost impossible, but you BUY TIME: looping on windows, running in circles on obstacles, etc. The killer gets you but don't worry, you need to be hooked 3 times to loose and you already bought enough time so the team fix 2-3 gens. You get hoocked but the other teammates will rescue you.\n(see how unfair looks a well coordinate team against the killer?). And yes, the killer have some perks to use that are really powerful, but there's one thing: hex totems.\n\nTotems are hidden things that survivors can destroy to get points or, if the killer choose a \"hex-perk\" (very powerful abilities), one totem gets \"coloured\" and if gets destroyed, that ability dissapear to the killer. The killer have those mentioned hex-perks that \"balances\" the \"Im alone against 4 coordinated people\", but if one survivor finds the hex-totem, it's all over, the \"balance for the killer\" ends.\nPeople have said the game needs to balance more making the survivors a little slower, not because the killer can't reach them, but because of the time the killer needs to reach it to hit it two times as it is a lot in terms of how much advance of the game the other survivors can get in the meantime.\nOther things the people say is to have more gens to fix or more time to actually finish one gen, other is that the killer may choose from the menu to play against groups or against solo survivors.\n\nI really enjoy the game, and love to be survivor and killer, but really and being honest, if feels more sided to the survivors at higher ranks (which you can't avoid, you win games and go higher, and higher ranks are full of swf teams and play as killer is a pain, and if you play survivor with friends, it gets boring to destroy almost every killer you encounter, you play solo survivor and then it's frustating for you if the other teammates don't help you at all).\nHow can we call this game \"balanced\" when, once you learn to play as a survivor (especially on swf), you can buy time REALLY easy but the killer can give his/her best and never win the time it needs to actually hook all 4 survivors 3 times each? even having 2 sacrifices on high ranks feels almost impossible.\nThis makes the killer not wanting to go on higher ranks (there are a lot of forums speaking of this) and a lot of people play killer only when the ranks resets, and once they get higher, they stop playing killer.\nThat is not a balanced game to the killer, I say this as a survivor, and as a killer.\n\nPlease devs, try to change something here. I love this game but this issue is huge and the internet is full of this topic.","timestamp_created":1638419715,"timestamp_updated":1638419715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105049310","author":{"steamid":"76561198053771529","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3610,"last_played":1638419368},"language":"english","review":"This game is so trash.","timestamp_created":1638419385,"timestamp_updated":1638419385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105049286","author":{"steamid":"76561198275776357","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2463,"last_played":1641445623},"language":"english","review":"no","timestamp_created":1638419324,"timestamp_updated":1638419324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105049031","author":{"steamid":"76561198356987498","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1660267752},"language":"english","review":"Honestly really fun with and without friends.

And then spends the rest of the night absolutely destroying you in it, actively mocking and dunking on you, because they know how to play and you don't? That is an accurate summation of DBD -- Trying to learn and play a game, under sustained stress, that doesn't become \"fun\" until you are already good at it, while practically every opponent you face openly mocks you. \n\nThat isn't hyperbole either -- The process of learning the game is so unbelievably frustrating, that even if you managed to keep your cool, the other players are so saturated with anger and resentment, that when they encounter a player they can beat -- usually someone even newer, they will take every opportunity to finally give someone else what they've been getting.\n\nYour every minor mistake, or new player learning curve gets you punished in game, and then mocked by your opponents or even teammates at times, as the game is stuffed with as many sore winners, as sore losers, all so frustrated and desperate for a target to vent it on. The game itself makes people feel 'bullied', and then those people go off looking for opportunities to finally give it to someone else. That might be through exploits, taunting, throwing matches just to ruin one persons game, or by literally holding matches hostage, doing anything they can to waste your time, even after the match is over. \n\nAnd the community is like this, because of how unfun this game is to lose or even 'draw' (aka get a score the matchmaking considers average). A game going badly feels pointless, and your character unable to do anything about it -- even as the killer. They aren't short games either, often taking near on a half hour each.\n\nBut hey, once you learn the game, and get over the curve, it'll become fun, right? Wrong. The game uses a matchmaking system that ensured my favorite killers all eventually stopped getting fun matches. There is no 'casual' play. Every chase becomes a punishing grind. Every hit or down is not a victory, but a measure of how MUCH you lost. \n\nAt this point, if you aren't already into this game, don't bother starting, because the Devs are only interested in making the game more complicated, pandering to what passes for a competative scene, and churning out more content to sell.","timestamp_created":1638414713,"timestamp_updated":1644744735,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105045617","author":{"steamid":"76561199091196171","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":27690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1393,"playtime_at_review":5354,"last_played":1660558518},"language":"schinese","review":"非常好玩，如果国内能直播就好了","timestamp_created":1638413795,"timestamp_updated":1638413795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ468/EvP0CcefbkAM="}
