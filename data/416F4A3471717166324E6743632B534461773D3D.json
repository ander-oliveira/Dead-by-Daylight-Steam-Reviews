(Add this together, Instant escape + 5 second stun for the Killer + Boosted run speed for the Survivor compared to all the effort the Killer had to go through just to catch them, undone with 1 perk)\n-Allowing Survivors into ranked public games with VOIP chat is ludicrously unfair, it is actually a form of cheating because of the collusion and collaboration that takes place further increasing the difficulty for the Killer in a game that is already too difficult for the Killer. Having a Survivor who gets hooked call out, \"He's heading behind the building, come get me!!!\" is cheating.\n-Allowing Survivors to detect and sabotage a Trapper's traps thus negating an entire Killer character is grossly unfair.\n\n...just to name a few problems with the game.\n\nThe entire burden of the game lies with the player who chooses the Killer because, without a Killer, not 1 Survivor can play this entire game. The game requires 1 person to choose a Killer in order for the game to even be played at all seeing as how there is no single player, no training missions, no story segments involving the various characters and their motivations, nothing, just online multiplayer. With the burden of the entire game on the shoulders of the Killer, why are the developers listening to Survivors who are whining and complaining about Killers being too strong? \nIf a headless chicken wanders into a trap that a skillful Killer lays for them why is it the Killer who is instantly labelled a \"filthy camper\"? Would you refer to our Nation's military as \"Filthy Campers\" for using an entire field of science known as \"Tactics\", which is the art and science of the detailed direction and control of movement or manoeuvre of forces in battle to achieve an aim or task? The Survivors who complain to the developers are those who do not look both ways before crossing the street, then want someone to nerf the car that hit them because, \"Woah, cars is OP yo!\"\nWith the entire burden of the game resting on the Killer why are the Killer's methods to achieve his score raised as \"Unbalanced game mechanics\"?\nIf a Killer stalks a piece of screaming meat he has just hung up to di...dry, then why should it be called \"Camping\" by the people who got caught in the first place? Many Killers are forced to resort to watching their prey dangle on the end of a fishhook because of many issues, including the ones listed above, which necessitate the Killer ensuring they get at least some points for their effort while Survivors can get points for EVERYTHING including taking points away from the Killer. Survivors don't have to run into the Killer watching a hook, then whine about getting caught, there are other things in the game they could be doing.\n\nThen, if I choose to play as a Killer and, in spite of all these problems, actually manage to kill all the Survivors I am treated to a torrent of unfiltered abuse from the angry Survivors complaining about me being OP with my rank 20 and no perks, while my mouse cursor disappears disabling me from being able to leave or exit the end screen. Another over looked bug, or inherent developer design to harass a Killer who uses his brain to play?\n\nThen I read that the Test Servers are running Regenerating Hooks, Infinite Hooks, Killers able to sabotage generators, blahbityblah, etc.? This is insane...\nThis is actually CAUSING the game to veer completely away from it's core premise: Killer stalking players struggling to survive.\n\n-Regenerating Hooks? \nWhy have them be able to be sabotaged in the first place? Aren't they etherial connections to the Entity, disappearing after it has harvested the sacrifice? If not then why aren't they reusable? Hooks should NOT be able to be sabotaged with a lopsided basement map design (The Basement often spawns near 1 far corner of the map allowing Survivors to infinitely stall until the gates are opened thus forcing many Killers to not play the game but sit and watch their crawling victim so they can get at least some points. Can't pick them up, they have Decisive Strike! Thus causing what happens at the hooks to happen at the Survivor's location as well.) Allowing the hooks to be sabotaged is like playing a game of baseball, but one that isn't dependant on skill, but rather revolves around one team sneaking onto the field and destroying the bases so the other team physically CAN'T win. Who would play that game? Exactly. There are many baseball teams who don't win at all and you don't hear them crying and whining that the rules should be changed so they don't have to feel humiliated by another team who has conditioning, athleticism, tactical reasoning and execution, decernment, and talent who defeats them. They instead trade away bad players and look for new players who have something called Skill.\n\n-Infinite hook time? \nNow players who are hooked can stall out the entire game by hanging on a hook, taking away any possibility of the Killer getting a reward for putting them up there. Aren't the hooks supposed to be painful, slicing through flesh and bone while the victim bleeds out? Who gets hooked and suffers no pain? The people on the Test Server that's who! The Test Server, a magical place where Survivors have no consequences, they can win or stall every match and the Killer is only there to host the game for the Survivors to play while laughing at his assumed lack of skill and nerfed gameplay mechanics while jeering, \"Git gud noob!\" In any competitive arena, anywhere in life, when people go head to head one side will always lose and one side will always win, this is how competition works. Instead of screaming their faces off for the rules to change, or the winners to be nerfed it is traditionally the \"Losers\" who are clearly seen as inferior. In the case of this game, it is not a skilled Killer who needs to be nerfed but rather, it is the Survivors without the proper inherent skill and capability who need to heed their own words and indeed \"Git gud!\"\n\n-Killers able to sabotage generators? This is detracting from the core gameplay. This is causing the Killer to do something other than hunt Survivors. It's like playing a game of chess but before you can move you need to play a game of musical chairs first. No. The Killer's core job is to, anyone, anyone? Bueller? \"Kill\"! That's right! And it is the job of the Survivors to \"Survive\"! Killers hunt Survivors while Survivors try to orchestrate their escape and evade the Killer. It is NOT the Survivors' job to prevent the Killer from \"Killing\", and it is NOT the Killer's job to get a mechanical degree...come on.\n\nIf the developers continue to listen to these \"Survivors\" who want to play a competitive multiplayer game with no consequences for their actions, or lack thereof, with their opponent being outnumbered, his hands tied, his methods restricted, his mechanics nerfed then this game will truly be the only thing \"Dead by Daylight\".","timestamp_created":1480445792,"timestamp_updated":1480446846,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528113067150115967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28080085","author":{"steamid":"76561198347273447","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1893,"last_played":1655177916},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom, ideia inovadora mas prcisa corrigir alguns bugs","timestamp_created":1480444743,"timestamp_updated":1480444743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28079864","author":{"steamid":"76561198321223823","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12794,"last_played":1616851492},"language":"english","review":"how to get custom shirts?","timestamp_created":1480444319,"timestamp_updated":1480444319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499750107526779175","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28079810","author":{"steamid":"76561198055376215","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":10336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1499509698},"language":"italian","review":"gioco di merda, non è possibile che mentre stai vincendo si disconnetta da sola dalla partita e addirittura sto bagaglio di gioco ha anche il coraggio di dire che si è disconnesso il mostro quando in realtà sei uscito tu, fa imprecare abbestia non lo comprate, piuttosto compratevi l'abbonamento a brazzers hd","timestamp_created":1480444208,"timestamp_updated":1481011807,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463689059019088745","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28079651","author":{"steamid":"76561198079819200","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6805,"last_played":1578257202},"language":"russian","review":"Игра интересна во многих аспектах, но есть и минусы:\n-Немногим раньше, игра была поистине интересна, но, после последнего обновления, связанного с медсестрой, играть стало невероятно сложно и неинтересно.

Ты ползёшь к выходу, раня рука и ломая пальцы, но всё бесполезно... ОН берёт тебя на плечё и несёт к себе в логово, уже нет сил сопротивляться, в глазах темно, словно ночью, а мысли сбиваются в один непрерывный поток... Мнгновение, и тебя вешают на крюк, ржавый и испачканый кровью прошлых жертв... Секунда... И когти сушьности разрывают тебя, вынимая и забирая твою душу...

This game is still a blast and keeps on getting better. That is why I nominated this game as \"Labor of Love\". There's no other game that lets you play as Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger in their respective line of duty.\n\nIf you like classic slasher movies and that kind of stuff I am sure you will enjoy this one. \n\nDead by Daylight is really interesting game. Asymmetrical multiplayer in its core is really similar to Evolve. There is one killer and 4 survivors. Killer wants to slaughter these horny teenagers and survivors just try to escape. There is no way to kill the Killer so as a survivor you need to hide and work together to survive. Also it provides the horror element to this game making you feel helpless. This game provides 2 different gameplay experiences which are both equally enjoyable. It offers variety even if the gamemode is always the same. \n\nWhen you see people who have written reviews of this game, you can see that quite many have several hundred hours of playtime. That is because this game is addictive. There is not many maps to discover or interesting stories to find but what makes this game addictive is competition. I place this game in to the category of \"Skill addiction\". Much like many mobas and competetive shooters, this game has a steep learning curve and a ranking system. Getting better and unlocking new perks for your characters keeps you \"hooked\" and the gameplay experience fresh even when there is little variation. \n\nIf you can look past some rough edges, bugs and salty adversaries, you will find very compelling and addictive multiplayer experience.
