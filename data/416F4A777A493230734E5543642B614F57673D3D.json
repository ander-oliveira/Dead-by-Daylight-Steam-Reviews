Once those have been fixed/added then this game will be perfect) Just writing this review to let people know before they buy. Currently (6/18/2016) there is no play with friends option. A lot of people sit there writing their bogus comments saying \"THATS NOT NECESSARY TO PLAY THE GAME YOU DONT HAVE TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS BLAH BLAH BLAH\" 9/10 of the games I buy, I buy to play with my friends, and the fact that it doesn't even say you can't play with your friends (unless you have a full games worth, 4 survivors and 1 killer) is extremely misleading since it says co-op. There are definetly some flaws with this game besides that though. Trying to play as killer can prove to be very frustrating as the matchmaking in this game is practically non-existient. 1. You'll be put into max leveled players, which when they have all their perk slots activated and filled that can get extremely annoying. 2. You'll sit there in the lobby for at least 5 minutes waiting for even 1 person to join, and when the game starts loading you very well can end up getting kicked back out to the create a lobby screen.

updated review it is now March/08/2017\n\nThe game it self is fun and challanging - the only pro\n\nCons\nthe Community is a new level of toxic.\n\nthe ammount of exploits people take advange of (ie window/blockade juking).\n\nthe \"rank system\" invokes so many people that if you beat them to post on either your profile by shit posting you and your steam friends or to go to 3rd party steam sites and give you a negitvive review.\n\nand if you camp as killer (which is a legit stratgy) the also shit post you and your steam friends or to go to 3rd party steam sites and give you a negitvive review.\n\nall in all the game IS ONLY FUN when playing with a full group of friends.\n\n\nall in all 3/10 for random online play\nand a 8/10 for only playing with friends\n\noverall review \"Stay away for this game like you would lepper\"\n\nAlso NEVER post on the Steam Forums.\nit never ends well.\n\nupdate 1/1/20\nSo the \"Battle pass\" I 100%'ed the very first one and here's my PERSONAL take.\nDO NOT BUY THE PASS UNLESS you have all ready finished it.\nThey purposely make it impossible to fully acquire all the ranks with the RIFT, \nand (BHVR) fully expect you to Pay additional money to get the rest with the use of \"FOMO\"\naka the \"fear of missing out\" which is a cheap tactic used to make people buy things they do not need/want.\n\nupdate 2/28/2020\n\nCommunity has gotten even Worse since, and due to the blatant survivor favoritism, killers have either stopped playing or have swapped to survivor.\n\nSurvivor que times are up to 5 mins on the low side 25-40 mins on the High.\nKiller ques are instant but the toxicity is to much so DON'T.\n\nand if it keeps up\nno one will get lobbies\nUnless they add BOTS like they did on the phone version (8 /6/2020 update : They are)\n\n\n\n\nSKIN MATH TIME\nC = Cells / S = Shards / B= Blood points\n\nC=$3.00 = S=4.5k / S= 2k = B= 150k BP\n\n1S = 75B\nNow while you cannot trade B to S, this also tells us the value of one S is 1/75 of one B./ Or 0.01333(...)B\n\nTo determine the value of C\nAnd the exchange of the three\n\n$0.01 = 1C = 18S = 1350B\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m5QdYJv.png\n\nAssuming you purchased ONE part of this 3 piece set at full cost\nNo combo deal\nThis is $4.00 = 400C = 7,200S = 540,000B\nFor each item\nMeaning the outfit is a total of 1.62M blood\n\n\nAverage time: 20 minutes\nexperience per round: 500\naverage reward per round:17,500 BP\n\nYou're \"earning\" $0.38.888(...)/hr in equivalent value.\n\nThat means for example.\nFor that 400C item\nWhich we know is $4\nThat is \"worth\" about 10.5 hours of your playtime.\nSome of your cheaper sets\nAre only looking at 3-4 hours.\nSo essentially \"does a skin worth a long workday's worth of playing to put on feel worth it to you\"\n\nthe \"individual SBMM\" for EACH killer is added since the Datamine found out that there is NO \"individual SBMM\" for EACH killer ever even added to the code.\n\nthis is beyond toxic to the extremes of 16 meta perks BNP, Odd Bulbs and SWF comm users\nbreaking the flow of the game I have been playing (4-8 hours/D) since the SBMM came out\n(36 hours total since SBMM added)\nand in that time I have only gotten to (ASH 2) aka rank 17!!!!\n\nthis isn't fun\nthis isn't fair\n\nand the match that has me removing this game from my SSD on my Ps5\nwas me chasing ONE ace with a Marco bound flashlight to make my FPS drop (ON A PS5!!)\nfor only 2 mins and in that Time 4 gens popped all while just getting ONE hit on them.\n\nand when I DID down them I get insta blinded by their Friend ALSO using the machine click spam Macro also with ODDBULB and as soon as ACE was freed 5th gen Pops and OFC ace had Adrenaline!!\n\n\nSo yeah I freaking quit!\n\nGL HF and may the game all ways be balanced for the ENTILTED FEW.\n\nDDOS\nVPN scummers\nHackers/script kiddies\nun fan game play for killers, 20+ mon ques for Survs due to killers leaving.\n\npeople being able to pay 5 USD to a site to unlock every Skin Char and perk in game and NOT get caught.\nthe under the radar hackers that have been hacking since 2016\nusing 2-10% faster gen speeds and running speeds to take 10 secs of a gen or make a loop

And charging $20 for an incomplete game isnt the worst thing you could do, hell RUST made a shit load of money on an early developement game that they never finished.....then scrapped that game, only to replace it with a COMPLETELY new game, which sucked ass....so I guess what I'm trying to say is please Starbreeze Studios....Don't scrap this game and replace it with a COMPLETELY new game, just finish this game.\n\nSo in closing, if paying $20 to play a psycho killer who runs around a couple of different maps that look EXACTLY THE SAME sounds like fun (i'm not even gonna mention the lack of grouping with friends......fuck I just did) , then give it a try.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nmore than a month later, this game is still the buggiest thing i've tried to play since Arkham knight.\nmaybe the dev's should read shit like this before trying to make another game.\n\nhttp://www.denofgeek.com/games/bugged-videogames/33602/have-bugged-videogames-now-become-the-norm\n\nAt least friend grouping has been added...sort of.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n1 year on and play with friends still barely works.","timestamp_created":1466225945,"timestamp_updated":1505962826,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23626300","author":{"steamid":"76561198000559680","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":632,"last_played":1493765897},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1466225855,"timestamp_updated":1466225855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447042644023895264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23626295","author":{"steamid":"76561198283320979","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":110,"playtime_at_review":1718,"last_played":1659789339},"language":"schinese","review":"ÂàöÂºÄÂßãÁé©ËøòÊòØÊÑüËßâÂæàÊñ∞È¢ñÁöÑ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÊòØÊÑüËßâÂÅ∑ÁîµÂ§™Âçï‰∏Ä‰∫Ü„ÄÇÁé©Â§ö‰∫ÜÂ∞±ÊÑüËßâÊØîËæÉÊûØÁá•‰∫Ü„ÄÇ","timestamp_created":1466225821,"timestamp_updated":1503372619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543379008769989014","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23626219","author":{"steamid":"76561198086257321","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1466228751},"language":"schinese","review":"ÂæàÂ•ΩÔºå‰Ωú‰∏∫‰∏Ä‰∏™ÈÄÄÊ¨æÁãÇÈ≠îÊàëÊ≤°ÊúâÈÄÄÊ¨æÁöÑÊ¨≤Êúõ\nÂØπÊäóÁöÑËäÇÂ•èÂæàÂ•ΩÔºåËÉΩÈù†Ëá™Â∑±ÔºåÂ¶ÇÊûúÊúâÈòüÂèãËæÖÂä©Â∞±Êõ¥ÊµÅÁïÖÔºå‰∏ç‰ºöÊúâ‰æøÁßòÁöÑÊÑüËßâ\nÊ≤°‰∏≠ÊñáÔºåÁõÆÂâçÈöúÁ¢ç‰∏çÂ§ßÔºåÊ∏∏ÊàèÈáå‰∏çËÆæÁΩÆ‰∫§ÊµÅ‰πüÁÆóÂ§©ÁÑ∂Â¢ûÂä†ÈöæÂ∫¶‰∫ÜÔºåÈô§ÈùûÂºÄÈªë\nËøô‰∏™‰ª∑Ê†ºÔºåÊÑüËßâÂêàÊÉÖÂêàÁêÜ„ÄÇÂèçÊ≠£ÊàëÂÆÅÂèØ‰π∞Âá†‰∏™ÊùÄÈ∏°Ôºå‰πü‰∏ç‰ºöÂÜç‰π∞‰∏™100Â§ö200Â§öÁöÑËÇ≤Á¢ßÁöÑ‰∫Ü‚Äî‚ÄîCNM","timestamp_created":1466225375,"timestamp_updated":1466225375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23626157","author":{"steamid":"76561198078043158","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":160654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":183,"playtime_at_review":2042,"last_played":1660443862},"language":"english","review":"Fish simulator 2016","timestamp_created":1466225006,"timestamp_updated":1466225006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23626154","author":{"steamid":"76561198189319521","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":23944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1626147242},"language":"english","review":"I love the game but everytime i escape my game crashes. \nBut when i die it still works fine. happened 4 times already","timestamp_created":1466224953,"timestamp_updated":1466224953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23626143","author":{"steamid":"76561198009128053","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1466018298},"language":"english","review":"Good Idea Terrible Execution.

It needs fixing.\n\nLike everyone says, matchmaking is probably the biggest issue. Mostly long load times, but it does sometimes take 2-3 minutes to fill up a lobby. Which is a long time if you consider some games you're only alive for 2 minutes. As in there really isn't any. If you want to be the killer, you make a lobby and people will join. If you're a survivor you join a lobby. But no party system is in place though the devs are working on it. Players disconnect every game, I have crashed multiple times, and while it's not really the devs fault, a camping killer will ruin the game. As a personal note, I have always HATED perk systems. With a fiery passion. I wish they would die.\n\nAs for bugs, there aren't many game breaking bugs or exploitable bugs, but I've run into a few that make life very difficult. Like not being able to pick up a downed survivor, or survivors living though multiple hook hangings (they are supposed to die automatically the second time).\n\nSo far I can't really complain about balance issues except for the camping killers.\n\nIt has potential, but it's not finished. Wait for it.\n\nEDIT: So after the last few patches, they fixed many game breaking bugs, and added a party system. It still takes forever to get into a game with multiple survivors, but that's not a problem on the part of the devs, rather the killer to survivor ratio. So most of my previous complaints are no longer valid.\n\nSo it's now a good game right?\n\nYes. But it's not fun.\n\nLet me explain. This game is not designed to be fun. It's just not. It's designed with a heavy bias to the killer, regardless of what anybody says about survivors being OP. The killer is, and always will be, stronger and better than the survivors. That's the point of the game. It's not fair, and it's meant to be that way. As a survivor, you are meant to have all the odds stacked against you, and still be able to get out alive.\n\nThat's not fun for me. So I won't recommend the game. But many of my friends love the challenge. The devs had a vision, and they brought it to life. It's good. I just don't like it.","timestamp_created":1466222278,"timestamp_updated":1469951559,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551536738872528076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23625685","author":{"steamid":"76561197995167253","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1581184298},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bien, tiene algunas cosas por arreglar pero en general es muy entretenido.","timestamp_created":1466221901,"timestamp_updated":1466221901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23625656","author":{"steamid":"76561198112973569","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2264,"last_played":1506473436},"language":"turkish","review":"Feaaaarrrrrrrrrrrr :///////","timestamp_created":1466221746,"timestamp_updated":1466221746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23625652","author":{"steamid":"76561198154740439","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":6934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":25,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1659554650},"language":"english","review":"GET THIS GAME!!

No. Is it fun? Bloody hell yes. \n\nThis game isn't going to be for everyone. Odds are you ARE going to be helpless as a suvivor. That's the point. Survivors are suppose to be helpless against a Killer. As a suvivor you don't play to win games, you play to survive them. And as a Killer you play to do one thing and only one thing, kill. If you don't like being helpless against an unstopable Killer IF he finds you, then odds are you aren't going to like Dead by Daylight. But if you are smart. Then either the Survivors or Killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other.\n\nPros-\n-Playing as a slasher flick killer. 3 of them with more in the works.\n-Being a victim of a slasher flick. Escape death with skill, maybe just dumb luck, or die in soiled pants.\n-4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other.\n-Great use of sounds for information.\n-RNG tile based maps. 1-2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places, but everything else will change every game.\n-Games last 10 minutes on average.\n\nCons-\n-Some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair/eyes as a Killer or some janky movement with Killers interacting with suvivors.\n-Balance. One Killer is weaker than the other 2. Windows close together can make near 100% safe zones for survivors depending on a few things. Some perks are rather annoying, maybe a touch OP.\n-Games have no timers. If someone wants to waste your time, they can if they are good enough.\n-No communication. It is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like Steam, Teamspeak, Skype, ect.\n-Making a lobby as a Killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill. Not from player counts mind you. Either another bug or a waiting list with strict \"first come, first filled\" rules.\n\nIn short-\n\nFor $20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game! Just note that it might not be for everyone as not everyone can handle playing as victims who are by design made to be helpless more often than not.","timestamp_created":1466214515,"timestamp_updated":1466214515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":377,"votes_funny":30,"weighted_vote_score":"0.866490840911865234","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23624440","author":{"steamid":"76561198030009008","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":38287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16960,"last_played":1526244264},"language":"spanish","review":"el

Full of bugs such as one of it is jumping over a window and get stucked and the killer just look at me and just like oh poor little goat is going to die and i cant do sht.\n\n2.) Old school match making. The most terrible things i face when playing this game, the connection stability is base on the host killer, means if killer had a bad connection speed, you are screwed.\n\n3.) Very hard to find a room, im not sure is this matchmaking is for worldwide? but i keep finding no matches, which i feel like this game only have about less than 20 people playing it i guess?\n\n4.) When a people leave a room, you should reduce the generator to work on,but no mostly what i met is when a player leave, it left only 3 people to work on 5 generator and facing a killer =)\n\n5.) Teamwork, annoying as sht, no communication in game, we just do not know what we are doing, sometimes i was trying to say, ill save him and you all work on generator, it ends up all are waiting to save people or sometimes no one will save it.\n\nThis game is just not ready yet, fun, yeay, headeach yeay, frustration yeay.
