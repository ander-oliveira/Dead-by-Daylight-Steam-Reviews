At first i was in love with this game. I loved the licensed killers/survivors and didnt mind playing as either. But this game has just fallen from grace, and I'm done with it until it's major flaws get addressed.\n\nThe good:\n-Team play is excellent when it works, and when you have a communicative team. \n-A shocking amount of builds to try, with a unique leveling system\n-Survivor teams are rewarding when done right, and hero moments actually feel heroic\n-Most killers are very different, and cater to most peoples play styles.\n-The game receives regular \"updates.\"\n-While the scares go away over time, it's still dreadful to know you're being hunted, and you don't even know by who until the game actually gets going for a bit.\n\nThe Bad:\n-This game has the most toxic community I've ever seen in a game. You play well, you're a disgrace, you play bad, you're shit talked into oblivion, you run certain builds, you're a moron. Literally just playing the game at this point is an act of treason. The first time i played in a lobby of just friends was the best time ive had in this game.\n-Cheaters are rampant in this game\n-MMR has destroyed this game. It pairs you with people WAYYYYY Above or Below your skill level. I intentionally throw matches so the game thinks im bad, but it still puts me with people who live and breathe this game. And consistently getting put with people who sweat this game just derails any enjoyment i get from when it used to just be chill lobbies up until you got to a certain rank. And that goes for either killer or survivor. You play survivor nowadays, you get the same 3 busted killers that take no prisoners. You play as killer? Godlike team full of red ranks that just grief you any way possible and trash talk you into oblivion after the fact. The game IS NOT MEANT for new players anymore.\n-They've added no genuine change to the formula. Which would be fine if it wasn't broken, but it is. \n-The devs do not care for the playerbase. i genuinely believe theyve basically muted it. The community itself is a nightmare, and there are no meaningful updates. Any concern addressed to the devs just gets the answer of \"were working on it\" with no explanation other than that.\n\nI want this game to succeed, but it's just gone down a horrible road, and i dont think its coming back. The game is not new player friendly, i wouldnt even bother anymore.","timestamp_created":1643280659,"timestamp_updated":1643280659,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108870146","author":{"steamid":"76561198087077588","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8560,"last_played":1643561255},"language":"spanish","review":"no\n","timestamp_created":1643279995,"timestamp_updated":1643279995,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108869318","author":{"steamid":"76561198220077305","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26261,"last_played":1650253912},"language":"brazilian","review":"peguei 400 hora em 1 mes","timestamp_created":1643278664,"timestamp_updated":1643278664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108869299","author":{"steamid":"76561198327014124","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":76,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1659948953},"language":"english","review":"why each update want to download entire game of 35GB ? why dont you fix this?","timestamp_created":1643278646,"timestamp_updated":1643278646,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47243848443031311","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108868272","author":{"steamid":"76561198019051647","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":352,"playtime_at_review":6023,"last_played":1660595599},"language":"russian","review":"fun to play as killer","timestamp_created":1643277061,"timestamp_updated":1643277061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108868193","author":{"steamid":"76561198817761120","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":42657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39680,"last_played":1647070508},"language":"schinese","review":"很好，修复了护士的bug\n虽然还有很多bug，但这是良好的开端","timestamp_created":1643276961,"timestamp_updated":1644551434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108867933","author":{"steamid":"76561199114872998","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":261,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1660327847},"language":"russian","review":"Очень крутая игра, по началу пердак гореть будет ярко","timestamp_created":1643276558,"timestamp_updated":1643276558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108867565","author":{"steamid":"76561199220452132","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2000,"last_played":1648292433},"language":"schinese","review":"人类就强的离谱，4黑开语音杀手直接白给，开门还蹲起嘲讽。\n杀手除非操作或血压过关，不然千万别碰。\n杀手建议：先开几局了解游戏，再去学习一些大佬杀手如：青铜海树。熟练后在尝试打高分操作\n人类建议：找几个好兄弟即可（尽量别嘲讽杀手，都不容易）\n欢迎继续补充建议","timestamp_created":1643275929,"timestamp_updated":1643275929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50641024112701416","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108867140","author":{"steamid":"76561198847200538","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":40353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7172,"playtime_at_review":15855,"last_played":1660403593},"language":"schinese","review":"加强屠夫\n","timestamp_created":1643275212,"timestamp_updated":1643275212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108866784","author":{"steamid":"76561198128202303","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":48336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2240,"playtime_at_review":1934,"last_played":1660555361},"language":"english","review":"Wasn't sure if this was my kind of game.

U can check my steam-profile and u will see that its totally simping for DbD. Artworks i drawed over so many hours, steam-emotes, cards, showcases even my guestbook is filled with DbD-related content and even my stream on twitch. I can say 90% of my viewers are from the DbD-Community.\nWhat i love about DbD? Oh here i can say many things\n\n=Jake- he is a totally cutie.\n\n=Trapper-one of the funniest ones to play and with him i started watchin TheEntityLeftHand. \n\n=Storys-i rly love the different storys behind the characters (Jakes one is the reason i love to play him. Also with trapper > i dont play trapper cuz of his traps (even they are fun to use))\n\n=Gameplay- it took me a while to get the perfect timings with loops and pallets and to learn the different strategies to play all those different killers and their powers. I tried to play other A-symetrical games like VHS or Propnight or others. There is still nothing like DbD. U have a lot of characters to play and every 3 months we get new ones. The Entitys world is colorful and everyone can find someone he likes to play. The killers also are rly intresting and each of them individual (kinda like) Also u can choose the role u playn: sneaky survivor or murdery killer. \n\n=Colors\n\n=Skins\n\n=Different related characters\n\n=Different playstyles\n\n=MEMERS-They are sadly extremely rare but they are there. and they still give me the strength to move on... . . . \n\nI still love DbD... . . .\n\n\n\n\n. . . ...but i hate the developers for making the game worse and less worth to play. And this is rly sad.\nLets talk about some of the latest shit they've done since the game came out:\n\nSECOND:\n\n=Old Scripts- Since years the community is reporting bugs who where there since the game had his first release in the gamerworld. Getting stuck in things or on places u never thought u would get stuck/glitched ( https://youtu.be/nuaUqIVaFqc ), glitched characters and skins and all over on top of it the hacking-problems during the old... rly old AntiCheatSoftware. \n\n=AntiCheatSoftware - this is a joke since years. Sure from time to time they're getting a rework out but it is still based on the old shitty scripts and they dont realise one thing: if u have only one point wrong it destroys a whole script. And after years of ducttaping it and stressing the game more and more with new \"Content\" the tape is falling of again. How many times will they need to realise that they dont have to change the lightings or the maps or putting in new killers and their powers or introducing weird changes to old killers or throwing new stupid perks into our faces noone will use more than one time cuz the community wants to win by any means so they use the powerfulliest perks they can get. 98% of the killers play BBQandChilli, Tinkerer, NOED, Nurses Calling and other socalled metaperks. 99% of the survs play DS, DH, Lithe, etc. oh and the newest bullshit: Boons (i only use Boons(Healing, Shadowstep and Exponential)). BUT EVERYTHING IS BASED ON THE OLD SCRIPT THEY STILL USE and this is what makes everything worse and worse. Even u have Shadowstep on a boon i had times where a killer still saw the scratchmarks (Shadowstep should prevent that!). Or i wasnt able to heal standing right next to the Healing-Boon or get up in my own exponential. On little very smoll fail in a script can cause this. Not everytime obviously cuz there are some other factors who need to be active... BUT THEY ARE THERE and wait for their next time to shine.\n\n=Community-I meet so many good people in DbD but they're getting less and more less cuz the good people who enjoyed the game have at least a bit of honor left to not camp and tunnel or they just have time to meme. The old ones i know are mostly gone and this is the reason we have a lack of good players who where able to get into the OLD REDRANKS (The new Ranksystem is a complete joke in my eyes and resetting the community to one level on every 13th of a month is so stupid that i cant find words for it.) The old ranksystem needed skill (and thats not the same with tunnel or camp), the new one just patience. And its not even needed cuz u getting matched totally randomly. And depending on what mode or time u play it still takes HOURS to find a lobby.\n\n=Toxicity.... ...wins. The behavior of the players are not worth to talk about. If u want a 99.99%-community full of toxicity (thanks to all the shit on youtube and also the stupid brains of the most new gamers)... buy DbD and chat there. U willg et totally payed off.\n\n=Tunnel and Camp- the old conversation. Sure those are allowed strategies. I can accept that but with the new ranksystem it got WORSE. Can u beleive this? Before u needed at least a lil bit of brainusage to get ur kills but actually u just need to stay on a hook to get ur next pip/level.\n\n=Missuse of items or perks or enviroment is another thing. AM getting so bored if someone clicks with a flashlight all the time or vaults a palett for hours when u ignore this person who desperately WANT UR FREAKING ATTENTION. And also as killer...one tip for u when u play killer: always expect Decisive stike, Dead heart, Boons or Borowed time. Also when u play Surv: always expect BBQandChilli, Tinkerer, NOED and all those other frequently used socalled META-PERKS (on killers mostly those perks who strengthens their powers extremely.). 98% of the community are using META-PERKS. u dont need to expect something else. If u do so u will get good along. Oh and dont forget to play them as well so its getting more easier for others to share them... . . . \n\n=The permanent cry \"SURVIVORSIDED OR KILLERSIDED\"- its exhausting. We have so many different characters out there but u will see mostly the strongest killers in this game and if ure lucky to see one of the rare ones... they are mostly mains on this one or they play like the last babboonbuddholes. Sry for that word... but i cant find other words for it.\n\n=COMPETITVE GAMEPLAY- nothing wants me to vomit more than seeing all those people who want to win by any means. A WIN in DbD looks different but mostly it is \"KILLING EVERYONE\" for Killers or \"CLICKY CLICKY/TEABAGGING IN THE EXIT\" for survivors. \nWinning something in Reality is so rare that the people want to win at least in a game. And if they dont win they dont play this game. Winning by any means. Easier for killers cuz if ure lucky ur survivors getting matched totally randomly. Fokus on the one who is good, tunnel him out and u won. Its that easy... ...or u are lucky to get the full-swf-overpower and u want to quitt the game instantly. Here comes all together.\nBut u have to think about one thing: u dont know what happened previously in their games. U are mostly just unlucky that u get all the anger on u when u try not to play like the last buddhole. This is why i QUITT playn killer on regular bases. And am sad about this. (But i more recently dont wanna get matched agains those idiotic SWFs who want to be toxic IN A GAME).\n\n\nPLS DEVS. Grab ur pants tight and start to rework EVERYTHING from the beginning on. Whats saying something against that u couldnt start a new Chapter: Dead by Daylight 2. Give all the ppl their skins who they payed for and get a better game together. Sure its a lot of work and it will need TIME but YOUR COMMUNITY IS MORE AND MORE. Every big person i know is bored of all the things i typed before.","timestamp_created":1643265428,"timestamp_updated":1643266237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642857134342193604","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108861186","author":{"steamid":"76561198422051256","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34066,"last_played":1655537356},"language":"english","review":"hArD","timestamp_created":1643264882,"timestamp_updated":1643264882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108860601","author":{"steamid":"76561199208837287","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1462,"last_played":1658050319},"language":"schinese","review":"英雄联盟！这个游戏是让我笑得屁股脱落！","timestamp_created":1643263967,"timestamp_updated":1643263967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108860498","author":{"steamid":"76561198307118783","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1969,"last_played":1657227393},"language":"english","review":"The game feels scuffed and just meant for you to spend money. Ill start listing the reasons. The first one is the pay wall. To play over 80% of the killers and survivors you have to pay money which makes no sense because you just payed money to play the game. \nA huge bad design was the currencies and it just feels like it was meant to drain as much money from the player as possible. Blood points arent a good design because to obtain the perks on survivors means you have to spend blood points and level up but this puts you at huge disadvantage all for a very long time. Blood points should of been the currency to unlock new characters similar to how blue essence allows you to unlock champion in league of legends. Also having to use blood points to get items that can only be used once is dumb as it'd just make more sense to unlock them permanently or else players will feel to scared to use the item and its the same thing for offerings. Shards are a bad currency because they're practically impossible to use on things you want since obtaining them takes forever. I have over 30 hours on the game and only 1/3 of the way to unlocking a new character but of course they allow you to buy the champion with real money. Again back to how league of legends does it, they make the champion locked but the free currency blue essence is obtainable to unlock a character you want within a relatively reasonable amount of time. Also people want to try new killers/survivors so making the characters actually purchaseable for free would be a great change. People who got bored of one killer could simply just get a new killer without having to spend even more money on the game\nVoice comms, pings or a chat for survivors would be a great addition. \nAnother problem is when youre in an actual match. Hitboxes dont always feel right as for survivors its very possible to be hit over a wall of from insane distances where on your screen the killers strike misses by at least a meter. Hitboxes should always have clarity just for user experience. This is something that should really get fixed considering its made using unreal engine which is known to make fps shooters so accuracy is a things its very capable of.\nMaps in the game feel somewhat low effort. For a game that costs 15 pounds and costs around 4 pounds per character, I feel that having a ton of the maps just being flat, feels low effort. I mean come on they're literally flat pieces of terrain!\nOn a positive note the game can be really fun and I think it has incredible potential to be better. Smoothing out the gameplay and fixing the poor currency system would make the game less frustrating.","timestamp_created":1643263803,"timestamp_updated":1643263803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108860002","author":{"steamid":"76561198274195602","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":13775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12913,"last_played":1658347446},"language":"english","review":"good with friend or when be killer.

I have over 800 hours now and the game is Fun. However, it has some glaring bugs and issues with encouraging a very non fun way of playing. Going both ways on killer/ survivor. The company has pretty much ignored people's anger with the current matchmaking. When it is, admittedly, pretty bad. I thought it would get better with time but my quality of games have gotten mostly worse than it was before skill based matchmaking. You're fighting people much less experienced and suddenly in the next facing people who can annihilate you (survivor AND killer sided as well). The evenly matched games are more far in between.\n\nThis game is best enjoyed when you don't take it too seriously right now. It can be for you but keep in mind that you'll come across a lot of kinda stupid stuff and not in a good way.

It's a great game at its core! The *core* gameplay is fun.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers have kept going in a direction that both - killer and survivor - makes the game unfun. A recent example that's easy to explain to someone unfamiliar with mechanics is the new wiggle changes. \n\nFor context, once a survivor is in a \"downed\" state, they must be carried to a hook. However, the survivors have the ability to wiggle out of it. It takes time, requires you to spam two keys, and is one of the survivors ways out of a killers grasp. It's intended to punish the killer for lazing around while holding someone. However, a recent nerf to killers has made it better to leave the bodies on the floor [b]and let them bleed out.[/b]\n\nThe nerf happens when a killer, while holding someone, drops off a floor. This takes a whopping 25% off the time it takes to wiggle. That's huge, as in some cases, you can lose 50% of a wiggle meter in 10 seconds. That's severe enough to make it impossible to hook a player, in some cases depending on where they die. This is not to mention the development direction they've been going in, forcing killers to do more tasks when they already have a LOT of things to deal with.\n\nHowever, killers aren't the only characters being ruined. Survivors have it bad, too. At higher levels of play, you're expected to run the same 4 perks to escape killers, because they're extremely strong. This makes fun meme builds, such as Plunderers Instinct (a perk that locates treasure chests with items in them, and increases the rarities of items inside) and Ace in the Hole (a perk that adds \"addons\" to said items, which increase the effectiveness of the item) almost impossible to run, as you'll likely get bodied at high ranks for running them. It's inherently unfun. This isn't even mentioning the community, which I will skip as I am not qualified to talk about them.\n\nI am however, qualified to talk about bugs. This game is extremely buggy. For context, I play a character known as nurse. Nurse has a killer ability that allows you to teleport - with a catch. In order to teleport, you must charge it up, aim it, and it will go as far as you have charged it. You do not know where you will teleport without a addon. [b]A large portion of the maps do not properly support nurse teleports, such as RPD.[/b] You will frequently not teleport any distance, even with max teleport charge. Sometimes you'll get stuck teleporting repeatedly. Sometimes your teleport won't charge. It's just buggy.\n\nI hope I have cemented that this game, while at it's core is good, unfortunately fails due to the development decisions elsewhere. Both killers and survivor mains are finding this game less and less fun. I can only hope it improves, but it's unlikely, as developers have confirmed this is where they like the game direction.\n\n\n\nI wasn't gonna write a essay, but here we are.","timestamp_created":1643248343,"timestamp_updated":1643248343,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510309278964996338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108851124","author":{"steamid":"76561197981435370","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2029,"last_played":1643432443},"language":"english","review":"A fun game to jump in and out to have some stupid fun every once in a while!","timestamp_created":1643248050,"timestamp_updated":1648749655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108850869","author":{"steamid":"76561198817402111","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1642813310},"language":"english","review":"fun game verry fun  also fun :)","timestamp_created":1643247613,"timestamp_updated":1643247613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108850721","author":{"steamid":"76561199157335869","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":104599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2408,"playtime_at_review":61274,"last_played":1660602664},"language":"english","review":"Love this game!","timestamp_created":1643247379,"timestamp_updated":1643247379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108850718","author":{"steamid":"76561199076477630","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4354,"last_played":1658744459},"language":"english","review":"Warning to all future players!

They think everything should have a skill check, no real depth of thought is put into the mechanics of the game. The new wiggle is a joke, and the removal of tapping while on the hook being replaced with skill checks are a joke. Killers are unbalanced and they intentionally do it to push sales, which then they nerf them once they milk it enough. The bird lady has infinite range when shooting her crows. Still not convincing enough? Well those crows literally go through walls at no maximum range. They can camp you from a distance while tracking your locations. It's obvious they are trying to push you to spend money on characters to have an advantage (Killers specifically since abilities are unique to killers.) The BTS killer that is a Kpop idol was obviously biased when created because it is one of the most forgiving characters to play. All range character require you to aim and punish you when you miss except him. He has over 50 knives to throw and he can spam them nonstop. Huntress only has 5 axes and Gunslinger has to shoot once before reloading which is fair because you are being punished for missing. At over 50 knives it takes 6 to do a full damage to you. It takes 12 knives to down you, which sounds like a lot except  Trickster throws them at a fast rate. If he would be balanced they would reduce him to having equal potential damage as huntress by limiting him to 30 since it takes 6 to deal 1 damage. Huntress has 5 potential damage with the total amount of hatchets .\n\nIF YOU PLAY AS KILLER ALONE, you will enjoy the game. IF YOU HAVE EVEN 1 Friend that you would like to play with I highly recommend you stay away since you will be forced to play survivor.  \nThis game has fallen far from greatness and it's a shame that the devs don't care. \nBUYER BE WARNED, THE TOXICITY is HIGH in this game.","timestamp_created":1643242239,"timestamp_updated":1643242239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108847304","author":{"steamid":"76561198855715240","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":152,"playtime_at_review":1909,"last_played":1660346395},"language":"brazilian","review":"Recomendo apenas se voce quiser passar raiva e ter um AVC ao mesmo tempo.","timestamp_created":1643241993,"timestamp_updated":1643241993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108846892","author":{"steamid":"76561198269222532","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4002,"last_played":1651875962},"language":"english","review":"I became addicted.","timestamp_created":1643241362,"timestamp_updated":1643241362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108846883","author":{"steamid":"76561199074648524","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1643241792},"language":"english","review":"i wanana fuck all kill so bad plss....lmemme smash bro","timestamp_created":1643241346,"timestamp_updated":1643241346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108846721","author":{"steamid":"76561199067640441","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1348,"last_played":1659135763},"language":"latam","review":"Piola.","timestamp_created":1643241053,"timestamp_updated":1643241053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108846683","author":{"steamid":"76561199029753405","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":48544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1775,"playtime_at_review":22846,"last_played":1660599284},"language":"russian","review":"Думала в в команде 3 дебила.
