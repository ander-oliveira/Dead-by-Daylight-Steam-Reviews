fun game, I gifted the game to my friends and now we play it together.\n\nThis game consists about a player being the killer, there are different killers and each of them have different abilities, survivors have to fix the required amount of generators and find the escape or secret exit.\nKillers must find all the survivors and hang them until they die.\n\nFeatures:\nYou get to choose if you want to be killer or survivor, which is an option I really like.\n\nYou can customize your characters, buy DLC's to have more things to wear on your characters and in some DLC's you will also get new characters, such as killers or survivors.\n\nCharacter perks, add-ons and offerings: You get to add items or power ups to your character + offerings that if you win, grants you boosts.\n\nThere is an option to make a private game called, ''Kill your friends'', where you have to play as the killer against your friends that play as survivor, you get to choose any perk, add on and offerings for your character and you can also choose the map for your custom/private game.\n\nDLC'S: As I mentioned before, there are DLC's, these DLC's give you either: accesories or killers & survivors.\n\nCAMPERS:\nYes, there are many campers in this game that will stay right next to you until you die so another player doesn't rescue you, however, you can counter it by pulling off a distraction.\n\nBUGS:\nFrom what I've seen so far, there are around 2 bugs that don't affect your gameplay.\n\nThis game is worth it, but if you don't believe me, try watching a gameplay like I did

I mainly play a Survivor all the time and I can tell you this. You can literally always win as the Survivor and I can even prove it in game to. All you have to do is run thats it run jump threw a window then wait for him to go around and jump back threw. And then again and again and again. The Killer it is basically impossible for the killer to win unless you have idiot players. But if you do the trick you win. The killer focuses on you while 3 other people do a stupid ass Generator. Even if you left him to go to another player. Guess what lol that player will just do the same thing. I really wanted to like this game and tbh  I did when it first came out. But this game is Unbalanced unfair for the killer and 100% boring. The reason its boring is simple. As a Survivor you do NOTHING  but hide and turn on a damn Generator like really. Thats all you do. Just turn on a Generator the entire game. You turn 4 on and you basically win.  So not only are you just sitting there doing nothing but screw around with a Generator. But the killer can't stop you from doing it cause all you have to do is just run to a damn window or wait by a barricade for him to be stunned. And if they have the flash lights lol just another LONG ass stun to waste time. That is basically it. For a game where the Survivors should feel afraid of the killer there not if anything its nothing but Survivors Taunting the killer to come to them. Do not buy this game I mean it. You will either like the game for about a hour or 2 then hate it and never touch it again. Or you will just straight out hate it at the beginning. In conclusion this game deserves a 3/10. The game is fun if you play a Survivor at the beginning of the game. But after you play him for about 2 hours you will find yourself very bored and wishing you never bought the game. As for the killer lol. There is nothing fun about being the killer. You don't feel like a badass or a actual killer. You feel like a idiot just walking around looking at Generators.","timestamp_created":1497894756,"timestamp_updated":1497894756,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45057108998298645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32571013","author":{"steamid":"76561198376115263","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1498413666},"language":"russian","review":"ТОП ИГРА","timestamp_created":1497893519,"timestamp_updated":1497893519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32570335","author":{"steamid":"76561198321458970","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1629303750},"language":"romanian","review":"un joc superb!\n","timestamp_created":1497891702,"timestamp_updated":1497891702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32570267","author":{"steamid":"76561198046741343","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":8929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5096,"last_played":1561644882},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, crea una gran tensión.\nUnico problema que jugar de superviviente en squad cuesta pork hay pocos asesinos online, pero repito gran juego","timestamp_created":1497891534,"timestamp_updated":1497891534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32570133","author":{"steamid":"76561198241404110","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":55784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21944,"last_played":1651446393},"language":"spanish","review":"re piolaa wacho","timestamp_created":1497891209,"timestamp_updated":1497891209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32569996","author":{"steamid":"76561198198608170","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1530516617},"language":"english","review":"mehh full of toxic,waiting in lobby forever,can't find a matchmaking and it's too late to refund because i'm waiting in lobby for too long","timestamp_created":1497890865,"timestamp_updated":1497890865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518433153629302979","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32569617","author":{"steamid":"76561198200823645","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":33556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":2247,"last_played":1660086122},"language":"english","review":"Best horror Mp game","timestamp_created":1497889971,"timestamp_updated":1497889971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32569429","author":{"steamid":"76561198216992460","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":22076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1225,"last_played":1625753522},"language":"english","review":"you are on fire !

Gra została wydana 14 czerwca 2016 roku na systemy Windows.\n\nRozgrywka Dead by Daylight jest asymetryczna, tj. jeden gracz staje do rozgrywki przeciwko zazwyczaj czterem innym. Ta grupa pięciu graczy to maksymalnie 4 uciekinierów i jeden zabójca. Zadaniem uciekinierów jest wydostanie się z zamkniętej mapy gry, zaś zadaniem zabójcy jest uniemożliwienie tego. Gracze chcący uciec mają za zadanie naprawienie i włączenie odpowiedniej liczby generatorów prądu, pozwalających na otwarcie drzwi i ucieczkę z terenu mapy. Zadaniem zabójcy jest zabicie pozostałych graczy (uciekinierów).\n\nGracze po obu stronach mają możliwość wybrania postaci, którą chcą kierować w grze. Uciekający mają do dyspozycji 7 postaci, każda mająca inne zdolności do wykorzystania w trakcie rozgrywki. Grający zabójcą również posiada opcje wyboru spośród 6 postaci może to być  (m.in. Michael Myers), z których każda ma inne zdolności i techniki zabijania.\n\nRozgrywka trwa do momentu ucieczki przez drzwi lub ukryty właz albo gdy wszyscy uciekinierzy zginą. Po zakończonej rozgrywce gracze otrzymują punkty doświadczenia do wydania na dalsze rozwijanie swojej postaci.\n\nAkcja odbywa się na jednej z sześciu losowo wybranych mapach, na której znajdują się różnego typu przeszkody i znajdźki.
