Campers can be handled by a group of survivors, one distracting or two and the other ones attempt the save, Glitches tempt to occure like every 1/20 game aswell so nothing really that matters too much to me. What you can do is maybe find friends to play with so if you do encounter a camper you guys can communicate through somewhere and well plan on how to save the one innocent man/grill on the hook.\n\nLoving the new update with the Huntress, Keep humming her lullaby to myself thinking she is the killer every game to then find out it's the shape and noticing it too late..","timestamp_created":1503301692,"timestamp_updated":1511509432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536398470401763916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34389844","author":{"steamid":"76561198326314006","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1565837233},"language":"schinese","review":"人进房 就闪退，服务器贼不稳定。","timestamp_created":1503300803,"timestamp_updated":1503300803,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500330328941345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34389743","author":{"steamid":"76561198268273406","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":27089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":244,"playtime_at_review":3780,"last_played":1660529185},"language":"koreana","review":"시작한 지 2주 된 유저입니다. 친구들과 함께 매일같이 즐겁게 플레이하고 있어요.\n처음에는 고객 평가란에 '비매너유저', '버그', '불안정한 서버' 등의 문제로 인해, 부정적 의견들이 많아서, 읽고 구매를 꽤 망설였었는데, 구매 후인 지금은 하루도 빠지지 않고 플레이할 정도로 무척 좋아하는 게임이 되었습니다. 앞에 언급한 문제들이 해결된 것은 아니나, 어느 정도 커버할 수 있을 정도로 즐겁고 원활하게 진행되는 판이 더 많습니다.

The balance and exploits leave something to be desired. Visually and conceptually the game is pleasing and enjoyable and I don’t regret picking up or continuing to play this game. I enjoy this take on a horror/thriller style of game. Though I am only 70+ hours in I have already started to see a trend though, and it’s something that makes the game hard to play and its due to the number of exploitable parts in the gameplay.\n\nThe environments, most of them, have several spots in them that have what is considered a “Safe Zone”. This is a spot that is almost guaranteed to make it impossible to catch a survivor regardless of the bloodlust effect that is gained by the killer. It only takes a miss step by the survivor to get hit by the killer but in high level play this is unlikely to occur and I have been stuck in these loops often as the killer, where you will get pulled into a “Safe Zone” and if you disengage to chase another you will be pulled into another one quite easily. That and if you encounter a group of survivors that do nothing but hover around each other, catching one person and hooking them often leads to that person getting free quickly and before you know it they have all somehow managed to escape as even if you do manage to get someone in a “Save Zone”, this is only a distraction, this coupled with a few select over powered survivor perks and the killer just isn’t winning. This is only on high level play though that the survivors become nearly unstoppable.\n\nIn low level play, often times being the survivor becomes the difficult part, the game swings into the killers favor as your perks aren’t that good just yet and often times it is hard to pull one over on the killer, that being said the “Camping Killer” strategy is far too easy to preform, hook a survivor and just stand there or walk in a 10x10 area so you can get anyone that gets close to the hooked survivor. It doesn’t take much either as the survivors are meant to help each other. And before anything else is said I’m not even going to cover the body blocking exploit.\n\nWhile the game is fun and enjoyable when you have a group of people who want to enjoy a game for the thrill over winning more often than not you get the situation of “I just want to win”. This means you get far too many toxic players exploiting the game to make sure they win and you end with one or more players having a bad time, and it happens far too often from what I have seen.\n\nFinal note: The game is great fun but often times you have to do the game in short bursts or know your limits for punishment as far as toxic players are concerned. It is a wonderful game to try and get into over all its fun but in the end, there is a lot of tweaking that needs to get done on a game that has been released for over a year now. But I still say play the game and enjoy it as much as you can, there are very few games that does this kind of atmosphere right and that is where the game excels.\n\nTL;DR\nFun game, wonderful atmosphere for a horror game but the exploits and player toxicity is there in large amounts.","timestamp_created":1503291038,"timestamp_updated":1503291038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34387968","author":{"steamid":"76561198316134206","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1539430499},"language":"thai","review":"อยากได้อะไรใหม่ๆ มากกว่านี้","timestamp_created":1503290346,"timestamp_updated":1503290346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34387664","author":{"steamid":"76561198306609226","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":174236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34883,"last_played":1659270441},"language":"german","review":"Meine erste Review entstand nach knappen 500/600 Stunden, zu einem Zeitpunkt in der es mehr Lobbysimulator als Gameplay war. Mittlerweile habe 2000 Stunden Spielzeit mehr und kann einiges sagen.\n\nDieses Spiel hat zwar einen Suchtfaktor, aber die Entwickler verderben den ganzen Spaß. Es ist leider sehr traurig wie sich das Spiel entwickelt hat. Man wartet teilweise sehr lange auf Patches die nötig sind! Es wurden Server angekündigt, damit die Killer nicht mehr die Hosts sind und siehe da, Hits sind nicht mehr legitim, Killer sind verbuggt ohne Ende, Alpha Wände sind auch vorhanden (teilweise die die eigentlich \"entfernt\" wurden). Mit den Servern kamen auch teilweise die tollen Lobbysimulatoren zurück, aber wenn wir schon bei den Lobbysimulatoren sind. MATCHMAKING! Ich bin jede Season im High Rank unterwegs und frage mich immer wieder wieso bekommt man als Rot Rangler Leute rein die im Rang 20 bis 13 rum tanzen? Auch die Gegenpartei tanzt des öfteren in so einem niedrigen Rang rum... Von der Balance in dem Spiel fangen wir gar nicht großartig an, außer mit den Worten dass es keine Balance gibt und sie nie geben wird, da immer eine und dieselbe Seite gepusht wird! Survivor werden stärker und starke Killer werden so generft dass man sie leider Gottes in die Tonne entsorgen kann.

Oh boy do I have things to say about this clown fiesta of a game.\n\nThis is a game stuck is perpetual state of constant brokeness. Whether it's balance and just spaghetti code, I've never seen it in a stable state. Sure it's seen darker times and it's seen better times, but it's never not been broken.\n\nI hate this game. I really do. It has put me in mental states which I didn't think a game was capable of putting me in. I've met the dregs of humanity playing this game. I've played games with notoriously toxic communities. 500 hours in overwatch, an admittely brief stint in cs:go, etc. But holy shit, these games have nothing on Dead by Daylight. Particularly survivor mains. Most killer mains I meet are pretty chill. But survivor mains are actual scum. These are the most dense, sweaty, petty scum-lords on this plain of oblivion. Songs will be sung about the treachery of these nasty motherfuckers in the years to come. If you dare play killer in a way they deem ill manner (aka play the game as intended) these people open of the gates of hell on you in the post game chat. But it doesn't end there, these people don't just wish death upon your loved ones in the post game chat no no no. These people will leave comments on your profile expressing all the same wonderful rhetoric you'll soon get accustomed too. Some will even go as far as to add you as friends in order just to get another chance to convince you that suicide is the answer. I saved a 10+ minute conversation like this (which I sadly lost when I built a new pc).\n\nNow for those who think I am exaggerating about how downright fucked this community can be. I challenge you to click on my profile, scroll down, and read the 500+ comments on my profile. Before I played Dead by Daylight, I had 3 comments on my profile. Now I have 500+ thanks to the dead by daylight community.\n\n\nSo what of the game? See the game is unbalanced to say the least, it (as in the balance) has been survivor favored for most of the game's existence. Not to say survivors don't have legitimate reasons to complain, they do. But hot damn they got it easy compared to killers. Killers serve a primarily reactionary role. Most killers in this game are incapable of making plays and rely on the survivors to make mistakes in order to win. Meaning that if the survivors do the objective and play optimally, most killers have no way of dealing with it. The two meta killers Nurse and Billy are a bit exception to this role. Nurse more so than Billy. Billy can make plays and better pressure the survivors with his chainsaw and Nurse requires the survivors to completely change the way they play in order to deal with because of her ability to go through walls and ignore pallets. But for the other 10+ killers? It's just a game of capitalizing on the survivors' incompetency and if they aren't incompetent, well.....you just kinda lose and you just kinda have to deal with it. And if they are stupid and get themselves killed in a especially stupid way, expect to hear the sound of meaty sausage fingers slapping on greasy mechanical keys as they type out 10 reasons you should consider necking yourself.\n\ntl:dr play killer if you enjoy masochism.\n\nAs a side note, the devs are.....very stupid. Like how are these people even devs? If you want an example, they didn't and still haven't added in advanced graphical settings because they are afraid that it may \"give some people an unfair advantage\". So enjoy having only the option between  a low, medium, high, and ultra graphical settings because all those people with good rigs would certainly gain an advantage by adding loads of visual clutter to their screen in a game that relies on somewhat heavily on stealth right? That's the type of memery you can expect from behavior. They're really fucking stupid.\n\nThe redeeming quality of this game is that the entire concept of a 4v1 asymmetical horror is so good and so alluring. I mean when this game is fun, it's incredible. It's just the shit you put up between the fun. It also helps that this game has no competition.\n\nSo do I recommend Dead by Daylight? Yeah. Kinda. I'd get the base game on sale and try it out before you spend anymore of your mom's credit card. And if you are depressed, suicidal, or just thin-skinned, then just don't even bother. This community chew you up and shit you out.\n\nBut I made this review to let people like you, that other rando, that kid who is too young to be playing m-rated games exactly what they're getting into. And maybe it's for me too. Talking about this game has been like a form of theropy for me. Because I am in an abusive relationship with this game and it beats me everytime I boot it up. Hell, even my pc makes weird noises and heats up when I play this as if its asking: \"why the fuck am I being forced to run this dumpster-fire?\".\n\nSo yeah, there you go. Dead by Daylight in the perspective of me. I hope you're happy.","timestamp_created":1503256349,"timestamp_updated":1554286603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":17,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34379191","author":{"steamid":"76561198271920307","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":31312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1505,"last_played":1658368454},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1503252400,"timestamp_updated":1630179338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34378076","author":{"steamid":"76561198078342609","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1535052029},"language":"french","review":"Hunters

67 hours and noticed very few bugs, like sometimes in the matchmaking the killer leaves right when you join so you just get instantly kicked out, but that isnt even really a bug.\nand the whole \"too many campers/pallet loopers\" thing? camping is about one of the most easily counterable strategies in the game because if they are camping then you can just get all the generators and open the door, and by then the guy who is being camped is usually still alive. you can then just save him, take a hit, and run to the exit. pallet looping isnt easily counterable unless you play as huntress or nurse who can throw axe and teleport, however you can still counter it if you are another killer by destroying the pallet, they might get away, but you can just follow their tracks and they can never use

will say for now that the recommendation is yes. It seems to be a solid game however that being said alot of negative is going to follow. This review is mostly for players like me who came to the game very late in its release.\n\n\nThe game that grew to popularity from youtubers seems to be a bit more designed for fun with friends than general play. There is almost no semblance of balance and the progression system seems to be a bit awful. It is procedurally generated so you never know what you will get at what level in the blood web. It also seems to have no match making so if you are a new player this is one of many ways the game hates you. You will play against people with insane amount of perks and skills that far suprass your own. Never giving you a chance to learn other than being repeatedly curb stomped by much higher rank opponents.\n\nAs for the killer I highly suggest new players start as survivor for a long period before attempting because of the above reason. New players that start as a killer (such as me) and play against people with 200+ hours in this game I was lucky to land several hits really. Although I will say these survivors were amazing people and super polite which is why I stuck with the game. Minus the small toxic community this game has a VERY helpful group of people behind it which is suprising with modern gaming. \n\nThe balance in this game is awful. However that being said there also does not need to be a harmonious balance in a game like this. My first few games as killer I took wraith because invisible sounded amazing. Then because of advice I went and tried trapper. It is night and day. Trapper is simply amazing compared to the loud tolling of the bell with negates the point of invisibility.  The survivors and their perks also are insanely different and some of them when played by someone competent are just so hard to truly stop with the amount of time they can waste from a killer. And as with all games the newer killers are quite strong especially for a period after release.\n\n\nNow that the negative is aside some huge positives-\nthe community is amazing I cannot stress this enough.\n\nThe game does reward you for failing to escape which is helpful for new players because it means we will eventually come to stand with the multi perk players without relying on a hard carry.\n\nBeing a killer is quite fun truthfully which is the point of the game, to have fun.\n\nThe level design is actually a little more varied than I expected from a game like this.\n\nThe killers are feel very different as do the survivors. It is quite amazing and a bigger change than just looks.\n\n\n\nMy one and only pure negative in the game is also for new players- daily rituals\n\nWhen you are new. Some of them are simply impossible. Anything that says escape three times is immedietly trashed. I have yet to play a game where even one person has survived so why would I even do this? Most of the rituals are simply not something that can be done by new players. Simply creating a larger gap between the new players and veterans.\n\n\nOverall however the game is fun. Which is all that matters. That being said meet some nice people from the game and play with them.","timestamp_created":1503168515,"timestamp_updated":1503168515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533898293972015381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34356294","author":{"steamid":"76561198409255393","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1640131291},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom \n","timestamp_created":1503167297,"timestamp_updated":1503167297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34356006","author":{"steamid":"76561198016648778","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":123427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123427,"last_played":1640330586},"language":"english","review":"game for only killers, not 4vs1, 0vs1 because survs suck","timestamp_created":1503166355,"timestamp_updated":1640331149,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34355597","author":{"steamid":"76561198330373031","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":9416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1619904292},"language":"brazilian","review":"Incrível!

It is beyong aggravating, however, victory is soooo sweet! It takes about 10-15 levels before you start performing better due to perks, items, and addons. The game is not very intuitive so it takes a lot of failure to become successful. After 14 hours I am now winning more than losing, but I still have some rough runs. The community in this game is dope, and if you have friends who play I would highly recommend utilizing discord. My only gripe now is that the Doctor is OP as fuck. Doesn't change how awesome this game is!\n\n1st Update: After another 4 hours of game play, I'm still extremely frustrated with this game. The art is amazing, the controls are okay, but there is no balance whatsoever. In a coop game like this, that has to be the most important thing. Right now, the survivors seem to have a major edge. To name just a few major issues: \n\n1) NO FUCKING CHAT IN A COOPERATIVE GAME. You will play against people who are on discord and can coordinate better. This is giving a major boost to those who have friends who play this. I have a couple folks who play, and we demolish everytime because of this.\n\n2) As a monster, when you hit a survior they get boosted away from you AND you have about a 3 second delay where you savor the attack. It needs to be one or the other, not both. This gives the survivors way too much of a chance to get away.\n\n3)  Excape attempts from hooks only provide a 4% success rate. This should be around 10-15% considering it speeds up the process of the entity hooking you.\n\n***If you are going to play, I would suggest going to the help/tutorial section. The game should start with the tutorial, but they just throw you into it making it a bit frustrating at first.***\n\n1st  POST: Meh... there is no balance. My first run I started up 3 generators and escaped with little trouble. The next 2 rounds I died within 2 minutes of start. I was hoping for a horror game like this, but with more of a challenge on both ends, and no stacking against one or the other. As it stands now, I'm not liking the game. Visually it is dope. The mechanics are not to my liking. You get out run by the monsters, it isn't hard for them to search for you like the hints say, and the meter to struggle out of their grasps is insanely long. Needs more work. I might revisit. As of now, I paid $20 and feel like I wasted $15 of it.","timestamp_created":1503163487,"timestamp_updated":1503623032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497110545635223389","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34354305","author":{"steamid":"76561198132786550","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":172880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1234,"playtime_at_review":6186,"last_played":1660601531},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego muy poco begginer friendly, es cierto que existe un MMR interno pero eso al final no se ve en partidas reflejado, vi las partidas de un amigo mío que empezó a jugar y no se veía ese equilibrio que nos prometían con el MMR\n\nA nivel de balance hay personajes que tienen un poder base demasiado fuerte mientras que hay otros que tienen un problema más que un poder(ejemplo: hillbilly)\n\nanyways no está mal echar partidas de survi tbh, jugar killer no está mal pero según el personaje se recomienda ir con la mentalidad de que posiblemente todos no mueran porque volviendo a lo de antes, no es begginer friendly\n\na modo subjetivo añado que necesita modos de juego(por ejemplo unranked para probar builds), demos(para grabar las partidas ocurridas) y algún incentivo más allá de los puntos para jugarlo","timestamp_created":1503161183,"timestamp_updated":1657035476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34354233","author":{"steamid":"76561198395435042","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7736,"last_played":1635096344},"language":"thai","review":"อยากให้เกมส์มีการพูดคุยกันขณะเล่น","timestamp_created":1503160953,"timestamp_updated":1503160953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34353281","author":{"steamid":"76561198385123615","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":59208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30275,"last_played":1593357742},"language":"russian","review":"игра класс и графика супер обновы скорые токо мне прогрес слили но потом верну бп!\n","timestamp_created":1503158128,"timestamp_updated":1503158128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34352988","author":{"steamid":"76561198394325028","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":94901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51927,"last_played":1569426905},"language":"russian","review":"Dead By Daylight - это:\n- Когда ты взял престиж, но потом вспомнил, что у тебя были блуди пати\n- Когда тебя фейскемпят из-за 360\n- Когда абузят баг на кротусе, а потом пишут что ты нуб\n- Когда ты летаешь по карте со скоростью флэша\n- Когда ты спокойно чинишь генератор, без сердцебеения и колыбельной, и тут тебя хитует топор\n- Когда в СВФ ищет лобби час\n- Когда ты заАФКашил, а тебя уже повесили\n- Когда слепишь маньяка на последних секундах фонаря\n- Когда вся тима взяла топ итемы, аддоны и офферинги, а маньяк ливнул\n- Когда маньяк взял красный топор, а ты ливнул\n- Когда из профиля ты узнаешь многое о себе и своих родителях\n- Когда сбросили ранги, и тебя не спасают с крюка в 5 метрах, когда маньяка нет рядом\n- Когда попался маньяк 20, который даже не знает как повешать тебя на крюк\n- Когда сделал -4 за 2 минуты, и тебя называют читером\nВообщем, топ игра =)\n\n08.06.2019: Прошло много времени...
