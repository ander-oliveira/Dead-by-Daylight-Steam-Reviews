Just because its the best in its asymmetrical genre doesn't mean its actually good.

I really tried to make all of these things work but Dead by Daylight disappoints harder than a high school drop out taking online courses.

This new patch is extremely awful for Survivor players. While I welcome meta shake-ups (new meta changes) but this patch really Over-nerfed Survivors and Over-buffed Killers. The fun part about Killer is that u will NEVER be punished regardless if u missed hit, missed your power, unable to catch Survivors because you have Bloodlust & other catch-up mechanics to help u. Killers can also put end game build to get free easy kills. Developers encourages Toxic Killers and allows you to camp/tunnel/camp near hook your preys until they can completely out of the game. Just imagine when you are the Survivor, it is not fun at all. Additionally there are many Killer bugs that Dev doesnt want to fix so it is great for Killers BUT the moment they found out a Survivor bug, it will be fixed in no time. To be considered decent Survivor, you need at least 2-3k hours of gameplay and if u wanna be great, probably 6-7k hours and that is provided YOU have the brains. Survivors are not incentivised for most of their gameplay & most of the time, u get facecamped, camp near hook or tunnel. As a new player/average player, u wait 5mins for a game and if u are unlucky, u died within 1min, your chase could last 10 or 30secs. if u cant loop them well, so your interaction is super limited. So do your math to reach a 'decent' player skill. Therefore this game is no longer considered 'fun and casual'. Quit the game because SOLO Q is too awful.","timestamp_created":1651199755,"timestamp_updated":1658715253,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499592602252960205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114643269","author":{"steamid":"76561198128019985","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":879,"last_played":1655003032},"language":"english","review":"boring","timestamp_created":1651199051,"timestamp_updated":1651199051,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114643206","author":{"steamid":"76561199041858617","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":60,"playtime_at_review":32382,"last_played":1659573239},"language":"english","review":"this game is great if you're into having a bad time","timestamp_created":1651198945,"timestamp_updated":1651198945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114643167","author":{"steamid":"76561198918056390","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":104135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":355,"playtime_at_review":102435,"last_played":1660260068},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo decaiu demais.

wouldn't bother unless you're going to buy the DLCs.\nThe DLC characters are the best, especially the killers, some of them basically have no counters at all, so if you know what you're doing as the killer (which requires maybe 1 hr of game practice or less), you cannot be beaten.\nPerhaps in some kind of scenario where all 4 survivors are playing together, know each other, and have a character/map strategy in play. They could win consistently. Otherwise, not really possible.\nA lot of the people that play this are not very intelligent, they don't act tactically, don't hide properly, don't evade properly, so again, if the killer is even half way decent, then you are going to lose the game a lot.\nIt's bad enough where a lot of people don't even bother to try and help you off the hook, I find it's about 50/50 whether or not the first time I get hooked is a death sentence for the match.\nHaving friends helps, but no one plays this game like that any more where they're really trying to win so what ends up happening is a lot of AFK time for blood points meaning there's just no point really.\n\nEDIT:I just played some more and really need to stress again that this game is extremely stupid with just the worst people.\nDid you know that there is no way to communicate with your team in game?\nNo chat.\nNo voice.\nZERO WAYS TO COORDINATE.\nKillers that have played for years and have every unlock are put against noobs that just started and have no unlocks. \nI think it's because almost no one plays the game.\nThe game also doesn't not give you ANY indication of what these abilities do. \nThere is no in-game tool tip telling you what malice is applied to your character.\nYou just have to figure it out for yourself. The only way to find out in game is to play the killer and grind out the levels, discovering the information as you go. Naturally that will take you a few hundred hours to do.\nYou could also completely break the immersion and read about it on the internet all in hopes that it will give you a better chance. I'd imagine that's what most people do.\n\nThe biggest problem I'm having is this:\nHalf the matches are literally killers farming bloodpoints (in game EXP) and they do NOTHING. They are macro'd to attack in place so they don't get disconnected.\nThe other half of games are filled with trolls or idiots who actively sabotage you at worst, or don't do anything to help you.\nAll it takes is one survivor playing poorly to strongly throw the game.\nSave your sanity.\nDO NOT PLAY IT.","timestamp_created":1651158078,"timestamp_updated":1652478335,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114617270","author":{"steamid":"76561199076447933","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5153,"last_played":1657320644},"language":"portuguese","review":"fx\n","timestamp_created":1651157182,"timestamp_updated":1651157182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114616555","author":{"steamid":"76561199101435726","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":88897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3351,"playtime_at_review":61792,"last_played":1660577030},"language":"japanese","review":"バグ、チート、ゲームバランスなど、突っ込みどころは山ほどありますが、結局は面白いゲームです。唯一無二ですね。楽しくプレイしたいだけであればサバイバーを、できればお友達とやるのをオススメします。","timestamp_created":1651156263,"timestamp_updated":1651156263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515247762203216553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114616052","author":{"steamid":"76561199104953085","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1503,"playtime_at_review":9342,"last_played":1660569529},"language":"turkish","review":"aylardır oynadığım tek oyun sıkılmadan oynuyorum.
