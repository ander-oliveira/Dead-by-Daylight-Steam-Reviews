Survivors are all just skins of eachother since they dont have a power like killers and only need perks. Whenever there is a update they always seem to break something else in return (maps,perks,killers). The community is very toxic due to having no communication with random teammates,having meta perks taking over the game, or people just playing certain ways that others dont like (tunneling,camping,farming,ect).Balancing killers powers and survior perks is a issue as well. Probably the biggest issue is the hitboxess. The game takes favor of the killers client side. so while as a survivor it looks like you dodged a killers attack, the killers client shows it hit so the game will make it hit you. This makes it feel like your being punished for reacting to whats on your screen. Just look up youtube videos on the hit boxes and you will see tons of vids about them. I only play this game when my friends want me to as im sick of it. At 20$ you get 3 survivors and 3 killers the rest you will need to buy and level up.","timestamp_created":1603134697,"timestamp_updated":1637182303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77824472","author":{"steamid":"76561198209414141","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1466,"last_played":1654287368},"language":"russian","review":"класс","timestamp_created":1603132338,"timestamp_updated":1603132338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77823829","author":{"steamid":"76561198401298879","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":556,"playtime_at_review":14993,"last_played":1660537914},"language":"english","review":"I've slowly stopped playing this game because the mechanics of the game are just far too oppressive regardless of which side your on. Killers can be bullied hard by survivor abuse of BT/DS/Adrenaline and Gen rushing, this is exacerbated by the fact that if you don't run game stalling tactics as a killer then the game can be rushed by competent survivors. BT/DS/Adrenaline are some of the most aggravating mechanics in the game and really rob you of progress as a killer.\n\nInstead of a minimum of 24 successful hits and 12 pick ups it quickly becomes a minimum of 28 successful hits and 15 pick ups from DS/BT and if Adrenaline actually procs then its a guaranteed esacpe for the survivors. I am surprised these perks are not mutually exclusive or share a global cool down. The fact that BT into BT and into Adrenaline can occur with an additional sprint perk is quite insane. I am surprised survivor perks do not share a global cooldown instead of several different cool downs. The same could apply to killers as well with some of the cheese tactics they can utilize. Like reduced struggle timers for survivors when they get tunneled or a guaranteed escape from the hook if they get rehooked rapidly due to bad survivor play or lame killer tactics. Also, why can the survivors run forever without getting tired? that would be an interesting mechanic where survivors would get tired after running for a certain period.\n\nThe toxic culture of both sides of the aisle definitely adds to the bad blood. Making it \"opt in\" to post game chat would probably be a good change and reduce peoples bad blood kind of like Fall Guys. There's not really a need for post game chat in this game except to talk shit really.","timestamp_created":1603131430,"timestamp_updated":1603131430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77822935","author":{"steamid":"76561198236151744","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7752,"last_played":1623365822},"language":"polish","review":"Porównując grę teraz, a kiedyś, dochodzę do wniosków że gra stawia wyżej killerów, niż survivorów.

Abridged with square brackets.\n\nI wouldn't ordinarily give up on this sort of game after less than 20 hours, let alone presume to review it, but DBD has such such a laundry list of obvious, crippling flaws I just couldn't help myself.\nIt's entirely possible that there's a good game experience to be had here, eventually, but the process of getting there is so punishing and time-consuming that I cannot imagine it being worth the effort. Where to begin?\n\n== QUICKTIME EVENTS\nSome players are cool with these. If you're one of them, skip ahead. [Else don't play survivor]\n\nSee, survivor gameplay is about (1) avoiding the killer, and (2) fixing a bunch of generators, and if you've successfully pulled off 1, the devs don't want you to get bored doing 2 while the killer blunders about on the other side of the map. So they throw a ton of QTEs at you[...] Likewise, they don't want you to get bored if the killer's impaled you on a sacrificial hook [... so you button mash to live].\n\n[You could argue they're not hard, but then why include them? Survivor is Shenmue minus forklifts]\n\n== BROKEN MATCHMAKING\nThe game will _constantly_ match new ([<5 hours]) players up with veterans with hundreds of hours[...]. Bad enough in a symmetrical multiplayer game, but in a 1v4 matchup, with the one being the newbie, it's inexcusable, especially given that (1) [steep learning curve, no practice mode], and that (2) the game is...\n\n== GRIND TO WIN\nWhen you start playing, you'll have a handful of characters unlocked, each of which has one slot into which you can place one of three character-specific level-one (you can swap out perks between rounds). As you play, you'll level up your characters and unlock new perks and slots, and level up existing perks (up to lvl 3). [It's not RPG leveling, it's a loot box system, each level you get a choice of random perks].\n\n[Per-character basis, and very slow. Can grind a ton for] \"teachable\" versions of a character's unique perks, meaning those perks have a chance of appearing in the loot boxes (or ~*bloodwebs*~) of _other_ characters. The right perks on the right characters can be hugely impactful, so if you really want to optimize your characters, you'll have to:\n1. Unlock the characters you actually want to play _and_ the characters whose perks you want to use. This is enough of a hassle on its own, see below (FREEMIUM THAT YOU PAY FOR)\n2. Level the perk characters up until you get teachable versions of the desired perks\n3. Level the play characters up until you find those perks which you've made teachable in step 2, plus any other ultra-rare generic perks you want to use. Three times. Per perk. Per play character.\n\nRemember the teams of veterans I mentioned above? Not only do they [have experience, but they have maxed ultra-rare perks from 3+ different characters]. Meanwhile you're probably rocking 2-3 lower-level, lower-rarity perks from your current character's pool. Which isn't that bad if it doesn't happen too often, a really one-sided match can be a learning experience, and if nothing else it should be over quickly. Except that...\n\n== TOXIC COMMUNITY, NOW WITH ROOT ACCESS\nI know, I know, every multiplayer game has the worst community imaginable, but the degree to which DBD enables obnoxious behavior is mindblowing. It's generally acknowledged that the report system does nothing, which is a problem when bad players (at least ones that play survivor) essentially run the match.\n\nLet's go back to those 4-man hit squads of gold-plated, perked-up survivors you're constantly getting matched against. [They're elite and they can loop (see below)...]They're basically untouchable, and chances are they'll spend the entire match rubbing this in your face, constantly spamming taunts (teabagging etc).\n\nNow, when I say \"the entire match\", you have to bear in mind the match doesn't end until they say so. [No timer, no acceleration mechanisms, if you can't kill them, they decide when the match ends...] or you ragequit, possibly to write a negative Steam review.\n\n== FREEMIUM THAT YOU PAY FOR\n[Game is $30, but most content is $ DLC. Not just cosmetics, 17/21 killers. Can grind for content, but super-slow. No free char rotation, can't try b4 buy]\n\n== ROUND AND ROUND WE GO\nSo, killers in DBD are generally faster than survivors in a straight line, but take a bit of time to build up speed. Survivors are nimbler, able to turn on a dime and reach their top speed pretty much instantly. The idea is for survivors in a chase to bob and weave between obstacles and try to break line of sight with the killer, then fake him out (ducking behind a tall obstacle, then doubling back as he rounds the corner, etc). There are also single-use environmental hazards (conveniently-placed wooden pallets) which survivors can use to get a bit of extra space between them and the killer.\n\nIt's a good design in principle, the problem is that it's a lot easier for survivors to just run in circles around one obstacle, forever. You just find the right obstacle, not too short or long on its major axis, and not too tall (so line of sight is never broken, and there's no room for mindgames), and start running around it, completely negating the killer's speed advantage because he constantly has to change direction to pursue. This is called looping, and it's more or less the game's core emergent element. Some killers have special abilities which allow them break loops, most don't, therefore most killers are essentially useless against competent survivors who play to win.\n\nThe devs have acknowledged that looping wasn't what they had in mind for the game (not a lot of slasher movies about a killer helplessly chasing a victim around a bale of hay forever), so they've taken some measures to mitigate it, mostly in the form of bloodlust, a temporary speed boost which killers get after spending enough time in a chase, but (1) bloodlust is actually more useful in a proper chase than in looping and (2) even with bloodlust, catching up to a survivor in a typical loop takes _forever_, long enough for his teammates to complete half the objectives elsewhere on the map, even longer if the loop has one of the aforementioned disposable pallets. Bloodlust doesn't do enough in one way, and makes the problem worse in another.\n\nSo the best thing you can do as a killer is just walk away the instant a survivor reaches a loopable object, and try to catch some other survivor somewhere between an objective and another loopable object. It's absurd. I realize the game isn't exactly trying to be immersive, but clearly the idea was for killers to pose an actual threat, for them to be something survivors try to avoid, rather than something they can just effortlessly string along if they find the right stretch of rusty cars in the junkyard.\n\n== NO RIGHT WAY TO PLAY\n[...] three things:\n1. Killers hate survivors that loop, [boring and no counterplay]\n2. Survivors hate killers that [camp hooks], for the exact same reason. Survivors also hate \"tunneling\", which is basically camping writ small; instead of making sure a survivor never gets off the hook, you focus on hooking that one survivor again, since each subsequent hook is more effective and requires less time to kill the survivor.\n3. All of these are optimal strategies*.\n\nBasically, if you're playing the game right, you're pissing someone off. The only way for everyone to have fun (which is possible, but far from guaranteed) is to actively subvert the design of the game.\n\n* [Camping only situationally optimal; complex]\n\n== CONCLUSION\n[So yeah]. It can be kind of fun under the right circumstances, and it has some pros, but in the face of all these obvious cons, I really don't think they're worth mentioning. Fundamentally broken across the board, old enough that if the devs were actually commited to fixing it, they would have done so by now. Avoid at all costs.","timestamp_created":1603122975,"timestamp_updated":1603122975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77817203","author":{"steamid":"76561199086993328","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5236,"last_played":1652989779},"language":"turkish","review":"31","timestamp_created":1603122302,"timestamp_updated":1656517770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77816823","author":{"steamid":"76561198995521653","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16717,"last_played":1629567419},"language":"schinese","review":"请解决一下把把玩到一半掉线的问题，一掉线就是惩罚时间真是智障","timestamp_created":1603121732,"timestamp_updated":1603121732,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77816328","author":{"steamid":"76561198317440537","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1624086859},"language":"schinese","review":"我来增加屠夫游戏体验","timestamp_created":1603121067,"timestamp_updated":1603121067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77816271","author":{"steamid":"76561198310439525","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":30676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23260,"last_played":1650379827},"language":"danish","review":"This Game was so fun of me to play its horror its a co-op game i love it!.

There is a whole cast of characters that each have their own initial play style for you to have fun with but you aren't locked down to a character based on the perks. The game is engaging and easy to pick up to the point where coming back from a break in playing is like riding a bike, you don't really forget. Despite the game being out for years the developers are still hard at work improving the game and adding new characters. This game is not really a horror game despite the characters and looks. It rarely feels like a horror game, people are rarely scared of killers and oftentimes you are so busy laughing at shenanigans that you can't be scared. The game is endless fun and enjoyment that you can play for hours on end.\n\nThere are very few downsides. The community is a toxic mess that i can put firmly between being more toxic than Overwatch and less toxic then League of Legends. This makes playing the game without friends a chore sometimes rather than being fun. Killers are toxic to survivors, survivors are toxic to killers. Both sides are super entitled for the most part and think the other side is completely broken. Killers have cheesy ways to play that can all but guarantee a death without any skill from their part and survivors have a huge advantage in the fact that killers can't afford even one mistake against good survivors. There are still game breaking bugs that appear far too much. The ones I personally encounter most is being stuck on a killers shoulder so the killer can't use their abilities or even end the game even with end game collapse. The only way out of that game is if the killer disconnects. It is being worked on as I type this but there is weird hits where the killer clearly didn't connect with a survivor but it hits them regardless. \n\nDespite it's problems I would still recommend the game to anyone at least to try.","timestamp_created":1603116902,"timestamp_updated":1603170976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77813358","author":{"steamid":"76561198449575383","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":7105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3048,"last_played":1636251416},"language":"spanish","review":"Por momentos es un juegaso y por momentos una mierda pero ta bueno","timestamp_created":1603116843,"timestamp_updated":1603116843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77812993","author":{"steamid":"76561198273607317","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":31961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14397,"last_played":1656250855},"language":"german","review":"I think its a really good game!","timestamp_created":1603116351,"timestamp_updated":1603116351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77812803","author":{"steamid":"76561198310826742","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1657488001},"language":"turkish","review":"CAMPLEYEN KATİLLER ORUL ORUL OROSPU COCUGUDUR.\n\nENGELLİ OROSPU COCUKLARI OYUN ICINDE CHAT OLMADIGI ICIN ANNELERINE SOVEMIYORUM EKSI YON","timestamp_created":1603116093,"timestamp_updated":1603116093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77812699","author":{"steamid":"76561199073336293","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":78612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24155,"last_played":1648891798},"language":"schinese","review":"最近的优化做的还好\n\n","timestamp_created":1603115963,"timestamp_updated":1617633531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77812499","author":{"steamid":"76561198887379656","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":544,"playtime_at_review":1534,"last_played":1660025578},"language":"russian","review":"Покупаешь игру за 500 р, а потом должен 100500+ часов тратить на фарм/гринд(называйте как это удобно), чтобы открыть  хотя-бы одного маньяка или сурва Или купи их за донат. А так изначально у тебя на выбор 5 сурвов и 5 манов, хотя в игре раза в 3-4 больше. Но никого не волнует, что ты и так заплатил за игру. Гемплей унылый и скучный, никаких интересных особенностей и режимов, просто 4 сурва vs 1 маньяк. Кстати баланс открыто говоря на стороне маньяков.  В игре ничего не ожидает интересного от слова \"совсем\". Ни хоррора, ни экшена, вообще ничего. Баланс кстати тоже не очень. Я будучи 18 рангом мана без адоннов и с 1 уровнем мана, играл против 3 и 4 рангов сурвов. Найс просто. Совет простой - не покупайте!

Es kann einen absolut süchtig machen, und dennoch ärgert man sich ständig. Über Bugs etwa, die seit Beginn des Spiels vorhanden sind und nie gefixt werden, da die Devs lieber an Skins arbeiten. Das Balancing ist ebenfalls katastrophal, das Crossplay war für alle PC-Spieler ein Downgrade.\nAber das allerschlimmste ist die Community. Wie in jedem Spiel, wo sie dabei sind, sind vor allem die osteuropäischen Spieler unglaublich toxisch. Am schlimmsten sind hierbei die Russen. Leider macht exakt diese Community eine Menge der recht hohen Spielerzahl aus, wodurch gleich CS:GO Feeling aufkommt. Wenigstens gibt es keinen Voicechat. Natürlich sind auch andere Spieler toxisch, in diesem Maße jedoch sind mir bisher nur die Osteuropäer untergekommen.\nEDIT: Oh und die Strafe für Disconnect funktioniert \"wIe GePlAnT\". Man wird überhaupt nicht bestraft, wenn mal das Internet rausfliegt oder ähnliche Probleme auftreten. Zeitweise wird man auch nicht bestraft, wenn der Killer nen DC hinlegt, alles funktioniert absolut perfekt. Und es gibt natürlich auch keine Troll Survs, die dann beispielsweise mit dem Killer zusammenarbeiten und sich dann vor den Torschaltern in Position bringen, sodass man das Spiel nicht verlassen kann. Dann gehen sie auch nicht afk und stehen mehrere Stunden da rum, sodass man disconnecten MUSS, wenn man nicht für eine Ewigkeit da drin sitzen will. Und die Skalierung der Strafe von 5min -> 15min -> 1 Std -> 6 Std -> 1 Tag ist natürlich auch super, wenn diese Probleme absolut nie auftreten, überhaupt nicht öfters. Die Server funktionieren perfekt, man wird nicht random aus dem Spiel geschmissen.\n\nFazit: du möchtest abhängig werden von einem verbuggten, contentmäßig doch sehr limitierten, grottig balancierten Spiel mit einer furchtbaren Community werden?
