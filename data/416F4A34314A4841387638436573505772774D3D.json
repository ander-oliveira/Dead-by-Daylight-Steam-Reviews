At first glean the gameplay seems simple but there is a lot of different midmatch scenarios to learn and practise and refine.\nThe Great: Incredible game time value for the dollars spent, lots to master, can get a lot of the content for no additional fees, just takes time to earn. Really fun to play with your friends either in survivor groups or with 5 total in a custom game. Lots of incredible streamers and partners that inform and engage with the playerbase.\nThe Not so Good: Solo Queuing as a survivor can be hit or miss, MatchMakingRating can plateau at a point where you have to conform to the meta or advance no further (they are looking at this)\n\nEasy buy on sale, still acceptable at full price.","timestamp_created":1648881168,"timestamp_updated":1648881168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113201630","author":{"steamid":"76561198999314579","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":26701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1382,"playtime_at_review":2994,"last_played":1660486938},"language":"thai","review":"ก็ดีนะ","timestamp_created":1648878770,"timestamp_updated":1648878770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113201616","author":{"steamid":"76561198054790371","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1648878509},"language":"english","review":"What's so fun about chasing a buncha sweaty kids that just harass you and kite you to hell and back?

are encouraged to camp, game is unomptimized in terms of graphics, can run apex perfectly fine and then i load up one match of this and its like watching a slideshow. ive put 600 hours into this game in 3 months and its very fun but there is some serious work that needs to be done. dead hard doesnt work half the time, ping from east coast to west coast is disgusting, vpn issues havent been worked on. the game is now riddled with subtle cheaters that get slight speed boosts and are never banned for it. it sometimes feels like pips are given out just because they can be. survivors hide in corners and let their team die just to get hatch and rank up for it. we need more things to be done to encourage different play styles that arent just \"hehe tunnel this guy\" and \"hehe hide in corner tunnel my team mate please lol\" but that will never happen because the devs that dont really care about us just say \"its a strategy so it works\". as a matter of fact, my girlfriend and i played against a dev from the game, and he face camped and tunneled. one of the worst players ive seen with one of the least fun strategies in the game. its almost impossible to have any fun or new builds when every killer and survivor are running the same repetitive things every single game. the meta for survivors is and always will be dead hard, borrowed time, decisive strike, and iron will. while for killers it is ruin, bbq, pain resonance and whatever other slow down perk the killer wants to put on. theres lots of variety that could happen but they never work out and theyre never as fun as they could be when every killer is sweating with the best addons and perks, same goes for the survivors with items. queue times are inconsistent and the matchmaking system is one of the worst ive seen. its hard to play the game and not want to just dc sometimes because of team mates/ tunneling killers. not to mention the amount of times you get kicked from games and punished for it because the servers just suck. anyway, the game is fun and i wish it was just better. im probably going to be trapped playing this game forever with the amount of time and money ive put into it, but at this point im wondering if it was even worth it. it feels like every single update the devs somehow make the game play and run

one of the DLC killers if you really want to play them. If you're looking to play this for a really long time, eventually you're going to have to buy all the killers as some of the best perks are locked behind them. Despite this, its really fun at casual levels of play! I don't see myself personally ever looking to get to top level play (I enjoy playing for fun and top level seems extremely difficult to play off-meta). Matches are a wild 50/50 though, at least in my experience. Sometimes you get the sweatiest of teammates who drop connection the minute they get downed and sometimes you have four Megs who all point at you and offer themselves up as sacrifice for your bloodpoints. Be prepared to have to be patient, and for your earlier matches to be wildly inconsistent. Also, trying to learn a new Killer is ridiculously hard because you get matched based on your rank with ALL killers, rather than each killer individually.","timestamp_created":1648832289,"timestamp_updated":1648832289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113172557","author":{"steamid":"76561198853352467","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":37151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":743,"playtime_at_review":24281,"last_played":1660529429},"language":"english","review":"mid","timestamp_created":1648831313,"timestamp_updated":1648831313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113170751","author":{"steamid":"76561198371861617","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":20134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4218,"playtime_at_review":12083,"last_played":1660090605},"language":"english","review":"ba","timestamp_created":1648828753,"timestamp_updated":1648828753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113170465","author":{"steamid":"76561198865624300","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1135,"playtime_at_review":11959,"last_played":1660564495},"language":"schinese","review":"很治愈的一款游戏","timestamp_created":1648828373,"timestamp_updated":1648828373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113170333","author":{"steamid":"76561199101731321","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":42,"playtime_at_review":8035,"last_played":1659928343},"language":"french","review":"Best game honnestly if you like survival.
