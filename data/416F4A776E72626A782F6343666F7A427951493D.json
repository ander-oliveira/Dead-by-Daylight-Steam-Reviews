BHVR, to me, feels like they are starting to not care for the community, treating us like mindless sheep that will just keep playing because it's dbd or nothing, no second game like dbd in the market. They lie to us. They promise us things they cannot deliver. They delay the necessary fixes, like Object of Obsession for 4 years, or Iridescent Head for 3 years, but give us new cosmetics every other week and a fucking new HUD that doesnt fit the theme of the game, is less efficient than the old HUD, looks terrible, takes away the only innovation we had with custom perks, and, above all else, was the most unnecessary change needed. They had a full month between the PTB and release, they heard our feedback, but because the devs are like children and cannot handle criticism, they kept a horrible change in the game. We've endured a whole year of just bad updates, but this one, while content-wise isn't the worst update, the lack of communication and understanding from the devs is dooming this game quickly.\n\nDead By Daylight dies in 2021","timestamp_created":1613034702,"timestamp_updated":1613034702,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590749740600585938","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86387150","author":{"steamid":"76561199032999674","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5996,"last_played":1631973943},"language":"schinese","review":"更新前，玩着贼刺激。更新后，傻逼游戏！谁再买谁煞笔！不推荐！","timestamp_created":1613034698,"timestamp_updated":1613034698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86387077","author":{"steamid":"76561198835194074","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":223,"playtime_at_review":24384,"last_played":1659637520},"language":"schinese","review":"当前版本谁买谁傻缺，人类站着像僵尸，受伤和拉稀找厕所一样。界面ui设计得和劣质手游似的，我获取信息得化身二郎神眼观六路。小丑在制作组爆改之后真就变成小丑，弱的和屎一样，一堆瓶子搞成果粒橙？？\n\n新地图肉制品工厂一改，绝了，安全板加了一堆，长版换成超级加长板，基本每个板子不踢都要命。\n\nui界面和人物姿势没改正常以前此评价不会改变，傻逼zzz","timestamp_created":1613034605,"timestamp_updated":1613034605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86387053","author":{"steamid":"76561198028528805","num_games_owned":467,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1253,"last_played":1657182340},"language":"english","review":"Thanks to new technology this game allows crossplay with the Zoo closest to you so you can play with actual chimpanzees.","timestamp_created":1613034569,"timestamp_updated":1613034569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86386977","author":{"steamid":"76561198853795947","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1645563811},"language":"english","review":"вроде нормально","timestamp_created":1613034467,"timestamp_updated":1613034467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86386945","author":{"steamid":"76561198069999047","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":469,"playtime_at_review":3393,"last_played":1660543278},"language":"english","review":"Not good","timestamp_created":1613034406,"timestamp_updated":1634281802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86386800","author":{"steamid":"76561198196998782","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":66188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1576,"playtime_at_review":61333,"last_played":1660575006},"language":"tchinese","review":"這次改版是怎樣 前不想賺了是不是\n這什麼爛模組 爛UI 最爛的是可以把ESC修機改回來˙嗎\n不改回來一天不玩 什麼垃圾改動","timestamp_created":1613034190,"timestamp_updated":1613034190,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529132604598999023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86386686","author":{"steamid":"76561198872775473","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":23022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1405,"playtime_at_review":3022,"last_played":1659858502},"language":"english","review":"50 Hour: Play this with friends if you wish to have fun.

To top it all off, the \"Second chance\" perks that killers complain so much about have been absolutely destroyed, now I'd have to force a killer to tunnel me in order to have DS function the way I'd want it to.

is by no means a sporadic, or casual review. I have approx. 2k hours playing Dead by Daylight across the Windows Store and Steam versions of the game. I have spent an embarrassing amount of money purchasing all DLCs, cosmetics, rift passes on both platforms, and spent over a year streaming this game and building a community around it on Twitch. Here is my honest review as of Jan 2022.\n\nDead by Daylight at its core is a phenomenal, addictive, and exhilarating game. It stands as king in the a-sym gaming sphere because of its iconic licensed characters and original game design. The highs and lows of this game keep a relatively repetitive structure feeling fresh and exciting for many MANY hours. I love this game more than any other game I have ever played, and don’t regret a single minute I’ve spent playing it. But for the reasons below, I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nI have never, in over a decade of gaming, seen a developer that is so incredibly out of touch with their game and community as a whole. BHVR has and seemingly will continue to do everything in their power to frustrate, ignore, and disappoint its player base. DBD has an almost insurmountable grind associated with it. Players with thousands of hours STILL are not able to completely perk out their survivors and killers, and every three months another killer/survivor is added. This is a huge barrier to entry for new players and a massive frustration for seasoned players. The dev team has done nothing and has no plans to do anything to alleviate the insurmountable time players have to invest to essentially play the game at full potential - not to mention that some of the best perks in the game are locked behind DLC paywalls.\n\nAside from the insane grind to unlock perks for your killers and survivors, MMR/SBMM was added to the game. This has been a catastrophic failure, resulting in complete randomness and chaos in matchmaking at all levels. An invisible number based on arbitrary scorekeeping supposedly determines the “skill” of the players you play with and against. The vast majority of the community has been incredibly vocal against the introduction of MMR, but it has fallen on deaf ears with BHVR as always. \n\nSo far I’ve mentioned the ridiculous grind to unlock perks, the MMR system that actively works against you earning points to progress by making your matches completely unpredictable, but the most egregious failures of DBD comes in the game breaking and constant bugs within the gameplay. In a game based on instant reaction, environmental awareness, and critical moments the amount of game breaking bugs that stay untouched and unmentioned for MONTHS is completely unacceptable and disheartening. These bugs aren’t small and can range from audio issues, broken maps, hit detection, desync, non-functional perks and powers, etc. \n\nI’ve listed the major issues that I feel are worth touching on in depth. But I also would like to just rapid fire mention a few more of the endless issues with this game and its development team.\n\n-In-game events that are lackluster and seem to only exist to promote the sale of more overpriced cosmetics.\n\n-Bloodpoint codes as “apologies” for massive development errors that are often awarded in amounts that almost mock the difficulty of progressing in the game.\n\n-Their ambassador program, called the Fog Whispers. A program that actively shuns criticism, constructive or otherwise, and supports only content creators who blindly praise the game and pretend to be ignorant of its flaws. Not to mention those selected to be Fog Whisperers seem to be chosen based on BHVR meeting a diversity quota, rather than content creators who have worked for years to create high quality content and build great communities based around the game.\n\n-Complete lack of creativity and game balance with new killers and new survivor perks that create un-fun and extremely frustrating gameplay.\n\n-A progression structure that provides both a time and money barrier to entry. You shouldn’t need over 500 hours to succeed consistently and approaching over $200 to have all characters unlocked.\n\n-Out of touch devs who very obviously do not play their game and actively mock their player-base.\n\n-Rampant and unaddressed hacking that can result in players being held hostage for hours, whether by the hacker or by the games ridiculous multiplicative ban system for disconnecting from matches.\n\n-Post-game chat censorship that censors survivor names, random words, and harmless phrases, while still allowing death threats, hate speech, and unspeakable insults with no consequences for doing so.\n\n-Matchmaking times that exceed the duration of the match itself.\n\nI could keep going but I know very few, if any, will read this. To be honest, I’m mostly writing this review as a form of closure myself and to leave DBD to rest. I hope this game receives the development and support it deserves.

The core experience has been enjoyable enough over these past few years, enough for me to sink in nearly 900 hours as at writing this review.\n\nHowever, as it is currently, I cannot recommend it to anyone, the latest update 4.5.0 has just changed things in a way that have made things pretty unsatisfying. While they've changed the UI slightly since 4.5.0 dropped, it still doesn't look quite as visually pleasing as what the old UI did, and while actually having the player icons show the character each person is playing, it does make checking on survivor health and status less clear than it was originally. Additionally, the changes to the animations honestly don't feel great. The actually motions look weirdly glide-y now and don't look quite as fluid in my opinion, and at their worst they actually pretty much ruin the ability to do some higher skill survivor techs such as 360's to try to evade killer hits. This patch has also introduced a number of new bugs to the game that, while some of the bugs have been fixed, many are still recurring and constant issues, and there are still bugs from several major patches ago that are still persistent issues.\n\nAlso on the core gameplay side of things it in general now feels extremely campy (probably the worst it's ever been), with no systems to de-insentivise this (and the latest killer honestly emphasising it). There is legit nothing fun about being downed by a killer and then forced to watch for the next minute as the killer never goes further than 30 feet from you while your teammates gather close by waiting for an opportunity to rescue you that will never come. This wouldn't be an issue if this were only an occasional factor, but this is almost every other game at this point, even among the higher ranked players.\n\nSadly, this game just doesn't feel particularly enjoyable for me to play anymore.","timestamp_created":1613023541,"timestamp_updated":1614670518,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86380028","author":{"steamid":"76561198430573287","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9766,"last_played":1629262555},"language":"schinese","review":"屠夫攻击判定太离谱，距离两个身位被一刀砍翻，我真不知道人类怎么玩","timestamp_created":1613023495,"timestamp_updated":1613023495,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86380022","author":{"steamid":"76561198993832391","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":49942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48868,"last_played":1659128345},"language":"english","review":"i'll drop some honest stuff about this game.\n\npros:\n+its a horror game and it has shit ton of licensed characters. resident evil, silent hill, evil dead, halloween, nightmare on elm street, texas chainsaw massacre, scream, saw, etc. (ofc you buy the entirety of this roster seperately. not with the game.)\n+design of this game is very good. visuals (i don't mean graphics) and music, all are excellent.\n+can be fun with friends.\n\ncons (this will be fun)\n-this game is all about tom and jerry chases. it stops getting scary after few hours because you'll notice you already know the gimmick of the game.\n-no singleplayer. no way to play it offline except tutorial bots, but you have to be ONLINE for that. no gameplay mode where you have free roam on maps.\n-story is barebones and hardly have anything to do with gameplay. there are some stories on text in section called archives. the fact that they're in archives which is more about taking in-game challenges or buying a GAMEPASS (lmao) literally overshadows the backstory of this game. honestly this is terrible and the game is absolutely more boring because of this.\nother than that you get this: \"This evil entity puts humans and a killer in a place, he watches them die then eats them.\"\n\n-this game is UNBALANCED.. survivor perks are overpowered. (my entire gametime went to playing survivor.) i just show pity to killer mains lol\n-killers always have to camp to stand a chance (don't blame them) and always have pressure on them. survivors will always have advantage over killers. survivors scare killers in this game, not vice versa.\n-solo survivor is even worse because you can do a solo performance to an extent. if your teammates are shit and you're not voicechatting with friends, you're done. there's no other way to communicate with your teammates other than using 2 crappy in-game emotes of \"pointing\" and \"waving towards yourself/come with me\". that just doesn't do everything.\n-cosmetics are overpriced. most of time you buy these with \"in-game progress money\".\n-most of licensed characters are also sold DLC you'll pay for it extra. now you'll think \"why did i pay for the base game if i don't get 75% of the roster at start?\" Because this is dead by daylight. they can't be bought with in-game money.\n-speaking of in-game money, it's EFFIN grindful. you'll play en entire week and you'll collect money just for one item or something.\n-another in-game thing is bloodpoints aka XP, it's also very grinding and it takes forever to find the perk you want in randomized progress bar. (its called bloodpoint web) this is the most grinding part of the game.\n\nnow the social and community problems of this game:\n-overly support of LGBT and pinkwashing. this got out of the hand after they announced the rainbow flag and game became more of politically representing what you support. nobody gives a crap to this. but BHVR seems to be obsessed with this and the game SUFFERS from it. this is one of the biggest things that can push you off from this game. honestly i, myself don't even know why this game got so many lgbt players. it's just a bad horror game.\n-there's a clear miscommunication between players and developers. hardly any developer working for this game knows how this game works. perk changes, HUD changes, survivor face model changes, animation changes, map visual changes, millions of consistent bugs.. developers will do everything you do NOT want. they'll instead ask charity for lgbt on twitter. (aka pinkwashing)\n-the changes they make are mostly focused on one audience. it's.. of course twitter audience. they're crybaby survivors and they're making the game incredibly annoying for killers.\n-post-game chat. there's obviously a frustration for killer players to go against 4 survivors because they know the core and every inch of the game, so the post-game chat will be either killer complaining how unfair the game is (they're right) or survivors complaining the way killer played to win. player-base is absolutely oblivious of each other's gameplay and they're focused to boasting about their W more than having fun.\n\n-you do NOT have FUN in this game. never, ever buy it. don't try it for free on Epic Games. never support this game, never let anyone even know about this game.","timestamp_created":1613023487,"timestamp_updated":1638780882,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86379781","author":{"steamid":"76561198405541484","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2141,"last_played":1655064819},"language":"russian","review":"Мансить
