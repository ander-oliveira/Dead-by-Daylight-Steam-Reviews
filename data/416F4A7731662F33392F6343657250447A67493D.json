It's competitive and gives plenty of adrenaline rushes that fully excite you when you get something insane done. This could be opening a gate, finishing a generator as the killer pulls up, maybe getting rid of a hex totem, it's always fun. The main issue is a lot of the killers and the main one being Leatherface and he's a complete asshole. The fact this killer is designed to camp a hook and down multiple survivors with one ability is pathetic and a lazy way of completing a game. You either ignore your teammate and rush gens or help your teammate and end up getting more punished anyways. This killer isn't balanced and has way to much pressure against hooks against multiple survivors that ultimately makes it unfair. I understand this killer isn't played much compared to killers such as Freddy, Hag, Huntress, e.t.c but, this killer has a serious issue that is making certain games very unenjoyable due to his insta down mechanic. You could vault a window three times, pallot him twice, juke him with a dead hard, none of this matters because as soon as you get hooked, you're fucked unless your teammates are competent. Majority of your games that will not be the case though, DBD has very poor match making occasionally. You could be rank 1, getting paired with rank 18s. Which furthers this problem of Leatherface because if you're going against a rank 1 Leatherface and you're team has no clue what they're doing, you automatically lose because this guys mechanic is so unfair. The only reason anyone actually buys this killer is simply for his B&Q perk. Please make him either purchasable with in-game currency or just fix his hook camping.","timestamp_created":1614659523,"timestamp_updated":1614659523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87706529","author":{"steamid":"76561199022932648","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":261,"playtime_at_review":12214,"last_played":1660585364},"language":"portuguese","review":"Melhor jogo","timestamp_created":1614658551,"timestamp_updated":1614658551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87705405","author":{"steamid":"76561198351625822","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":14414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13475,"last_played":1658790011},"language":"english","review":"sam","timestamp_created":1614656406,"timestamp_updated":1614656406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87704203","author":{"steamid":"76561199115421444","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1658130406},"language":"english","review":"really fun once you get into it.

Survivors work on objectives (called generators) to escape, and the killer must stop them. This can seem like a simple concept, but there are many survivors to choose from, which all have their own unique perks. Killers also have their own unique perks, but also have powers they use in game to help them get the job done. There are 15 maps and some have different variations. Generators and some tiles are randomly generated, which keeps the game feeling fresh.\n\nBalance can have it's issues sometimes, but the community has shown that it can adapt to most of the changes made to the game. I have personally encountered a few bugs, some game breaking, others just being a hefty laugh, but none of it affects my overall experience that I've had.\n\nAfter 1000 hours, this game is amazing. It's a high skill cap game, but don't let that deter you. I highly recommend playing with friends, or even random online people in the Dead by Daylight discord.

For every few frustrating things the game throws at its players, there is a moment of excitement and unique type of fun that very few PvP games have. Despite DBD's glaring problems and questionable decisions made by the developers, there is still a dedicated playerbase that grinds this game pretty hard. Many killers have high skill ceilings with unique abilities and interesting playstyles needed to sacrifice survivors. Additionally, survivors can be particularly exciting to play as when engaged in a cat-and-mouse-like chase with killers.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned before, this game has serious design problems. For example, killers can simply hook one survivor and camp them for the entire match. This causes everyone in the game to receive very few Bloodpoints and score. This makes it nearly impossible for anyone, including the killer, to rank up in that match. Why playing like this isn't considered griefing and isn't bannable is a mystery to me.\n\nThere are many problems like this with the design of the game (ex: broken uncounterable killers, unbalanced survivor items and perks, etc.) which cause many high-rank players to abide by a hidden \"honor code,\" in which they attempt to win while not bringing overpowered items/perks and to not camp/tunnel players all game. Behavior Interactive needs to find solutions to these design issues instead of pushing out buggy updates that tend to break map designs and pointlessly rework killers no one complains about. \n\nDespite this, the game is still fun. The salt from the playerbase is a little unfairly bloated, but it is still somewhat deserved. I am not sure if the developer's priorities align with the community's wishes. Dead by Daylight is very fun for new players who are looking for an asymmetrical PvP experience to play with friends, and the majority of the DLC is worthwhile. There is a decent, yet grindy, progression system in place that will keep you playing for a while. But beware: the community is weirdly toxic for its size, and high rank games will feel very unbalanced due to large amounts of skill discrepancy.","timestamp_created":1614648265,"timestamp_updated":1615235717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87700481","author":{"steamid":"76561198122161230","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1643562432},"language":"spanish","review":"loco el asesino siempre es muy gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay","timestamp_created":1614647840,"timestamp_updated":1614647840,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87699190","author":{"steamid":"76561199018015623","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":100397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":653,"playtime_at_review":89198,"last_played":1660356486},"language":"english","review":"-Buggy\n-Toxic players\n-Bad devs\nFuck this game and everyone who plays it","timestamp_created":1614645551,"timestamp_updated":1639630726,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51086956262588501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87698789","author":{"steamid":"76561199052585535","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1637629646},"language":"brazilian","review":"JOGO FODA","timestamp_created":1614644825,"timestamp_updated":1614644825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87698392","author":{"steamid":"76561199111794788","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":44208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11707,"last_played":1656870823},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom esse jogo é encrivel  ele n e facil de se enjoar e tambem e muito divertido , muitos killers de filmes e etc so a hit box e meio bugada, mais tirando isso  ele e mt bom eu recomendo","timestamp_created":1614644116,"timestamp_updated":1614644116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87697880","author":{"steamid":"76561198077580736","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":26847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":299,"playtime_at_review":12668,"last_played":1660518612},"language":"english","review":"Yeah, I like this game.","timestamp_created":1614643214,"timestamp_updated":1614643214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500993072986602783","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87697174","author":{"steamid":"76561198149403511","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2396,"last_played":1647431312},"language":"brazilian","review":"Peguei o jogo para só jogar com os amigos, mas o jogo atendeu até mais das expectativas que eu tinha com ele.
