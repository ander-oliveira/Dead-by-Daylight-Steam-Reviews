NOOOO GOD! NO GOD PLEASE NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!![/h1]\n\nAnd here’s why:\n\n\"4v1 cooperative competitive horror game\". Sounds great, right? It is. I like game mechanics, I like to play hide and seek with killer, trying to outwit him. But I don’t recommend it. Don't even play the game, if you have free copy. It's just horrible.\n\nMain reason of this negative review - developers. Maybe they are lazy, maybe they are students, or maybe they are just a bunch of monkeys, which press the buttons with no porpoise. Two month passed since release and it’s still has a bugs, that it had at launch: UI bugs, such as inverted state of buttons, or displaying button promts when it’s shouldn’t be displayed; unhandled connection errors – if you connecting to friend lobby through invite, but friend has left the lobby, you will be loading forever; objects state bugs – sometimes you cannot interact with another player (even if you are killer) when you should, or your character doesn’t hold items in a proper way, so you cannot use them (and, thanks god, lose); matchmaking… “Failed to join a game”, “No games found”, *returns to main menu*… You cannot just press ready and wait for game. Matchmaking WILL crash and you must press again, and again, and again… If you get lucky you find game with couple of crashes. But you don’t. You need to use offerings to developers to boost your chances. But seriously, they said that matchmaking system is too fragile to make changes to it. Nuff said.\n\nI like game content, but I don't like technical execution of this content.

eggs are normally brined duck eggs. Chinese people use them to make moon cakes（月餅）, glutinous rice dumplings (粽子) and many other dishes. Some families I know, like to steam salted eggs that go with congee for breakfast.\n\nIn my good old days, salted duck eggs are often sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. Nowadays, the producers might know how to do marketing and give the humble salted eggs a nicer presentation. The salted duck eggs I come across here recently almost have the salted paste removed, wrapped in plastic, or vacuum packed. The best salted eggs should have a briny aroma, translucent egg white, with the yolk bright orange-red in colour. The yolk that releases oil after being cooked is considered as a high quality product.\n\nSadly, here in Australia, it’s quite hard to find fresh duck eggs, yet it’s much easier to get some cooked ones. Weird, isn’t it? If any fresh duck eggs put on rack for sale in any Asian grocery stores, they would be gone very quickly.\n\nAs I have been missing and craving this homey food very much, I brined a dozen and then cooked several traditional Chinese dishes with the salted eggs. Would you like to know what dishes I cooked? I'll post them in a series later on.\n\n\nI was glad to hear that Penny of Addictive and Consuming and Trix of Tasty Trix would host an International Egg Incident Party. Lucky enough I can manage myself to participate this time. Here in this post, I share an easy way to make salted eggs at home. This time I used chicken eggs. If you can find fresh duck eggs, that’s even better. But I found the end result of using chicken eggs was very satisfied. This recipe was tested for many times. Not long before, I shared this recipe with my Chinese readers, all salted egg lovers were fascinated and many of them tried it on the next day they read my recipe with satisfied outcomes. Here’s a picture of my fan's salted egg. She shared her joy with me when she successfully made some delicious salted eggs.\n\nHomemade Salted Eggs \n\nIngredients:\n12 duck eggs (or chicken eggs)\n1 cup sea salt (or rock salt)\n4 cups water\n1 tbsp Shaoxing wine\n1 star anise\n2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns\n\n\nMethod:\nRinse the eggs and drain well. Set aside.\nPut water and salt in a saucepan. Add star anise and Szechwan peppercorns. Bring it to a boil. Once the salt completely dissolves, turn off the heat. Let cool completely.\nPour in the wine and stir well.\nUse a clean glass container, carefully arrange the eggs in the container. (Note: check every egg to make sure there are no cracks on it.) Pour salted water into the container and cover the eggs. You’ll notice some eggs above would float to the surface, so place something, like a little sauce plate on top of the eggs. The basic idea is to get all eggs submerse completely in the brine. Tightly cover the container and place at room temperature. The brining process normally takes 30 to 40 days. Label the start and finish dates on the container to remind yourself. (I used google calendar to set an email alert to myself.) After 30 days, take one egg out to cook and see if its taste is salty enough. If not, let the rest to brine for a few days more. If you’re satisfied, drain all eggs out and wipe dry. Keep them in an egg carton and place in fridge. The salted eggs can be kept for a few weeks in fridge.\n\n\nNotes:\nBefore placing the eggs in the container, do make sure all the eggs are not broken or have any cracks.\nIf you don’t have star anise and Sichuan peppercorns, you can replace with any tea leaves you like when cooking the salted water. The egg shells would look darker, infused by the fragrance of the tea you used.\nThe egg yolks would turn orange-red beautifully because of the effect of adding Shaoxing wine.","timestamp_created":1474096436,"timestamp_updated":1477552506,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25540881","author":{"steamid":"76561198327151835","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1658263955},"language":"russian","review":"найс","timestamp_created":1474091634,"timestamp_updated":1474091634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25540768","author":{"steamid":"76561198058615609","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3089,"last_played":1472099317},"language":"schinese","review":"是好游戏，那么，我很想玩；\n支持中文，那么，我必须买。\n（有些也不错的游戏，连个中文也不出一个，我玩你妈！不伺候中国人，那我也不伺候你）","timestamp_created":1474090955,"timestamp_updated":1474090955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600202381610870361","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25540441","author":{"steamid":"76561198192875777","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":170410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1656916930},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un pvta mierda de juego espero y se mu3era los devs son unos p3ndejos, osea el juego esta bien y la cagan. esto ya parece movil.","timestamp_created":1474089264,"timestamp_updated":1613645155,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25539948","author":{"steamid":"76561198081692855","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":27377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3026,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1660447419},"language":"english","review":"Although I have low hours on this game, I also have about 15 hours on the beta version, and I must say that very little has changed from the beta. Is the game still fun? Yes, it is very fun, and it's one of the few games where my heart starts to really beat when I'm getting chased. There are quite a few glaring problems though. For one it doesn't seem they have improved multiplayer whatsoever. I still have to click join a lobby about 5 to 10 times to actually join a lobby(it was even worse in the beta). There is also very little change in my opinion from the beta. They just added a new characters and maps and that was it. Another problem with the game is with some of the maps. There are some places on certain maps where a survivor can just run in circles and the killer cannot catch them because they vault a wall anytime you get close. Most of the map isnt like this but some places it is just impossible to catch someone. Another problem I have is how fast a person can be removed from a hook. If you turn your back for two seconds that victim is gone like the wind. My final problem with the game has to be the heart beat to tell you where a victim is. Time and Time again killers have ran right towards my position, while I get this is to balance the game, it honestly should just be an indicator to give a general direction, and ontop of that a good killer shouldn't have many problems finding survivors, because as the number of repairable generators dwindles a killer is able to go between all of them and check to see which ones are being repaired. Anyways I still believe this game is fun for many hours, and it is well worth the money","timestamp_created":1474086567,"timestamp_updated":1474086567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25539931","author":{"steamid":"76561198226098028","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2259,"last_played":1635585230},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏 开发者将您的账号查封醉醉的","timestamp_created":1474086479,"timestamp_updated":1474086479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25539913","author":{"steamid":"76561198120006781","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1158,"last_played":1652246497},"language":"german","review":":) viel spass... lohnt sich....\n\n","timestamp_created":1474086409,"timestamp_updated":1474086409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25539887","author":{"steamid":"76561198253585254","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":69677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1770,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1660590220},"language":"spanish","review":"A really nice game if you hate yourself, maybe be hard at the start, but later, you will enjoy bully survivors with your stronger/favorite killer","timestamp_created":1474086277,"timestamp_updated":1609826557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499944031238555908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25539805","author":{"steamid":"76561197973125522","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":27571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5036,"last_played":1631604511},"language":"english","review":"Wish I could be here writing a great review for this potentailly fantastic game....instead I'm expressing my dissapointment.
