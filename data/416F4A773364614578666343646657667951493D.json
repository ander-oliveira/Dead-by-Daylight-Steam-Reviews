New UI layout is counter-intuitive (despite benefits of seeing Survivor faces and hook states).

I've dumped 3k hours of my life into it. But for some reason, BHVR is listening to the not-so-skilled players as far as making changes to the game.\n\nThe release of 4.5.0 killed this game for me, and I cannot recommend it to friends who will start off with no skills.  I believe a lot of my frustrations with this game started with the release of dedicated servers.  I do realize there's a lot of difficulties in overcoming latency-based issues while having a smooth matchmaking experience.  I would prefer to wait 10 minutes for a decent match without janky hitbox issues (like your pawn's collision capsule lagging behind your character on your screen) than to deal with what we have today.\n\nRevert running, walking, and standing animations.  Why is my character, who is trying to survive a trial by someone more sinister than the devil himself, standing above the weeds instead of crouching behind them?  Why are they trying to peek over the wall that I'm running the killer around?  These animations not only removed outplay potential, but there's a VERY serious desync between the pawn's animation and the collision capsule for the killer's weapon swings.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the UI.  I realize that it was intended to bring more immersiveness to the experience of being a survivor, by taking away a lot of the clutter that was distracting from the scene, but there are some very glaring issues for me as a long-time player:\n\n• The button that shows up in the middle of skill checks is distracting and makes it more difficult to see where the skillcheck is on the bar.  You only have a couple of seconds to react, so it's important that it's clear to the player when and what button to press.  The giant white and yellow icon takes away from being able to see clearly where that skillcheck is immediately.\n\n• Emblem progress is a lot more difficult to see being shoved to the top-right.  Maybe this will just take some time to set in, but it's never been a problem on the left side on my screen.  I cannot think of a single time where emblem progress toast spam has cluttered up the left side of my screen so much as to affect my decision making ability because I couldn't see something.\n\n• Remove the scratch marks from the player's faces when they're injured.  It's for clarity that they're injured, sure ... but why have their portrait there if you do not want us to see their face and know WHAT character the person is playing?\n\n• Get rid of the italicized text on player's names and/or give breaking points in the hook progress bar, so it's more clear to players when they'll be pushing into the next phase.  Before this update, I knew to-the-pixel where those break points were on any name ... but between the new smaller size of the bars and the italicized text, I cannot figure it out.\n\nThis update sucks ... and shame on BHVR for not getting feedback on it before pushing it live.","timestamp_created":1612939272,"timestamp_updated":1612939272,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548150300979614258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86317108","author":{"steamid":"76561199043823008","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1626079076},"language":"russian","review":"Игра весит много и большая часть этого гейские скины по цене почки я желаю тем у кого есть мозг не покупать эту помойку не верь своему другу который рекомендует он скорее всего долбан с 47 хромосомами игра не интересна токсичное комюнити играя в эту игру ты!

Inhalt bekannt. \n\nIch spiele (oder spielte) das Spiel als Survivor only ca. 1k Stunden auf PS4 und wechselte dann auf PC mit über 2k Stunden. Das Spiel war herrlich unfair, voller Bugs und machte riesig Spaß. Seit nun fast 2 Jahren ist es sehr einseitig geworden. Waren vorher die Survivor bevorteilt, änderte sich das ab diesem Zeitpunkt rigoros. Daß Infinites wegfielen - okay. Aber gleichzeitig wurden Paletten mit jedem Patch verringert, die Abstände vergrößert, die Versteckmöglichkeiten reduziert oder ganz weggenommen. Ganze Spielelemente wurden herausgenommen, z.B das Sabotieren, Wiggeln lohnt sich im Allgemeinen nicht mehr. Maps wurden verkleinert und für die Killer entschärft. Survivorperks wurden konsequent und bis zur Bedeutungslosigkeit generft. Auch Killer mußten Einbußen hinnehmen, die aber lange nicht an die von den Überlebenden heranreichen. Ein 100-Stunden Killer nimmt problemlos eine 4*500 Stunden Survivor Solo Crew auseinander. Lange ist sie her, die Zeit, als zwei Entkommene und zwei Opfer als unentschieden gezählt wurde. Nun ist es immer der 4k, alles andere ist für Killer inakzeptabel. Die Bugs im Spiel (eine Menge) gehen normalerweise zu Lasten der Survivor, sie wurden auch nicht gefixt, bzw. kommen immer wieder. Ich bin bei jedem einzelnen Spiel aufs neue erstaunt, wie die Spielmechanik mich natzt, damit ich schlußendlich doch nicht gewinne. \n\nUnd nun ist er endlich erreicht, der Tiefpunkt, der lange angestrebt und nun erreicht wurde. Es fing, wie schon gesagt, vor langer Zeit an, bergab zu gehen. Ich denke, ab dem Zeitpunkt, an dem im Thompson House auf der ersten Etage ein Haken platziert wurde, lohnte es sich nicht mehr, das Spiel zu spielen. \n\nNun hat BHVR noch einiges draufgesetzt. Mit dem neuesten Patch ist das Spiel als Surv auf der PS4 fast unspielbar. Die Spielinformationen wurden von zwei zentralen Stellen auf sechs aufgeteilt. In jede Ecke eines 56 Zoll Fernsehers schauen zu müssen ist kein Spaß mehr. Die Hitboxen, die schon immer ein Problem waren, sind nun eine Zumutung. Es ähnelt Willkür, wenn man aus 10m Entfernung durch Wände und um Ecken herum geschlagen werden kann, von diversen Fensterhits ganz zu schweigen. Un_er_träg_lich! \n\nDas Schlimmste aber ist die Änderung im Movement. Nicht nur, daß schon wieder ein Spielelement reduziert wurde (360s, Moonwalk), sondern auch, daß es sogar noch beschissen aussieht. Gerade und vor allem die Bewegungen machten für mich einen großen Teil des Charmes aus, den DBD mal hatte. Habe ich es vorher gerne gesuchtet, mache ich es nun nach 2 Runden aus. Es reizt mich nicht mehr, ist nicht mehr schön anzuschauen. Der Dauerspaß ist einfach verloren gegangen. \n\nWie gesagt, es ist nicht nur der neueste Patch (auch, wenn er abgrundtief schlecht war), es ist der ganze Weg, den DBD gegangen ist und den es wohl weitergehen wird. Ich schaue ab jetzt alle ein, zwei Wochen mal rein. Sollte es länger so bleiben, wie es jetzt ist, dann war es das wohl mit dem Spiel.","timestamp_created":1612935641,"timestamp_updated":1612936162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86314782","author":{"steamid":"76561198379076126","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":402566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220210,"last_played":1643884204},"language":"english","review":"Played Since late 2017, Found the game amazing.

My opinion still stands, if not worsens. Balance is impossible to dream of. The devs do not play their own game at any significant level and every aspect of the game is heavily in favor of the Survivor. \n\nThe grind for perks and abilities in the game is worse now than it ever was, and the Devs have said they won't be changing this because... \"Reasons.\"\n\nDo not start playing this game. If you do play, stay only to the Survivor side and don't bother trying to play Killer. If you do play Killer understand that the moment -- THE MOMENT -- you reach rank 15 as a killer you will immediately be placed with people who have been playing the game for thousands of hours. This is done to alleviate the Survivor queue time -- With zero fucks given if you enjoy your time playing as Killer or not.\n\nOver 800 hours in this game. Have played for a long, Long time.\n\nBHVR doesn't understand how to balance. They don't understand how to fix issues. They don't understand how to properly update their own game.\n\nThe most recent visual update is horrific. It's a mess of hitboxes, glitches, load-times, and shit no one asked for but the Devs insist is good for us.\n\nOn top of that, Balance has been an issue for years. Currently, Low-Ranked Survivors (Ranks 1-4, good, veteran players) are being matched up against Mid- to High-Ranked Killers (Ranks 12-20, new players). This is done because BHVR specifically allowed matchmaking to ignore ranks when Survivors wait too long for a lobby.\n\nEXCEPT, because new Killers are being matched far beyond their skill level, and the toxicity of Low-Ranked Survivors is damned near legendary, no body is playing or learning Killer anymore. New Killers get burnt out from constantly losing and being told they're horrible for even trying to succeed at their objectives, so they stop playing altogether. \n\nThis causes Survivor queues to become even longer, there-by causing more of a problem to begin with.\n\nAnd this has been happening for close to 2 years now. BHVR's original fix for long Survivor queues was increasing the matchmaking Rank Cap to +/-6. Then they removed it altogether when Survivor queues didn't shorten. Now they have no plans to fix it in the works.\n\nBut they did update the teabagging animations, so Survivors can taunt Killers even more effectively now!\n\nIf you think I'm kidding, the Devs LITERALLY commented on a Dev Video about the new teabagging animations and that they wanted Survivors to enjoy teabagging even more.\n\nThe only reason this game is popular is because there's no other game like it that's stayed alive long enough to compete.\n\nFrom an 800 hour player that plays both Killer and Survivor: Do not invest in this game.","timestamp_created":1612931138,"timestamp_updated":1646785218,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502701640129089355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86312006","author":{"steamid":"76561198895173366","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6401,"last_played":1641594085},"language":"english","review":"This game has turned into garbage!
