It's honestly one of the most BS things about the game, the killers get to complain about something and its instantly nerfed while survivors who have been given a severe lower hand already have to try so hard that their parents are wondering where they've been for the past 3 hours because games take that long to find. They don't care about the survivors. They don't care about you. Don't buy this game. Buy minecraft, people don't tunnel in minecraft. The amount of catering to killers in this game is astounding but do you see any killers saying \"haha good game man you got me good nice escape\" NO its always some terrible insta-down killer complaining about how you brought decisive strike, and borrowed time. guess what.... THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE, not to mention the overpowered add-ons/perks all the killers have, Seeing through walls, NOED, BBQ, NOED, franklins, NOED, and ruin/overcharge/surge/thrilling/corrupt/popgoestheweasel oh did I mention noed? THEY HAVE SO MANY GENERATOR REGRESSION PERKS ITS STUPID. what do the survivors get to even the playing field? Pebbles/fast crouching/ running 3 seconds at full speed then becoming a sloth/ jumping through windows then becoming a sloth/ and pallets that are STILL broken half the time.... Waste of time. until the devs give some love to the shitty role that is survivor this game is doomed.\n\n****EDIT****\nAfter playing the Public Test Beta released 11/19/19 I'd like to revise this by saying that the devs have done it. They have actually made the game UNPLAYABLE. The servers have no less than 100 ping at any time, the hitboxes and hit registering have hit an all time low as you can now be hit while in a different area code or from a different map. The new killer that \"is based around slugging\" is so broken it hurts. He is the hillbilly that could with his cross-map sprinting and insta-downs. And what do we get in return as survivors? \"if ya stay real close to someone being carried, they wiggle a bit faster.\" Guess what, iron grasp exists. I will end this revision by stating if the killer is not fixed before releasing it into the actual game, the player base will drop dramatically and maybe a red flag will pop up and the devs will finally realize they cater to the worse of people. But lets be real here. they are in it for the quick cash grab. In the few months I've played this game ive seen nothing but nerfs to survivors and buffs to killers that don't need them. Decisive strike's skill check is now smaller while the cannibal's base speed while chainsawing is now equivalent to sonic the hedgehog. I'm done playing this game. It has not been enjoyable, it has not been fun, the devs hate you.

I am also impressed with how thrilling the game can be.  I have managed to bring in a slew of my friends to play the game, and despite how toxic I can be online sometimes, I still think there is much enjoyment to be had. \nThe two downsides are pretty rough.  \n1. The community is so super toxic that it may turn you away from playing.  AKA- Survivors being so upset they lost to the killer that they will call the killer a camper.  To which they have at least 5 different definitions of the term, so that it always seems to fit into their gripe.\n2. generators are repaired way too fast.  Killers are FORCED to take Hex:Ruin just to keep up, and this rarely helps, since the survivors have ways to find and destroy the Totems.  This also doesn't help when the survivors are able to simply by-pass the effects of your Hex: Ruin by simply clicking the generator for only a single second then releasing and repeating, so that they never get a skill check hit them.  If the devs would add a five (5) second build-up time before the generator progressed any further each time anyone clicked to repair a generator, it would put an end to this exploit. \nThis game is still very fun and extremely addictive.  I hope those whom try it out, wont let the toxic community hold them back.
