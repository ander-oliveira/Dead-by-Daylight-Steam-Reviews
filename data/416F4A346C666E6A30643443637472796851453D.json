A great horror game that just gets better every update! Haven't had any of the problems where I lost my saved progress. Been playing since it came out! It's a nice game especially for people like me who don't have a whole lot of time to play video games, it's nice to be able to sit down for half an hour and play a couple matches! It gets real intense real quick and has a variety of characters who have diffrerent abilities and different playstyles (since they are player controlled) it really is a very enjoyable game and has become one of my most favorite games! I recommend it highly! (and if you don't want to buy it to try it out play a friends copy and try it out or even just wait for another free weekend) Got a friend from work to start playing it and he came back the next day talking about how he was addicted to it and had to make himself stop playing! Seriously it's awesome and at least worth a try!

Each map is mostly the same in some sorts, but other maps have different aspects that can be great or absolutely horrible (cough cough haddonfield cough).\n\nThe gameplay however is horrendous. Hitboxes with the huntress's hatchets are god awful, and holy shit don't' get me started with how dog shit hit validation is. (It's SLOWLY getting betterish overtime, but it still is just horrible.) Some killers can just be busted as fuck, (like bubba, who can just oneshot you without requiring any skill whatsoever) Then there are killer like doctor who just make you wanna kill yourself, for the sole reason of that he makes being chased nearly impossible, unless you're a fucking god at the game. Then there's the perk that basically says, \"Hey, you may have done the gens really well, but fuck you, i win. NOED. The perk that makes me want to kill myself everytime I see it. Granted, some killers kinda need it, especially ones that have little to no map pressure at all, but I still feel it's a baby perk for baby killers.\n\nDon't think I forgot about the survivor perks. Holy hell, there are a SHIT ton of survivor perks that are the god awful, and are used by 90% of survivor mains. Dead hard (dog shit especially with the hit validation for the killer), DS (granted this perk is less hell then it once was), any other exhaustion perk tbh,and there are a few others that are just used by practically every survivor, that just makes the killer's job 500x more hell then it already can be.\n\nThen there's the hacker problem, that the devs have done squat to fix. Thankfully, I haven't encountered one in like 2 years, but I've seen so many streamers going against them, that it's just unreal, and that BHVR is doing jack shit about, and that there are people being held hostage because the hackers just can't die, and just drag the game out for eternity, until the person going against the hacker quits.\n\nGranted I have 2000+hours on this shitty game, but when you're playing with friends, it can be a more pleasant experience, since you can actually talk to your teammates, and makes the game somewhat more fun, but I highly just suggest you don't get this game, unless you're wanting to play your soul to damnation, and eternal suffering. \n\nP.S.

Si un killer asesina a  3 survivors y quedan menos de 3 motores, el survivor puede escaparse por una trampilla que esta oculta en el mapa. \nLa ambientacion y los mapas consiguen sostener una tension en la partida muy buena. En el juego cada asesino y survivors tienen distintas habilidades y sus mejoras vam por separado , lo que agrega varias horas de juego. El ultimo punto positivo son sus asesinos de pelis de terror clasicas cmo Letherface, Freddy Krueger o Micael Myers.\nAca enpiezan los puntos negativos: como bien dije los killers deben  colgar minimo una vez a los survivors, pero en ocasiones el killer se quea al lado del gancho campeando y jodiendo la partida a otros survivors.\nOtro punto negativo son los bugs si bien cada vez hay menos, es molesto que fallen la carga de texturas o que por un bug te caigas del mapa.\nPor ultimo quiero mencionar que muchos killers y survivors del juego hay que pagarlos, los precios rondan de los 3,99$ y los 6,99$","timestamp_created":1506018071,"timestamp_updated":1594785648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35109656","author":{"steamid":"76561198367845422","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1438,"last_played":1646867154},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu très prenant !

Обновления и правда меняют баланс (хоть и как-то странно, но действенно), исправляют баги, появляются новые dlc с имбовыми маньяками. Теперь даже можно спокойно играть с друзьями, а раньше для этого нужно было пройти семь кругов ада. Правда маньяком играть очень тяжело. Это не в плане самой игры, а в плане создания лобби. Дело в том, что если игрок выбрал маньяка, то это он создает новое лобби, а не присоеденяется к другому. А так как маньяком играет много начинающих игроков, то нужно ждать минимум минут 10, пока наберуться выжившие. Хотя и это со временем улучшается.\nЯ игру купил со всеми дополнениями и во время скидки купил друзьям, не жалею.

after playing for so long i am here since the anniversary and i must say i can see this game alive for a long time.Now basic stuff.You can play as either a survivor which has to repair 5 gens,open 2 doors after and escape.You have several tools at the survivor's desposal to combat the killer such as pallets,flashlights and jukes.The problem is that teamwork is a key but there is no voice co which is bad cuz it kills the teamwork a bit.You have some other tools like medkits,toolboxes,maps and keys to help your teammates complete the task or evade the killer.Every character can reach lvl 50 and then you can prestige him to recieve much more rewarding bloodweb with better items and perks and a bloody cosmetic which is good as a camoflage if it acctually worked most of the time.You can prestige untill prestige 3 and then thats it.Ofc you can always upgrade other survivors to get their teachable perks.Some maps are great like autoheaven wreckers and haddonfield and some not really cool like backwater swamp.Now playing as a killer is acctually a bit more fun in the game.You get to choose from several killers from which 3 are movie killers such as Leatherface,Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers.Every killer is unique in his own way but i get the feeling that with every killer it gets really ez to fight survivors which is not good.There are some really cool killers such as the Hillbily and the Wraith which are in the shadow of LF and Freddy and Myers.The way the game treats the survivor is kinda good cuz its much more challenging and stressfull.But the problem is that the devs are making the killers ez to play as for example there is this ,,autoaim\" feature which is just holding the LMB and getting more speed and gives you a hit.Second problem is the community which is toxic from some sort like when you play as a killer you will always get attacked in the chat or in your Profile comment section with salty stuff like noob,loser,camper etc.Playing as a survivors is not cool when the killer camps you while the other are forced to do nothing than just fix 3 gens,or when the killer constantly attacks you cuz he cant get anyone else and thinks he can get you,but he doesnt,as well as some killers will chase you cuz of the character you play as like Dwight who is getting hate from all around the community and will always be a target.And finnaly the maxed out killer which are bored from the game and just troll cuz they have nothing else to do and just  dont know what the outside world looks like anymore #nolifers.SWF aka Survive with friends is pretty good with your friends when you have discord or skype etc.Also there are sometimes when the killers get triggered and just leaves or constantly starts chasin you cuz you were pallet looping him or flashing him etc. which is not fun.Some killers will even attack you in steam comments etc. if you ask the Devs for buff to the survivors cuz it will be ,,gamebreaking\"or ,,not balanced\" etc. cuz the devs mostly listen to the Killer mains in the commmunity but if you get this problems out of the way the game is pretty good so yes i recommend it if you have strong nerves againts the killers so yeah see ya in the fog guys and good luck.","timestamp_created":1505989159,"timestamp_updated":1512775425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555084764957427979","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35101369","author":{"steamid":"76561198377874840","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2058,"last_played":1628179746},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩~~~~~~~~~","timestamp_created":1505989077,"timestamp_updated":1505989077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35101341","author":{"steamid":"76561198367631830","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1241,"last_played":1608896624},"language":"russian","review":"Ваще

From hiding from the killer up to running for your life, there is no shortage in emotions from winning or losing and surviving or dying.\n- Dead by Daylight is constantly being refreshed and updated by its developer. New Killers, Survivors, Skins and even new maps have been thrown at this game since its release. \n- Make no mistake, there is a strategy to this game. I have to admit, I haven't mastered or even aware of all of them. Thankfully there are communities in facebook, youtube channels devoted to educating new players how to advance and succeed. \n- Multiple Play Styles. You can be altruistic or heroic. You can also just look out for yourself, as a survivor. Characters can carry different perks according to how you want to play. \n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n- Don't get me wrong, its current and only game mode and mechanics is fun. However, given the potential of this game, I expected it to have another game mode or different types of mechanics for the killers or survivors to catch their prey or survive the game respectively. \n- Developers made a huge blunder. A lot of players lost their hard earned progress in the game. If you've slaved over this game to get all the perks and items you've wanted I can't blame them for down-voting this game. \n\n\n[b]The Recommendation: BUY IT[/b]\nWith the comming halloween season, now is the perfect time to get this game, a long with your friends.
