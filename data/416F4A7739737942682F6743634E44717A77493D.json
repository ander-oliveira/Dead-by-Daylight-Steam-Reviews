Confusing matching mechanism\nThe matching mechanism of this game is the same as nothing. Basically, a room is opened when a room is full. Players who have too different levels of game skills are often matched together, resulting in novice players having no gaming experience. There are also many team players who maliciously use the flaws of the matching mechanism to bully novices and further damage the novice's game experience.\n2. The game environment is smoky\nEvery night there are a considerable number of teams to drive black teams, and at night, four human players team up to match the novice killer. Not only bullying novices, but also like to formulate various rules to restrain killer players. For example, the survivors can not return to defend or accuse you of guarding the corpse. You can't use red accessories or scold you for rubbish and so on. The other is the plug-in problem, which is very rampant. I was online for two hours a day, and I encountered one plug-in on average three days.\n3. Game balance gets worse and worse\nI started playing this game in 2017, quit in 2018, and returned in 2020. I can really fully feel that the balance of the current game is far less than before. The most intuitive evidence is that the number of survivors and killer players is now seriously imbalanced. The game in 2017 has just started for a year, and the matching speed of survivors is very fast, entering the room in one second. The killer match is slower and takes 3 minutes, but it is understandable. After all, one killer has four humans. But in 2020, the situation will reverse, the killer enter the room in one second, and the survivor will have to match for 15 minutes. The beginning of all this is the revision of a killer skill called Hex :Ruin. The revision of this core skill has greatly improved the speed of survivors repairing generators. The normal duration of a single game has been reduced from the previous 15-20 minutes to about 10~15 minutes. The mechanics of this game determine that the longer the delay, the more disadvantaged it is for the survivor and the more advantageous it is for the killer. Since then, the survivors have been greatly strengthened, the killers have been greatly weakened, and the balance has begun to collapse. There are fewer and fewer people playing killers, and more and more people playing survivors. In addition, the black players in the team maliciously use the flaws of the matching system to destroy the game experience of the novice killer players and enjoy it. As a result, this game can only be experienced normally during the day when there are few people. It takes 15 minutes to play the survivors at night, and the killer will be humiliated by the survivors who team up.\n4. The update of the production team is becoming more and more difficult\nThe update frequency of the game is low, and most of the updates are based on the existing content. The new killer, new skills and new maps that can enrich the game content are basically only two to three times a year. So the game is easy to get bored. The creation of new content is becoming more and more careless, and the innovation and fun of each major version is far less than before. The new Korean killer feels like a replica of the huntress. Modifying the parameters of the huntress and changing to a model is a new killer.\n\nThe last suggestion, if you want to experience this game normally, it is best to play on host platforms such as switch and PS4, and turn off cross-platform matching, otherwise it will match the plug-in and low-quality fleet on the PC side. If you don't have a host and only have a PC, I suggest that you only play this game during the day and don't touch it at night. If you neither have a console nor can you play games during the day, then I suggest you don’t buy it","timestamp_created":1615170571,"timestamp_updated":1615171473,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548974931240081787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88055301","author":{"steamid":"76561198259078779","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5511,"last_played":1653544008},"language":"english","review":"*joke*","timestamp_created":1615170051,"timestamp_updated":1615170051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492327392101287842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88054781","author":{"steamid":"76561199087806496","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":39850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":5037,"last_played":1659549047},"language":"english","review":"devs

Тебя всегда обольют грязью быдло игроки и бегут писать в комментариях Стима не очень и приятные комменты про тебя. \n\nА все из-за того, если ты играешь за маньяка и ты кемперишь и туннельщик. \nА если ты играешь за Сурва, то...  не снял с крюка, таланты неправильные у тебя.\nИ много другие причины облить тебя грязью. \n\nТакое ощущение что ты кому-то в этой игре кому-то должен и плясать под чужую дудку. \n\n[h1]Страдание всех маньяков.[/h1] \n\nНа сегодняшний момент всего 22 маньяков, но только один из них более менее играбелен. С последними обновлениями игры они стали мальчиками для битья для токсичных Сурвов или особенно наглых.А точнее быть - это в наглую щелкать фонариком, светить в глаза, приседать, стопить всей кучей, а под конец игры просто троллить вас возле выхода. \n\nОднако таких наглых и особенно одаренных можно законтрить навыком \"Эбеновое Моменто Мори\". Также такое Моменто Мори отлично справлялось и против Сурвов по Discord. А теперь Моменто Мори стал просто мусором, чтобы оно сработало нужно вешать Сурвов на крюк только по второму разу. Пока будешь бегать и вешать, то моментально тебя загенрашат. Моменто Мори мог остановить и генраш.\n\nЕдинственное кого бояться теперь такие токсичные Сурвы, то это только Бубба. Ведь вас никто не будет стопить и лишний раз побояться светить фонариком вам в лицо. Так как навык \"Погибель Франклина\" выбивает из рук не только фонарики. На худой конец побояться и Майкла Майерса, вот те маньяки могут ваншотать наповал. \n\nЕсли маньяки были кемперами и туннельщиками, то из-за этого их стало еще больше. Даже я уже не хочу бегать за Сурвами. Мне проще кемперить с бензопилой и пилить смелых альтруистов. Если до обновлении я мог убить четверых Сурвов, то теперь у меня только отловить троих или двоих Сурвов. \n\nТакже на мой взгляд пати Сурвов состоящая из Discordа совершенно нечестная игра против не только маньяка, но и других обычных Сурвов.  Так как из-за этого есть большой шанс, что данный маньяк в будущем будет просто кемперить.\n\n[h1]Страдание Выживших.[/h1]\n\nВыжившие и они же Сурвы как оказалось тоже страдают. Есть огромный шанс, что вас будут кемперить возле крюка и туннелить маньяк. Если он это делает, то скажите особо одаренным Сурвам первого ранга, которые играют по связи, троллят маньяков, светят назойливо фонарем. и щелкают даже тогда когда маньяк даже никого не поймал. То есть просто выбешивать маньяка своим гадким поведением. \n\nТакже с последним обновлениям игры увеличился радиус атаки через окно для маньяка. Даже если вы уже оказались по ту сторону окна, то маньяк может нанести вам урон через окно. Также непонятно с тотемами и как они работают у маньяков. Если ты все вычищал на карте тотемы, то у маньяка появляется порча по откатам генераторов.  И ты по всей карте бегаешь и не понимаешь где еще один находится тотем. \n\n\n [h1]Таланты у маньяков и Сурвов большинство из них бесполезные.  [/h1] \n\nТакже я не понимаю зачем столько бесполезных и ненужных талантов? Даже по ситуативной ситуации эти таланты также вам не помогут.\n\nДля Сурвов самые полезные таланты которые сильно помогают: \"Оставленный Позади\", \"Железная Воля\", \"Крепкий Орешек\",\" Одолженное Время\", \"Сам Себе Доктор\", \"Несокрушимый\"\n\nДля Маньяков: Сумеречные Шпионы, \"Барьбекю и Чили\", \"Гибель Франклина\", \"Коварство\", \"Никому Не Скрыться От Смерти\", \"Пожирание Надежды\",\"Мертвая Хватка\", \"Нетерпимость\", \"Чертик Из Табакерки\", Поиграть Со Своей Жертвой\", \"Кровавый Смотритель\"\n\nТакие полезные таланты только по пальцам можно пересчитать. А остальные только для галочки сделаны, а также они могут еще и запутать новичка.\n\n[h1]Вердикт.[/h1]\nИгра по своей сути Гриндилка с разломом. С Неадекватными людьми и даже вам спасибо никто не скажет, если вы пожертвуйте собой под конец игры с обратным отсчетом, где вы снимите другого Сурва, но зато вас всегда гадко и мерзко напишут вам в комментариях очень нехорошие слова. А за маньяка вы будите сосать детородный орган у токсичных Сурвов.  И крайне недружелюбна к новым игрокам и прочим новичкам.
