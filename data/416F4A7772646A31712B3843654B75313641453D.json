With addition to the character dynamics, it should host more light hearted experiences for people to prepare themselves. It is fun if you have a group prepared but is horrid if you are a killer looking for the chance to learn. Or even get the vibe, the monsters are unique and have potential to be fun for everyone, if not scarier. But not understanding the more intricate aspects can stifle the gaming and ruin the desire to come back. \n\nWith friends you can get a solid 4.5/5\n\nAlone, the drive dwindles and essentially brings the feeling of lackluster plays to an all time high. 2/5\n\nWhen you get the chance to be a Killer and don't encounter the many issues you do during match makings, such as automatic booting and a drastic lag spikes. 3/5. The idea of putting any skill you have to work against others is thrilling, and it shows when each character has time put into them. The fact alone that a match can end in seconds because the only players still playing are decked beyond what a new comer could hope to handle.","timestamp_created":1577744295,"timestamp_updated":1577744295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60945325","author":{"steamid":"76561198340560546","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6690,"last_played":1645033418},"language":"russian","review":"заебумба","timestamp_created":1577744239,"timestamp_updated":1577744239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60944947","author":{"steamid":"76561198084487909","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":49,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1659406714},"language":"russian","review":"ну игруха топчик,правда есть минусы после некоторых обновлений)\n","timestamp_created":1577743834,"timestamp_updated":1577743834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60944541","author":{"steamid":"76561198032723059","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":18145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15946,"last_played":1617903795},"language":"english","review":"good game play much and fanny killers goods 2 overpowred like the rabbit womman go hmmm hmm hmm hmmmmm hmmmm hmmmm hmmm hmmmmmm hmmmmmm hmmmmmmmmm throughs hatchets neck insta braken if add-on for aimware or red offfering.\nalso why the pig humane goes IIHH IIIIH IIIIIH and swings motorized axe around and picks up to swing and stared me for rest game no fun killer","timestamp_created":1577743407,"timestamp_updated":1577743407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60944317","author":{"steamid":"76561198130925818","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":9603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1605481760},"language":"russian","review":"Если вы везучая крыса, то вы попали по адресу, если нет, то советую не играть в это.","timestamp_created":1577743177,"timestamp_updated":1577743177,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471204221248626709","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60944266","author":{"steamid":"76561198356699861","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1634345746},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazom xD","timestamp_created":1577743134,"timestamp_updated":1577743134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60944170","author":{"steamid":"76561198185302927","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":128407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2324,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1660599060},"language":"french","review":"would recommend this game if you don't cry enough in your life","timestamp_created":1577743030,"timestamp_updated":1659792935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.402046769857406616","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60943972","author":{"steamid":"76561198175310317","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":14696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1654601989},"language":"english","review":"It's aight","timestamp_created":1577742816,"timestamp_updated":1577742816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60943627","author":{"steamid":"76561198851237292","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1587313721},"language":"english","review":"Its generally a fun game, filled with thrill as the survivor as well as the killer.

It's poorly designed, broken, and buggy as all hell. It has some of the best art direction I've ever seen, complemented by bad implementation all over the place. The gameplay can either be some of the most thrilling ever, or it can put you to sleep. I've gotta break it down.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nI would normally give a rating, but this part is too complex to even rate. \n\nAs a killer and survivor (obviously) the gameplay and feel can change drastically based on which killer you are playing as/against. \n\nThe survivor gameplay is fun and the feeling of outwitting the other player is often fun and thrilling (this goes for the killer as well)\n\nOne of the truly amazing aspects of this game is the unique ways you have to adapt and respond to each killer, and while several killers can be countered using the same methods (using line of sight and faking different directions) at the very least you have to have intimate knowledge of how each killers' powers work or you are in for a very bad time, so in terms of the learning curve, you do have a hill to climb.\n\n\nWhen it comes to playing as the killer, this aspect is dulled to some degree, you ARE the unique element. If you play the same killer over and over you often won't experience this, and the map generation isn't so random that each game won't share significant similarities (but don't mistake this for each map being too set, the different maps, and different iterations of these maps and different playstyles of all survivors are quite enough to keep it fresh for a long time)\n\nImportant to mention, the game style of the individual killer can make or break games. Succinctly, a camping killer can make the game super boring. Doesn't lose you the game, but makes it super boring. \n\nGameplay (Balance):\n\nAHHH don't even get me started. This is so much to unravel it could break my mind. To keep it short and sweet, matches will and often are unbalanced. The map generation will randomly place the structures and it can and will be broken in either direction. You could have zero chance as a survivor OR get absolutely demolished as the killer and YOU have ZERO control over this. \n\nNot to mention there is a gap as large as the ocean between the power levels of each killer.\n\nA good nurse will demolish almost every single match without giving them a chance (in all fairness nurse is by far the hardest killer to learn, but that's not an excuse for being broken)\n\nA PERFECT wraith can get demolished even if played perfectly since good, coordinated survivors can just straight up give you no chance.\n\nThere are a million perks at this point in the game's life cycle and expect to use about a dozen since for every good perk there are about 6 horrible ones.\n\nLet's move on, in summary, don't expect a balanced experience. At all.\n\nArt and Music\n\nIn general, every single killer oozes personality and is completely unique. BHVR's ability to create unique personalities, again and again, is truly world-class in my opinion. While many are similar in power, no killer looks remotely like another. Each is recognized at a glance, each has its own unique sounds and different animations (besides standardized things like breaking pallets and such)\n\nThe music is excellent, and the art direction of almost every map leaves nothing to be desired (unlike the actual design lol)\n\nOne serious complaint I can levy is that oftentimes the animation leaves much to be desired. There's nothing seriously wrong, but they're a lot of placeholder animations that don't make sense in the context. As well there's a kind of lack of life from these dead men, and the animations often don't ooze the oomph they should given the fact that they're often shattering wooden structures and cleaving survivors. Survivor animations are well done, no real complaints tbh it's hard to really mess up. They do lack a bit of life, but they're nothing to complain about.\n\nThe sound design is excellent, every hit sounds crunchy and hurtful. Voice lines are well done (although the survivors can often sound a bit silly)\n\nGame feel and other points:\n\nFor the most part, the game feel is well enough. I have some complaints about the jankyness of certain killers. Pyramid head feels like garbage to use his power with, the trickster's recoil is all camera recoil, which often leaves it feeling somewhat jarring to use his power.\n\nDon't expect good game balance decisions from these devs, just don't. If you play this game, and you have problems enough with the balance that you can't handle it; you should most likely just refund cause it hasn't really gotten that much better in 5 years. It's light years ahead now, but it just takes ages for any good and reasonable change to take place. Additionally, they repeatedly release content that is lackluster or is something that no one wants and is actively bad.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI have enjoyed my time with this game, and it has given me memories and even a few friends. If I could go back I would buy it again in a heartbeat. It has plenty of appeal, but it's not an easy game to start with (expect to get demolished for a while especially as a survivor). It holds a special, frustrating place in my heart.","timestamp_created":1577740602,"timestamp_updated":1636172324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60941566","author":{"steamid":"76561199003326133","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":25672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1408,"last_played":1653641324},"language":"russian","review":"ЭТА ОЧЕНЬ КРУТАЯ И ВЕСЁЛАЯ ИГРА","timestamp_created":1577740407,"timestamp_updated":1577740407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495049476623535156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60941538","author":{"steamid":"76561198859938605","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1586046475},"language":"spanish","review":"porfin me lo pude comprar xd y no me arrepiento de nada :D","timestamp_created":1577740367,"timestamp_updated":1577740367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60941391","author":{"steamid":"76561198930253524","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1655373941},"language":"polish","review":"bardzo fajna polecam znaleść ekipe","timestamp_created":1577740229,"timestamp_updated":1577740229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940773","author":{"steamid":"76561198376938581","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20552,"last_played":1627761890},"language":"english","review":"super cool that's all I can say","timestamp_created":1577739676,"timestamp_updated":1577739676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940426","author":{"steamid":"76561198272761838","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":52702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39223,"last_played":1656536589},"language":"english","review":"As someone who has played this game for a while and has really stopped playing at this point, I can definitively say that this will be a good purchase for you.\n\nThere are pros and cons to this game, lots of cons. But it is a (mostly) enjoyable survival horror.\n\nThe mechanics (fundamentally) are good. Although some perks and add-ons feel can feel unfair at times.\n\nThe community, though, can be quite toxic, although there are some really nice people out there, you just gotta find them.\n\nYou'll be glad to know cheaters are 99.9% nonexistent. Honestly do not worry about running into a script kiddie.\n\nThe bloodweb is a very innovative and fun way of levelling up. As you spend your bloodpoints, you have to choose wisely about what you will purchase next, as the entity will take what you don't. This becomes a small game of it's own. \n\nThe game is NOT pay to win. However please note that lots of characters are dlc, but all the characters/ you really need are already in the base game. \n\nPlease if you need any advice at all going in is that you should take everything with a pinch of salt. Or a couple bowlfulls.\nHave fun playing this game, make an effort to lighten others' days up, even if that person is flinging insults left, right and center.","timestamp_created":1577739368,"timestamp_updated":1577739430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940397","author":{"steamid":"76561198801387349","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":36283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3822,"last_played":1654556206},"language":"german","review":"ja","timestamp_created":1577739345,"timestamp_updated":1577739345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940323","author":{"steamid":"76561198156978433","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":6199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6174,"last_played":1621213545},"language":"english","review":"it's alright","timestamp_created":1577739257,"timestamp_updated":1577739257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940256","author":{"steamid":"76561198862058905","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":212991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191720,"last_played":1658595543},"language":"russian","review":"ГОВНО А НЕ ИГРА, СТОЛЬКО БАГОВ И ЛАГОВ ЧТО КАПЕЦ","timestamp_created":1577739199,"timestamp_updated":1577739199,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940231","author":{"steamid":"76561198308979889","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1612474130},"language":"english","review":"i love this game 100% recommend","timestamp_created":1577739180,"timestamp_updated":1577739180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60940008","author":{"steamid":"76561198315110879","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":612,"last_played":1638992209},"language":"russian","review":"chotka","timestamp_created":1577738973,"timestamp_updated":1577738973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60939692","author":{"steamid":"76561199006444854","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1654438651},"language":"english","review":"this game it was exciting and nice gameplay","timestamp_created":1577738712,"timestamp_updated":1614334145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60939606","author":{"steamid":"76561198360731793","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":21612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19918,"last_played":1592777652},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun and original but its in a complete mess.

Good idea for the game but honestly one of the worst survival horror games I have tried. CASTLE MINER Z IS A BETTER SURVIVAL GAME.

They decreased engineer boxes and first aids,so they become really useless.\nAnd after one of the latest updates, they even more made live of the survivors just impossible to save when the camper staying right next to the hoocked guy. \nBefore, they just hited us and we had a little chanse to escape, but now they just interrupt our saving motion without any chance to save.\nI'll try to play a bit more, but it seems like i'll stop to play it soon.\nAnd maybe rarely i'd play as a killer.\n\nReview update 10/10/2020\nI can't stop play this game guys coz it's great!\nIt has a lot of updates among the time, developers work quite hard and always do some events, create new characters with new abilities, creating new maps, updating grafics, creating new books with bunches of new missions.\nI really appreciate it.\nMay be i can't stop coz it's always fresh.\n\nIt still great!!","timestamp_created":1577730268,"timestamp_updated":1637875756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60930178","author":{"steamid":"76561198081111876","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3233,"last_played":1642024811},"language":"brazilian","review":"Primeiramente, Bom dia/Boa tarde/Boa noite.\nSegundamente, gostaria de dizer que esse jogo possui diversos prós e contras, sendo os contras principalmente o desbalanceamento nas partidas e as hitboxes que são totalmente zoadas.
