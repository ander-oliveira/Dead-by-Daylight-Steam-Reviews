Theres endless hackers, toxic Killers/entitled survivors, broken game mechanics, stupid developer decisions. \n\nContructive criticism or complaints get completely ignored by the developer/Moderators. The only reactions i got was from fellow players. And they agreed that this company is completely failing the game.\n\nAnd just a little point of interest: The hackers in this game are having so much fun not getting banned, theyre programming literal Killerbots.

be honest game itself is great. 10/10 on the game, absolutely love playing it.\n\nThe community is horrid.\n\n95% of the games you get will be like this.\n\nAs killer - Get ingame, by the time you get your first survivor hooked 3 generators are done. By the time you can kill one survivor (if you tunnel them) the gates are open, if your lucky you can get 2. Every game you are sure to be blinded multiply times doing close too any forced animation. And people will always be in pacts of 4.\n\nIm not a bad killer but with how many people i get that are trying so hard to win that i once had 3 people blind me in turn for the full length of their extra length flashlights (with me trying to hurt them and turn away the entire time) so that the fourth person can open the gate and that the last person to escape tried to give me a pity kill, has made it so if i see a player has a flashlight at the start of the game i will leave the lobby, that if i dont get a hook by the time 2 gens are done i leave, because i know i wont get kill let alone win.\n\nAs survivor - TL;DR. You either always win with all four players alive, or you always get slaughtered, nothing in between.\n\nThe other 5% are either matches that are fun and challenging where everyone barely wins or barely loses.\n\nThis game is filled with too many people looking up the best build/strat to win, that it makes the game not fun. Its almost so bad that if i had the ability to ask for a refund, there have been times i might have done it. As all the killers i have bought are practically useless if i want to win or have fun, because if you dont run the \"best killer + build\" then chances of anything coming of the match besides frustration and sadness are 0.\n\nOh and fyi, if you do get the game and decide to get new killers, if you want a moderate chance of enjoying them, don't play them till you level them up too at least 20-40. Anything lower and unless you get people that suck at the game, chances of you doing much more then being a grandpa/ma yelling at them kids to get off your gens is assured.","timestamp_created":1649220846,"timestamp_updated":1649220846,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491233855485916138","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113413620","author":{"steamid":"76561198215122364","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":73715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":598,"playtime_at_review":62368,"last_played":1660241130},"language":"english","review":"I love this game","timestamp_created":1649220584,"timestamp_updated":1649220584,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113412898","author":{"steamid":"76561198273960909","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":934,"last_played":1659145032},"language":"english","review":"I'm not much of an online gamer, but this game is very much worth the chance to give to anyone who isn't keen on playing online with others.
