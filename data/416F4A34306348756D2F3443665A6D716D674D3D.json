Having the likes of Michael Myers and Nemesis in the game creates a lot of excitment beyond the gameplay alone.\n\n","timestamp_created":1641624736,"timestamp_updated":1641624736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107573789","author":{"steamid":"76561198426821785","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":66745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":59114,"last_played":1659590985},"language":"english","review":"nah dont even consider buying it","timestamp_created":1641624354,"timestamp_updated":1647877186,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515527963638305664","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107573467","author":{"steamid":"76561198209097567","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":44237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":516,"playtime_at_review":27664,"last_played":1660276174},"language":"english","review":"It's a fun game if you hate yourself enough.","timestamp_created":1641623870,"timestamp_updated":1641623870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107572998","author":{"steamid":"76561199184649774","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3709,"last_played":1653206856},"language":"tchinese","review":"新手白銀二整天配到紅段一玩家新手要打甚麼?官方的配對系統可以再破一點","timestamp_created":1641623146,"timestamp_updated":1641623146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107572941","author":{"steamid":"76561198304656466","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6520,"last_played":1645264240},"language":"english","review":"<3 <3 fun to play !!","timestamp_created":1641623068,"timestamp_updated":1641623068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107572807","author":{"steamid":"76561198045126662","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1255,"last_played":1656207770},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego","timestamp_created":1641622862,"timestamp_updated":1641622862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107572618","author":{"steamid":"76561198087505690","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10605,"last_played":1614627854},"language":"russian","review":"Игра про маньяков и жертв?

It takes an actual interesting spin on the asymmetrical horror game genre.\n\nDBD Devs actively don't listen and say camping/tunneling is a viable strategy.\nWatch the Patrick (LEAD GAME DESIGNER BTW) interview if you want to see a dev actively avoid nearly all questions that would HELP the game and talk more in-depth about worsening most problems already present.\nThey tried NFTs, after the first 3 months that NFTs even started, meaning they knew the environmental harm and they still tried it anyways, that alone says enough that these devs don't care for anything except their own pocket money.\nDevs have the right to take away pretty much everything if you disagree with them (See DOWSEY who lost his twitch shirts for speaking up about the problems the community is facing).  I'm stating a fact, but the devs shouldn't have to act on that fact for valid criticism.  Just because it's fact doesn't mean you should attempt to reinforce that fact.\n Imagine buying something in the game and then suddenly it's taken away from you because you wrote a popular negative review, calling attention to all the stuff that needs to be fixed.  All the stuff that they've done that's wrong.  That's not how you keep a good fanbase, that's how you lose people.\n\"The art team and the bug fix team are separate\", but yet you're actively able to pump out new outfits between each patch and fix nothing in that time... Severe lack of funding to hire on one side and overabundance in another if you ask me.\n6th Anniversary is going to rework the most/least used perks, regardless about how toxic/healthy they are by comparison to other perks.  I'm putting this here solely because not all of the perks they told us about need any change to them and I, due to my previous reasons, lack any semblance of confidence that they won't mess it up.\nSolo Queue can have it's own negative review.  The game is centered around SWF, even if the devs don't want to admit it.  Why did we get BBQ and Chili?  The survivor counterpart was just for BP for the longest time, but the killer version also gets one of the most important aspects: Aura reading.  There ARE ways to counter, but let's also remind ourselves that the methods to counter are either unproductive (Locker hiding, or hiding close to the hook), or are very under powered (Even the devs had to buff Distortion because they knew with how much Aura Reading they gave killers now that no one would run it, and I doubt more than a few people, including myself, ever run it from the teammates I see playing).\nThe last thing I want to add is that I keep hearing any killer without an infinitely reusable exposed-like effect on their power or add-ons is under powered (Myers being an exception due to the additional slow effect and lack of any other power).  If killers are feeling that way, then there's an inherent issue with the game design itself.  1-shots shouldn't NEED to make the game fun for anyone.\nDon't forget that they nerfed Mettle of Man, the only good Ash perk, after people bought the DLC and there's no way to refund that.\nSBMM is really coming in handy when I either get a team of newbies vs a veteran killer or when it's just a newbie killer.  None of the matches I've had so far seem to be at the same skill level for everyone involved and I wonder why...  Maybe it's because they admit to how lazy they were making the SBMM that we see on stream \"It has so many factors that we somehow can't program in, despite the fact that we program in literally every single different interaction event into it's own category.\"  They don't care about it at all, clearly.\nSo far in 6th Anniversary, every person is sweaty and I can barely escape with any masks.  I've encountered everything in the book from people that 5 gen chase and camp (VALID STRAT SAYS THE DEV) to people that shake their character model and decide not to pick you up 'til the last second.  I guess this is what happens when they don't even try to read the notepad text boxes they call a report system.\nA 3 second long open hatch animation?  Really?  Why the fuck did you nerf keys so badly?  Are you guys that braindead?  They barely had any use at all and now they're worthless.  You guys really don't think at all about that decision did you?\nEvery single time I see a 5 min penalty for DCing against an unfun 4k that WASTES MY TIME makes me want to increase the amount of criticism I find because it's pretty much bottomless how much is wrong with this game and how much the devs ignore in favor of not actually testing out anything in the game.  6th anni comments are just there to say \"We're doing *something*,\" but we all know it's not playing simulated matches to see what needs to be buffed or nerfed.  It's quite literally just testing things in a vacuum and seeing if there's any problems, which overall doesn't amount to much in real matches.  You know how many times I see people exploit game design that NOTHING gets resolved over because they don't seem to punish anyone at all?  Yeah, I see everything from Pyramid head drop into creep without allowing me to instant crouch to shack trapper repeatedly tormenting.  NOTHING gets fixed.\nDid I forget to mention the scum tactics that should be looked out for and made sure they can't happen?  People that somehow magically find out where the end of the radius is for perks and deliberately encircle it just outside the range so it isn't eliminated?  There's really nothing they can do about that?  I'm pretty sure if they can make\"conspicuous actions\" and the new NOED change, they can give it a growing radius they can't be in for each hook state.\nAlso you need more indicators for perks like Distortion so people know not to crowd together.  It sucks moving away and EVERYONE follows.  The buff proves they didn't even pay it any attention since it was part of the most \"underused\" categories.  I bet no one bothered testing it past \"It works\".  Same for most of the other underrated perks, hence why some of the buffs are nonsensical.  Same with some of the nerfs too.  Self-Care?  Really?  People are still going to use it, but now matches are gonna take longer for chasers because they're still going to bring it anyways.  Thanks DBD, really makes me want to continue playing this hot garbage called a \"game\".\nI've also seen a lot of coercion based on names as well that don't seem to get punished \"Flan or DC\", great job guys, really doing your job keeping those guys at bay.  If someone else doesn't bring flan, it's on me apparently.  I'm sure those 5 mins mean the entire world to them.  Punish them for the entire event if they put that as their UN.  \"Change UN to matchmake\" would be nice, or ban them until anni is over.\nProbably gonna quit and uninstall after anni is over and the PTB changes get implemented to regular servers.  This game is a chore.\n\nAre there any positives about this game? None I can think of.  If I was asked back in 2016, I'd say this game, while still flawed back then, was fun.  I feel like this is attributed in part of the e-sports scene as well, which this game does NOT suit, especially when watching survivors at all.\n  It used to be a fun game at some point, but after consistent changes in the wrong direction, constant bandages on festering problems, and lack of pretty much anything, they've taken a short, but fun game into one that's basically a toxic saltfest that I wonder why I've ever played or even try to play.","timestamp_created":1641620330,"timestamp_updated":1656988023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107571055","author":{"steamid":"76561199074067497","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2125,"last_played":1650774445},"language":"english","review":"i like the killing","timestamp_created":1641620272,"timestamp_updated":1641620272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107570768","author":{"steamid":"76561199187016658","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":28415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5904,"last_played":1656926688},"language":"english","review":"monkey\n","timestamp_created":1641619883,"timestamp_updated":1641619883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107570516","author":{"steamid":"76561198316697759","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":29956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2537,"playtime_at_review":14548,"last_played":1660566638},"language":"russian","review":"Сама по себе игра не плоха, не дотягивает до \"хороша\".\n4/10.\nНо игра мертва, так как разработчики добавили кроссплатформенность из-за чего в игре есть пс4 и егс игроки.\nЧитеров много.
