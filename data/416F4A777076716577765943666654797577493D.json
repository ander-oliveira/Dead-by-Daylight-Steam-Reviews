De base tenía a los primeros cinco asesinos y a los que entraban en el paquete de Silent Hill y he comprado con fragmentos a la Legión, a la Plaga y a los Gemelos, es decir que no he jugado con ninguno de los asesinos licenciados a parte de Pyramid Head, ni con el cowboy de la pistola, ni con el Oni, ni con el penúltimo asesino\n\nEl juego en sí me parece divertido pero tiene bastantes problemas.\nPara empezar, lo bueno del juego:\n+Los Asesinos son muy variados, cada uno tiene sus propios poderes e intentar aprender como usarlos es bastante entretenido.\n\n+Los Supervivientes funcionan todos igual, así en vez de comprar el DLC para tener un Asesino y un Superviviente puedes ahorrar fragmentos (te los dan cada vez que subes de nivel) y cangearlos solo por el asesino (Nota: si el asesino es de una franquicia externa como Silent Hill o Halloween esto no es posible, lo cual es entendible por temas de licencias). Para que os hagais una idea en mis 300h he tenido suficiente para comprar tres asesinos y tengo para otros dos mas.\n\n+ La sensación de juego al jugar como asesino es inmejorable gracias a las animaciones y efectos de sonido cada vez que golpeas a un Superviviente.\n\n+Gráficamente está bien, los asesinos y supervivientes, especialmente los nuevos, tienen buena calidad, y los mapas (en mi opinión, se que hay gente a la que le parecen un poco tirando a generación pasada) también. Además parece ser que van a actualizarlos durante el próximo año, asi que se espera ver una mejora en aquellos que no han sido actualizados aún\n\n+En el mejor de los casos una partida será un toma y dale entre asesinos y supervivientes por el control del mapa en el que los supervivientes tienen que intentar arreglar los 5 generadores mientras el asesino ejerce presión para evitar que eso ocurra, en el que ambas partes intentarán ser más lista que la otra. A lo mejor el asesino en uno de los \"loops\" se da la vuelta para esconder su luz roja en medio de una persecución, haciendo que el superviviente piense que está yendo por el lado contrario y se tope de cara con él, o un superviviente es capaz de encadenar una serie de ventanas y palés haciendo que el asesino pierda un montón de tiempo persiguiendole a esquinas inhóspitas del mapa mientras sus compañeros hacen generadores.\n\n+Las partidas suelen ser rapidas entre unos 10-20 minutos\n\nLo malo:\n-La comunidad, sin duda, es una de las más tóxicas, al final de cada partida, no importa de qué lado estés lo mas probable es que te encuentres a gente echando sal hacia la otra parte. Mi recomendación es que directamente cerréis el chat y ni lo leáis (aunque hay veces en las que supervivientes hacen body-blocking al asesino o entre ellos, t-baggean etc, lo cual es bastante molesto)\n\n-El juego esta balanceado a favor de los supervivientes. Muchas veces un asesino se va a encontrar con que en el primer medio minuto de partida ya ha saltado uno de los generadores. Decisive Strike se supone que es para evitar que el asesino se centre en tí pero dura un minuto entero y muchas veces puedes llegar a toparte de casualidad con ese superviviente y que use esa perk sin haberle hecho focus (Por no hablar de los que nada mas ser liberados del gancho se tiran literalmente hacia tí, si les golpeas pierdes tiempo de ir a por el rescatador, si el rescatador tiene borrowed time tienes que golpearlo otra vez, si además lo recoges son otros 5s de aturdimiento por el DS y si no hacies ninguna de las dos tampoco te vas a poder mover porque te hace body-blocking) Si hay dos o mas supervivientes que son amigos y se estan comunicando en discord eso supone una gran ventaja porque se pueden coordinar y tener controlado al asesino Al menos han reworkeado las insta-curas, algo es algo.\n\n-Los asesinos, especialmente en rangos bajos tienden a centrarse en un unico superviviente cada vez o a quedarse a centimetros del gancho para que no se pueda rescatar a la persona enganchada, lo cual hace la partida bastante molesta (especialmente para el jugador en el gancho, que básicamente no juega lol)\n\n-Hay una tienda de cosméticos y un Battle Pass, entiendo que los asesinos y supervivientes sean DLC pagado pero eso la verdad es que no me agrada, pero bueno de algo tendran que sacar dinero.\n\n-Ha habido controversia con este ultimo parche porque con los nuevos asesinos tambien han entrado un monton de bugs (que me parece han/estan siendo solucionados). En el tiempo que ha estado jugando esta ha sido la unica ocasion en el que un parche ha dado tales problemas.\n\nAl final del dia me parece un juego bastante divertido, supongo que con amigos más pero yo he jugado principalmente solo jaja.","timestamp_created":1608586926,"timestamp_updated":1608586926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82845796","author":{"steamid":"76561198074285683","num_games_owned":664,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7565,"last_played":1609966980},"language":"spanish","review":"MUY BOEN JOEGO Q BLANDI NO TIENE JAJA","timestamp_created":1608585882,"timestamp_updated":1608585882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82845612","author":{"steamid":"76561198835087850","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1602430960},"language":"russian","review":"да)\n","timestamp_created":1608585672,"timestamp_updated":1608585672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82845498","author":{"steamid":"76561199013937361","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1655583161},"language":"german","review":"Voll cool","timestamp_created":1608585549,"timestamp_updated":1608585549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82845374","author":{"steamid":"76561198246645358","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":377,"playtime_at_review":5505,"last_played":1659623710},"language":"english","review":"Very enjoyable game alone but even better with friend's.

The more time you put into this game and the better you get the more problems you realise this game has. Time to list all of the problems I can think of off the top of my head.\n\n- Bug fix list is shorter than the list of known bugs\n- Survivors are all just re-skins of each other. Once you unlock a survivor's teachable perks they become the same. No unique mechanics like killers have.\n- The best perks stay as the best perks. You will see the same 10 perks over and over again unless someone wants to have fun, doesn't have the strong perks or they release a perk that is equally as strong as the current meta perks.\n- Content takes so long to unlock and if you want 1 of 7 licensed killers (killers from a movie or game series) then you have to pay for it. You get 5 of the 22 killers available in the game at the start and have to buy or earn the rest. You can bring an offering into game that removes the perks and add-ons your killer has to let you try a DLC killer for a game, but again you've got no perks which means you're going to do poorly.\n- Lots of cosmetics aren't available to buy with the earnable in-game currency for no reason, forces you to buy it if you want it. Some of the cosmetic sets take even more earnable in-game currency to unlock than the actual killers or survivors themselves.\n- The game has a battle pass despite the game costing £15 with £94 worth of DLC (not including cosmetic DLCs, actual playable content).\n- It seems no matter what they do the connection between you and the killer is terrible. The killer will hit you from a good meter away through pallets, vaults and through other people even with a 30-40ms connection to the servers.\n- Rank means nothing in this game. There is no reward for reaching anywhere on the ladder outside of an achievement. The higher you go in rank the sweatier the killers become and that is all.\n- Do well as survivor and get punished for it. If you run a killer around for too long, bring in a flashlight or press crouch once you're getting thrown on a hook and stared at for the rest of the game. In other words the community is hella sensitive.\n- Keys are pretty strong but they're getting nerfed soon iirc.\n- The balance team listens to Reddit.\n\nMy times playing killer are pretty enjoyable. I think most of the people that complain about killer being weak don't play the game properly.\nMaybe give it a bit before buying the game","timestamp_created":1608567619,"timestamp_updated":1608583800,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480582535266876221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82830183","author":{"steamid":"76561198145655682","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29076,"last_played":1656770053},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра чтобы побыть в атмосфере хоррора.

I wont get into why cuz you have a life and im not a writer , you have youtube for that. Again the concept is great and the game itself is kinda adictive. Everything else is trash.
