and Foremost, just a warning: If you can't handle large quantities of rage and salt, this game probably isn't the best pick for you. If you DO insist on giving it a try however, you can in fact mute the post game chat by hitting the chat bubble icon and *Boom* now you can hide from the killer or butcher the survivors in complete ignorance to what they have to say to you post game.\n\nNow for the real meat of the review. \n\nDead By Daylight (DBD) is a non-linear pvp horror game where 4 survivors seek to repair generators to power up exit gates to escape 1 killer who's goal is to down the survivors (takes 2 normal hits, HOWEVER several killers have abilities for a 1 hit down) and throw the poor miserable bastards on sacrificial hooks. Each survivor can be hooked up to 3 times, first hook Survivors can either way to be released by a teammate OR attempt to \"Kobe\" off hook. (you only get around 3 chances default to Kobe and each attempt has a 4% chance of actually succeeding) Second hook players have to repeatedly smash a button to avoid being outright killed by the Claws of \"The Entity\", a creature/god/being the Killers seek to please.\n\n Both parties have a whole toy box full of characters/perks/items to play with and try out builds, although at high ranks you can expect almost the same build for each character with very little in the way of variety. Catch 22... a lot of the \"good\" perks are DLC you either buy (most are very cheap so it's not too bad on the wallet) or save up on a resource called Iridescent shards that allow you to purchase perks you don't have yet. The shrine changes weekly and there's always two perks for survivor and killer available.\n\nThere are plenty of people on both sides of the game who will claim that the other has it easier or that the Devs favor the other and HONESTLY as a killer main... I would say the game is mostly balanced. The main problem isn't who has it easier, but rather, how bad the matchmaking is. I (at the time of this review, a rank 8 Killer Main) either go up against brand new survivors who are the equivalent of the meme of Patrick Star with the two-by-four plank stuck to his noggin', or go up against a full stack of Rank 1 survive with friends carrying optimal builds to either stall for time and/or rush the generators. This puts me in the position of either wanting to try a new fun and/or meme-y build on a killer only to get absolutely TRASHED by the SWF or only run the three killers I know like the back of my hand to occasionally go up against some rank 17 players who have almost no chance against me. I know this is something the Devs have addressed and are changing it very soon, along with some near-endless loops and questionable mapping.\n\nUltimately do I recommend the game? Yes. For all the issues it has at the moment, the Devs regularly put in new content and are changing up meta enough to keep me interested. In the 400+ hours I've played I've quite enjoyed myself. So why not give it a try eh?","timestamp_created":1587291885,"timestamp_updated":1587291885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508690059185028076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67617307","author":{"steamid":"76561198202333581","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":14675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":231,"playtime_at_review":1144,"last_played":1660570078},"language":"russian","review":"прикольно","timestamp_created":1587291656,"timestamp_updated":1588931344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67616741","author":{"steamid":"76561199047780372","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1650009290},"language":"italian","review":"bello ma ancora da migliorare","timestamp_created":1587291003,"timestamp_updated":1587291003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67616123","author":{"steamid":"76561198327826390","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":37689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30077,"last_played":1641045103},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight - A game about the battle between a Killer and four Survivors.\n\nIn this game you can either play as a Killer whose objective is to kill all or at least most of the Survivors by hooking them on sacrificial hooks provided by the mysterious Entity. Once a Survivor is hooked, they have a certain amount of time to be rescued. They also have three chances to try and get themselves off of the hook. This however speeds up the sacrifice process, putting the Survivor in the struggle phase (after three unsuccessful attempts). Once in the struggle phase, you have to continuously mash a button to avoid dying. In this phase, you are at the mercy of your teammates as you are busy fighting the Entity‘s Tentacles. Should you not be rescued, the Entity will kill you, leaving the other Survivors with a decreased chance of survival since the killer now has to deal with less people - or you can play as a Survivors. Your objective is to repair Generators to power the Exit Gates so that you can then escape. While repairing the Killer might come after you, causing you to have to run away if you don‘t want to die. While getting chased you‘re able to use your surroundings in order to get away. You could throw a pallet onto the Killer‘s Head, causing him to get stunned for a little bit, giving you just a little bit more time to run away. There are many more things but you should find them yourself.\n\nThis is most definitely a great, action filled game. But there are also a lot of frustrating moments that almost make you want to uninstall the game. Aside from that, there are a lot toxic players and also a few hackers, ruining the experience of everyone. Though all things considered, Dead by Daylight is still a great game that is getting updated regularly, adding new Killers, new Survivors and new mechanics.\n\nIn my opinion, it‘s a really fun game until you hit red ranks for the like 10th time. At that point the game kinda looses it‘s charm and it‘s only fun to play with your friends. This is mainly because one single mistake at Rank 1 will cause you to loose the Rank.\n\nDead by Daylight is a great game and I definitely recommend buying it if you‘re not sure.","timestamp_created":1587290215,"timestamp_updated":1599728803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67615278","author":{"steamid":"76561198930315723","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":907,"playtime_at_review":6444,"last_played":1660401926},"language":"schinese","review":"经常BUG，然后买了个声东击西的技能，妈的刷都刷不出来，有病的","timestamp_created":1587289118,"timestamp_updated":1611911388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67615249","author":{"steamid":"76561198842179742","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":108,"playtime_at_review":5915,"last_played":1659622014},"language":"schinese","review":"\n.\n..","timestamp_created":1587289083,"timestamp_updated":1587289083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67615116","author":{"steamid":"76561198984619808","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1893,"last_played":1653335320},"language":"russian","review":"игра супер\n","timestamp_created":1587288921,"timestamp_updated":1587288921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67614672","author":{"steamid":"76561198840535686","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1638666907},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING","timestamp_created":1587288317,"timestamp_updated":1587288317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67614240","author":{"steamid":"76561198450588285","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":6258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1264,"last_played":1655569791},"language":"english","review":"Good game.

Absolutely, balance is wacky but honestly the favor tips for either side easily. As a survivor I've messed some killers up but also gotten destroyed by some as well. As killer I destroy survivors but also sometimes they loop me for 3 gens then I want to disconnect but that's besides the point. \nSkill and just knowledge in this game are pretty useful, also survive with friends is probably the most useful out of everything in this god damn game. \nAnyway, this game is good but it's not for everyone.
