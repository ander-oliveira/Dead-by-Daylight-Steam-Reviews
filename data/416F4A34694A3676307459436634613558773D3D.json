I started the game, and played 2 games, 1 as survivor, and 1 as a killer. Both were intense and fun even for me, who can't even sit on my own couch and watch a horror movie, and hate jumpscares. I later found out my friend got home from work. I told him to download Dead by Daylight, so he did. Once we both started the game up, we had issues. We could not find a game, and it was impossible to find one. After 10 minutes, he just gave up. I tried right after he left, it worked again. I played 3 games after that. 2 of the 3 I escaped successfully. To be honest, this game has its ups and downs, but for $20 I think it is totally worth it. If you are not into the horror scene, this is a great starter introduction. For the gameplay, it is VERY good. It is very well enjoyable if you are alone, or if you have a full party of 5. The idea is unique and fun. Both sides- survivor and killer- are relatively equal. I would give this game a 8/10, for a great starting horror game. :)","timestamp_created":1471659110,"timestamp_updated":1471659110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25024139","author":{"steamid":"76561198093149805","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":52838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48465,"last_played":1658980500},"language":"english","review":"shit game","timestamp_created":1471658708,"timestamp_updated":1630744553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525139689445495605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25024108","author":{"steamid":"76561198092868937","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1051,"last_played":1658187913},"language":"english","review":"If you like running for your life and intense gameplay this is for you","timestamp_created":1471658559,"timestamp_updated":1471658559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25024076","author":{"steamid":"76561198017584804","num_games_owned":517,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":19523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":5487,"last_played":1660591835},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, good mechanics, bad matchmaking, buggy.

The Dead by Daylight community, unfortunately, has to be one of the more Toxic Communities I have come across. Everytime a DLC, Buff or Nerf is put into the game you will usually, if not always, see the discussions erupt saying how \"this is unfair\" and \"wow this is so broken\". One side is never happy when the other side gets something and vice versa. Not to mention, most of them are biased and will not be willing to listen to other opinions or options. Some of this 'Toxicity' may even rub off onto you, I know of many occasions where someone would screech about a certain person that we were playing against because of the way they played, sometimes the one screeching was even me. \n\nOne final thing to add (or more or less expand on my other point being the High-Rank Gameplay) is that it should be known that Killers will not always play in fun ways, i.e Camp the hooks, and survivors will also not play fun ways either, i.e 'Pallet Looping' which means you will waste a lot of time running around an object. \n\nOk, so I know the last thing was supposed to be the final but I remembered something important. It is possible your save file could be wiped so back up. I had mine completely wiped and lost 1000 hours worth. Now, the devs have a system now where they compensate you (which is much better now than when I lost my stuff) however, you should know that it could still happen (couple friends lost theirs recently).\n\nI recommend this game as I (obviously) spent a lot of time on it and all that time was enjoyable. The idea of Dead by Daylight is amazing.","timestamp_created":1471657890,"timestamp_updated":1504938661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513248980045318604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25023844","author":{"steamid":"76561198093271756","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":60525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5845,"last_played":1658655784},"language":"english","review":"is a great game, got a bit of a learning curve but once you learn all the mechanics it's good shit","timestamp_created":1471657208,"timestamp_updated":1471657208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25023833","author":{"steamid":"76561198078859678","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":34215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1652833847},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo top de terror, melhor ainda jogando com os amigos.

A style of game I've wanted to see for a long time. Overall, the game is enjoyable; especially with friends. There are a few options missing in the settings, such as more detailed graphical settings to change. And like every other game, it has its fair share of bugs, though. There are actually too many and a wide variety of bugs to go into so refer to other discussions and my notes below for information on that. To summarize, if you can hang on until the bugs get patched, give this game a try if you like the multiplayer, , survivalist, teamwork-oriented gameplay that Dead by Daylight has to offer.\n\n\nUpdated Notes - This portion will be edited as the game gets updated\nEdit #3 - Matchmaking appears to be degrading in quality again. Matches are getting harder and harder to find. Games are still seeming very one-sided. (ex. infinites are still spawning or killers are auto-aim hitting 5 feet through windows and past pallets).","timestamp_created":1471656043,"timestamp_updated":1472278898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25023645","author":{"steamid":"76561198161329967","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":21325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1198,"last_played":1655819823},"language":"thai","review":"#No more จูก for life","timestamp_created":1471656023,"timestamp_updated":1471656023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518248200416564941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25023642","author":{"steamid":"76561198196275278","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1175,"last_played":1655355407},"language":"english","review":"Fine game, but has many issues.

Many times I play and I'm unable to have a good time as I automatically associate anything where I'm failing to what I feel is unfair or unbalanced, even though there is good reasons or counters for them. But I cannot see them, leading to frustration, anger, and inappropriate rage until I've had enough.\n\nThe down vote is not for the game, it's for me. For not being able to see past losing and play just as a good sport. There is no need for a player like me that can become toxic to others playing this game, and therefore I must stop.\n\nGo have fun to those who can, you're clearly having a good time.","timestamp_created":1471650498,"timestamp_updated":1621147240,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25022426","author":{"steamid":"76561198156327971","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1659248923},"language":"english","review":"10/10 got scared","timestamp_created":1471650220,"timestamp_updated":1471650220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25022409","author":{"steamid":"76561198296183716","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1635255086},"language":"russian","review":"Игра мне очень понравилась правдо чутка лагает ну всё же я потёк...","timestamp_created":1471650170,"timestamp_updated":1471650170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25022391","author":{"steamid":"76561198144048290","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":66463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7519,"last_played":1656517865},"language":"english","review":"This game is masterpiece.It has so much things to discover as a guy who loves playing as a evil character this game give me what I want also it's really fun to play with friends","timestamp_created":1471650074,"timestamp_updated":1575330743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25022369","author":{"steamid":"76561198000422841","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":19493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19338,"last_played":1634443831},"language":"english","review":"paskaa","timestamp_created":1471649990,"timestamp_updated":1632621627,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491573035717010498","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25022333","author":{"steamid":"76561198032149918","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5366,"last_played":1602974141},"language":"english","review":"This game was super fun until the added a killer that you can not get away from, pls nerf you will lose players from this just saying.

De momento no recomiendo comprar el juego, ya que se pasa más tiempo esperando que jugando. Sin embargo, y lo vuelvo a repetir, la idea es muy buena y el juego entretenido. Espero que arreglen pronto estos fallos.\n\nANÁLISIS TRAS LAS RECIENTES ACTUALIZACIONES:\nParece que ya han arreglado, más o menos, el problema del matchmaking. He conseguido jugar 4 rondas sin tener que esperar un minuto. Realmente me alegra mucho que hayan arreglado este problema y que, por fín, podamos jugar sin tener que esperar mucho tiempo.
