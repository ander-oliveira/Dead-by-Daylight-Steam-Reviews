Jahresevent angefangen habe, zu meinen Lieblingsgames. Dies hatte verschiedene Gründe, die ich nun zusammenfassen möchte:\na) der große Reiz, spannende chases mit dem Killer einzugehen\nb) oftmals packende matches mit Killern, die faire games abgeliefert haben, ohne zu tunneln und zu campen\nc) SWF-games, um einfach eine tolle Zeit mit seinen Freunden zu verbringen\n\nIm Laufe der Zeit fiel mir natürlich auf, dass die Meinungsverschiedenheiten von Seiten der Killer- und Surv-Spielern so unterschiedlich sind, dass beide Parteien sich gefühlt wie die Pest hassen. Killer neigen dazu, viele games zu campen oder survs rauszutunneln. \nLaut eurer Idee soll das alles auch erlaubt sein, weil ansonsten würdet ihr das ja auch punishen.\nNun haben wir das Problem, dass ihr für solche Tunnelgeschichten perks wie \"DStrike\" eingebaut habt, um dies besser unterbinden zu können. Aber durch das NEUE Update, welches einen DS-Nerf mit sich gebracht hat, habt ihr den Killern das TUNNELN noch DEUTLICH EINFACHER gemacht. Lustigerweise meintet ihr mit dem neuesten Update und der Basis-BT-Regelung das Tunneln und Campen entschärfen zu wollen. Im Laufe der kurzen Zeit fällt aber auf: Die Killer campen nun VIEL ÖFTER und tunneln auch VIEL ÖFTER die survs raus, weil durch die erhöhte Gen-Time es dem Killer einfacher gemacht wird, die Spiele zu gewinnen, weil die survs zu dritt kaum noch einen nennenswerten gen-progress gewähren können. \n\nNun stellt sich mir die Frage: Wie kann es sein, dass ihr all das zulasst? Ihr bemerkt, dass die meisten Spieler, die NICHT killern, ziemlich unzufrieden mit dem Spiel sind. Das belegen auch die neuesten Rezensionen und die LANGE Killer-Wartezeit, weil kaum noch einer Surv spielen möchte. \n\nIhr habt das Glück, dass ich generell noch das Spiel spiele, weil ich mich über dem durchschnittlichen Skillniveau sehe. Jedoch merke ich, dass schwächere Spieler im Allgemeinen durch den neuen Patch noch viel MEHR STRUGGELN, weil ihr für die Chases mit den Killern auch noch die ganzen Zeiten (Stun-time, DS, Hit-Duration, etc.) heruntergeschraubt habt zugunsten des Killers. Dies macht es ergo für die schwächeren Spieler noch schwieriger, chases aufrechterhalten zu können. Mit der Folge, dass sie deutlich schneller down gehen und der Killer mithilfe der neuen und sehr OP-lastigen Gen-Slowdown-Perks den Gen-Progress relativ einfach verhindern kann. \n\nIch höre immer mehr von vielen Spielern und von Streamern (ich schaue mir auf Twitch sehr gerne DBD-Content an, obwohl es derzeit sehr anstrengend ist, diesen mit viel Spaß verfolgen zu können), die die Lust an diese Spiel allmählich oder gar ganz verlieren. \n\nEs kann nicht euer Ziel sein, die Surv-Spieler so weit zu dezimieren, dass es hinterher kaum noch welche gibt und die Killer dementsprechend noch längere Wartezeiten haben werden. Witzig finde ich eh die Tatsache, dass Killer-Spieler, die eh schon LANGE auf ein game warten müssen, dieses auch noch mit diesen perfiden Tunnel-und Camping-Strategie spielen, als würden diese matches ihr Spielerlebnis auf ein neues Level hieven. Warum nicht einfach ein fairer Spieler sein, der ALLEN Spielern eine aufregende und tolle Spielspaß-Garantie gewährt? Kein Wunder, dass die Gemüter sich dadurch weiter erhitzen und beide Lager verbal aufeinander losgehen und sich toxic verhalten, welches sich im Spiel durch \"teabagging\", \"flashlights\" wiederspiegeln. Ferner habe ich auch den Eindruck, dass die Killer uns Survs schon als absolut toxic bezeichnen, wenn man sie mit Paletten stunnt, oder sie flashlight und über Fenster vaulted. \n\njedenfalls...\n\ndas Spielerlebnis ist aktuell sehr TOXIC und einfach UNSCHÖN. Killer spielen NUR noch auf 4Ks, weil sie ansonsten wohl das Gefühl bekommen, nicht gut genug gewesen zu sein. Selbst dieses Problem müsstet ihr eig verbessern, dass man jedem klar macht, dass 4K NICHT das Spielerlebnis eines Killers prägen und ausmachen soll.\n\nGenug geredet...","timestamp_created":1659391905,"timestamp_updated":1659391905,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666626930236816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119905119","author":{"steamid":"76561199368498139","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":934,"playtime_at_review":997,"last_played":1660600647},"language":"spanish","review":"...","timestamp_created":1659391462,"timestamp_updated":1659391462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119904786","author":{"steamid":"76561198261697940","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":81346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2696,"playtime_at_review":78649,"last_played":1660600038},"language":"spanish","review":"nerfean tanatofobia porque los survis son unos llorones y los devs unos viejos chot0s que ni juegan DBD.Asco de las premades y de que no hagan nada con demuestra lo que vales.Asco de los genrusheros, asco de desarrolladores.CHUPENLA","timestamp_created":1659390998,"timestamp_updated":1659390998,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119904486","author":{"steamid":"76561198045736246","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":14640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14640,"last_played":1658132581},"language":"english","review":"Meh, i get killed alot.","timestamp_created":1659390604,"timestamp_updated":1659390604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119904478","author":{"steamid":"76561199083662176","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1621,"playtime_at_review":30199,"last_played":1660588235},"language":"english","review":"games kinda nice like you may end up hating everyone including yourself but not to the extent of other games like rainbow six, rocket league, and fifa","timestamp_created":1659390596,"timestamp_updated":1659390596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119904000","author":{"steamid":"76561199244246204","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2344,"playtime_at_review":3015,"last_played":1660081325},"language":"english","review":"good soup","timestamp_created":1659389967,"timestamp_updated":1659389967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119903977","author":{"steamid":"76561199080320186","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1300,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1660421369},"language":"russian","review":".\n","timestamp_created":1659389943,"timestamp_updated":1659389943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119903959","author":{"steamid":"76561199309021446","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2852,"playtime_at_review":4275,"last_played":1660599036},"language":"russian","review":"goat","timestamp_created":1659389921,"timestamp_updated":1659389921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119902065","author":{"steamid":"76561198056838285","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":61652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61652,"last_played":1658629041},"language":"english","review":"They ruined the game by bringing huge nerfs to survivors.

I was invested, I enjoyed playing killer solo and joining my friends in survivor queue even when it was stinky and sweaty. It had times when I wouldn't touch it (around reset) and I was frustrated as much as I was satisfied by my time in the game, but with the newest update reworking the vast majority of the perks and, most importantly, resetting everyone's character skills to locked if you hadn't prestiged, I've finally given up the ghost and uninstalled. \n\nI had managed to finally unlock all the survivor and killer perks on all the characters about a month before the release of the Dredge update by leveling characters to level 40 - this was just about aIl I wanted to do, because it gave me the flexibility to play whoever I wanted at any time. It also took nearly 1000 hours to get that far. Now? After the update, all my builds are a mess and all those hard-earned skills I had finally managed to unlock? Gone because I prestiged for an absolutely absurd and useless \"reward\" the devs knew weren't going to be satisfactory. I would have rather had a cosmetic than a filter for my character profiles. Honestly, it's all just deeply offensive that they'd take for granted a loyal playerbase this much. People were constantly asking for clarification on the new prestige system via social media and the official forums, and to let people reset all their characters to prestige them for something that nobody else even sees? Bad move. Worse move to say you'd reward players for perks already unlocked, without actually making it clear that you'd only keep them unlocked on characters who had managed to find them in the Bloodweb already, We were never given a clear or transparent answer from the devs, now I feel like I've lost hundreds of gameplay progress, and I'm done. Uninstalled today, and will not be coming back any time soon.\n\nAllegedly the new system was to 'reduce the grind' -- well, how's this for a grind: with no skills unlocked, it now takes 283 million BP to unlock all character perks at P3, whereas before you only had to level characters up to level 40 to simply unlock the skills in all the webs. \n\nHappy grinding everyone.
