Das Spiel ist zudem nicht teuer, zwar sind die DLCs etwas unnötig (aufgrund Extrakosten), aber man braucht sie nicht zwingend um Spaß am Spiel zu haben. Das Spiel kann für einen Anfänger schon schwer sein, aber man findet sich recht leicht ein in der Welt von Dead by Daylight. Es gibt zwar immer noch einige Probleme bei dem Spiel, da es ziemlich nervig ist, wenn man einen Camper als Killer hat oder der Killer regelrecht auf den Tod wartet, dass ist allerdings nicht sehr schlimm, da es viele gute Runden gibt. Als Killer hat man auch eine Vielfalt an Möglichkeiten wie man spielen möchte, da jeder seine eigenen Fähigkeiten hat. Es gibt schon sehr viele Momente indem das Spiel nervt, allerdings würde ich das Spiel dennoch empfehlen, da es sehr viel Spaß macht. Zudem hat dieses Spiel auch eine größtenteils freundlich und hilfsbereite Community, die sich auch für andere Opfern, obwohl sie sie nicht kennen. Immer noch ein tolles Spiel nach 4 Jahren.","timestamp_created":1500828869,"timestamp_updated":1606414228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578157126903533936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33747934","author":{"steamid":"76561198074367573","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":36295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11777,"last_played":1586284811},"language":"russian","review":"Наиграл уже вроде бы почти норм часов.

Не умею мансовать и всегда бегу вперед, в надежде, что я быстрее, но нихуя подобного. Короче игра все еще держит в своей атмосфере, не смотря на колличество часов. Игра кайф.
