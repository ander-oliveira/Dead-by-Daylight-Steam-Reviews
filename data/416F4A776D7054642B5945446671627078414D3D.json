Any decent player knows any of the killers are so OP that it's laughably easy to sacrifice all 4 survivors every round.  The most recent killer buffs and survivor nerfs along with the super toxic environment for the anniversary event left a bad taste in my mouth.  The killers getting mad don't understand the point system (more discovery, chasing, damaging, etc leads to more BP and more pips).  As a trial I went from Ash IV to Gold IV in 2 hours as killer when I actually tried.  I can't imagine that being possible as a survivor with all the tunneling, camping, and aura perks everyone runs now.  I bought all the DLC, Rift pass, and some cosmetics and now lament spending so much money on a game that is on a downward spiral.  Playing against NPCs would be a nice option to add because load times can be extremely aggravating.  Sometimes I'll go do something in the other room for a while knowing it won't be loaded anyway.","timestamp_created":1657688402,"timestamp_updated":1657688402,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118730613","author":{"steamid":"76561199102821783","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1617,"last_played":1658525967},"language":"brazilian","review":"ruimmmmmmmmmm","timestamp_created":1657688283,"timestamp_updated":1657688283,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118730387","author":{"steamid":"76561198297032107","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1639450548},"language":"english","review":"No","timestamp_created":1657687876,"timestamp_updated":1657687876,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118729821","author":{"steamid":"76561198849709127","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3654,"last_played":1657633105},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom\n","timestamp_created":1657686826,"timestamp_updated":1657686826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118729794","author":{"steamid":"76561198968402583","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":14128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13554,"last_played":1658113169},"language":"english","review":"can

Without getting into the fact that rubberbanding being in the game for over a month with no fix from the devs(insane). The developers want to make the game more competitive but at its core it is best realized as an arcade style game. I really want this game to be good, they have a lot of cool intellectual property licenses and the devs seem passionate. The issue is there are aspects of the game that are inherently imbalanced. There are perks in this game that you have to run on certain killers for the killer to be viable, but there are killers you can run zero perks on and you will still have an easy time. \nTake michael myers, if you do not run corrupt intervention and other gen slow down, you will lose. put those perks on nurse, spirit or blight and it is an automatic win. The developers want to frequently push balance changes to these perks because they have high use and win rates, but it cripples the more difficult killers. Now with the relatively recent addition of MMR, you can't play very casually. You will rarely get matched against survivors or killers that are playing creative builds, or having fun with the game. \nI think there are two viable options for making this game fun\n1: Get rid of MMR altogether (worse option)\n2: Don't balance perks to be equivalent in value, instead instate a point based build system. It is an impossible task to have a diverse set of perks, and also have a good competitive game balance. Instead keep the overpowered perks and killers overpowered. Here is an example with arbitrary numbers. When making a loadout you get 7 points, killers like nurse/spirit/etc cost 4 points to use, then perks are ranked between 3-1 points in cost. So if you want to use ruin (pre-nerf), then that is your only perk if you are an S tier killer. Include the same system for survivor, obviously there arent character specific abilities or stats so make it only based on their perks. Using a system like this would allow for using less meta, but more creative perk combinations. Say you pick michael, and D tier killers cost 1 point, then you have 6 point available. You could run ruin undying, or instead you could make a vault speed stealth build using 6 not very good perks. Same story for survivors, they could choose dead hard and circle of healing as a two perk load out; or they could have a plethora of low tier perks to experiment and synergize with. This system allows for such a large diversity of play styles. It would be so much more fun, and would stop the need for balancing around killers whose base kits are always going to be overpowered unless they are entirely reworked.","timestamp_created":1657669271,"timestamp_updated":1657669271,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118720182","author":{"steamid":"76561198815360631","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":114524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4395,"playtime_at_review":107064,"last_played":1660601028},"language":"brazilian","review":"viciante","timestamp_created":1657669189,"timestamp_updated":1657669189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118720138","author":{"steamid":"76561199176129490","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3176,"last_played":1659160759},"language":"english","review":"BAD BUT GOOD. you know what i mean\n","timestamp_created":1657669132,"timestamp_updated":1657669132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118720068","author":{"steamid":"76561198465459648","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3650,"playtime_at_review":4725,"last_played":1660411246},"language":"english","review":"fun stuff","timestamp_created":1657669040,"timestamp_updated":1657669040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118720010","author":{"steamid":"76561198172635894","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1657742886},"language":"english","review":"is fun","timestamp_created":1657668909,"timestamp_updated":1657668909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118719924","author":{"steamid":"76561198992360318","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":713,"playtime_at_review":18690,"last_played":1660449705},"language":"english","review":"This game is extremely wacky and wacky also fun","timestamp_created":1657668680,"timestamp_updated":1657737527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118719719","author":{"steamid":"76561198085188742","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":12184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":87,"playtime_at_review":11508,"last_played":1660500327},"language":"english","review":"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outplayed players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have \"thick skin\", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.\nTalking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game:\n- It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000 hours to gain them all for free.\n- The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't.\n- The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money.\n- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved when the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases.\n- Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR at the moment.\n- The support isn't really helpful and deals with certain issues quite poorly.\nPlease, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.\n\nI would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers.\nThe community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request has been dismissed until recently.\nOne of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income.\nI don't know about you but treating people with poor ability to determine colors like that is speaking volumes about the overall way the developers treat their community.","timestamp_created":1657659848,"timestamp_updated":1657659848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118713756","author":{"steamid":"76561199239551468","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1660592529},"language":"spanish","review":".l.","timestamp_created":1657659239,"timestamp_updated":1657659239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118713425","author":{"steamid":"76561199171505453","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":80069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3844,"playtime_at_review":73438,"last_played":1660537457},"language":"english","review":"The game is just addicting and has a lot a of lags. bugs, and is not the best.
