I have chosen the latter, and would strongly recommend this game if you are interested in killing other players. As a whole, the dev team works hard to balance the strengths of both \"classes\". Some of these balances are controversial and don't accomplish the goal 100%, but it does make for a fun game. The system of ranking in the game, ranging from 20 (low) to 1 (high), is decided by your performance in each game. Your rank goes up through obtaining pips, marks achieved through gaining 10k points throughout the 4 categories of each character. The reason I love this system, is that you can rank up without surviving or killing anybody. It gives you the ability to toy around with your victims as the killer, while still doing enough to pip. It allows for survivors to have good teamwork and help to recover each other and rank even without surviving themselves (surival being 5k points). Overall, I would recommend this game due to the fun it has brought and the competitive environment.

A LOBBYでゲームを始めようとするとロード画面でロゴが脈打った状態で止まり、一向にゲームが始まらないというものです。これは通称ドックンバグと呼ばれており、このバグが起きると本人はロビーに入ることが出来ていないにも関わらず、他のプレイヤーからは入室出来ているように見え、このまま放置しておくとバグに見舞われたプレイヤーが欠けた状態でゲームが始まったり、永遠にロードが終わらないままになったりしてしまいます。\n対策としては、サバイバー側でプレイする際は、SURVIVE WITH FRIENDSから始めるとバグが起きないようです。ただ一戦毎にいちいちこの手順を踏まなければならない為、若干面倒ではあります。それかバグが起きたらすぐゲームを終了させれば他の人の迷惑にはなりません。キラーはホストになる為、ロビーを立てる側となりますがロビーチャットはサバイバーにしか出来ませんので、ギリギリまで待ってもREADYを押さないサバイバーがいた場合はロビーを一旦解散した方が安心かもしれません。\n\nまた、その他、スキルやアイテム装備の制限を一部外せて仕舞うバグがあり、主にHILLBILLY以外のキャラがチェーンソーを持っている、サバイバーがTRAPPERの罠を持っている、優秀なスキルを重ね掛けしている、キラーがDWIGHTのBondやCLAUDETTEのEnpathyといったサバイバー側のスキルを持っている場合などが多いです。ネタ的な意味合いが強い場合もありますが大体がゲームバランスの壊れたマッチングになってしまいます、意図的にやらなければ起きないバグ利用ですので、このバグの利用者に当たってしまった場合は通報やブロックなどをお勧めします。\n\n以上、バグの為に現在、ゲームの楽しさが損なわれてしまっている感がありますが、それでもドックンバグは回避できますし、悪質なバグ利用者はごく一部だと思われます。\nゲーム性は大変素晴らしく、最初はすぐにキラーに見つかり捕まってしまう、サバイバーが全然見つけられず脱出されてしまうと思いますが、何度かプレイしていくうちにコツがわかって来ます。キャラの成長要素もあり、スキルやアイテムの構成を工夫していくうちに自分なりのプレイ方法が確立してきます。\n上手く逃げ延びられたり、サバイバーを捕まえたり出来るようになった時の喜びはひとしおです、是非ともプレイしてみて欲しいと思います。\n\n追記：アプデが入り、細かなバグはまだ残っていますが上記2点のバグは解消されています。","timestamp_created":1482972811,"timestamp_updated":1487460434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548517704010009766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28772441","author":{"steamid":"76561198189468103","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":158834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1649039335},"language":"english","review":"After 3 years since I posted my initial review on DBD, I thought I'd return to the old one and update it. Has the game improved since 2016? Yes! Is it worth the current price? Ehh, maybe. I still would consider no, but this time, a soft no\n\nDBD has fixed many issues over the years, and I can say that the game is more optimized and more fleshed out than it was 3 years ago. Reports actually do something now, connections are more stable, and there are considerably less times the game freezes up on you.\n\nHowever, the game still has its issues, some of which still persists from launch. The infamous 'infinite loading screen' bug still occurs (although rarer today) forcing you to fore the close the game and restart. Despite having 'dedicated servers' the connections of lobbies are still mostly centered on the host's connection so if the hosts starts lagging, or lag switching, you're gonna feel it even if you joined a lobby with less than 150 MS. Community events are few and far between, and the early game hell is still very real, due to the huge number of killers in the game, and the lack of a proper tutorial. Queue times as killer can also be very long, and sometimes it can take up to 5 minutes just for the game to \"create\" the lobby.\n\nIt's not all bad, however those are the prominent issues with the game. Cosmetics are decent, and progression is manageable. My advice: Pick the game up during a free weekend or during a sale, and try ut out for yourself. If you can handle the connection and technical issues that come with it, then it is definitely a fun (and frustrating) game to enjoy!","timestamp_created":1482972190,"timestamp_updated":1561268129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517551422119140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28772400","author":{"steamid":"76561198203821244","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":9553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6295,"last_played":1577157974},"language":"english","review":"One of the best Co-op Survival games I've ever played.\n","timestamp_created":1482972089,"timestamp_updated":1482972089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28771977","author":{"steamid":"76561198024021600","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":46229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1631295428},"language":"french","review":"bon kiffe !","timestamp_created":1482971025,"timestamp_updated":1482971025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28771472","author":{"steamid":"76561198011781853","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1636159915},"language":"english","review":"Dead in the Lobby.
