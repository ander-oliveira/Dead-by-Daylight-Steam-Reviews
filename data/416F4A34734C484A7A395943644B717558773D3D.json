The other side to that as you can imagine is that the game just doesn't work. At all. One word to sum up the entirety of this game would indeed be \"broken\", which I hesitate to use on anything that doesn't deserve it. Well Dead By Daylight, you do deserve it, well done. Every patch that gets released seems to only make new problems and barely fix the old as well.\n\n\nDLC: The first pay for DLC is out now, and the first thing I see is...cosmetics. Cosmetics that they didn't even try for a reskin. It's literally just the same clothes you can always wear only recolored slightly and actually...kind of really garishly. I get it's supposed to be 80's wear but it's just kind of disgusting. Well done, thanks for the terrible skins that are just the same clothes with different colors, oh and you want me to pay for that? Hah Hah, God, you really are funny people you know that? \n\n\n\nFix your goddamn game. We should not have to wait a half hour for a single match, only to get killed within 2 minutes (somtimes less if there is a good killer) and have to restart the wait. We keep recieving patches that seem to completely divert the attention of the community away from their outcries of pain at the game's state. Minor, insignificant things are being changed such as little speech bubbles in the chat and new icons for the spacebar appearing onscreen. This aggrivates a few players I've talked to because they feel it's akin to asking an ice cream shop for a scoop of chocolate, and them handing you pure white vanilla with chocolate chips while they grin and take your money. New content gets added that only aggrivates players more because none of it makes any sense, like they didn't even think about it past having the idea, coding it, and putting it in the game. Things get nerfed, perks get changed, and none of it seems to be for the better. It almost seems like we're left to just keep on guessing what their priorities are or what they are thinking. \n\nAn amazing concept for a game, creative, fresh, and awesome, you just failed horribly in the execution and making it worthy of being played. You have to fix the core issues of the game itself, or you will lose your fans, and I do not want that with the amount of potential this game has. Perhaps I have been ignorant in this review because I do not fully understand your process.

[b](Irony)[/b]\n [b]Why I'm writing this review?[/b]\nBehaviour said they want keep the horror theme. \nBecause as i played since [b]2016[/b] It was hard game to play it. Now they must everything change to easy level for kids because they crying how hard it is (for example HEX: RUIN) We must take experience and learn to hit a [b]GREAT[/b] Skill Check. Full pallets map. We started the game when they came out, we started with a lot of training. Now it's everything about winning and T-Bagging by the gate. Next I remembered event how you must collect some orange jelly from flowers and you could buy a skin for it. That was awesome but now you can buy it by SHARDS! So that by chance one can't pull out that he has something that others don't.\nBefore I started playing, we had to work together as a team! Co-op! Now as I look someone is hooked and other still doing generator and let him die or someone crouching in bush and waiting how killer kill everybody. \nBehaviour actively disrespects their community. And they asked us to vote for the Steam Awards? The community is spitting on you! \nThey trying to fix everything but every two months update brings alot bugs.\nNow this \"BIG\" update of new movement of survivors ruined everything... Again hitbox suck and they are at the beginning again. I am actually writing this review about the last update.\nThey received feedback from players in PTR that nobody liked it and implemented the changes anyway... As I said, This update have BIG bugs and glitches about hit boxes, broken walls, Bus changed to how Killer can't go through.\nNext thing, The developers launch a game full of bugs and instead of fixing them they just do stupid update. And when players discover a bug in the game, the developers banned players to the game for exploiting instead of fixing the bug. They do not admit a mistake. If the bugs exist, why should't people use them? It is the developers problem. The solution there is to fix the bugs and not banning the people. \n\n-That's all I've thought of so far.\nPS: Sorry for my English\nThis game died on 09.02.2021","timestamp_created":1471554535,"timestamp_updated":1637502720,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532908737659454346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25000173","author":{"steamid":"76561198228915564","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1308,"last_played":1563543288},"language":"czech","review":"Very nice game, but new update broke lobby","timestamp_created":1471554465,"timestamp_updated":1471554465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25000160","author":{"steamid":"76561198271467632","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":50716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3351,"playtime_at_review":14576,"last_played":1660607348},"language":"english","review":"Very good game.

Some of the structures are all the same, but they are placed differently every match. Once you hear the heartbeat and give into a chase your heart will start pumping fast.\n\nThere's also the thrill of the kill as you can play as one of three killers. The Wraith is a killer which has the ability where you can mask your heartbeat and turn invisible, but while you're invisible you can't attack anyone. The Trapper which has traps he can use to trap survivors with well placed beartraps and the The Hillbilly which has a chainsaw which gives him an infinite sprint. All killers have strengths and weaknesses and it boils down to your preference. \n\nNow I love this game and I think it's a really fun experience, but it has too many issues to get a positive rating from me. \n\nFirst of all this games community is absolute trash. It's filled with salty people, who quit as soon as they are dead and killers who aren't able to kill anyone in the match. If a killer leaves the match before you escape then you're gonna derank which is absolute garbage.\n\nThe matchmaking is also terrible. It takes forever to get into a game and is even worse for Survive With Friends, it takes around 15 minutes (sometimes even more) to get into a single game, which is absurd since most games last the exact amount of time.\n\nThe game also has bugs like character models glitching, items disappearing before the match starts and many more to list here.\n\nOverall Dead By Daylight is an incredibly fun game, but it's too buggy right now for a positive rating. If it was more stable I would say it's definitely worth it, but as of now, wait for a lot of fixes.\n\nPros:\n+ Terrifying and intense\n+ Fun gameplay for both survivors and killers\n\nCons:\n- BUGS,BUGS,BUGS,BUGS\n- The abandoned survivor/killer system is broken\n\nFinal Rating \n6/10\n","timestamp_created":1471553695,"timestamp_updated":1471553695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598840415477752686","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24999906","author":{"steamid":"76561197960743698","num_games_owned":2951,"num_reviews":315,"playtime_forever":12832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1561,"playtime_at_review":2859,"last_played":1660503211},"language":"english","review":"Would let my love kill me over and over again. 10/10 Worth it!","timestamp_created":1471553575,"timestamp_updated":1476006235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24999894","author":{"steamid":"76561197992300452","num_games_owned":444,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2957,"last_played":1471554431},"language":"english","review":"Stop releasing new content before you bug fix the game.

The play with friends queue system is absolutely horrible, it is basically a game of pressing ready up every 8 or so seconds. Granted it is better than lobby hopping before they even had the survive with friends mode, but still nonetheless frustrating. Another huge annoyance is having players from other regions in your game, it gives killers an unfair lag advantage and I hope they set up a better location system in the future. My final complaint is the latest updates which seem to favor the killer more than anything. This is subjective however I don't think many people enjoy a teleporting killer with wallhacks very much.

It looked super fun to try with my friends.\n\nThe short answer: this game is actually really fun. When you actually get queued up, it's a refreshingly addictive asymmetrical multiplayer survival game. I had to contain my screams and heavy breathing at 3am while I hid below a window in a room--watching the killer pacing outside, looking for me.\n\nThis leads to the problem: THE QUEUEING. Sure, go ahead and change your Steam download region as recommended in some forum posts, but it won't help. I have spent 4.6 hours playing the game, but really, I've successfully matched in only about 4 games during that time. We had to make custom private matches to keep playing (which isn't nearly as fun).\n\nLong queue times isn't necessarily the problem: the \"Ready!\" interface is confusing and (I'm pretty sure) buggy as hell. You press \"Ready!\" with your team to be kicked out of queue instantly because \"No matches found.\" You will then spend 20 minutes pressing \"Ready!\" and repeating this process before actually finding a game. You will then have a high chance of the people you are matched with leaving because you're a noob or because there's lag. Or, maybe you think you're surviving really well until you randomly win while fixing a generator you blew up four times--because the killer either DC'd or just plain quit.\n\nMaybe the free weekend will get more people to play and more matches can be found.\n\nTLDR: \nThe game is good. \nThe queueing system is terrible. \n10/10 if you play either alone or with at least four people (as survivors). \n5/10 if you try to play with one or two friends because good luck finding a game.","timestamp_created":1471551497,"timestamp_updated":1471551497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24999353","author":{"steamid":"76561198015560753","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":80957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":15747,"last_played":1659658724},"language":"german","review":"Supergeiles Game an sich...\n jederzeit würde ich es wieder kaufen..,,Tolle Spielidee...\nSuchtgefahr....\naber seit dem Neuen Update funzen die Server nicht mehr richtig...\nProbleme find ich auch gibt es immer mit den Servern,...\ndas ewige klicken nervft einfach...bis man eine Lobby hat...auch wenn man mit Freunden spielen will.\nVieleicht kann man dort noch eine andere Lösung finden....\nGruß BEULE","timestamp_created":1471551492,"timestamp_updated":1471551492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545262575149536133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24999341","author":{"steamid":"76561198031688678","num_games_owned":787,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":21467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8928,"last_played":1620924373},"language":"english","review":"I really wanted to like this game but Dead by Daylight has still too many bugs for an released game. \n\nIf you looking forward to play this game with your friends get ready to be frustrated because the Queuetimes and Queue System is buggy as hell.
