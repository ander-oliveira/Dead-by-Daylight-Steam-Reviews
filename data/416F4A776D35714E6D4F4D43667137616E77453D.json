DbD is meant to be fun multiplayer horror game with co-op and is good with friends and also played mostly with friends and well.. Guess what, you have to actually tryhard on this game and when you are having fun with friends... Experts will call you out for  enjoying playing, and thus you are ''being toxic'.' Well ofc you can have family friendly party but killer won't hesitate and will immidietly penetrate you. There's really not much grind and when i bought my first characters i thought i won't buy any more than that and hey i bought another 4 because the licensed DLC's are great (for sure i don't say this just because i'm life-less gamer without reason to spend money or anything else *cough* *cough*). I like the perks and mechanics but few of them feel somewhat old and for this reason, I've been suggesting several times some new ways to freshen this game to devs and hey, they actually listened and added at least breakable doors (one of the things i thought of) so i was satisfied.\n\n[+] \n+ Original idea that is greatly executed with dedication from devs\n+ Communicative Developers\n+ Great atmosphere (only if you actually take some time to take this game seriously)\n+ Really fun with friends \n+ Rewards are nice and especially when there is some event like xmas and i like that a lot so grinding levels and perks is kinda easy\n+ Pretty nicely made mechanics, perks, graphics/visuals, playermodels, details\n+ Licensed DLC's which are fun to play with\n+Actually has entertaining lore\n\nNow it's time for my less favorite part of this review\n\n[-]\n- Bugs, Lags, and it's a really annoying thing in this game\n- Hitboxes feels like the killer hits you from different solar system\n- From like rank 12 (don't know that equals in new gRadE system) it will give you feeling of \n  playing slot machine because you either get such bad teammates that you just can't just \n  CAN'T or on the other side, you'd get bad killer so \n  then it's only XP farming and that's not fun and it just gets boring and it is kind of based on \n  luck when you play soloQ\n- Community just too bad and salty, not worth further discussions\n- Not much enjoyable for new players because like i said, they will most likely get placed \n   poorly cuz of the ranking system and the tutorial just isn't helpful and it doesn't tell you the \n   REAL game rules like looping and juking, or something not really written like diff. roles in a \n   match that are in DbD.\n- Gets kinda repetitive when you are expirienced player already and you know the \n  mechanics. They did add like breakable doors and the end game but they could add more \n  details that won't even hurt the game because you really then just play and play like in a \n  loop and you're just kinda hanging around and doing the same thing over and over even tho \n  you know that if you die you still escape. ''Death is not an escape'' btw. Would be cool thing \n  to add maybe like a really really quick skillcheck during the time killer found you in locker \n  would be enough to make og's like me happy idiots jumping on our wheelchairs\n \nThis game will be getting some big visual updates so it doesn't look that bad and i think that DbD community could actually finally bring new players and rise but please, don't play the same game as me if you are toxic twat :) thx.

just hit my 1200 hours played mark. Every hour I gain on this game it becomes more and more apparent to me that this game will remain in it's broken state forever. Every late hit after a pallet throw, every other lobby you join ends up freezing at the loading screen, every new game breaking bug that comes out with every \"patch fix\". I held out hope that at least one of the Dev's actually cares about our ideas and issues with the game, but there are bugs that are still in the game from when I started playing (Sep. of 2017).\n\nI even went on McLean's Twitch while he was streaming today and asked, \"Hey instead of rolling out a new killer / survivor this coming month, how about we get like 1GB+ of bug fixes.\" His response was this: \"No brakes on the chapter train; choo choo.\" At first I just laughed it off. But judging how DbD is getting lower and lower in the browse section of Twitch, and DbD is on sale for $10 every other week, and the fact they keep cranking out money only clothing for characters, I have a feeling this game is going to come to an end soon. And they're just trying to scrap up some cash before it happens. Look what happened to Deathgarden. It lasted what a month?\n\nI know Behaviour is a small Indie company. I get that. BUT there are some small Indie games that I've played that have received MUCH MORE love from their Devs (The Forest for example). Like I stated to McLean, if they just took a 3 month period off from coming up with some new killer everyones gonna hate and work on bug fixes, it would help the game go a long way. If this game was in Alpha or Beta, it would make a lot of sense. But to be this broken and be a full release? Shame.\n\nI hope someone on the fence about this game reads this and decides not to join the toxic dump that is the DbD community. This game gives people more cancer than Second-Hand Smoke.

The concept of the game is great but the execution is the worst I have ever seen. The game's current format is who can be more toxic to the other team or who can exploit the games terrible design the most. The toxicity is a never ending cycle of a killer face camping a survivor so the survivor next game runs him around the map like Usain Bolt and repeat. This would not be a problem if they had the \"team\" of 4 survivors ranking up or losing rank based on their TEAM performance but currently you will gain little and risk losing a lot if you do work as a team. In terms of bugs and connection problems they are very present. I can't count the number of times where I have stunned the killer with a pallet and still get hit or knocked down. Furthermore there are no dedicated servers but rather killer hosted servers so with that comes a lot of desync/connection issues. This is what you can look forward to but only after you wait 15 minutes to get into a game because of constantly lobby bugs.

I'd rank up, get lots of bloodpoints to spend, and play fairly matched, fun games with people. \n\nUnfortunately, they changed the ranking system to use emblems, which: a, are unclear in what you have to do in order to get enough points to rank up, and b, are extremely unbalanced on the survivor side. All of the players at low ranks, especially rank 20/19, are absolute trash. It's almost impossible to rank up, because the killers camp everyone to death, can't get anyone on a hook (removing all chance of getting anything for altruism whatsoever), or all of the players quit on you, leaving you with no chance of escape because the gens aren't done yet. There's nothing to stop this from happening. There are no points for having no one be put on the hook. There's no punishment for killers who camp. In fact, they're rewarded, as as long as they can get two people to die, then they pip. There's no punishment either, for teammates that quit once they've been downed twice in a row, because at this stage they are so low in rank that losing two pips for ragequitting doesn't even matter. \n\nThe killers get absolutely overpowered perks, in order to make them still want to play the game. Eg, Hex: No one escapes death - downs survivors in one hit if the gates are open. It boosts killers who aren't very good at all, just because they can knock down a survivor in one hit, put them on the hook, and hit other survivors when they try to save them. \n\nBasically, if you enjoy laggy servers, garbage teammates, and boosted killers, then totally get this game. If you want to have a good time, play something else. Or wait until the team makes the game better. \n\n(You may just think I'm salty because I suck at the game. I've always sucked at the game. But now I only play so I can watch myself die over and over. )","timestamp_created":1525531336,"timestamp_updated":1525531336,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516778528690338135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41867754","author":{"steamid":"76561198119105480","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3464,"last_played":1658225905},"language":"schinese","review":"非常喜欢的游戏，对于新人不太友好- -，当人总是被抓，当鬼总是找不到人。","timestamp_created":1525528380,"timestamp_updated":1525528380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41866188","author":{"steamid":"76561198809968489","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1229,"last_played":1527152553},"language":"schinese","review":"求求你放人类一条生路","timestamp_created":1525522957,"timestamp_updated":1525522957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41865966","author":{"steamid":"76561198346124482","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12863,"last_played":1646935359},"language":"russian","review":"Игра топ, йоу","timestamp_created":1525522158,"timestamp_updated":1525522158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm5qNmOMCfq7anwE="}
