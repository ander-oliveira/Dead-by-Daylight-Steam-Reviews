[/h1]\n\n[b] This review is pretty long by my standards but if you've somehow come across this and not bought the game, I would highly suggest reading. [/b] \n\nThis game is a broken mess that's flawed in just about every aspect. I won't focus too much on the community being terrible in this review (because you've probably heard it 100 times already) and instead focus on the game itself. \n\nDead by Daylight has a monopoly on the cat-and-mouse genre, and this has resulted in the most inept, lazy development I have ever seen in a game. This is sadly what happens when a game has almost no competition whatsoever in the market.\n\nEvery single update comes with a variety of new bugs and issues, most of which never get fixed and are still in the game years later.\n\nThe developers are clearly solely interested in profit and ignore almost the entirety of community feedback. Perfect example of this is the Twins killer. The developers released the killer on PTB, got tonnes of negative feedback and game-breaking bugs, changed almost nothing and then released it anyway for full price. \n\n[h1]  Do you like grinding achievements?  [/h1]\n\nSome achievements are straight up bugged, and others are unfairly difficult to obtain. When I say unfair I'm not claiming that they're just \"too hard\" because I have no problem with that, it's the fact that the conditions required to obtain them are usually outside of your control. For example:\n\nSurvivor adept achievements:\n\nEscape using the survivor's 3 set perks, no questions asked.\n\nKiller adept achievements:\n\nYou have to deliberately go out of your way to inefficiently kill everybody in the lobby just to please the outdated scoring system and get the \"Merciless killer\" rating.\n\nYou also have to do this with the 3 set perks for your killer, and depending on the killer these perks could be terrible (Huntress has 2 useless perks and 1 near-useless perk, Wraith has 2 useless perks and 1 somewhat okay perk, etc)\n\n[b] Not only this, but if a survivor disconnects at any point during the game, you lose your entire attempt. This could be your 20th attempt at the achievement and you lose it because a survivor pressed Alt F4.[/b]\n\n\n[h1]  You're new to the game?  [/h1]\n\nIf you only bought the standard game and no DLCs, prepare to grind for literally hundreds of hours if you want to unlock all of the characters (the characters that are even available without spending real money, that is). Even if you don't want to play as the character themselves, this will be your only way of unlocking a majority of the perks in the game unless you want to take the incredibly low chance that your desired perk will appear in the weekly shrine. (And even if this happens, I hope you have 2000 shards lying around / can grind for them within 7 days, or you're out of luck.)\n\n[h1] You have hundreds of hours?  [/h1]\n\nThis game becomes more boring the higher ranked you get. The meta has been stale for years because a handful of perks dominate all other perks by an enormous margin. There is no freedom to customize your perk build to your playstyle without putting yourself at a heavy disadvantage by not taking the boring meta perks (this applies mostly to killers).\n\nThe worst offender here is Ruin / Undying,  two perks that have dominated the meta at the time of this review. By taking these boring meta perks, you are left with 2/4 perks to work with for your own playstyle. If you're playing certain killers such as Demogorgon, make that 1 since certain perks are essentially required to make them playable (Save the best for last).\n\nThe devs will take a perk that's blatantly overpowered (Decisive strike for example) and [b] maybe [/b] give it a [b] very minor nerf [/b] if people beg for it enough over the course of several months. Conversely, they'll take a terrible perk that clearly needs a massive buff to become viable and slightly tweak it which ultimately makes no difference. This game has horrendous balance and this is just one example of it.\n\nThe ranking system is a glorified skill-based matchmaking system that has no value other than bragging rights. You get no rewards for reaching the top ranks. Once you hit rank 1, there is effectively nothing to strive towards anymore.\n\nOnce you have perfect builds on all of your characters, bloodpoints become near-obsolete unless you care about the incredibly underwhelming prestige system. At this point, the only reward you get for playing are shards, so you can grind for an obscene amount of time for a singular cosmetic you may like. That's if the cosmetic is even available for shards, since some of them force you to pay real money. \n\nDead by Daylight should be free to play. Fortnite, Rocket League and most mobile games have more modest micro-transactions and they're free. \n\n[h1] Terrible balancing  [/h1]\n\nMany would agree that the most ridiculous example of terrible balance is the existence of keys. This item is essentially a free win button as survivor if you're still alive during the endgame. There is almost no counterplay as a killer and it results in survivors getting completely undeserved wins. The developers finally acknowledged this recently and instead of making a meaningful change, they instead completely insulted the entire killer playerbase by nerfing them so slightly that it makes almost no difference whatsoever.\n\nMany of the killers in the game are horribly underpowered and the devs make no effort to rework or update their base kit to make them viable in high level gameplay. Some of these killers have extremely obvious (and usually very simple) tweaks that they desperately need but the devs don't bother. This means that by playing the lower end of killers, you choose to deliberately put yourself at a severe disadvantage purely due to laziness on the devs part.\n\nTo make matters worse, the devs are also painfully out of touch and make baffling choices that suggest they have zero understanding of the game. Rather than focus their limited efforts on one of the many killers that need attention (Myers, Trapper, Clown etc) they decided to nerf arguably the most fun and balanced killer in the game (Billy) for absolutely no reason and he's almost never played anymore. Great job!\n\n[h1] In conclusion... [/h1]\n\nThis game is a joke at this point. Save your money.\n\nIf you aren't a competitive person and can put up with the ridiculous amount of issues in this game, then I'd say there's some fun in playing survivor with your friends. But that's about it. This game is absolutely not worth playing solo.\n\nPlaying survivor alone sucks because most survivors care purely about themselves and will leave you to die on your first hook even if you went out of your way to save them multiple times. Anybody can play however they want and I won't criticise that, but waiting 10 minutes for a lobby only to die because your teammates ditch you gets really tiresome. Some of the best perks in the game require coordination to work, and since the devs dont bother balance out the perks you're just playing at a huge disadvantage.\n\nPlaying killer is not fun 90% of the time. Most of your experience is just going to be confusion and frustration. If you dare to play in a way that upsets survivors (ie. killing them and doing your job), prepare to get flamed in post-game chat for not following the all-important unwritten survivor rulebook.\n\nThe tension dries up quickly because it's usually clear about halfway through the game who is going to win. You're either stomping the entire lobby, or getting bullied by a 4-man toxic SWF (group of friends) with meta perks, keys, flashlights, and insta heals. This is why queue times are so long. Nobody wants to play killer anymore.\n\nI can only hope that Dead by Daylight gets some actual competition so that the developers are forced to either do their jobs properly, or watch a game that actually cares about their community take over the market. Either way works for me.","timestamp_created":1598580678,"timestamp_updated":1659132022,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562171638011932373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75032642","author":{"steamid":"76561198415628005","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":170923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144877,"last_played":1659253078},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pretty good job so far!!","timestamp_created":1598579624,"timestamp_updated":1639453306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75032633","author":{"steamid":"76561198170056019","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":20078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14779,"last_played":1654912960},"language":"english","review":"Good game, needs work sometimes cuz it can be unfair but they are working on it","timestamp_created":1598579612,"timestamp_updated":1598579612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75032609","author":{"steamid":"76561198071829793","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":92624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":274,"playtime_at_review":21879,"last_played":1659845025},"language":"english","review":"A fun game but they need to do something about the racism, homophobia and toxicity\n\nAlso hacks","timestamp_created":1598579572,"timestamp_updated":1598579572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495867758989334106","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75032092","author":{"steamid":"76561199085734142","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1656271733},"language":"english","review":"This game is a very awesome one. tots 5 star","timestamp_created":1598578630,"timestamp_updated":1598578630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75031952","author":{"steamid":"76561199059610224","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":249,"playtime_at_review":8600,"last_played":1659854560},"language":"english","review":"The games shit but its good \nDo i recommend this game?\n:No but i still play it","timestamp_created":1598578390,"timestamp_updated":1598578390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75031757","author":{"steamid":"76561198139669101","num_games_owned":683,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":25380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":592,"playtime_at_review":18787,"last_played":1660586328},"language":"koreana","review":"살인마 1명 대 생존자(생존마) 4명이라는 비대칭 게임의 아버지뻘 겜\n\n게임 컨셉만큼 초반에는 잔인하고 무서워 할 수 있으나 100시간 넘길쯤부터 살인마를 놀리는 자신을 발견하게 될 것이다.\n전승퍽 (30,35,40랩을 찍으면 다른 캐릭도 해당 캐릭 고유퍽을 사용 가능)이 중요한 겜인 만큼 초반에 전승퍽이 부족하면 다소 살인마에게 오버 밸런스로 느껴질 수는 있으나 과거에 비해 아카이브(미션을 통한 블포 제공)을 추가함으로서 나아진 편. 물론 양쪽이 전승퍽을 다 찍으면 생존자가 압도적으로 유리해진다.
