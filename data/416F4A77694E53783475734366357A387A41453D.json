Overall I think the game is really complicated to explain. The core gameplay for survivors isn't even something I would consider fun. You hold left click to repair generators while being on the lookout for killer. Oh, they're coming? Time to hold Shift + W until either all the gens have been completed, or I get downed and hooked. The gameplay is so simple it's not really easy to describe as something that sounds fun. The real enjoyment for survivor is in seeing yourself improve. Running chases longer, learning how to loop the killer better and more efficiently.\n\nPlaying Killer is a nightmare. Survive With Friends, toxic behaviour by the survivors, and just generally being outnumbered makes killer play really unpleasant. Some survivors play not only to win but to ensure you have the least amount of fun humanly possible. They will teabag you at every corner, blind you in every animation, save their teammates with flashlights, and wait at the exit gates for you to see them leave because they want to assert dominance. Queue times for survivor are so bad right now because no one wants to play killer and be bullied.\n\nEverything said I enjoy the game, but right now this game doesn't deserve a positive review because of the recent actions by the games developers, Behaviour Interactive. A popular DbD twitch streamer and Youtuber DOWSEY recently made a tweet and video criticising the naive comments of the games lead designer during their recent Q&A. In retaliation to criticism, BHVR removed cosmetics from DOWSEYs account claiming they didn't endorse his actions of \"targeting a member of the development team\". Basically they have set a precedent that if you disagree with them, they will arbitrarily punish you for it because they're above criticism.\n\nIf you own the game currently, play it. Have fun. If you own it and you're a content creator, watch out what you say about the game publicly.","timestamp_created":1562378649,"timestamp_updated":1643307802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53736219","author":{"steamid":"76561198885946444","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1268,"last_played":1567446862},"language":"english","review":"lots of toxic but very fun","timestamp_created":1562378334,"timestamp_updated":1562378334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53736179","author":{"steamid":"76561198211875099","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":30452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15410,"last_played":1658384590},"language":"koreana","review":"so good","timestamp_created":1562378298,"timestamp_updated":1562378298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53736157","author":{"steamid":"76561198907275413","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":32318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1974,"last_played":1624114472},"language":"russian","review":"Не так давно приобрёл себе данную игру и она полностью заняла моё время.
