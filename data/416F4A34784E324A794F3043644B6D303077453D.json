by Daylight is a game that actually has replayable content that can feel unique each time and different. It has done it really well with the variety of killers, perks, maps, and different builds that are available. \n\nThe game is good with friends. Definitely worth purchasing if you have a friend who frequently plays the game. \n\nIf you like taking your emotions out on survivors then killer is the single player mode for you. Sacrifice them, or run that Ebony to track down those twitch streamers. \n\nThe game is so unbalanced, just when you think it's balancing out, some hillbilly charges you with double move speed from across the map before you can say \"Oh Crap\". Some people say the unbalancing adds to the fun of the game, because it is unbalanced on both sides, it kind of evens out... In fairness, there is a way to play around most things in the game.\n\nIf you're new to the game, take your time mastering skill checks and getting used to the audio-queues. Learn the map layouts and pellet locations. Learn looping and understanding that if the killer is on someone, it is okay to do gens instead of squatting in the corner. Read up on the perks and used Google to answer any questions you may have. I'm sure the answer is out there. (like how could they improve legion? Answer: Delete).\n\nA huge con of the game is survivor hitboxes (imagine being hit through a window.....) and slowvaulting at the worst possible time.\n\nThere are other cons to the game, but if you pay attention to patch notes, the game is under constant development, which addresses a fair few of the concerns/issues the community has (such as the lobby system, matchmaking, ping/host, etc).\n\nThe fact that the game is consistently under development is the major reason this game is recommended by me. Any issues that I have had with the game in the past, have been addressed at some point in the further development of the game. \n\nPS. Yeah you can get full tilt in this game btw.

game as unbalanced as somebody's mental state if they found it enjoyable. \n\nAs a survivor, you are an underdog running on survival instincts and adrenaline. How do we make sure that players are able to manage going up against a killer who is fearless and powerful? Lets add benefits to the killers!\n\nYes, I know, this comes across as illogical, but it's a moronic reality that the game currently suffers from.\n\nBut how could the developers possibly formulate such a recipe for disaster? Well... they:\n-Made it so Killers are faster\n-Killers can sprint\n-Killers can do a 180 in a split second\n-Killer lair has a single exit/entrance\n-Killer can camp the hooks\n-Killer can repeatedly destroy generators\n-Killer can use abilities to track players unless the players use an object to get rid of it\n-Killer can crouch hide\n-Door escape has a countdown timer\n-Killer can gain levels throughout match to kill in less hits\n-Killer can detect sprinting\n-Killer can detect a player being still to long\n-Hooks are covering the map\n-Killer can... \n\n...alright, you get the idea. So do we find it odd and broken that the survivors have little to no advantages over the killer?\nI think that it defeats the whole purpose of the game\n\nIf a player knows how easy it is to die immediately, it ruins the tension and fear the game tries to portray. It ends up being a repeating purgatory where you end up not caring about the killer. It ends up as a frustration that reminds you how little the developers care about any resemblance of balance.\n\nWait, but can't players hide and knock things over to slow down the killer?\nI think it would be easier to explain how these mechanics have become flawed. It seems that the developers have forgotten about map design and have made sure that both hiding spots and blocking objects are nearly non-existent. \n\nBehind all of the glitches, terrible matchmaking, and awful map design, this game at its core is flawed and has only become more apparent as new killers are added which continues the theme of breaking the balance.\n\nBut for the big question, would I recommend this game? I don't think I could find any new players that wouldn't immediate see these flaws as I do. I also can't think of anybody who would want to suffer through a game that encourages the act of a molten lead enema.","timestamp_created":1570175556,"timestamp_updated":1570175556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539534866809844971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55438158","author":{"steamid":"76561198968249841","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":45175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1659181086},"language":"schinese","review":"hao","timestamp_created":1570174654,"timestamp_updated":1640161383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55437517","author":{"steamid":"76561198797271354","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":21500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1657384983},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольная игра, ЛЮБЛЮ ФАКИН СЛЕЙВ","timestamp_created":1570170279,"timestamp_updated":1635260990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55437237","author":{"steamid":"76561198213415641","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1607703835},"language":"russian","review":"Игра про алкашей из подъезда которые гоняются за шпаной.\nА так игра очень даже понравилась))","timestamp_created":1570168513,"timestamp_updated":1570168513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55436858","author":{"steamid":"76561198882487079","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":15289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2718,"last_played":1657394783},"language":"russian","review":"Коммьюнити в дбд это когда:\nМан кемпит/туннелит -

I liked it when it worked, even with all its flaws.\nSo far many problem were more or less addressed by paid DLCs so be prepared to spend more than the base game if you want to have a chance against the other players.\n\nThe game itself is riddled with bugs.  Expect your power to fail you consistently or, if you play killer, to have your aim magically moved toward the last server-know position of an opponent who's lagging. (So, yes, lag-switcher are still there and contrary to the lies from the developer it's an advantage when kept in check, at least it is for the survivor side.)\n\nThe main problem of the game is that it has never been balanced properly.\nBasically the developers are making it so new survivor players can win without having a clue.\nIt doesn't take a genius to ask the question : \"But what does it means for experienced players?\" and the answer is easy.  A team of experienced survivors will win most games.\n\nEvery veteran knew this already but now that there is finally a \"skilled-based match making\" (MMR) experienced killers soon get to play matches they have very little chance winning as well as cheaters.  This may be the reason why the population has dropped from about 100k to 50k in about 3 months (That and some serious, and free, competition being right on the corner).  You only need to look at how many \"killer mains\" streamers are now playing more and more survivors.\n\nStill if you are choosing one the the few viable killers (Blight, Leatherface, Nurse) you may stand a chance ... up to a point. (Spirit has been nerfed : newbies rejoice, you will still not stand a chance but neither will she against good players.)\n\nThis culture of mediocrity makes the game awful for survivors playing alone too.\nYou only need to be paired with fools to get your \"skill\" level downed, starting down a spiral to hell.\n\nBasically the only way to play this game and have some fun is as a group of 3 or 4 survivors : that's what I've done for the last few months.","timestamp_created":1570109949,"timestamp_updated":1634123879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487660378217697144","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55424651","author":{"steamid":"76561198875176718","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10276,"last_played":1639787125},"language":"tchinese","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1570107838,"timestamp_updated":1570107838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55424392","author":{"steamid":"76561198095201465","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":71132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44087,"last_played":1637913278},"language":"koreana","review":"중앙서버인가 재앙서버인가","timestamp_created":1570106818,"timestamp_updated":1575842888,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523160755634307861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55424209","author":{"steamid":"76561198832754218","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3014,"last_played":1570117245},"language":"schinese","review":"支持伟大的马列黄俄共产党！奴役支那猪，万世都不朽！","timestamp_created":1570106069,"timestamp_updated":1575210496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.398093044757843018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55423387","author":{"steamid":"76561198896714652","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2806,"last_played":1567231928},"language":"koreana","review":"데드 바이 데이라이트는 네 명의 플레이어가 살인마를 고문하고 죽이려는 잔학한 생존자의 역할을 담당하고, 나머지 한 명의 플레이어는 생존자로부터 도망치려는 살인마로 플레이하는 (4vs1) 코믹게임 입니다.\n","timestamp_created":1570102473,"timestamp_updated":1570102473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55423036","author":{"steamid":"76561198281019487","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":22935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9973,"last_played":1658839611},"language":"english","review":"i lije it","timestamp_created":1570100686,"timestamp_updated":1625481546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55422771","author":{"steamid":"76561198909846072","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":158619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":268,"playtime_at_review":20594,"last_played":1660135161},"language":"german","review":"this is my best game dead by daylight by sorvivor and killer\n( das ist mein bestes spiel dead by daylight von Überlebende und killer <3 )\nDead by Daylight ist mein lieblings spiel","timestamp_created":1570099430,"timestamp_updated":1576837711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55422595","author":{"steamid":"76561198024178115","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6936,"last_played":1646847227},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1570098497,"timestamp_updated":1570098497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55422529","author":{"steamid":"76561198140981992","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":9260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4966,"last_played":1650633050},"language":"russian","review":"Знаете, я человек по натуре не социальный и не люблю находится среди людей, поэтому купил себе участок за городом.
