Games where you are the 1/4 (25%) to be caught first, get hooked, and then camped and tunneled to death is un-interactive, and not fun.\n\nMost games you don't get this, but unfortunately their are too many where this does happen.\n\nGames still have unfair match-making too, where a new player may be put alongside prestige players, against a average leveled killer. The math balances out, but it makes the game un-fun for the new player, and un-fun for the killer to try and get the more experienced players.\n\nWith a new game by the devs coming out soon, it won't surprise me if this one gets less developments, and matchmaking issues (and camping) are still not fixed due to this new game taking development time.\n\nOnly get this on a sale (50% or more), don't pay full price for this.\n\n--- Previous review (6th September 2016)\n\nI enjoy this game greatly, I like most of the character mechanics and perks...\n\nWhat I don't like is trying a different character (who is at level 1) and being put with other survivors mostly at level 10-20, against a killer at level 40...\n\nI don't know whether the issue is with a lack of player base, or lack of a background system to queue people around the same level, but the game was changed recently so that rather than leaving a lobby if you felt other players were too high level, instead it doesnt show you their level now.\n\nI've played as killer a few times at level 5, and been against level 30 players, or level 35 prestige 2 players...\n\nThe game isn't designed for people who can only play an hour or two a day, and it is a shame.\nMaybe if there was a non-competitive mode? (turns off perks) the game could be viable for new players, but with the current systems, it is unplayable.

However the price is very reasonable for the amount of hours I've put into this game. The game is constantly improving and new content is being added. Yes there are always issues, the Devs are reletively new but are hard at work. I've spent £40 on games and barely played 50 hours so it's certainly value for money.\n\nThe typical game spawns you in as a Survivor where you need to repair 5 Generators to power the doors and and make it out alive. It's easier said than done as each Killer has different mechanics and is a human player constantly looking to sacrifice you to The Entity by hooking you. There's plenty of longetivty to the game as long as you don't mind a bit of a grind. You can unlock character specific perks for both Killer and Survivor.\n\nIf you're looking for a triple A quality game this is not your game, this is a fairly priced Indie game. If you enjoy Cat vs Mouse gameplay and nailbiting close calls then this game is worth the money\n\nUpdate: 660+ Hours at the time of writing this review. The game has its ups and downs but the game is certainly fun and for an affordable price. DLC Cosmetics are low price and the game is stricly NOT Pay-To-Win. All DLC Perks content can be obtained without buying the DLC. Frequent updates and new content with this game means you can't really go wrong.

маньяка является остановить нас.И  какие же могут возникнуть проблемы спросите вы.\nВ игре порядко 25 карт,которые по сути не отличаются друг от друга(авторы штампуют их одну за другой) и казалось бы должно подкреплять атмосферу безысходности,но нет.\nВо вторых в игре только один режим игры и абсолютное отсутствие контента.Да авторы добавляют каждые 3 месяца новую главу,но много ли в ней пользы,все выжившие абсолютно одинаковы,у них нет никаких особенностей ,а что касается маньяков ,каждый из них индивидуален и ведет охоту по своему,что и  является сильной стороной игры.\nВ игре есть своя ранговая система,но она не на что не влияет.\nВ третьих  у всех персонажей есть так называемые \"перки\",которые даруют им необычные способности.Именно перки уничтожают игру и атмосферу происходящего.\nВ завершении хочу обратить внимание на технические проблемы.Авторы категорически не хотят давать игрокам нормальные сервера,хостом всегда является маньяк,пинг которого может посеять такой хаос ,что сразу ливать хочется.\nБольшое количество загрузок,действительно большое,они отнимают 10%

Dann wird es anstrengend, vorrausgesetzt man hat selber 1 oder kein Perk. Weil dann kann es je nach Skills des Killers, auch mal zu Frustration kommen.\n\nAber dazu kann ich sagen, einfach dran bleiben.\n\nMit einer Spielzeit zwischen 10 - 20 Minuten pro Match ist es auch gut für zwischendurch geeignet.
