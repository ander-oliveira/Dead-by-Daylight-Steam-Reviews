Killers were semi-balanced, where there were builds that were impossible to survive such as insta-down huntress. After the recent update though it makes it near impossible to survive unless you're amazing and fast at this game. Endgame only has 2 minutes or you lose automatically as a survivor and killer and close hatch to prevent an escape and just patrol gates easily. It's especially hard when they buff ruin and make it harder to avoid the killers who already tunnel (chase you down after you get unhooked) and can just camp you to prevent you from escaping alive. I've played both ends of the spectrum and I say survivor is near impossible now in comparison to being a killer, especially since all the good survivor perks get debuffed because killers complain, such as Decisive Strike getting a massive nerf to be literally useless unless you get tunnelled, which they can just drop you right back off to waste your perk for the whole game. I would have to say wait until they decide to actually make survivors able to win again unless you think you can be a godly survivor in chases.","timestamp_created":1557261021,"timestamp_updated":1557261021,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468960344791412354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50532482","author":{"steamid":"76561198094238220","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2175,"last_played":1628105937},"language":"russian","review":"Я вчера значит проснулся (на кукане уже) и СЛУЧаЙНо ОбОСраЛСя БЛиН бЛИнЦКИЙ (ИГРА ХУЙНЯ!)","timestamp_created":1557260621,"timestamp_updated":1557260621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539071381092071533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50532074","author":{"steamid":"76561198389938573","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3689,"last_played":1633257301},"language":"german","review":"sehr geiles Spiel","timestamp_created":1557258689,"timestamp_updated":1557258689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50532067","author":{"steamid":"76561198166930052","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":268152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63089,"last_played":1658870717},"language":"italian","review":"A great idea, in the anarchy. 3 years and still so much broken.","timestamp_created":1557258665,"timestamp_updated":1571749039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525507092475891113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50531732","author":{"steamid":"76561198346016764","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20518,"last_played":1650750851},"language":"russian","review":"После давних обнов игра стала устанавливаться \"по-новой\".\nНакипело.\nПосле каждой.
