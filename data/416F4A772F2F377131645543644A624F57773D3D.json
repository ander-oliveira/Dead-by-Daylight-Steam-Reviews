Тиммейты спокойненько закончили игру, понабивали себе очков, бегая вокруг нас, и ни одня блядина даже не попыталась заюзать обоссаный  фонарик (возможно не хотели зашквариться этим бесполезным предметом). Хост не захотел ливать, и спустя час я не выдержал и сам нажал ALT+F4. Получил в ебало 14.3 ЧЕТЫРНАДЦАТЫЙ РАНК, СУКА, c тремя каплями.

Нередко жертву нельзя поднять с земли или вылечить.\nОбновления нихуя не выходят.
