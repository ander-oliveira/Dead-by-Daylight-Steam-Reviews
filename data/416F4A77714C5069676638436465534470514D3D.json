Survivor is only really fun with friends and if you do plan on playing solo then good luck. You will either be blessed with walking potatoes or god tier teammates, there is no in between. As for killer, all I will say is that it was much more enjoyable 2 or 3 years ago. I recently gave up on playing as killer just due to the fact of how stressful the games can be. The only time I find myself playing killer is for my daily quests which by the way seem to lean more towards killer than survivor. I had at least 1,000 hours in this game on Xbox before permanently switching to PC so I certainly do enjoy it enough to keep coming back, but it does have its days.

this sound bug has been on the game for a while already and it has not been fixed, the developers have their priorities mixed and worse they don't know what they are doing, pushing patches with arbitrary nerfs and bufs and a mess overall, another aspect I don't like of the game is the monetization but that can be ignored as it is not a big issue like the rest of things, cosmetics and killers are paid, I can understand and find no issue with the licensed ones and at least you can grind to unlock the non licensed killers and some cosmetics but I find wrong that a paid game also has cosmetic items that are paid with real life currency when I already bought the game, but not a really big issue, that one can be ignored unlike the previous ones and the next ones to follow, now the biggest issue, the game is a cheater playground, it is not as bad as other games that are infested as they are rare at least for the blatant ones, but the fact that they are there is concerning, and they are not new, they have been there since around 2020 or maybe even earlier, not that I noticed earlier so can't say, they are rare but are there, the game is also really grindy, the grind is massive to unlock perks in characters the more characters you get but I personally don't mind it as much but I believe it is worth mentioning\n\nI simply cannot recommend this game, which is a shame as it is really fun but oh well what can one do, if you can look past all the issues then go ahead and get the game but I think you shouldn't even bother, the issues are big after all","timestamp_created":1645075816,"timestamp_updated":1645075816,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110401455","author":{"steamid":"76561199131250810","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9028,"last_played":1659192646},"language":"english","review":"IT HAS IMPROVED THE SBM IS KINDA OFF BUT VERY FUN GAME","timestamp_created":1645075037,"timestamp_updated":1645075037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110401153","author":{"steamid":"76561199219246125","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3361,"playtime_at_review":22409,"last_played":1660556794},"language":"english","review":"This game is so fun!!","timestamp_created":1645074485,"timestamp_updated":1645074485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514635622501373291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110401114","author":{"steamid":"76561198972330900","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":29000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":119,"playtime_at_review":8525,"last_played":1659410873},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoy this game.

Also a ranked system that resets monthly that (under recent stats) resets everyone to base, which can force less experienced players to be faced with the top 5 ranks. \n\nThe Grind: \n\nTo explain the grind a bit more in detail: Each character has 3 set abilities that they start with and 4 slots to equip abilities in. To unlock/upgrade abilities you must spend points (blood points) earned from every game to spend in an ability web (bloodweb) which will randomly have a new ability or an upgraded version of an ability already had on that character. \n\nEvery character has their own webs and abilities, and the only way to unlock these abilities to be placed on other characters is to raise the character to level 30/35/40 to unlock their teachable ability, which allows that specific ability to appear in other character's bloodwebs. After obtaining the teachable, you must collect the ability within the other character's bloodweb in the remaining pool of moves. This is for both Survivor and Killers. \n\nEvery character is like this, and if you're not willing to shell out the money to purchase character packs, non-licensed characters can be purchased with special shards earned from leveling in the game, and a 4 perk store that allows you to purchase the teachable of a perk to be added to your pool (2 survivor and 2 killer perks, but purchased one at a time.)\n\nThe accessibility to be on the same playing field as a player with these other resources available due to time in the game (not to mention the skill curve) can leave more to be desired from a general entry point. Pairing this with the disadvantage that Killers also suffer from not having base access to add ons (useable items that can minorly or majorly change the fundamentals of their killing kits) outside of using them once from their bloodwebs then having to spend more bloodpoints in hoping to get more basic buffs is very disheartening... especially when survivors can, on some occasions, find decent items and survive to take the item into their main pool (medkit, flashlight) to use in another match. \n\nI would only recommend this if you have 5 people you'd want to play with and have fun as the \"kill your friends\" setting basically unlocks everything for everyone in terms of abilities and allows you to experiment and have fun... but other than that, don't bother. There are other, similar games, with probably the same player base as of recent months the queue times have been growing longer and longer. \n","timestamp_created":1645069600,"timestamp_updated":1645069600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532842576503753662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110398482","author":{"steamid":"76561198869727525","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":177,"playtime_at_review":18596,"last_played":1660439446},"language":"russian","review":"213","timestamp_created":1645069419,"timestamp_updated":1645069419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110398354","author":{"steamid":"76561199026440663","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1650790403},"language":"english","review":"good soup\n","timestamp_created":1645069212,"timestamp_updated":1645069212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110397861","author":{"steamid":"76561199093886932","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":212,"playtime_at_review":12398,"last_played":1660285236},"language":"english","review":"just dont","timestamp_created":1645068443,"timestamp_updated":1645068443,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110397671","author":{"steamid":"76561199021769459","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":25621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2863,"playtime_at_review":14293,"last_played":1660589761},"language":"english","review":"⢸⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⡷⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⡇⠢⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠈⠑⢦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Are you tunneling son?\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠖⠒⠒⠒⢤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⢸⠀⠀⣀⢤⣼⣀⡠⠤⠤⠼⠤⡄⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⢸⠀⠀⠑⡤⠤⡒⠒⠒⡊⠙⡏⠀⢀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⠢⡄⠀\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠇⠀⣀⣀⣀⣀⢀⠧⠟⠁⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠸⣀⠀⠀⠈⢉⠟⠓⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢱⡖⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⢺⠧⢄⣀⠀⠀⣀⣀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⣠⠃⢸⠀⠀⠈⠉⡽⠿⠯⡆⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⣰⠁⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠉⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠣⠀⠀⢸⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⢇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡌⠀⠈⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⠃⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⠀⠀⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠷","timestamp_created":1645068103,"timestamp_updated":1645068103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110397657","author":{"steamid":"76561199180376101","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1651785858},"language":"english","review":"i likw this game. thank you to notch for creating this game.","timestamp_created":1645068085,"timestamp_updated":1645068085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110397639","author":{"steamid":"76561199129524255","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1652569428},"language":"english","review":"Great game for people who want to be bombarded with messages from man-babies crying about how you stood next to the hook you just placed them on for 0.23 seconds","timestamp_created":1645068060,"timestamp_updated":1645068060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110397531","author":{"steamid":"76561198269168048","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":75799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":876,"playtime_at_review":63785,"last_played":1660350162},"language":"english","review":"I've been playing this is game for almost 5 years now.

esta va a ser una reseña larga supongo porque a pesar de que me guste el juego tengo muchísimas quejas. Voy a dar mi opinión desde dos perspectivas, la de superviviente y la de asesina.\n\nEmpiezo con la de superviviente: Tener compañeros buenos parece un regalo de los cielos ya que la mayoría son tóxicos que al final te arruinan las ganas de jugar sin razón alguna.\nTambién les pueden tocar asesinos super tuneleros y campers que no te van a dejar NI caminar en paz por un bendito segundo, EJ: Bubba. No esperen nada de los Bubba, créanme.\n\n Hace una semana me toco jugar con una compañera que me body bloqueo para que me maten y luego en otra ocasión me apareció un compañero que no hizo nada en toda la partida y cuando termino me empezó a decir que jugaba re mal y no hice nada. Si, lamentablemente si te compras el juego te recomiendo que no esperes lo mejor de parte de los compañeros. \n\nLuego pasando a mi experiencia como asesino, soy main ghostface y me encanta usarlo pero siempre tengo la hermosa mala suerte de encontrarme puras partidas pre made o gente en si toxica por razones que yo desconozco. Las pre made son geniales de jugar porque te encontras gente que SI sabe jugar y disfruta hacerlo, la gracia ya se va cuando todo lo que jugas son pre mades.\nUna vez me toco una en donde era todo el team brazuca y estaban haciendo premade, estuvo buena pero al final de la partida me dijeron que jugaba mal y se rieron de mi manera de jugar, yo no entendía porque me dijeron eso si hasta GG les dije a los wachines. \nUna cosa que si debo recalcar, si les llama la atención jugar de asesino tengan en cuenta que el juego esta mas del lado de los supervivientes, por lo que les recomiendo buscar buenas build y estrategias.\n\nLlegando al final, es un juego buenísimo pero el problema grave es la gente que lo juega, tienen que bajar un cambio y aprender a tratar un poco mejor a los demás (Aunque veo que es mucho pedir) :/","timestamp_created":1645050399,"timestamp_updated":1645055293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.725003600120544434","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110386221","author":{"steamid":"76561198148461991","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2353,"last_played":1658545309},"language":"english","review":"when amongus killer?????","timestamp_created":1645050250,"timestamp_updated":1645050250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110385469","author":{"steamid":"76561198299078543","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":36711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33273,"last_played":1658730572},"language":"english","review":"buy it on sale then its worth your money","timestamp_created":1645049121,"timestamp_updated":1645049121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110384724","author":{"steamid":"76561198200158595","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":121358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":116907,"last_played":1660262905},"language":"english","review":"Having played this game since its release in 2016 I can say in all honesty that I can wholeheartedly recommend it. I think that there's already enough reviews on its gameplay and how killers and survivors interact (actually there's tons of different interactions and playstyles for killers but to some degree for survivors as well which can simply not be compressed into a single review). For this reason I'd like to point out something that I only realized recently when I talked to some friends who only started playing this game very recently: What started as a very niche and fresh type of game setting with its asymmetrical playstyle that feel like two different games combined into one slowly grew into a franchise that is reaching thousands of new people every day. If this shows anything at all it's the developers' dedication and heart they bring into the game: they keep mixing up its gameplay, balance it out whenever a significant issue arises and overall show a love for their game by consistently updating and upgrading it to the best of their efforts. As with all developers their best effort might not always be exactly what the community suggests - and this community sure is an extremely nitpicky one. However, when you take a step back and really look at where this game started and what it turned into there's no denying the developers have made a lot of good decisions and are continueing to do so going forward.","timestamp_created":1645048150,"timestamp_updated":1645048150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110384598","author":{"steamid":"76561198054491569","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5549,"last_played":1645046865},"language":"english","review":"The first problem, that ruins otherwise great idea, is a bad netcode.

And not because the game, itself, is too hard. The real problem is a matchmaking, which is a total piece of s#it. The game is real fun, when it lets you to play against players of your own level – but it almost never happens.

this is a bit difficult. \n\nIn general, I like the intention behind this game. A 1v4 is a pretty good idea to make a game on, if you know what you do. And that's where the problem begins. BHVR has absolutely no clue on what they are doing. They even compared this asynchron 1v4 game to a linear game of hockey. Then this game has EAC injected in it, that by itself is not a sin, but the way it's injected is definedly a sin. All it checks is if you modded the game files (except for graphics for perks, portraits and so) and the prior and later game chat. Hackers have easy access to the game in a way, that it is really frustrating. You can get away with basicly everything, since nobody can really report you, because that feature isn't working. Again, it's impossible to report someone through the game, because they can't do anything with it, because they implemented EAC so badly. The next is SBMM, which is probably the second worst thing that happened to this game. The perks are completely unbalanced, at the to of the ranks are literally almost only hackers or dirty idiots playing this game as they are playing against the toxiest of the toxic with the most annoying perks and add ons just to fuck up people, making them regret every decision to have bought this game. \n\nAnd somehow I still like to play it. Yes, it can be a good game, if you get people on your level, but the ranks don't define you or your skill in any way. I wish killers would play with builds they'd like to play against and not with the top tier stuff. \n\nSo I like it in a way, I hate the way it's being developed by BHVR like everybody here does, I'll leave you to decide whether it's a good game or not, I really can't say it, but I'll have too, so I'll tick recommend.","timestamp_created":1645035222,"timestamp_updated":1645035222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110373328","author":{"steamid":"76561198144848900","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1648951278},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dead By Daylight pode não ser mais criativo, mas ainda impressiona. Jogar no controle melhora um pouco a experiência e aproveitar as partidas, seja na pele do assassino ou dos sobreviventes, continua tão divertido quanto antes. O game faz grande esforço em ser variado, com cenários gerados aleatoriamente, e muito conteúdo personalizável. Porém, ainda há pequenos bugs visuais e, no geral, ele é bem mais divertido só quando jogamos com um grupo conhecido de pessoas.","timestamp_created":1645035056,"timestamp_updated":1645035056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110373270","author":{"steamid":"76561198855299732","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":16114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1141,"playtime_at_review":8952,"last_played":1660303826},"language":"russian","review":"rhenj!!!! круто!Й!!!!! ура!!!","timestamp_created":1645034985,"timestamp_updated":1645034985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491803258657455444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110373187","author":{"steamid":"76561198153264314","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":41298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37077,"last_played":1650055813},"language":"russian","review":"Клёвая игрушка, повеселиться с друзьями самое то","timestamp_created":1645034904,"timestamp_updated":1645034904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110372520","author":{"steamid":"76561198900444378","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10799,"last_played":1626190353},"language":"schinese","review":"别具匠心","timestamp_created":1645034151,"timestamp_updated":1645034151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110372353","author":{"steamid":"76561198931003995","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":40662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2043,"playtime_at_review":14121,"last_played":1660545240},"language":"english","review":"after 400 hours more hours added this game still needs to be fix with all the bullshit killers have to go through to have fun","timestamp_created":1645033977,"timestamp_updated":1655016937,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110371599","author":{"steamid":"76561199123289035","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":27533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":11977,"last_played":1660557446},"language":"english","review":"daddy myers :)","timestamp_created":1645033127,"timestamp_updated":1645033127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110370633","author":{"steamid":"76561198393383436","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":5683,"last_played":1659461799},"language":"english","review":"So far fun","timestamp_created":1645032097,"timestamp_updated":1645032097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110370373","author":{"steamid":"76561198145861958","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9398,"last_played":1653870905},"language":"english","review":"is good :)","timestamp_created":1645031824,"timestamp_updated":1645031824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqLPigf8CdeSDpQM="}
