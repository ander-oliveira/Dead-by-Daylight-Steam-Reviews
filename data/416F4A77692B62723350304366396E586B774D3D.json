My most pleasurable experience was honestly when I first begun the game, the feeling of being helpless and struggling to survive against massive monsters and murders with only flimsy pallet and interesting mechanics. That love died slowly over time when I begun to realize this game was terribly flawed.\n\nA common quote of \"unbalanced\" probably rings your mind. Because it's true, the developers of this game honestly have no more passion for the game besides money, if anything the art directors have more passion then anyone else if they have any at all. I try not to insult the devs but it's so hard as they boldly ignore their community at all costs and only add what they think is cool, even at the cost of being terrible unbalanced.\n\nBIG PROBLEMS\n1. Marketing\n2. Perks\n3. Content/Balance\n4. The Community\n\nCOSMETICS | Cosmetics have been in this game for a while, but they've heavily outstayed their welcome. Cosmetics in this game is one of the major marketing strategies of Dead by Daylight, they make lazy designs or really good ones and expect people to buy them. This game also has a battle pass, yet still costs $20 to play, as well as countless DLCs you are REQUIRED to pay for. The amount you have to pay in this game is ridiculous. If this game has a battle pass for cosmetics, and has multiple DLCs you are required to pay for, the simple solution is to make the game $5 around the board, or even free but I doubt you'd ever do that since you only want is money. This would probably help you even more since more people would be open to buying your game and it helps the community as we have easier access with a lower cost.\n\nTHE FLAWS WITH PERKS | Perks aren't the worst thing in the world, and are actually one of the major things in this game that can dictate a chase's loss or win. The problem is the amount of perks, there's over 200 perks in this game. Meaning that each side has to worry about if a killer/survivor has 100 different perks. Sure once you mature in game you can easily figure it all out but only when you sink hundreds of hours. Newer players struggle very hard as they don't know what the different between perks and powers are, or even if its just a base game feature under certain circumstances. There isn't much to help with this either as the most survivors or killers they add, 3 new perks MUST be added despite the difficulty of adding new original and balanced perks. It's terribly flawed with almost no solution, that's what makes it scary.\n\nSTOP ADDING NEW CONTENT | There is a really good quote for this, \"STOP ADDING NEW CONTENT\". Please do, please go back and balance your original game. Some categories to focus on would be perk/killer balancing like boon totems and also reworking some killers to be better and more fun. Another category would be to add more maps to realms that only have one map, the amount of realms in game (family of specific map themes) that have only one map, making map offerings insanely overwhelming is insane. Also make sure to go back and balance the maps as well. Items are also very overlooked as if you think about it items are just survivor powers, that can become utterly broken with the addons they come with. Please look over all your previous content and halt new chapters, killers, whatever. Just go back and tie up all loose ends.\n\nLISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY | Dead by Daylight is pretty infamous for their toxic community, so why listen to them right? Here's the big thing, listening to your community about balancing is very important. Developers for this game have literally admitted to features being redundant (ie. OVERHEAT mechanic) yet they refuse to remove a useless mechanic due to the useless effort put towards it. Great examples for balancing suggestions should be known from OTZDARVA and SCOTT JUND's videos, they really do have smart ideas that could make the game way more balanced and fix alot of issues.\n\nThere are countless amounts of other things I ignored but can't bother with to name as their so obvious. I used to respect this game, now I still play it but despise it at the same time.\n\n3/10, fun but unbearable.","timestamp_created":1639527292,"timestamp_updated":1646589454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559951126575469971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105843344","author":{"steamid":"76561198350231549","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1654722863},"language":"spanish","review":"Dejen de hacer perrito guardian con el killer 👿 🌹 👊🏽","timestamp_created":1639526527,"timestamp_updated":1639526527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105843339","author":{"steamid":"76561198212786184","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1500,"playtime_at_review":30317,"last_played":1660588990},"language":"english","review":"okay letsgow","timestamp_created":1639526523,"timestamp_updated":1639526523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105842684","author":{"steamid":"76561198989755101","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":28,"playtime_at_review":3217,"last_played":1659480141},"language":"brazilian","review":"sim","timestamp_created":1639525444,"timestamp_updated":1639525444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105842601","author":{"steamid":"76561198359921650","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":23869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23869,"last_played":1636163202},"language":"english","review":"I haven't put thousands of hours into the game like the many dbd pros out there, but I have been a part of the dbd community for quite a long time. I've watched the development of dbd for years and I am just disappointed. The game was fun for a while but I just can't put up with the garbage anymore. Everytime the game is updated, multiple things break. Every. Single. Time. Then there's the matchmaking mechanic they added which barely takes into account the skill of the player when ranking them up. Plus the perks survivors have are so unbalanced that it feels like Unbreakable and DS are base kit, as there's very little point for people to use anything else. And wait! There's still more! Theres a massive hacker problem in dbd in which not only are people getting forced to quit out of matches, but people are also getting DDoS'ed! All in all, dbd has just been a major let down. I wanted to find a fun horror multiplayer game to have fun with and all I got was a buggy mess that the developers refuse to clean up. They only dress up the mess and pretend it's all good.
