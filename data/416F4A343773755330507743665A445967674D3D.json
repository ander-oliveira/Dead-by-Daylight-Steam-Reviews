For Honor gets a new game mode, new illustrious outfits, x2 executions based on the trapper and huntress, new battle pass, and new signature...\n\n4. Yesterday, they had a random reset error that caused the game to be unplayable for a couple of hours... \n\n\nAll this, has made me think with my wallet- not buying the new Tome, or the rest of the Stranger Things cosmetics.

It has so many cool ideas, so much potential, and such a heavy focus on replayability and mastering of gameplay that it's entirely feasible to get hundreds of hours out of, easily.\n\nBut the truth is? The game under that facade sucks. Most of the issues aren't immediately apparent to a new player, but as you play the game more and more they grow from annoyances to game-ruining.\n\n- SEVERE balance issues that result in high-level matches being the exact same killers over and over and over again because most of the killers are gravely underpowered and generally incapable of dealing with meta survivor builds (which are also 90% of what you see at this level, be prepared to see the same 4-6 perks over and over and over again on every survivor and killer).\n\n- Varying levels of technical issues resulting in everything from bad framerates to mid-match hitches (which can immediately ruin a match and are infuriating) to minor inconvenience bugs to game-breaking bugs. It's even worse on Console, with the XBOX One and PS4 versions of the game having major performance issues at almost all times, long load times, and frequent hitches. The Nintendo Switch version is effectively unplayable.\n\n- Neverending stagnation and lack of major change. Response to issues is glacially slow, with even major bugs taking weeks to patch sometimes. Balance changes come once in a blue moon and are usually tiny adjustments to mostly irrelevant things, like buffing perks that are completely useless to make them... situationally useful at best. There have been no major changes to the game's structure in the past 2 years, with no new gamemodes or anything to break up the monotony. Communication from developers is minimal, customer support is minimal.\n\n- Obnoxious DLC + Microtransaction structure that requires frequently dumping considerable amounts of money for new content, thankfully most older content goes on sale semi-frequently. Skins are completely outrageously priced and have no free way to earn them\n\n- Beyond absurd amounts of grinding. It literally takes *thousands* of hours worth of grinding to level up every killer and survivor, and even more beyond that to prestige them.\n\n- Severe cheater problems at a high level. Game is incredibly poorly locked down with cheaters being able to modify almost every single element of it. Most cheaters are blatant thankfully, doing things like instantly healing or doing Generators far too quickly, or preventing killers from picking them up. However, some cheaters will instead hold the game \"hostage\" by stopping the end-game timer from beginning, and sitting out of bounds to force the killer to leave the game and lose all points and get a matchmaking ban. It is also highly suspected and commonly theorized that there are large amounts of small-scale cheating going on at a high level, which is nearly undetectable.\n\n- Developers have openly supported Cryptocurrency and NFTs, going as far as to include DLC codes with NFTs.","timestamp_created":1634787629,"timestamp_updated":1641678959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522085666656494141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101373046","author":{"steamid":"76561197981609013","num_games_owned":777,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3546,"last_played":1624032314},"language":"english","review":"Scamaz","timestamp_created":1634787501,"timestamp_updated":1634787501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101372949","author":{"steamid":"76561198947303983","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6654,"last_played":1639345540},"language":"spanish","review":"amigo

I thought it was a me problem but everyone i talked to has this issue.","timestamp_created":1634781159,"timestamp_updated":1634781159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101370125","author":{"steamid":"76561198081661403","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":33263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23963,"last_played":1642580594},"language":"polish","review":"ta killer tunneluje","timestamp_created":1634781139,"timestamp_updated":1634781139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101370048","author":{"steamid":"76561199121476526","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2882,"last_played":1658485299},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1634780988,"timestamp_updated":1634780988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101370009","author":{"steamid":"76561198981093068","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6303,"last_played":1646878740},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo legal nas primeiras 30h, depois disso cansa, esse novo sistema de rank é horrivel, hits quebrados, se pudesse dava reembolso em tudo que comprei, não hype mt e gaste todo seu dinheiro. vai se arrepender.\ncomunidade horrível, killers sem nem um pouco de decência, acompanho o game desde 2016 e nunca se quer arrumaram os hits roubados.\nnão compre. pro seu bem.","timestamp_created":1634780902,"timestamp_updated":1634780902,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101369921","author":{"steamid":"76561199079135532","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":13803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":692,"playtime_at_review":11359,"last_played":1660575845},"language":"english","review":"good and bad","timestamp_created":1634780680,"timestamp_updated":1634780680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101369830","author":{"steamid":"76561198080591841","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":274,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1634780203},"language":"english","review":"Good game.
