Bur for now know this. Dead by Daylight is THE BEST asymmetrical horror survival game currently on the market. Does that mean the game is perfect? Hahahaahahaha.... no. The game is riddled with inconsistencies and glaring design flaws, but if you can ignore those for a moment you will find an engrossing game with hundreds (even thousands) of hours of replayability. I am a killer main, I like killing surivors, its what I do. But lots of people love playing survivor! There is much to be said about both sides and honestly i feel like it's impossible to cover everything in one review so I will boil it down to this. If you like feeling like you beat the odds by the skin of your teeth, this game is for you because BOTH sides can feel it easily, do you like feeling like your personal skill was what led to you winning? This game is for you because BOTH sides get this feeling. Do you LOVE experimenting and trying new things constantly? Great, this game is for you because BOTH sides get to do this. Thats a lot of good stuff right but lets dig into the negatives.\n1.Rich man's war-poor man's fight. This game is HEAVILY DLC dependent. I shit you not if you do not own any dlc and just play the base game, it will feel like you are playing less then half a game because of how the perk system works. (perks are abilities specific to each character that can be made available to all other characters by leveling) This is especially bad for a fresh killer main because the absolute best perks for killers are essentially locked behind a paywall. (yes i know the shrine exists but im 400+ hours in and I have yet to see several perks that I still dont have and dont want to put money into the dlc cause i dont like the killer)\n2. Balance. This game is notorious amongst it's player base for being mostly survivor sided on the higher end of the skill spectrum and mostly killer sided on the lower end. (the ranking system starts at rank 20 then goes down till you hit 1 as you play more) this is a little bit obnoxious because it means new survivors are usually shit stomped by killers and once killers reach about rank 10-11 they have to start dealing with ranks 1-9 which can be a real sad experience.\n3. Matchmaking. This games matchmaking is shit and anyone will tell you thats a fact. All it takes to ruin it is a Survive with friends. SWF is where multiple survivors queue up together in a lobby. This is fun for them obviously, but here is the issue. There are NO rank restrictions, meaning 2 rank 2's and a rank 19 can queue up together and the rank 19 will gut the matchmaking system and match them up with some poor rank 17-20 killer who barely knows what they are doing, who will then proceed to get demolished by the 2 high skill survivors. I hate seeing this happen, i hate playing survivors and getting put into one of these lobbies, and I wish it was changed.\nI could go on and on but I dont want to sound TOO negative. DBD is an amazing game and if you have a little extra cash and are looking for a new game to immerse yourself in check it out. (if its on sale) Also the Wiki is amazing like seriously go check it out it has all the info you could ever need about the game and more!","timestamp_created":1612974000,"timestamp_updated":1612974000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86344842","author":{"steamid":"76561198063474185","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":27037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19981,"last_played":1649977003},"language":"english","review":"After the most recent change. \n\n- FOV viewing of both survivor and kill is smaller.\n- Animations feel worse and uncomfortable in control\n- UI isn't something anyone in the community wanted\n- The D-sync is insanely bad even with excellent ping between both killer/survivor\n- PTB is nothing short of a \" hey look at these new things we have you can try \" not \"hey we want your feedback\"\n\nIn short BHVR doesn't listen to the community when it comes to feedback. They will likely drive this game into the ground for profit. Considerably this game has made them a sizable amount of money in transactions ingame.

It even brought me closer to someone I'd lost contact with. I've gifted this game to my friends 3 times and recommended it to everyone else I could. But that was in the past.\n\nThe latest update (4.5.0) has completely destroyed the game. It is so unplayable that it does not even feel like the same game anymore. The new UI makeover greatly cheapens the game, whereas the old one was intuitive and simple, emphasizing immersion. The old UI told you all you needed to know without spoiling the mystery. The new UI was made for Igor eyes. \n\nThe new animations are awkward, the locomotive mechanics are CLUNKY. The player perspective on survivor is now re-framed in such a way that makes maneuvering impossible. To add insult to injury, the hit-box issues and bugs of the past remain and are worse than ever. The devs have, however, made it a priority to fix the jiggle animations on characters with breasts. Shows you what they think about the most. \n\nThat said, the game was in it's best condition in the update before this one. The introduced graphical changes were an appreciated effort, they took a good game and made it smoother to play and look at (while many common issues/bugs remained). I do not however, for the life of me, understand how or why they managed to screw up this bad. I hope behavior listens to the community, who for all their \"toxicity\" have been more than patient with behavior over the years.

They got rid of extra bloodpoints from certain perks. Now when you go to get items for characters you enjoy playing you have to prestige and start off with those annoying TINY bloodwebs. Also, the scoreboard is ugly as hell. The emphases should not be on the character name , but rather the player name. \n\n________________________\n\nFeb 10, 2021 \n\nI loved this game up until the most recent update. They have seriously just killed this game. If you've been thinking about buying it, please don't. The hit boxes are absolute garbage. Killers can hit you when you're not even that close to them. The new UI update is very distracting and all over the place. Health bars are incredibly hard to see now. The Rank system is broken (literally from bugs) along with matchmaking. No one cares about how the community feels. I've bought the game along with the majority of DLCs and have spent around $300 on cosmetics alone - I can tell you I will not be giving them anymore money until they fix this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥. This is coming from someone who has played over 4+ years.

The devs added it even though majority has said they don't.\nSadly the game is literally not even worth it for sale cuz you'll just be punished for doing well and rewarded for doing poor.\n\nEDIT 2: the devs are now supporting and making NFT's, which are a complete scam and damage the environment with greenhouse gases. Please do not buy or play this game, do not support these scumbag devs and their scumbag practices. Wait for VHS or play Prop Night if you want to play an asymmetrical game.\n\nEDIT 4: Hopefully the finale edit but ATM the security of the game has been breached and now hackers have been ddosing and doxxing streamers through dbd.
