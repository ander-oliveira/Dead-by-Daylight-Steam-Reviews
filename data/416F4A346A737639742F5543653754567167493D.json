I will still play it, even though i do not recommend it. This game has some really fun ideas, and the game seemed to go somewhere decent a while back, but I think it is finished.\nThere are so many broken things in this game on both sides. Some killers are just strait up OP compared to the rest of the competition. while those killers stay on top, the other parts of the killers keep getting nerfed to the ground. Even the stronger killers of the game will get nerfed, but not the OP ones that need something changed.\nOn the other spectrum, there are combinations that make some killers rediculous (Huntress with iri-head infantry belt combo (gives her 3 insta-down hatchets)), but BHVR refuses to changes any of that.\nThere are things you can bring into the game that give huge advantages. survivors can bring keys that make it so much easier to escape, and killers can bring moris to only need 1 out of the 3 hooks to kill you. after years of people complaining about it on the forums, no changes have been made to them. but pig needs that nerf i guess.\nOrganized SWF 4 man groups are the definition of a 1 sided game. the only way you have a chance of winning is if they are the kind that focus on keeping everyone alive and you just sit at the hooked survivor. otherwise, good luck getting at least 1 kill.\nThe community in this game has some great people. while not the majority, the toxic people are the LOUDEST of any community i've ever seen. They ruin the fun of the game for anyone else while complaining that their side is completely underpowered and justified to what they do.\nAnd, right as of now, the people making the final decisions of the game have never shown this much bias towards the whales of the game. In their biggest event of the year, they have decided that all skins must be purchased. Even last year, you were able to earn a currency to get 2 skins of your choice if you played enough, but now you MUST pay. While they are giving log in rewards as of this moment (until sometime at the start of november 2020), this doesnt fix the fact that we are not getting an event this year, because they have evolved from being inept decision makers to inept and greedy decision makers.\nWhile I hope this game eventually gets people who know how to run their game (and maybe play it more than once to test out the next patch), This game is something that you should stick away from. If you really want to play through the toxic community and bugs that plague the game from the beginning, then only purchase the game and don't buy anything else. it is not worth it. as of me writing, the developers do not deserve the money from other people.","timestamp_created":1603913446,"timestamp_updated":1603913446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539050936698913574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78303146","author":{"steamid":"76561199030149776","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7222,"last_played":1641628058},"language":"english","review":"I actually really enjoy this game.

You will get trampled unless you have all or most of the meta perks\n-Cosmetic items are a ripoff\n-Even on Ultra graphics, this game still looks like crap\n-Killer metas mean that you only stand a chance with killers like Freddy, Spirit, or Hag.\n-Matchmaking is complete garbage. Red ranks are frequently matched together with green ranks.\n-The developers don't listen to community complaints.
