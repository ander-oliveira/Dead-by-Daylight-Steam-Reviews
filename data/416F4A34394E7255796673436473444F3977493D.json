For example, as a Survivor you see in the third person, however, The Killer sees in the first person. This subtle but noticeable change makes it possible for counterplay on both sides and in itself allows strategies based solely on this perspective shift such as a tactic known as \"Moonwalking\". The Killer always has a red light directly in front of where they are looking,\nso in the third person, a survivor can angle their camera to then be able to see this red light around corners and in turn react before The Killer and survivor can see each other. The killer can then \"Moonwalk\", basically walking backward to hide this red light, and as result either throw off the survivor or give themselves more time to close more distance than normal allowing for the potential of a hit.\n\nLike Rainbow Six Siege, you may find it difficult to find another game like Dead By Daylight that is dominant in this genre of game in your market. At least that is the case for me in the American market.\n\nArtwork (Concept Art) and the way things look is excellent when they decide to focus on such things, with the new chapter being released, they went all out on Pinhead's (The Cenobite) \nunique animations and they look nice. Recently they also did an overhaul to the appearance of several maps, which also looks nice, especially the Cold Wind maps.\n\nThese are some of the good few things I can say about the game unfortunately and that is the reason I wanted to state these pros, and then move into the negatives.\n                                                   \nCons:\nFor once, while a game looks nice and has some unique ideas, this game completely fails in the category of balance. This is why this game is stuck as a casual game, and will likely never be a successful E-Sport. \n\nThe balance in this game is broken for several reasons but the main reason is because of the already strong base kit for survivors, perks that outright fix mistakes, items that \nalso fix mistakes while also increasing their main objective speed, and every map (If played correctly for some, but others are so broken that you don't need to play them correctly) \noutright being insanely forgiving.\n\n For example, in this game as a survivor, you have a potential base of 3 lives, which isn't that bad in theory. However, when you look at the potential for perks, you can add additional lives outright. \nLet's just stick to the meta, because this is what you likely will be playing vs. Deadhard, one of the game's most prolific perks currently allows you to outright achieve an additional minimum of 3 lives guaranteed almost no matter what with correct usage. \nA survivor who waits to use it near the killer is using this perk incorrectly, when using this perk it should always be used for correcting fatal mistakes, or directly extending the amount of time\nthe killer must chase the survivor to chain to pallets and windows that you normally wouldn't be able to reach (which is in itself a different issue, but one point at a time). \n\t\nMind you this is ONE perk, the other 3 you can equip (Max is 4 perks at one time). There is also Prove thyself, giving a 15% buff to repair speed that stacks with every nearby survivor for an insane and incredibly noticeable buff to gen speed. This makes survivors complete their main objective (Generators) at a huge accelerated rate. There are also perks like Borrowed Time that survivors typically abuse in the modern-day for extra lives rather than use them as they likely were originally intended. In modern times, Borrowed Time makes you impervious to any type of damage for one hit for 12 seconds. \nThe list goes on, there are a lot of perks you will typically see that will just be used over and over again because in this game perks typically only fall into the category of terrible, meh, or great. I can go on and on about perks because there are some other prolific ones, so I would like to speak upon the other things I have stated as to not waste a bunch of time.\n\t\nMaps, very much the newest one (RPD Station) can be on a scale from horrendous to bad all depending on the map. The reason for this type has to do with Pallet and Window formations. As a new player, you will start to see patterns in formations around the map, and these formations will dictate how safe or dangerous any particular map is. For example, T-Walls (formations with two windows and no pallets) are pretty fair for both sides. However, you commonly will see formations that are insanely safe such as shack pallet that has near no real counterplay unless you play specific killers.\n\t\nLastly, items, Toolbox makes gens repair even faster as its practical and common use. Medkits heal and have an addon to near-instant heal (literally). You can take two hits before you are downed as a survivor, in which case The Killer can pick you up and put you on a hook, and only then taking one of your lives which if the survivors don't unhook you will slowly result in your death and lost lives although the timing on this is forgiving, so this is very unlikely.\n\t\nContrast this with the killers, they're perks simply trying to slow down the game or down quicker such as Ruin that makes gens regress when a survivor isn't working on it, Undying that saves a Hex totem once, BBQ you can see survivors through walls for a few seconds, etc. \n        \nKillers are completely outclassed in this set. (Also Hex perks, unique to the killer, basically spawn physically on the map, and can be destroyed, as a result removing that perk for the\nrest of the game.)\n\t\nMaps are commonly unforgiving for The Killer.\n\tInstead of items, The killer has addons a few of which are busted, although survivors can still play through them and if the team of survivors knows what they are doing it will still be hell for The Killer to make progress.\n\t\nWhat this translates too, is the survivor is much easier and The Killer is insanely competitive. Gen speed in itself is low, all gens can and have been done in 3 minutes. This means if you play killer, vs better survivors you are strickly forced to play optimized if you want any chance of even drawing the game. Meaning, you must use some of the best killers, you must use the same meta perks like what the survivors likely will be, and you must play the best move regardless of  how unfun it might be if you want to actively compete with good survivors. \n\t\nThis is all because all of the things The Survivors have going on for them only pile and pile and pile until it's a mountain and because of this \"Camping\" or \"Tunnelling\" will be mandatory strategies, making this balance unfun for both sides.","timestamp_created":1630291622,"timestamp_updated":1630408910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98483487","author":{"steamid":"76561198068688637","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":79144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3182,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1660518577},"language":"english","review":"Dead By Daylight is an amazingly simple, yet fun, multiplayer survival horror game.

Every match tells a story of 4 survivors trying to escape an area without being caught and sacrificed by the killer. Every match is different and feels unique start to finish and somehow just doesn't get old. Each time you face a different killer (or set of survivors) in a different location where the set pieces you will use to escape (or kill) spawn in different spots so you can't ever memorize where to go. The gameplay loop created from this is incredibly satisfying and the perk & item/add-on systems give you a reason to farm up extra bloodpoints by doing daily objectives and (monthly?) challenges.\n\nAs someone who loves stealth and hide & seek games like Splinter Cell & Outlast, this game scratches that itch and I can play it with friends! I'm also a big fan of horror movies and games as well so the vibe here is perfect.

Et oui, le stress étant une des causes de l'alopécie prématurée, jouer à DBD est un bon moyen de finir comme Vin Diesel, Bruce Willis ou Dwayne Johnson ! Seulement, vous ne serez pas aussi beaux qu'eux, rip.\n\nDead by Daylight ou \"DBD\" pour les aficionados est un jeu qui vous fera stresser, bien évidemment, mais surtout rire ! Le nombre de situation improbable et de tension exaltante, ne manquent pas aux rendez-vous. \n\n***********SURVIVANTS************\nDu côté des humanoïdes, votre objectif étant de genrush comme des gros porcs (c'est à dire user de vos meilleurs compétences en ingénierie basique du type faire une Kokot), vous passerez de très bon moments à vous prendre des screamers de tueurs qui vous interrompent discrètement durant votre réparation, wlh (aka Mickael Myers du Film Halloween). \n\nDBD est aussi un jeu très réaliste où un survivant d'approximativement 1m70 peut tourner en rond autour d'une table pendant de très longues minutes et éviter de se faire tuer par un grand géant de 3 mètres de haut avec une tronçonneuse. C'est tout à fait cohérent, vous y trouverez beaucoup de plaisir ! N'oubliez surtout pas de vous T-Bag (c'est à dire vous accroupir et vous relevez pour faire rager votre poursuivant), ça réduira votre stress ! Aussi, vous pourrez utiliser des lampes de poches de chez Decathlon pour éblouir votre adversaire... mais ce n'est que secondaire. Le but principal de ces torches électriques est de cliquer à l'infini pour faire plein de bruit, c'est un excellent remède contre les acouphènes !\n\n***********TUEURS***************\n\nSi vous avez toujours refoulé votre furieuse envie de tuer des gens dans la vraie vie, comme par exemple ceux qui mettent leur masque en dessous du nez, et bien dans Mort d'ici l'aube, vous pourrez assouvir cette soif de haine pur et dure !\n\nDe plus, si vous êtes un bon tueur, vous pourrez régulièrement récolter les messages de haine des survivants qui vous ont fait tourner autour d'un rocher pendant toute la partie, mais en vain, puisque vous les avez finalement tué :).\n\nMieux encore, si vous avez fait les scouts ou êtes un vétéran de la Grand Guerre (14-18) vous pourrez \"camper\" devant les corps suspendus des homo sapiens sapiens (car ils s'apparentent un peu à des singes ces survivants), cela vous remémorer vos meilleurs moments entre amis quand vous êtes tout seul *v*. Car oui, joueur tueur, c'est accepter d'établir une relation privilégiée avec soi-même et tendre vers un certain épicurisme, sauf qu'ici, au lieu de cueillir le jour, ce sont les survivants ah-ah-ah.\n\n\n*******CONCLUSION**********\n\nS'il vous prend l'envie de vous amuser à tuer des gens de toute sorte de manière, à rendre des bugs plutôt régulier, n'hésitez pas à vous rendre sur Bug by Daylight comme j'ai l'appeler ! Plus vous jouerez à ce jeu et moins vous aurez foi en la bonté et piété de l'espèce humaine !\n\nLa mort n'est pas un échappatoire !","timestamp_created":1630272075,"timestamp_updated":1630272075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606003761291503906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98470866","author":{"steamid":"76561199121759430","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3462,"last_played":1655948719},"language":"spanish","review":"si t gusta el maincra este es tu juego anasheiiii","timestamp_created":1630271698,"timestamp_updated":1630271698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98470671","author":{"steamid":"76561199121300672","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1338,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1660430466},"language":"english","review":"the killer abuses survivors like me as a fat child abuse my parents","timestamp_created":1630271444,"timestamp_updated":1630271444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98470220","author":{"steamid":"76561198450804325","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2160,"last_played":1657835625},"language":"russian","review":"ххххххххх","timestamp_created":1630270829,"timestamp_updated":1630270829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98469336","author":{"steamid":"76561199170225958","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3036,"last_played":1645248164},"language":"english","review":"yes\n","timestamp_created":1630269612,"timestamp_updated":1630269612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98468607","author":{"steamid":"76561198084694474","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1632235789},"language":"koreana","review":"아니 재미는있는데 스트레인져 띵스 여자캐릭터 좆같이 만들어놨네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ","timestamp_created":1630268704,"timestamp_updated":1630268704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98468058","author":{"steamid":"76561198019935012","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1636725643},"language":"english","review":"this game taught me how to skin a fish.","timestamp_created":1630268126,"timestamp_updated":1651345321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98467946","author":{"steamid":"76561199085505585","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2056,"last_played":1631580643},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1630267994,"timestamp_updated":1630267994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98467604","author":{"steamid":"76561198209286619","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":113633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65078,"last_played":1655726974},"language":"english","review":"After a year of playing this asymetrical \"catch me if you can\" game.
