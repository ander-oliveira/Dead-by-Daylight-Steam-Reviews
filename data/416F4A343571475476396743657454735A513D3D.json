It's a shit storm. Now I don't mean like it's horrible or anything like that, but the community itself at least a good chunk of it is WHY I say this, constant fights against the others side, name calling, toxicity, things like that. \n\nI'm just gonna stick to the game itself and try to be as unbiased as possible.\n\nHave there been any bugs since I've played this? Looking at my hours, it would be tough to say that the game is perfect and has no bugs, however the only bugs I've experienced were WAAAAY in the early days of this game and the devs? Pretty nice people, trying to fix bug mistakes the second they learn about it, just that they give the update to it a while later somewhat causing different bugs, but hey progammers know that pain. Can't make anything perfect.\n\nSo how about gameplay? Well it's a 4 v 1... well no, more like it's suppose to be a 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 in some instances but more times than not 4 v 1, either play as a killer or 1 of 4 survivors trying to kill the survivors, or escape from the killer.  Perks that help with escaping, with killing, for being un noticed, and general things that help in the game. So the areas you play it in are randomized, but there's always like a... \"base\" kit so to say to help keep your bearings somewhat and a general idea of where some things are. Many different killers to choose from that fit how you play. Survivors are more or less \"skins\" however at least get all of the characters to level 40, that way you can get that characters \"Perks\" to help in the game itself. \n\nThere's... not much to say in story, as it's just a multiplayer, player vs player interaction, though there is some character backstory to HOW they got into this situation, for the survivors and killers themselves and some for certain items. \n\nCan you get your moneys worth? Ok for the base game, it comes with 5... 6 survivors at base, And 5 killers with different playstyles, and able to unlock ther killers or survivors just from playing the game a bunch, and all for just $20 american dollars, which is pretty cheap. Most of the dlc is just 1 killer, and 1 survivor for like.. 7 dollars, which isn't much if you don't WANT to sink a lot of hours just to unlock one or the other, though im not saying TO buy the dlc if you buy it, just if you enjoy the game but want to play as a different killer or want to play as a new survivor, that option is available to you.\n\nTL;DR $20 Dollars were well spent, DLC is there incase you want it, still a toxic community","timestamp_created":1479676736,"timestamp_updated":1543273625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26720440","author":{"steamid":"76561198276648779","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2481,"last_played":1559051559},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень затягивает и очень Увликательная покупайте классная игра","timestamp_created":1479673375,"timestamp_updated":1479673375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26720426","author":{"steamid":"76561198098722887","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":109,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1660370496},"language":"spanish","review":"Asco de juego","timestamp_created":1479673296,"timestamp_updated":1479673296,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26719939","author":{"steamid":"76561198330226548","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5446,"last_played":1621784461},"language":"english","review":"^^","timestamp_created":1479671405,"timestamp_updated":1479671405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481455057859420776","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26719815","author":{"steamid":"76561198160606084","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1531734432},"language":"russian","review":"И почему меня приспичивает в нее играть только ночью?!\n   Этот стук сердца который ощущаешь как будто у тебя стучит.

N'écoutant que mon courage et également par curiosité, j'ai décidé de craquer pour ce jeu que je possède que depuis jeudi dernier et déjà un quotat de 15 heures de jeu ; je peux désormais donner un avis constructif autour de ce soft. Avec le système Steam, on trouve des titres inédits et incroyablement intéressant alors que je suis un joueur arcade et consoles de salon.\n. Pour les plus anciens d'entre nous, on se souvient des films de style slasher des années 1980. Quelle est la définition de ce terme anglophone ? Les slashers sont généralement des films d'horreur où l'on retrouve souvent une bande d'adolescents qui se font tuer les uns après les autres par un tueur en série (ou parfois autre chose) qui fait sûrement partie de leur entourage. Cette mode débute en 1978 avec Halloween, La Nuit des Masques. Mais en 1996 Scream renouvelle le slasher movie en apportant plus de fun[style à revoir] et de gore.\nDurant la décennie 2000, le slasher se fait, plus rare laissant place à des films beaucoup plus violents appelés Torture porn comme Saw ou Hostel.\n\n. Contrairement aux précédents évaluations, je ne serais pas autant pleinement satisfait de jeu indépendant ; pourtant il se distingue des derniers titres triple A.\nReprenant en principe le jeu Evolve où vous jouez les chasseurs et la proie ; ici ce sont de jeunes survivants qui peuvent être désormais les victimes d'un tueur impitoyable s'inspirant de l'univers des slashers. Mais est-ce là un choix judicieux pour ce petit studio ? Le pari était risqué, cependant le titre Friday13Th a été repoussé et Dead by Daylight risque de plaire, au vu des commentaires élogieux du titre.\nMalgré que la réalisation graphique ne rivalise pas face au soft de Turtle Beach (Evolve) ; Dead by Daylight fonctionnera sans doute sur des petites configuration. On recense quelques bugs dans l'environnement, sans grande incidence. Cet aspect grade donne une touche d'angoisse comme si on regardait une vieille cassette VHS. Cela me rappelle des titres comme Nightmare créatures (Beat them all).\n\n. On regrette un mode solo, où on peut compenser le manque de joueurs ; surtout si on joue le tueur. Bien souvent, il a été difficile de trouver une partie. Je tiens à remercier à Z.le muet d'avoir joué avec moi, nous avons pris un pied fou à faire tourner en bourrique Michael Myers (le tueur des films Vendredi 13). \nCe personnage est malheureusement vendu en DLC, ainsi que d'autres données ; ce qui aboutit à un profond abus, de plus on dirait que le dévelppeur a donné beaucoup trop d'avantages face aux survivants.\nToujours dans les défauts, la montée en exp me semble fastidieuse et un débutant se trouve vite en difficulté sans de précieuses compétences comme saboter plus aisément les pièges à ours par exemple. Alors qu'un jeu comme Depth, tous les joueurs débutent avec le strict minimum de survie, y compris pour les requins, dommage pour ce Dead by Daylight.\n\n. Malgré de nombreux défauts, le titre arrive à convaincre, car il propose un univers prenant, doté d'une ambiance sonore incroyable. Vous apprécierez le cri de votre victime qui se traine sur le sol pour un tueur sadique. On remarque un grand nombre d'assasins assistant à la mort des survivants, nuisant la possibilité de sauver ce compagnon.\nLe titre peut être idéal pour jouer en équipe, en effet afin de sortir de cet enfer, vous devez réparer des générateurs dans la carte, de plus il est possible de soigner vos comparses. C'est vraiment un bon délire qu'on joue le monstre à la tronconneuse ou bien l'infirmière hystérique, chaque camp trouve son compte. \nLe gameplay à la manette ne pose pas de problème, mieux il est idéal pour réaliser les QTE, vous appuyez sur une touche au bon moment pour valider l'action.\n\n. Avec un peu plus de soins et des mises à jour régulière, ainsi qu'une écoute des joueurs, Day by Daylight demeure un titre sympathique et il se complète parfaitement avec Depth.\nSon ambiance unique et son principe apporte un pur moment de détente (façon de parler) ; profitez d'une promotion pour vous procurer ce titre.","timestamp_created":1479645287,"timestamp_updated":1479645287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603430092334747314","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26711701","author":{"steamid":"76561198339632609","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":23612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":25,"playtime_at_review":10369,"last_played":1660204062},"language":"schinese","review":"现在这个坂本不推荐购买","timestamp_created":1479644172,"timestamp_updated":1481100209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26711570","author":{"steamid":"76561198280515485","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4534,"last_played":1588080535},"language":"romanian","review":"It's

I was lucky enough to make friends with someone who talked me through the game and showed me the ropes, I'm barely at 15 hours played total in 2 weeks and I love this game.\n\nYes, killers who camp (stake out a hooked victim as bait for other survivors) is lame AF and I have no idea how that can ever been addressed with any finality - we will always have some players that suck that way, regardless of their experience.  \n\nOverall, if you stick with it and hang in there, you'll find a rhythm of playing that is right for you.  At the beginning I was instantly a hide and watch kind of player, now after watching a few expert streamers on Twitch, I get right in there and pitch in with generators. Teamwork makes the dream work after all.\n\nGood luck and add me if you want to play sometime.  I give this game a solid 8.5 out of 10.

If you are new player wondering if this product will get you XX  hours of gameplay, the answer is yes due to the progression system being grindy as hell to even get a taste of what the game has to offer. Basic gameplay is fun enough to keep you on the hamster wheel for a while until you figure why you start to hate the game.\n\n\"So why are you giving it a thumbs down?\"\n\nBasically the game should have never released as full-release, rather than being early-access title. DBD is one of those titles that you want to check out maybe in 6-24 months to see if the devs ever managed to figure out how to fix their game.\n\nSo, backtracking 5 months, DBD has open beta period of one or two weeks and then launches 14th of June 2016. Almost all of the complaints survive to release version, many of them are unfixed to this date. If i was to give you a complete list of all the faults that required / still require fixing, this review would become too long to read. Devolpers have SLOWLY started to figure that major bugs need be fixed when they pop out after every patch, but still have no answer to core problems of the game outside of bugs that they are still trying to hammer down:\n\nDesign flaws include such things as bad map making (Google: DBD Infinites), basic mechanics ranging from tolerable to unfair at times (Google: DBD Pallets, Hook camping), perks being just badly designed or just flat out broken good (flavor of the month OP perks such as NOED, Decisive strike, Self-heal, Sprint Burst, Sabotage just to mention few that had their fair share of crying). The game has 2 DLC killers released in 5 months, and already one of them is completely cannibalizing one of the original killers, simply being upgraded version of him. Poor wraith :(.\n\nUnfair gameplay makes community pure salt. If survivors are broken sometimes due to re-balancing, playing killer is simply not fun and killer players cry. If Killers get something good for a change, survivors will cry till they get nerfed. The cycle is endless. Game will never have positive community.\n\nIt took 5 months for the devs to realize just one of the broken designs and start figuring out a fix for it, at this speed the game is fully fleshed out sometime in 2018. Wasted potential is stamped all over this game.","timestamp_created":1479596174,"timestamp_updated":1479596225,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26701128","author":{"steamid":"76561198129176373","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1549491697},"language":"english","review":"Was a pretty fun game to play with friends.
