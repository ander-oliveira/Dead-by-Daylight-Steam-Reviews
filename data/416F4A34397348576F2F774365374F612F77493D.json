Though it is called survival horror since i have played this game for a while, it becomes less scary, but nothing a little jumpscare can't fix! They regularly update the game and recently added a new killer and are adding a new survivor as of when i am writing this (4/10/2021).\nThis game is the best when you play with friends in my opinion but if your more of a solo player killer is also very fun. I used to hate playing by myself but thanks to this game i can relax and enjoy my own company. In terms of difficulty, it is fairly easy to learn, there are lots of guides on YouTube and also learning as you go helps too. They recently added skill based matchmaking and a new mmr system, so if you are new, other people within your skill level will join in with you in the fun! This game is %100 percent worth the money, i hope this helped you make a decision on buying this game!\n","timestamp_created":1633310827,"timestamp_updated":1633310827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514018714427947998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100474297","author":{"steamid":"76561198404364746","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1633400796},"language":"spanish","review":"SI\n","timestamp_created":1633310760,"timestamp_updated":1633310760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100473990","author":{"steamid":"76561198040908357","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1652923364},"language":"english","review":"I was skeptical at first.

scheint auf den ersten Blick ein Spiel zu sein, was sehr schnell langweilig wird. Gewissermaßen kann das durchaus stimmen, denn die Spielstruktur als solche ist sehr simpel:\n4 Survivor sind auf einem Gebiet eingesperrt und müssen, um von dort zu entkommen, 5 Generatoren reparieren. Allerdings werden sie dabei von einem Killer gejagt. \n\nWarum habe ich aber schon mehr als 400 Spielstunden?\nEs gibt viele unterschiedliche Survivor, die ganz unterschiedliche Talente (Perks) freischalten können. Man kann pro Spieler nur 4 Talente aktiv nutzen. Da es aber zig davon gibt, kann man sie ganz unterschiedlich kombinieren. Durch die Kombinationsvarianten sind aber auch unterschiedliche Spielstile sinnvoll! So können manche Talente besser sein, um den Killer abzulenken oder auch Generatoren freizuschalten.\nAbseits davon gibt es auch viele unterschiedliche Killer, die wiederum auch unterschiedliche Talente haben und somit auch eine andere Spielweise erfordern.\nZudem gibt es auch Maps auf denen manche Talente besser nutzbar sind als andere etc.\n\nEs wird also schon deutlich, dass die fast schier unendlichen Kombinationsmöglichkeiten immer wieder neue Anforderungen an den Spieler stellen! Der mit Abstand größte PLUSPUNKT ist für mich aber das zusammen spielen mit Freunden! In meinem Freundeskreis ist DbD zu einer netten Abendveranstaltung geworden. \n\nWenn DU also ein Spiel suchst, was DU mit Freunden zusammen zocken kannst, was viel Abwechslung bietet bei gleichzeitig recht simpler Grundsturktur, dann ist DbD genau das Richtige für DICH! :)","timestamp_created":1633285509,"timestamp_updated":1633285509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100455949","author":{"steamid":"76561198418954948","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2006,"last_played":1645931513},"language":"english","review":"great","timestamp_created":1633285460,"timestamp_updated":1633285460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100455742","author":{"steamid":"76561199032682875","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1122,"last_played":1648946305},"language":"russian","review":"Норм","timestamp_created":1633285242,"timestamp_updated":1633285242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100455227","author":{"steamid":"76561198127576702","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2897,"last_played":1654566426},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo bom, pena que a comunidade é horrivel\n","timestamp_created":1633284657,"timestamp_updated":1633284657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49sHWo/wCe7Oa/wI="}
