Сама концепция не плохая. Игра настолько хорошая, что у неё есть клоны, да и всё сбалансировано, делает игру приятной как за убийцу, так и за выжившего. Но блядское комьюнити так и переполняет эту игру. Для многих игроков эта игра стала не просто игрушкой в которой можно повеселиться и немного подобосраться, а она стала для них соревновательной дисциплиной на ранкед. Постоянно вижу людей, которые с большим рангом пишут как мне, так и другим:\"20-тка, нуб и т.п.\". В принципе на них очень просто не общарать внимания, ведь это идиоты, которые не понимают суть того, зачем в эту игру играют, но это ещё не все. Большинство игроков в этой игре, как в любой другой кооперативной игре - дауны, которые ждут, что ты им поможешь, когда в 10 метрах от него сидит и кемпит убийца. Кемперство в этой игре вообще заёбывает. Я сам в первый раз, когда зашёл за убийцу, всегда кемперил, но потом понял, что это пиздец и перестал. Но каждую катку попадаются кемперы, что делает смысл крюка бессмысленным. Постоянно встречаются тролли в этой игре и прочие низины общества. Абсолютно каждая игра с каким-нибудь овощем. Причем я заметил, что огромная часть этих низин - русские. У меня кринж за наше общество, ведь русскоязычное комьюнити говно не только в этой игре, но и во многих других. Но менять в этой игре ничего не надо(кроме как разделять ранги, да и за убийцу игру долго ждать, лучше сделать, как во многих других играх - рандомно). Можно считать, что мой отзыв положительный и что я просто высказал свои эмоции по поводу мусора в этой игре.","timestamp_created":1596089364,"timestamp_updated":1596090110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73499852","author":{"steamid":"76561198055063341","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":106625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79007,"last_played":1656396517},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, this game is the farthest thing from perfect there is. It has bugs, and will always have balance issues and power struggles between killers and survivors, partially due to the community's own rampant toxicity. This game will drive you mad at times. However, with the amount of fun and entertainment it has given me I could never possibly consider giving Dead by Daylight a bad review. Four years later, I feel that this game is still worth purchasing & recommending.\n\nI feel this way since Dead by Daylight has been possibly the most unique and fun experience I've had in gaming to date. A simple cat and mouse concept is turned into a plethora of playstyles with all the new perks introduced as well as new killers. The unpredictability of matches keeps the game fresh and leaves you guessing. You could end up dying before even reaching 5k points, or escape with your entire team under 5 minutes! It gives way to so many unexpected gameplay moments, which I really enjoy.\n\nWhile the Devs may be slow, I feel they're really nice and try their hardest to keep the game in shape with all the new content and ideas being introduced. Most importantly, I feel that they CARE. They are by no means perfect, but it's still a breath of fresh air to see them still working and fixing things.\n\nThis game is still going very strong after all this time, and I'm really happy to see that.

anos passam e o jogo continua extremamente bugado e mal feito, cada atualização é uma tonelada de bugs, mas a empresa está mais preocupada em lançar novas skins que os bestas continuam comprando. \n\nEste jogo não tem otimização alguma, seu código é uma casa de cartas de baralho, que quando você move qualquer parte dela sem o menor cuidado, ela desaba. \n\nSe um bom desenvolvedor olhar para o código desse jogo, ele chora sangue. \nEu imagino que o código deste jogo é cheio de \"Ctrl + C Ctrl + V\", e os devs pegam esses algoritmos sem nem saber direito o que eles fazem. \nO DBD não deveria exigir a quantidade de recursos que exige do PC; é um jogo simples, mapa pequeno, sem IA, com poucas interações, gráficos de PS2, etc ... a impressão que tenho é que os desenvolvedores não têm ideia do que estão fazendo, apenas copiando e colando códigos.\n\nA solução que sugeri para isso é a seguinte:\nVenda os direitos para uma empresa que saiba desenvolver um jogo corretamente, para que eles possam dar um \"shift + del\" neste monte de lixo e refazê-lo do zero. \n\nO problema desse jogo na verdade é sua comunidade, que vive reclamando dele, mas quando a BHVR lança qualquer merda, o povo vai doido querendo comprar. Então é claro que a empresa não vai se preocupar em consertá-lo, afinal, patch de correção não dá dinheiro, muito menos refazer o game todo, que é o que deveria ser feito.\n\nFica lançando amuletozinho ninguém sabe pra quê, ou por acaso isso melhora a performance do jogo e eu não sei?!\n\nE o pior é que sempre vai ter quem defenda esse empresa horrível. Você pode ter o melhor PC do mundo, rodar todos os jogos existentes no ultra a 240fps, mas se vc tem perda de quadros com o DBD, sempre vai ter um falar que o seu PC que é ruim.

You either play as one of four survivors which need to power generators to open exit gates or the killer which needs to kill as many survivors as possible before they escape. The gameplay is very fun and exhilarating, although after a lot of hours you realize that this is less of a horror game and more of a PVP game. There are plenty of perks, items, maps (etc.), so each game is always unique.\n\nPros:\n-Lots of characters and perks to try out\n-Very fun to play with friends\n\nCons:\n-Community can be pretty toxic\n-Getting perks and new characters is very grindy\n-Developers seem to prioritize pushing real-money cosmetics over fun, free events and objectives\n-Base gameplay has not changed in years\n-If teammates disconnect as survivor, it's very difficult to come back and win","timestamp_created":1596074112,"timestamp_updated":1608047781,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73492431","author":{"steamid":"76561199066521958","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1653531241},"language":"english","review":"It's very spooky and I love the look to it all.

All changes are oriented to enhance the killer experience, to the point where survivors can only hope to do enough activities to reach the safety pip.  If the killer is feeling generous (or drunk), then the survivors actually stand a chance.\n\nThe hitbox is repulsively unbalanced and broken.  Your survivor can be 10 car's lenght away from the killer, he lunges only to barely reach a 5 car lenght distance, and still HITS you.  Want to rank up easily as a killer and/or win?  Just equip the cookie cutter perks:  BBQ and Chilli, Nurse's Calling, Bitter Murmur, and NOED.  Want extra assurance?  Do what the 92% of the killer playerbase does:  CAMP and HOVER dem hooks.  Prey on those victims harder than a drunk Harvey Weinstein at one of his Hollywood parties.\n\n\"Balance patches\" are a joke.  Example: on the latest patch, the Leatherface still remains the campiest killer ever, and the new chainsaw charges mechanic of his has had cero effect on his gameplay.  It is refilled faster than a crack addict cashing in a stimulus check to get a fix.  Yet the dev's stated this was intended to balance him out.  Balance what out?  Their bank accounts?  You can view other previous patches meant to \"enhance\" and \"balance\" out gameplay, and you'll most likely reach the same conclusions as I have.\n\nWant to play killer?  Buy this game, you won't be dissapointed.  Want to play survivor?

Although it needs some work I definitely think its worth checking out.","timestamp_created":1596066800,"timestamp_updated":1596066800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488825","author":{"steamid":"76561198393250770","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":7465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3657,"last_played":1643125833},"language":"turkish","review":"oynamayanın amq","timestamp_created":1596066760,"timestamp_updated":1596066760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488819","author":{"steamid":"76561198216117397","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1553,"last_played":1610526967},"language":"english","review":"fun to play with friends, hard game when u meet ppl with higher level.. \nwhen u get bored played as survivor, try to play as hunters..","timestamp_created":1596066747,"timestamp_updated":1596066747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488782","author":{"steamid":"76561198275060259","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":21922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17286,"last_played":1655066201},"language":"brazilian","review":"muit bom levaram meu  primo","timestamp_created":1596066695,"timestamp_updated":1596066695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488742","author":{"steamid":"76561199053080184","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1654141885},"language":"english","review":"Very fun\n","timestamp_created":1596066636,"timestamp_updated":1596066636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488718","author":{"steamid":"76561198444606815","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":44882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":123,"playtime_at_review":8525,"last_played":1660425659},"language":"spanish","review":"Lo mejor que me he comprado","timestamp_created":1596066600,"timestamp_updated":1596066600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488517","author":{"steamid":"76561198889503718","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":38768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4230,"last_played":1658121908},"language":"english","review":"its a good game for those who want to run into a survival game","timestamp_created":1596066203,"timestamp_updated":1596066203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488478","author":{"steamid":"76561198938229666","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":772,"last_played":1597554084},"language":"english","review":"fun with friends","timestamp_created":1596066145,"timestamp_updated":1596066145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488469","author":{"steamid":"76561198133162055","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1628800089},"language":"russian","review":"Дисбалансный донатный кусок говна","timestamp_created":1596066129,"timestamp_updated":1596066129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73488394","author":{"steamid":"76561198277791224","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":88019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":628,"playtime_at_review":31677,"last_played":1659761220},"language":"english","review":"You never get the same game twice.

You are scared for maybe like the first 2 games when you have no idea what the fuck is going on (as a survivor), then it is just pure cancer like any other competitive game, if you are playing the killer for the first time, always check their profiles, never go into a team with two or more people that have 1000+ hours, especially if they appear together, or even worse 4 man swf (survive with friends), you are not gonna have a good time, a lot of people get discouraged and give up on the game completely after such experiences (the ranking system in this game is kinda retarded so don't expect to be playing with/against people with the same skill level all the time). Other than that the game is really fun n addictive, there are a lot of toxic people in this game (like in any other competitive game), but there's also a lot of nice people playing it so as long as you are not a douche, you should get along with everyone just fine(in most cases).\n\nEdit: The matchmaking somehow got worse altho I still recommend this game as it can be hella fun, just don't get discouraged by assholes.
