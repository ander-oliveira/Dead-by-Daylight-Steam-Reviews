If you can put your anger aside, the game has it's thrilling moments. You can either experience the thrill of chasing or being chased, and the satisfaction that comes with it in finally downing someone, or evading the killer's grasp. However, there is a wide skill gap in the game, and many newcomers will not have too much fun with the game at first. Upon first opening up the app and entering the fog as survivor, you find yourself almost instantly found by the killer and basically just run in a straight line because you have no idea what to do. My recommendation is research some of the basic survival tools that you can use to evade and escape the killer. As a killer initially you should rank up pretty quickly, but then you'll run into the toxic survivor mains at lower ranks (note below). Altogether though, the point of the game is the thrill of the hunt and the thrill of the chase, which the game does a great job of providing. It also isn't really this two dimensional, there are a lot of things you can do in-game to make the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nBugs are another problem with the experience, but not even close to as bad as some of these salty reviewers are putting it out to be. Dedicated servers are an issue and you'll sometimes say \"how did I just get hit?\" or \"how did I not hit that\", but it's probably just because your ping isn't great, but aside from that, there are little to no game breaking bugs that really ever happen. I've only once experienced an extremely game breaking bug and that was years ago when I first started playing DBD.\n\nAside from the experience, the majority of the community aside from streamers (for the most part) and most casual players is very toxic and not welcoming to poor performance. If you're new and want to avoid initial criticism, then I'd recommend avoiding the endgame chat. People will go out of their way to grief and harass you for their own enjoyment, or simply to try and tilt you. You'll also have your fair share of cheaters so prepare for that. If you can't take a little grief and can't keep composure then play a game that isn't online against other people.","timestamp_created":1608105454,"timestamp_updated":1608105454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82481075","author":{"steamid":"76561199117776516","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1622243173},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1608104893,"timestamp_updated":1608104893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82480479","author":{"steamid":"76561198321683793","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1608103869},"language":"koreana","review":"뉴비 비추","timestamp_created":1608103925,"timestamp_updated":1608103925,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82479806","author":{"steamid":"76561199090490532","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2215,"last_played":1658940016},"language":"turkish","review":"çok iyi oyun baya sarıyo farm yapmalarını bek sevmiyorum çünkü o zaman 360 atamıyorum ama fiyat performansı olarak iyi\n","timestamp_created":1608102812,"timestamp_updated":1608102812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82479652","author":{"steamid":"76561199070861321","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":5923,"last_played":1659975824},"language":"turkish","review":"camperlar ve tunell yapanlar olmasa iyi (o yüzden decisive strike her zaman kullanın)","timestamp_created":1608102510,"timestamp_updated":1608102510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82479476","author":{"steamid":"76561198021771195","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7224,"last_played":1656014320},"language":"czech","review":"Best game Buy now","timestamp_created":1608102213,"timestamp_updated":1608102213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82478922","author":{"steamid":"76561198341051366","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":83403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55813,"last_played":1657647279},"language":"russian","review":"Не затянуло :(","timestamp_created":1608101332,"timestamp_updated":1608101332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82478700","author":{"steamid":"76561198079023701","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":19828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":196,"playtime_at_review":1841,"last_played":1659805152},"language":"english","review":"Fun game","timestamp_created":1608100959,"timestamp_updated":1608100959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82478304","author":{"steamid":"76561198384623259","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1480,"playtime_at_review":2110,"last_played":1660491451},"language":"russian","review":"Игра прикольная и страшная в некоторых ситуациях.

This is just Evolve with a Halloween skin (sort of). Also WTF is wrong with all this \"lose item and offering after a game\" thing? This is just dumb, it's anti-fun. Man, this game has PvE character progession in a semi-competitive PvP, which means that players with more hours played will always have greater perks (and more perk slots), items and offerings. To sum it up: this game lacks one vital thing for any upcoming players and that is OPTIONS. I know overwhelming people with too much stuff at the start of any game is not good but c'mon man there better ways to this. One last thing: this game has no ranked mode, or no casual mode I guess. This means that you can't relax and play a chill match because there is always Rank points at stake, and it doesn't matter if you care about it or not, it WILL affect you.\nBad customer support (let's not even talk about that poor guy who had 1k+ hours of game had an issue with his account and then Behaviour said he was lying). \nLook, in-game purchases in a paid game is unacceptable. Why don't just make this game free and then you can purchase cosmetics and such with ingame currency or cash? All about the Rift, the store or anything about money in this game is just insulting, Apple style.\nI've tried really hard to enjoy

Y aún así puede llegar a ser bastante divertido para ambas partes, lo recomiendo para jugarlo un rato, al principio puede dar bastante miedo y puede llegar a ser bastante adictivo si le encuentras el punto, y de la comunidad... el fin de cualquier juego es divertirse, se encontrarán uno que otro animal por ahí, pero bue, eso siempre en cualquier juego, diviertanse mucho y disfrutenlo, es un gran
