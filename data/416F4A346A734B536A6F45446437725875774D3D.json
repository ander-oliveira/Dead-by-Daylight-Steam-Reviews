When you actually get your first flashlight save, or accidentally walk into someone hiding in a bush and down them, or play with your friends and also meet some really cool people because of the game; even encountering 1 of the 3 people that main billy is something to behold. (i'll pray for u guys <3)\n\nThis game has toxicity, campers, tunnelers, entitlement, snoot-booping, bouncing billy's, jerryl's, killers and survivors from space, treasure chest bubba's, bleandettes, survivors farming your ass for absolutely no reason, 4 dh-ds-unbreakable's, twin mains (i think?), lots of questionable game mechanic choices, even more questionable developers, and SO.

I love the different killers and survivors that are brought into the game along with all the different builds you can make because of so many perks and ad-ons. It is a lot of fun when you have a group of friends you can talk to during the game so you can be strategic and plan out your next moves. Bringing some of our favorite characters to the gaming community has been amazing.\n\nHowever, I have had soooo many issues with matchmaking recently. It doesn't seem to matter if I play killer or survivor, I almost always end up playing against much higher rank tier opponent(s) and struggle because of it. Also, aside from Call of Duty, DBD's community of players are so toxic. I don't even think there's anything they can do about it but with the toxic players and poor matchmaking, I don't play this game as much as I use to, and I hate that because I really do love/hate the game. \n\nIf you play the game correctly, be prepared to be called names by your opponents, either side that you're on.  Apparently, playing the game correctly is a big no no. You're supposed to let survivors go, not chase them.

It can be difficult at times I know but at the same time it is fun. I do not care about winning or losing, fun and experience is my way of gaming. With almost 1000 hours in dead by daylight I can say that things are looking very positive. This is probably one of the only multiplayer games where the devs care. You probably think that they don't...but no they do. Here I will explain my reasoning. Players wanted a dating sim. First it started off as a joke, but then we took it seriously. Eventually the devs thought about it and what did they do in response? Make a new game about it. Hell, I might even buy it. So why the thumbs up even though dead by daylight has had some major issues from the past few months? Well I will tell you why. The devs listen and their marketing team is amazing. That is it and that's what makes me stay to keep on playing. Also to add on to this. To make the game more balanced in my opinion is if they add the character Morbius. Not just one Morbius but two Morbius's. Yes two Morbius's. One for the survivor and one for the killer. Don't you want to see Morbius again in action? It's the worlds highest-grossing film! I know I have heard rumors of a vampire killer so lets bring out the Morbius. Morbius's killer power can be his morbin ability where he can morb all over the survivors.

From the community, to the developers of this game. This game rewards whoever plays the most scummy and brainless strategies. As a killer survivors have such an advantage over you, its like you need to rely on the survivors getting a mistake. On top of that people playing survivor are so toxic (and killers too) that this game is guaranteed to make you have a bad day eventually. The good things you do in the game feel so pointless, which makes you pay attention to the negative more than the positive. And as a survivor, killers use the most brainless strategies to get kills, such as camping or tunneling (with Bubba especially). Which anyone can do, and its so dumb. However, I do see why some killers do that, sometimes they have no choice because they're losing so badly, or they're just doing it because they're toxic. And as I was saying with toxic survivors, these survivors will T-bag you at any given moment whether you get pallet stunned, or they're waiting for you as a killer to force them out of the exit gate T-bagging you the whole time. For the developers, The way they have made the game gets stale very quickly, every killer or survivor will run a certain OP perk that everyone uses and you just expect it. It does not make the game fun to go against people who are just using the same perks over and over again. And after 350 hours of this game i'm done with this crap, and if i ever return to this game it will be a long time coming, considering the state of the game.","timestamp_created":1654043741,"timestamp_updated":1654043741,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518348574638366699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116311125","author":{"steamid":"76561199141250758","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":67552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":306,"playtime_at_review":60386,"last_played":1660542354},"language":"brazilian","review":"goood game :) come b eat me","timestamp_created":1654041522,"timestamp_updated":1654041522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116310873","author":{"steamid":"76561198334911446","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1567,"playtime_at_review":14494,"last_played":1660579918},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mt bao","timestamp_created":1654041016,"timestamp_updated":1654041016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116310508","author":{"steamid":"76561198124173234","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":22671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4117,"playtime_at_review":2255,"last_played":1660600649},"language":"english","review":"Intense survival co-op game!
