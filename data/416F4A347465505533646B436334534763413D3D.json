If I could get my friends into a lobby and actually PLAY the game I'd recommend it to everyone I know. \n\nI stopped showing it to people when it got too embarrassing waiting for the game to work after they bought it on my word though. If the issues are addressed, instead of a new content DLC, I'd change this review immediately but holy hell just FIX. MATCHMAKING.\n\nEDIT June 2017: Nothing has changed. I get a guy to buy the game this week, we try four times to get into a lobby, two games fail to start. Tonight I sit searching for a lobby for fifteen minutes before dropping into one, then wait five minutes for the progress bar to load, only to drop me back at the main menu. There is simply no excuse for this, from a networking stance.\n\nEDIT July 2021: Four years later and a lot has changed.

The game directly encourages people to play like trolls due to the points system. The objective of the game as a victim is not to escape - you only gain 5000 points for that. You can get more points if you get chased, rescue other survivors from hooks, drop pallets on the killer and THEN escape. This leads to victims teabagging the killer to force a chase, swarming around hooks to rescue people rather than fixing the generators, lurking around pallets instead of fleeing, etc. The hook swarming by victims encourages the killer to camp the hook, which leads to endless crybaby behaviour after the match from the victims, such as insults and false reporting.\n\n2. The first point wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the second. Trash talking and abusive behaviour is part of gamer culture, after all. The second (and biggest) problem about the game is the control freak developers. If you look in the forums, there are many threads that are locked. There are many users that are banned from posting. The anti-cheat system which is a mandatory part of this game results in many false positives but the developers would rather ban nine legitimate users instead of letting one cheater go. On their Twitter accounts (which aren't followed by the vast majority of players) they arbitrarily declare certain playstyles \"cheating\" and threaten to ban people over it, because they're not intelligent enough to make those playstyles unbeneficial or impossible through patches. Rather than acknowledging the issues and fixing them, the developers just prefer to add a report button so bedwetting victims can report a killer everytime they die.\n\nBy listening to the most negative, hostile voices and obeying their demands, the developers have essentially become the game's most salty survivors. This community isn't toxic, it's just a normal gamer community that sees abusing the report feature as a way to get a tactical advantage. The developers however are 100% raw sewage because they let the inmates run the asylum. They'll kill the game with their police state attitude. Allowing people to report other users for \"griefing\" is a licence to let them report for literally anything. They shouldn't take such reports seriously, but they do.\n\nI won't use bots, I won't hack and I won't insult other users but I'll play this game however I want, regardless of the consequences. I suppose this will lead me to getting banned at some point, with a possible VAC ban on my record, even though I was playing the game unmodded and perfectly legitimately, all because I was facecamping or some other negligible tactic which annoyed developers with zero sense of a proportional response.","timestamp_created":1484906503,"timestamp_updated":1484906503,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.356718540191650391","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tePU3dkCc4SGcA=="}
