I would recommend playing it with friends but playing alone isn't bad as well.

But the game didn't lose the fun any second.\nNowadays the content of the game is really huge! I love how this game obtained a lot of licences of our favorite Terror and Horror Slashers. \nThe content they added to the game is really insane with a lot of things to do.\n\nBut Dieg if it is too good? why you didn't play it anymore?\nI play it once about 2 months nowadays, the thing is I play some survivor with friends that's fun, love to play killer too I'm a 50/50 player on that one. But the thing is for my personal attention i need a new mode of the game, I want some random mode not that competitive that you can play like 2 killers and 8 survivors just for fun. I know that it's not the target of Behaviour and I respect that. It's not a easy thing to do.\n\nI don't think I am bored to the game because new content brought me back to game again but not that much because is more of the same thing I grinded a lot.\n\nBut anyway, thank you for reading me! and thank you Behaviour for all the fun you're giving to the community I always had a great time with this game.\n\nCheers, Dieg!","timestamp_created":1636002689,"timestamp_updated":1636002689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102188139","author":{"steamid":"76561198241240350","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1615081402},"language":"english","review":"I love Michael Myers fictional character","timestamp_created":1636002306,"timestamp_updated":1636002306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102187802","author":{"steamid":"76561199085636024","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1653366830},"language":"spanish","review":"esta mamalon jugarlo con amigos \n","timestamp_created":1636001578,"timestamp_updated":1636001578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102187341","author":{"steamid":"76561199117427439","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":73552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1003,"playtime_at_review":12246,"last_played":1660440927},"language":"english","review":" good spoop","timestamp_created":1636000679,"timestamp_updated":1636000679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102187097","author":{"steamid":"76561199057607523","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":561,"playtime_at_review":10025,"last_played":1660447966},"language":"english","review":"10/10 this game is very fun to play","timestamp_created":1636000158,"timestamp_updated":1636000158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102186975","author":{"steamid":"76561199050211431","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":85,"playtime_at_review":8619,"last_played":1660356885},"language":"french","review":"Un très bon jeu pour jouer avec des amis!
