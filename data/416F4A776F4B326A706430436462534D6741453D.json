However in the execution is where this game falls apart.\n\nWhen you are the killer, you're suppose to be this unstoppable monster that is something to be feared. The reality is that you couldn't kill a fly. You can only down the other players, once downed you must then hang them on a post, where after a long period of time they will die. Yes, you can't actually kill anything yourself. Even when you get someone with your chainsaw you only down them.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if it actually meant something to be placed on the post/alter. It takes somewhere around 2 minutes for someone to die on it. That might not seem like much but the objective for the survivors is to turn on 5-6 engines. You can either go after those survivors or watch your \"hung\" survivor die. I bring this up because it is painfully easy for someone to get off the post once they've been placed there. Either they have a perk, or they have another player get them down. In which case after a quick heal it's like they were never downed.\n\nThis would be forgivable if there was actually any tension in the game, but again there isn't. You and the killer are only slightly faster than the survivors, and I mean this marginally. If you take one small turn off they will have grown the lead. You can spend an entire match chasing a single person in circles and never hit them. Which brings us to the next issue, as the killer it takes two hits to down someone. The reach of your weapon is very small, you have to be right on top of someone to hit them. This combined with the fact that you are only a percent faster than the survivors means good luck actually getting a hit.\n\nEach map is essentially a square, with various objects inside it, none of which you can really interact with. Every map feels the same, and are devoid of any interesting features for either the survivors to use or the killer.\n\nThere is potential here, if some of these issues could be fixed. Starting with making the killer something to be feared.

But though I haven't been playing all that much yet, there seems to be one flaw that might damage it in the long run: the lack of killers. When I play survivor alone I get a queue time sometimes over 10 mins, if I get to a lobby at all. As killer I get a match within ten seconds.\n\nThere are probably many reasons for this problem, but the biggest one imo is the community. Firstly, when you get into a match as a new(b) killer, the first thing you notice in the after-game lobby screen is that all the survivors are 15+, most of them lvl 25. This gives the survivors an unfair experience advantage both in perks and knowledge about the game.\n\nSecondly, the survivors can be toxic as fuck. Just today after one match I've heard words like \"autistic\", \"retard\", \"not bad. really fucking bad\" and so on. And these are the 25+ players. Sure, when you lose you can write stuff like \"fcuking camper\" and so on, but at least you are kicking up. Kicking down on a player that has lost is just untasteful and ruins any potential for new killers.\n\n I've also noticed that the killers are a lot nicer than the survivors. Writing stuff like \"gg\" and \"thx for the game\" and \"well played\" and doing things like helping you if you're new by letting new players finish generators and escape or guide/carry the newb to the hatch.\n\nAll in all good game.
