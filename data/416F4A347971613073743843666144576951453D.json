Не скажу, что прям без грехов, но хороша. Во-первых, в ней можно практически всё: Отыгрывать убийцей кемпером или честным, отыгрывать сурвом токсиком или нет. Решать вам. Можно поджигать пуканы сурвов своими действиями, чтобы они подумали, что ты читер. Можно также поджигать пукан маньяка играя постоянно с осколком и шприцом не давая маньяку и шанса поймать тебя. А если ты ещё играешь в команде с друзьями и у вас слаженная работа и крутые аддоны, то можно вообще убийце ливать с катки. Можно играть с друзьями в приват матч устраивая, что-то по типу турниров, или приват можно использовать для выяснения отношений. Кто кого круче, скиловее и тд. Игру упрастили для новичков, то бишь прокачка. Раньше такого не было. Прокачка длиться очень быстро, можно за 100-150 часов собрать себе неплохой билд перков и прокачать нескольких персонажей. Не то что раньше, где даже потратив часов 500 упорной игры ты максимум прокачивал нескольких персонажей до третьего престижа, и не открывал полностью все общие перки. Обучение для новичков было добавлено вроде бы не давно, но я к нему всё ещё не привык. За прохождение обучения тебе дают очки для начальной прокачки персонажа, это тоже можно считать за упрощение для новичков. Вообще прокачку сильно упростили. Но всё же играть новичку против опытных игроков бывает очень трудно. Потому что система подбора не идеальна. Чувак у которого 1000 часов может слиться к пятнадцатому рангу и спокойно нагибать новичков доставляя себе неограниченное удовольствие и простой геймплей. Во-вторых, имеется большое количество перков, предметов и тд. Чтобы собрать полною коллекцию перков надо сначала прокачать каждого персонажа до 40 уровня, а потом уже открывать его перки у других персонажей. Вообще делов у новичков будем полным-полно. Много карт, каждая из них имеет свою историю и геймплейную составляющею. Внедрение авторских убийц делает Dead by Daylight уникальным проектом достойным внимания. Игра имеет свою постоянную аудиторию, но она не будет хватать звёзды с неба как тот же pubg или Fortnite, но своё место под солнцем игра всё же нашла, завоевав сердца многих геймеров. У игры имеются недостатки: Баги, читеры, взломщики, недоработанный баланс, ну ещё можно сюда приписать не очень, то приветливое комьюнити. Комьюнити-здесь заслуживает отдельного внимания. Комьюнити в дбд это нечто иное нежели комьюнити в другой рейтинговой игре. Приседания за выживших, выебоны, щёлканье фонариком прямо в лицо. Токсичных действий как раз больше именно со стороны выживших, а не убийцы. Баланс здесь устроен таким образом, что выжившие играющие в команде вместе со своими друзьями, и ещё наверняка и по связи будут издеваться над убийцей как только смогут. И по этому убийца в большинстве случаев будет бессилен против таких вот выживших. Убийцы могут этому противопоставить только кемп или туннелинг. Многие любители суров утверждают, что разрабы постепенно убивают сурвов, но это не так. За суров всё ещё можно отыгрывать нормально. Конечно любители одиночной игры за суров приходится очень не сладко. Так как игроки, которые попадаются в рандомном лобби, иногда очень даже тупят. Игра сама по себе хороша, но вызывает много негативных эмоций благодаря своему токсичному комьюнити и проблемами с балансом. Достойна ли она своих денег? Не могу с полной уверенностью утверждать так как покупал этот товар по скидке в стиме. Но игра достойная. Магазин со скинами-он хорош, некоторые скины очень даже хороши. Можно задонатить и купить пару скинов которые тебе приглянулись. Тем более большинство скинов можно заработать собственным трудом. В принципе я всё рассказал, возможно, что-то упустил.","timestamp_created":1509263637,"timestamp_updated":1535218714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36102614","author":{"steamid":"76561198056532112","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1509262737},"language":"english","review":"1/10\n\nMy Experience of this garbage.\n\n1st: game looks like a*s even on max settings\n2nd: loading screen takes 15 minutes\n\nWould rather be skinned with a butter knife and have my limbs crushed by a truck running over my body.\nP.S the unistall button works.","timestamp_created":1509263040,"timestamp_updated":1509263170,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462138533592224121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36102432","author":{"steamid":"76561198099731274","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1757,"last_played":1518362529},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS VERY SKILLFUL ,HUMAN NEED TO SURVIVE UNDER THE THREAT OF KILLER.","timestamp_created":1509262458,"timestamp_updated":1509262458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36102377","author":{"steamid":"76561198091572417","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":10931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8990,"last_played":1635736041},"language":"spanish","review":"Un Fast-Game como yo les llamo, ese tipo de juego que basta entrar y buscar partida para pasar un buen rato con el proposito del genero que en este caso es horror.\nEl juego cumple con su proposito, mantenerte enganchado en una partida paranoica con un tipo de mas de 2 metros queriendo partirte por la mitad.\nA diferencia de sus competencias (que no mencionaré) este juego tiene variedad en escenarios y personajes, lo cual se aprecia mucho (aunque sean DLC); eso si el modo de juego no cambia asi que no te recomiendo hecharle mas de 2 hora seguidas.\nRecomendaciones: Tomarlo en tiempo de rebajas con todo y sus DLC de golpe, para gozar de la variedad; aunque la experiencia de nivel te hará enforcarte mas en uno que en otros.\n\nNOTA: 8/10 Es divertido, pero la monotonía puede cansar.\nSuerte con tus generadores papu, toma su tiempo.","timestamp_created":1509262303,"timestamp_updated":1606446061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36102362","author":{"steamid":"76561198162873392","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":46333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1878,"playtime_at_review":24793,"last_played":1660153989},"language":"russian","review":"Ну, в принципе, если против Фредди не играть, то маньяк норм","timestamp_created":1509262267,"timestamp_updated":1509262267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36102249","author":{"steamid":"76561198175740221","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2949,"last_played":1597039703},"language":"english","review":"Don't understand all this nerf the new killer I've already play against him over 10+ times and can still escape.

Every now and then we get a gem of an idea that takes a simple concept, but turns it into an addictive online experience.  This game is one of those!  You either play co-op with the 4 human victims, or as the solo killer.  Humans must survive, and the supernatural killer does its best to snuff you out.   This is similar to the Friday the 13th game but a lot more fun and varied!   Smart, quick, sometimes stealthy actions make up the bulk of the game.  Sort of like playing a Metal Gear Solid in the horror genre.  The sounds are the best part of the game.  They add to the experience.  When the killer's heartbeat starts reving up or the Freddy Krueger music starts playing louder, it's time to GET THE HECK OUT OF THERE!!  There's a random leveling up system to keep you entertained.  I can see how it could get old after a while without mods to enhance it, but right now I'm still enjoying the heck out of it.

Dang for a overpowered killer.\n\nI still give this game my recomendation :)\n\n27/04/2018\n\nI am changing my recommendetion to not recomended becouse of a toxic community.\n\nI have played this game for few hours and I only play killers. If people turn into how the majority of players behave as survivors then I am staying far away.\n\nNow I was in a game where one disconected before the game started. Then I was against 3 guys. I got one very early on, hooked him and went searching for the other two. Here 2 generators pop. Found one of them smacked him around then the one on the hook got off. I ran back found the wounded one hit him and hooked again. this time the other survivors did not save him and repaired a generator instead. then there were only 3 generators left whice I started patroling(nothing else to do, my killer was lvl 5 so I had no tracking perks) and I manage to find the one I smacked before(no self heal) and hooked her. To make long story short the gens were very close to my basement so I started patroling there also. Got the one I had not hit before and hooked in basement. The other one did not save him and since I was patroling gens he did not repair. After the one on the hook is gone I start running around to get the last one. Ofcourse like a true surviver she stands over the hatch teabags me few times and trys to jump down the hatch just to be grapped by me just before she gets to saftey. I than hang her on a hook and win. After the game I get the usual camper/tunneler/cheater and just for good measure reported so I ask them to please explain exactly why they would report me and they claim I had camped/tunneld the first one to die. I explain that I just got lucky finding him(should be believable since I just hadd one perk that made generators get medium skill check if kicked). At whice point I was informed that my skills suck and that I resemble womens privite parts...\n\nThis is just one of many many incidents where people are just rude and unfair when the killer wins. When I lose as killer I always congratulate people and try to be at the very least polite. If the poor killer dares to win he gets the stick so to speak.\n\nThis community so needs a tard fumigation that it is painful to watch and boring to play...\n\nP.S. I so take back what I said about Freddy. He and the rest of the killers so need a buff so this game becomes what they promise but not lets bully the killer.\n\nupdateded 07.05.18\n\nI am so sorry game that I was a salty killer :) I fully recomend the game. It has given me many good hours of play.","timestamp_created":1509253607,"timestamp_updated":1525676241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36099244","author":{"steamid":"76561198216621351","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":1645502378},"language":"koreana","review":"이건 진짜 명작인듯. 여태한 공포겜중 진짜 재밌게함","timestamp_created":1509253032,"timestamp_updated":1509253032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36098889","author":{"steamid":"76561198284189298","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":46057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38175,"last_played":1658428598},"language":"russian","review":"Играешь на Трюкаче?

(1060 3gb Msi. i3 7100. 8 gb ram, etc.)\n \nEn conclusión: Recomendaría esperar que hubiera una actualización decente o un precio más bajo para comprarlo no vale la pena pagar por el en este momento.","timestamp_created":1509229513,"timestamp_updated":1509229513,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512711822986602783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36091805","author":{"steamid":"76561198154717072","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":85438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":5671,"last_played":1659484770},"language":"brazilian","review":"wyiuftge7fruybguwrt","timestamp_created":1509228892,"timestamp_updated":1509228892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36091666","author":{"steamid":"76561198045348666","num_games_owned":614,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7124,"last_played":1576016060},"language":"russian","review":"Фредди имбалансная хуита, не покупайте, игра превратилась в дерьмо","timestamp_created":1509228516,"timestamp_updated":1509228516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529887974262237549","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36091640","author":{"steamid":"76561198164846976","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1559757790},"language":"english","review":"SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT","timestamp_created":1509228443,"timestamp_updated":1509228443,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421609818935394287","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36091455","author":{"steamid":"76561198122220744","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1190,"last_played":1510879355},"language":"russian","review":"Покупаешь игру на хэллоуинской распродаже.\n@\nРазрабы прямо в честь хэллоуина вводят хэллоуинского имбаллансного Крюгера\n@\nКрюгер невидим большую часть времени\n@\nКрюгер кидает тебя в сон, который практически нереально сбросить\n@\nКрюгер во сне видит тебя по всей карте\n@\nКрюгер еб***ал твою мамку во сне, пока еб***л тебя в игре\n@\n146% дауничей играют за Крюгера\n@\n146% других дауничей - твои тиммейты\n@\nДокупаешь Крюгера, заходишь всем отомстить - к тебе никто не коннектится в течение двух часов.\n@\nОХУ***ННАЯ ИГРА!

I prefer to play as a killer. Not to grief other people. Or, \"troll\" as others call it, I just want a fair, fun game. The problem is, this game does not deliver. I CAN LITERALLY NEVER find a match as a killer. In THIRTY minutes of lobby idling, I FOUND ONE MATCH!!!!!!!!!! ONE MATCH! I didn't grief, and had fun playing the nurse. It reminded me of Silent Hill, one of my favorite titles. I know I will probably be attacked for this, but I cannot recommend this title. If you are a new player, you WILL ALMOST UNDOUBTEDLY BE GRIEFED! Since I could not find one match as a killer. Playing as a survivor has to be fun, right? Nope, I was endlessly pursued by someone running the huntress. I was endlessly caught, killed, and put on a hook. I IMMEDIATELY was sacrificed for some reason. No other players helped me, they just literally scurried off, and allowed me to die for being level one. I wanted to put it to them, and quit. But I didn't. I literally lasted 2 minutes because I was, as the old euphemism goes, \"thrown to the wolves\". I WATCHED THREE PEOPLE SIT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, and not help. I couldn't enjoy this game, solely because I am a noob. NEVER have I seen a game so hostile for people just starting. I cannot express through any vernacular how unfair this game feels. You are at the mercy of others if you are new, and this led me to exercise my right to enact a refund. I cannot play half the game! If you are new, the only enjoyable aspect, is of course, you guessed it, being the killer. I FOUND LITERALY ONE MATCH, in an hour of play. As stated, Thirty plus minutes was idling trying to find a match as the nurse. The game could be great, if more balanced. Some people also grief in a form I never thought I would see. The last guy alive, was killed, the killer stood right by him, he escapes the hook. He then, instead of even attempting to escape, sits, and starts incessantly crouching in a repetitious manner. Known as, \"tea bagging\". This JACKASS Sits there, and crouches, till getting a hatchet thrown at him, and lo and behold, we all lost. I then received barely any points, because I was griefed the whole match. Yeah, I know, \"Stop whining yack, yack, yack, git gud, yack, yack, yack\". No, when I am literally unable to enjoy a title, and left at the mercy of jerks, I want a refund. People ruin this game. The jerks refused to aide me for being new. You know what? Everyone is new once, why be an asshole to new players??? You were one yourself once. I guess I should stop lamenting, and wrap this up. Do not purchase this game now, I have heard Freddy horror stories, and I am just glad I have not ran into him. Even though I barely played. This game is so unfair to new players. Do not buy this, speak with your wallet. This game needs work. 4/10. Would sit for thirty-forty minutes looking for a match as the killer again.","timestamp_created":1509227193,"timestamp_updated":1509227548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49902045726776123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36090894","author":{"steamid":"76561197981198416","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":90074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63806,"last_played":1658579765},"language":"english","review":"Best Game ever.
