I am so sick of dbd devs not fixing there game, all they do is bring in new killers and and fix some which only helps for so long. the mmr is sooooo bad I don't have anyone who ever plays this game with me because they won't ever touch it. my suggestion is go play something else till the devs get there act together or someone new replaces the devs there, and will listen to there community.

this review I'm not gonna talk about the positives of the game only the negatives.\n\nI bought this game when it was one sale for 10$ dollars \nhowever I spent over 40$ dollars on it just to have more content and stuff to play with (Characters) \ndidn't even spend money on skins \nwhat I'm trying to say here is if you gonna buy this game and play it completely for free after \nyou're most likely to get bored of it so think about that before buying this game \nI don't recommend this game for others because of several things,\n-player most of the time survivors or killers got almost full control of the enjoyment in the match let me tell you how, you play as a survivor the killer finds you first and after he gets you he camps you or tunnel you out of the game which is not fun, yes the other 3 survivors will escape and do gens and get out but you will just set on the hook for 5 minutes not doing anything or you will get out and get caught and hooked again in 1 minute meanwhile the other 3 survivors are not enjoying the game either because they're just doing gens and nothing is fun about that, for me having fun as a survivor is getting chased by the killer and I'm gonna get into that very soon \n-when you reach the high sbmm (skill based match making) which is basically after 3 games of you playing lol \nyou will most of the time get very strong killers with very meta perks and if you don't know what you are doing and not with a good team the match will end in 3 minutes because some killers you can't even loop (run away from them and get chased) cause their power is too strong and you need hundreds of hours to practice looping them \nnow this is gonna be it for the survivor side and I'll jump on the killer side even tho there's much more than I said but I only talked about what personally annoys me the most \nfor killer,\nif you wanna be a killer main may god help you I'll tell that much, I'm not saying this game is survivor sided or survivor friendly but you have to realize killer is way more harder/stressful/annoying and I'm pretty sure even survivor mains can even agree that's why they are survivor mains in the first place.\nit doesn't take that much of a skill in this game to beat the survivors yet at the same time you could be very skillful player and chase the survivors very good but just because u don't have that one meta perk or that really strong killer or they have that very strong loop against you, you will just lose the game because of that, also sometimes survivors make dumb mistakes and you can take advantage of that and punish them \nbut what makes killer really hard and stressful the fact that the survivors most of the time have meta perks every single game you play, every game almost feels the same everyone is using the same 4 meta perks, \nand you are not dealing with one survivor that got meta perks you are dealing with 4 of them and that makes it the match really annoying when you know what's about to happen and it happens yet you can do anything about it because that's how the game works \nif you wanna play a very strong killer like (nurse/blight/spirit/oni/ect...) with strong perks you will win most of the matches but what if you wanna play the other average killers or billow average with cute perks or even strong perks you should know and will probably get your ass kicked especially if you haven't practiced enough with the killer or the basics of the game \nnow for the last part I just wanna say this game is not bad its good but only if you are willing to really grind so hard and spend so much time into it and even money if you wanna play with other characters that are only available with real money wither killers or survivors \nI spent 1200 hours in this game yet there is so much still to learn in the game and I don't even have all the perks unlocked on all my characters and I'm pretty sure if you spent 1k hours in almost any game that should be enough to get everything in the game because you deserve it.\nthank you if you read this, \nbye bye.","timestamp_created":1650732835,"timestamp_updated":1655128847,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114346413","author":{"steamid":"76561199085931089","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1660370403},"language":"english","review":"I

BHVR wants more kills, well I want more escapes. I have escaped maybe 5 of the last 40-50 games, and some of those were killers letting me out. I have run into every camping and tunneling killer that plays this game since the update, and BHVR thinks those are solid strategies? Fine, ruin your game, but I will not participate in this any longer. It was bad before, and now it's even worse.\nOriginal: This game is fun when you get a well balanced match. Unfortunately, as survivor you're often matched with a camping and/or tunneling killer because they don't know how to win without doing so. It's fine occasionally, but often it's 5 or 6 matches in a row and with matchmaking taking as long as it does, it really ruins the fun. Who wants to play matches where a loss is all but guaranteed and as soon as you're off the hook, you're right back on? There's a difference between losing and losing like that. My only other complaint as survivor is that the wiggle bar takes much too long to fill, and it guarantees the killer will hook you unless you are either far from a hook, or the killer has trouble finding a hook. And survivors are not all that innocent themselves. I often run into toxic survivors while playing killer, and all I've literally done is just play the match. Hoping the devs will really do something to combat the toxicity. My suggestions to devs is that the ability to flashlight a killer while they are in a pallet break animation should be removed. This is toxic and unnecessary for the survivor to escape. They should also increase the penalty for staying within a certain distance of a hooked survivor and/or tunneling that survivor once unhooked. I think in the form of a matchmaking time penalty like they do with disconnects would be fair. Yes I know they punish them via blood points, but obviously it's not enough because so many still do it. I play as killer often (AND WIN) without camping or tunneling, so I would be perfectly okay with this change. Some say this game is survivor sided, I disagree. The only reason I keep playing is for the fun matches which are becoming few and far between. Take away the fun? There's no point to it. Ultimately, unless something changes, they will lose a lot of players by allowing the toxicity, camping, and tunneling to continue.","timestamp_created":1650685546,"timestamp_updated":1659402706,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503472208976745605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114313313","author":{"steamid":"76561199068975216","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":5683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5112,"last_played":1658694433},"language":"english","review":"no spring trap","timestamp_created":1650685257,"timestamp_updated":1650685257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114312810","author":{"steamid":"76561199010646669","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":13545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":361,"playtime_at_review":6790,"last_played":1660071073},"language":"english","review":"Killer Main\nPros- I kill\nCons- A piece of wood and light","timestamp_created":1650684600,"timestamp_updated":1650684600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114312478","author":{"steamid":"76561198834323868","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":6485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3051,"last_played":1656460967},"language":"english","review":"they should add a killer who has an AK47 and smokes weed and eats takis I think","timestamp_created":1650684098,"timestamp_updated":1650684098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":318,"votes_funny":108,"weighted_vote_score":"0.856388390064239502","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114310859","author":{"steamid":"76561198821395442","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":56076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2185,"playtime_at_review":39025,"last_played":1659846281},"language":"english","review":"Completely unbalanced, very toxic community, tons of hackers and bugs, and finally, lots of punishment for something you didn't even do.
