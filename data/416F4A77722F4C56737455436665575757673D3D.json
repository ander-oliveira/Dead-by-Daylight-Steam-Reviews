This is a completely idiotic idea because it turns the game from a “Survival style” game into a “Farm Simulator”. It should be changed so that you get a progression mark if you survive, not by how many blood point you acquire.\n\n2)\tLobbies – Instead of having set servers for the game the dev set it to be P2P, This means that if the host has a bad connection you’re in for a bad time. There is no auto-reconnect so if you get dropped you have to find a new lobby. Since there is no set matchmaking you can be put into a lobby with people way beyond your own skill level –which leads me to my next point- The Host (Killer) is able to see everyone’s names and ranks but not vice versa, so if you and your group are rank 20 with 10+ character levels against a rank 10 character; level 30+, you’re going to get stream rolled.\n\n3)\tNo matchmaking with friends – a huge complaint that I have seen so far is that there’s no way to play with friend online other than creating a private match. I’m sure this will be added it (But who knows how long it will take)\n\n4)\tMechanics – Some of the mechanics in the game feel a bit off/unfair.\n\n-\tNo matter how much you wiggle you won’t escape before being hooked (Unless everyone has a tool box and destroy all the hooks)\n-\tThe chances of getting off the hook on your own are extremely slim, so even if the killer leaves you hanging there if your team doesn’t come back for you you’re SOL\n\n5)\tNo team communication in the game – How can there be no team based communication in a team survival!?! The only time you can talk to anyone is when you’re in the lobby before the game starts, after that… silence. (Again I’m sure they will add something in but who knows how long it will take)\n\n6)\tThe Killer – The Hillbilly and Trapper are fine as they are, but The Wraith needs some serious tuning.\n\n-\tHe can turn invisible / move faster while invis, you can barely see his outline while he is invis, and the only way to tell if he’s there (Since the heart beat is silenced) is to sound whore the hell out of the game and listen for his growling, which is hard to do while fixing the generators) \n\n7)\tItems – I hold no issue with the Med kit or the Tool Box, however the Map and Flashlight are completely useless.\n-\tThe Map allows you to see the outline of generators… that you have already been to. This makes the map useless since you can easily remember the locations of all the generators (The game map is small / locations almost never change)\n-\tThe Flashlight has little to no accuracy and it burns through its durability extremely quickly, which means if you miss the killer on the first try don’t bother doing it again. \n\n8) No penalties for deserters - While I am guilty of leaving 2-3 games so far, I do have an issue with having no penalty to it. If someone leaves early then it makes it easier for the Killer, and it decreases the amount of blood points he gets which affects his rank.\n\n\nWhile I have listed quite of bit of negatives, I do see hope for this games future if the developers take people’s concerns and criticism seriously. From what I understand these issues were brought up during the beta yet nothing was done. This game makes you think on your feet and can be more intense than scary. I look forward to playing this game a lot more if these issues are resolved.","timestamp_created":1466303706,"timestamp_updated":1466304223,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23643616","author":{"steamid":"76561198208259520","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":54,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1466206080},"language":"english","review":"Very repative","timestamp_created":1466303650,"timestamp_updated":1466303650,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23643607","author":{"steamid":"76561198084989197","num_games_owned":706,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":833,"last_played":1558914470},"language":"russian","review":"10 ебанатов, которые не умеют нажимать пробел / 10","timestamp_created":1466303586,"timestamp_updated":1466303586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507643282413482666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23643603","author":{"steamid":"76561198057561707","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1641080514},"language":"english","review":"The game is good to play it creates a good suspense and also provides a spooky environment at the same time, yes there is a few bugs as expected for a game that has only been released on the steam market.\n\nPros\nGood music for chases,lobby etc.\nGood perks to encourage assisting other players.\nVarious different perks based on what character you choose\nMultiple locations to keep you interested in the game\n3 different killers that you can choose based on your playstyle\nbonus score for trying to save your companions\n\nCons\nA lot of lobby hoppers due to people trying to find friends, only still takes around 1 to 2 mins to find a game\nPlaying as the killer can sometimes be difficult due to i never seem to find any survivors i don't know why\nThe killer can just literally stand directly infront of a survivor and you can't get the action to grab them off the hook\nNo control rebinds\n\nDeluxe edition items\nThe artbook is currently in development which i am fine waiting for\nI recieved both of the payday 2 masks and the beta keys.

The gameplay is pretty straightforward; as a survivor, power at least 5 generators, find an escape door, and escape. However, you must do this while evading the killer and using stealth to your advantage. As a killer, of course, the object is to kill the survivors, either by \"sacrificing\" them on a meat hook to an entity in the sky, or by repeatedly slashing them as they futilely crawl to safety.\n- Survivors play in 3rd person and hear music that raises in volume and intensity when the killer is nearby. There are quick-time events that happen when performing an action, and while they can be frustrating at times, they are pretty easy to get the hang of.\n- The Killer plays in 1st person and moves slightly faster than the survivors. The killers do \"see\" loud noises given by visual cues whenever the survivors fail a quick-time event, or whenever they activate a generator.\n\n[h1]The Content[/h1]\n\n- While the game doesn't have a ton of content currently -- 4 different Survivors, and 3 different Killers -- the game is quite fun to play.\n- The maps are procedurally generated, and it seems that they use a format of combining 2 different themes into a map, and then the map is randomly generated into the style of the chosen 2 themes. There are a landmarks unique to each theme and chests usually always spawn in these landmark locations.\n- The \"Blood Web\" is the name of the skill tree in the game, but it is also procedurally generated, and you spend points earned from playing games to unlock perks, offerings, items, and add-ons. Each Survivor / Killer has their own seperate level and Blood Web assigned to them. You can, however, use your points on any character's Blood Web to your own heart's desire. As I stated, these Blood Webs are randomly generated, and there are mystery unlocks here and there that might give you a rare unlock.\n- Perks are passive abilities that give your character a slight boost in some situations, or may hinder your opponent(s).\n- Offerings are 1 time use items that can give you a boost in the amount of points you receive in a category, increase the odds of playing on a certain map, or affecting the environment by adding / removing fog, increasing the brightness of the moon, etc.\n- Items, of course, are in-game items that can aid the survivors in performing actions at a faster rate. (The med kit, for example gives you the ability to self-heal, as well as heal an ally in a shorter amount of time.)\n[b]Note: As far as I know, the killers currently only have access to 1 item that is specific to them only.[/b] You can, however use add-ons for the killers.\n- Add-ons are mods that are used in tandem with items to boost their effectiveness. For example, using a bandage with a medkit will add to the amount of time that a medkit can be used, while also decreasing the difficulty of the skill check events.\n\n- Obviously, [u]there are more unlocks than the ones I have listed[/u], those are just the few I used for examples.\n- Overall, there's a decent amount of content to pique my interest, and I've had quite a bit of fun.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\n[list][*]The game's atmosphere itself is well executed -- the audio cues from the music and ambient noise is spooky, and maintains the horror aspect while not being too in your face or too absent, which would detract from the experience.\n[*]The gameplay is pretty solid and simple, the controls are easy to learn, and the feelings you get from either escaping or pursuing are pretty great.\n[*] Farming for the unlocks can be satisfying if you're lucky enough to get a rare item in the mystery unlocks.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\n[list][*]Finding a game can be frustrating since there's no server browser. All you do is click \"join a lobby\" as a survivor and it will search for a game. However, it fails to join sometimes, so you'll be clicking a couple of times before you actually join a lobby.\n[*]The ranking system might need a re-work. If a killer disconnects while playing, you exit the game with the current point total of your actions, and might not get enough points to keep your current rank. Also, if you win too quickly and don't get enough points, you can actually get de-ranked from that as well, so it makes it more of a farming game instead of a play to win type game.\n[*]Currently, there is no re-connect system in place, so if an ally survivor disconnects at any point, you're out of luck and lose the help.\n[*]The game is based on a Peer to Peer setup, which is sometimes frustrating. The Killer is the host of the game and if they have a bad connection, it will affect your gameplay. It doesn't happen often, but I'll get about 1/15 games where I can be out of range of a hit, but it still connects.\n[*]There are a couple of bugs here and there, (getting stuck on terrain, characters not being on the killer's shoulder while he is carrying them) but it is nothing game-breaking\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall Opinion (Tl;Dr)[/h1]\n\n- Overall, I like this game. There are people who criticize the lack of content, rampant bugs, lack of high quality textures, or the lack of party functionality (which the devs have stated multiple times that they are adding).\n- I'm not saying this game is perfect, because it has its flaws, but the negative things in the game aren't that overpowering to make this a terrible game. It's still a good game in my opinion and has the potential to become a great game with a little cultivation from the devs.\n- The devs seem to be responsive to most feedback that they receive from the community, and it is good to know that they are working diligentely to make this game better.\n- The game is more of an experience and the procedurally generated maps leave you guessing on where everything is located.\n- The fact of the matter is that it is a game developed by an indie company. They did well, and you can tell that they have a vision for this game and how they want it to play out. They seem passionate about their creation, and I hope that they don't adopt terrible business practices for their future content that they will be releasing :^)\n\n[h1]Overall Score: 7.5/10[/h1]\n- This game does have some improvements that are needed, but like I said, it's a great experience and hopefully you'll give it a try!\n\nHappy hunting! (or escaping :^) )\n\n\n-- Thanks for reading! This is actually one of my first \"in-depth\" reviews for a game, and I hope it gives some of you an idea of what this game is about and has to offer.","timestamp_created":1466303240,"timestamp_updated":1466382598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23643514","author":{"steamid":"76561198088440517","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1758,"last_played":1565915944},"language":"english","review":"A very fun and rewarding game.

I've played the game for 5 hours now and it has crashed and breaks the game more times than a game is actually finished.  That's unnacceptable and I can't recommend this until you can play the game.  The worst part about the game is how buggy it is.  You wait too long to find a match.  It is the number 1 selling game on steam right now, you shouldn't have to wait at all.  When you finally get a match to start, there is at least a 50% chance that the game will break before it can be finished.  If that happens to you, no matter how much XP you earned, you lose it all.  I just crashed a game where i was the killer and had just finished off the last survivor and was taking them to the hook.  Crash.  I lost 10,000 XP and lost 18,000 XP from the completion of the Trapper Divine Ritual goal.  Talk about taking the wind out of your sails...  28,000 xp lost in a single match.

Unfortunately the developers decided to a survivor rank that goes up based on how well you play right out of the gate.\n\nAdding these systems creates a bad atmosphere where the people who have played refuse to play with any low levels who might ruin their important(worthless) rank, Starting out I have had people of both higher level and/or rank  either leave after joining or harass me/others in chat to leave because of this competitive system. And they're able to do this because the devs decided to make a competitive game with no penalty for disconnecting a.k.a the Elitist's dream.\n\nOn top of that the game has no matchmaking system and allows the killer to see your level but not vise-versa which means you don't know how many crazy perks he might have. I also did some looking up after a few odd rounds and learned that there really isnt any decent anti-cheat system in place or punishment for doing so.Out of curiosity I did a simple search for \"dead by daylight cheats\" and the first post was a forum with a guy selling subscriptions for his upcoming cheat engine and promising everything you could want. It could be fake and I really hope it is but if they dont fix their system and come down hard on the cheaters (Im thinking overwatch style with a steam account ban and name reveal).\n\nThis game could have been fun and it might still be in the future but at the moment most of what I see is a game with Elitists/Hackers and anyone who wants to play a legit or for fun has been tossed to the side. At the moment this game is as toxic as a MOBA with non of the punishment for the people who cause it.\n\nI would be happy to change my review at some point in the future but at the moment it has been a huge letdown. I would assume a company promoting a \"full release\" of a competitive online game would be smart enough to have dedicated servers that store your data rather than the archaic peer-to-peer system with player data freshly stored on your computer for easy hacking. The game is currently 1.0.1 (noticed the patch notes were graphical with nothing about fixing any of the more pressing issues). These are the type of problems you would expect to be solved during the beta. And this game should still be in beta but the devs know how suspicious people have become after the large number of \"greenlight\" and beta games on steam that end up abandoned. So they decided it would be better to falsely advertise their game as a \"full release\" at E3. The sad part is that if they had kept it in beta most people would have bought it off of the hype and given them more time to fix it.

Game is fun to grind - character progression promises fun (but not overpowered) perks and advantages.\n2. The multiplayer element is excellent (pending a good team)\n3. Your ranking in game and character level both represent your skill level, since you cannot obtain either if you are useless. Level does slowly go up regardless but at a fraction of a strong player's rate.\n4. Nice graphics\n5. No real bugs to speak of, I've only encountered some terrain issues whereby you cannot pass a tiny area as if there were a wall, but this really was a TINY spot.\n6. I've encountered no hackers at all in 20 hours of gaming time, although there have been some reports of speed hacks.\n7. Overall a great game\n8. If you get a shit team, one can make use of them as live bait (and thus a distraction while you win)\n\nI could list more pros, but that should give you a good idea.\n\nCons:\n1. There is currently (19/06/16) NO party-up system and to make it worse no error when private matches don't work. That means if you are playing with friends you have to leave lobbys over and over until you happen across each other. This can take 0-30 minutes.\n2. Following from (1) players are ALWAYS leaving lobbys which means games can sometimes take a while to start, i.e not having a party system is a con in two different ways.\n3. One 'killer' is imbalanced (the invisible dude), since it is picked in the majority of the games. I don't think I have ever lost to 'the hillbilly' killer. Contrare to this, death rate vs invisible dude is very high.\n4. The game CAN be dog-eat-dog, in that other players WILL choose their own life over you. However, I have found that if YOU help THEM they will return the favour. Although IMO this is part of the fun, I am no innocent and have been a bastard to grant myself an escape (and the vast experience reward) on countless occassions.\n5. The 'survivor skill level' system is bad since it only takes one wrong move to lose 20 minutes worth of progress. Also, if you have a DC/leaver, a bastard team or a killer who is targetting you it shits all over your hard work.\n\nHope this gives some insight.\n","timestamp_created":1466298463,"timestamp_updated":1466298463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534890592098236084","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23642708","author":{"steamid":"76561198025502714","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":42,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1466297745},"language":"english","review":"This game looked fun at first but when you play a couple rounds as the survivors you quickly notice how the balance of the match is shifted towards the killer, Sure it is four versus one but i don't think the killer needs to be moving as fast as the survivors sprint, As well as the quick time events for things pop up out of nowhere and can be one right after the other, Ultimately this game needs to get a balance check and make it a bit more fair toward every one.","timestamp_created":1466298148,"timestamp_updated":1466298148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.424458295106887817","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23642631","author":{"steamid":"76561198054176424","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":45494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":109,"playtime_at_review":23533,"last_played":1660099816},"language":"english","review":"Getting closer to a perfect game.

I have played this game a lot, more than the hours on Steam may indicate because I played it more on PS4 and some amount on XBox One as well, and I recently took a break from it.  I went probably 2 months and thought maybe I was ready to come back and play this game the way I used to.  No.  I was rank 8, and had a friend playing with me who was rank 12 and things were mostly fine.  We faced rank 8 killers but that was alright.  Then a couple more friends joined me, one of them rank 2 and one of them rank 20.  The change I was unaware of is that DBD now matches you with the highest rank player in your group instead of the average rank player in your group, so this means that my rank 20 friend who had never played before must either play alone or play against ridiculously high rank killers.

With how early the game is in development, I'm surprised how well it is. The game is difficult enough for the survivors that there’s little chance of survival, but by playing smart and using teamwork, maybe, just maybe you will get out alive. As more and more perks, items, maps, killers, ways to die/escape, etc. are added, the game will require balancing of course, but by the looks of how the game is now, I'm sure the devs will figure it out. I'm also sure a lot of people probably look at this game and wonder what fun comes out of running around turning on generators, inevitably walking into your death all for nothing. The enjoyment of the game doesn’t only come from escaping, it also comes from: \n\n1. outwitting something that has greater odds\n2. Working as a team to either complete objectives or save each other, creating an unspoken bond of gratitude for giving a second chance\n3. The suspense of knowing that right around the corner death awaits, making you not want to progress from the fear of dying\n4. The great use of audio and visuals to create and manipulate the game\n5. And of course, watching the survivors squirm as you hunt and kill them, laughing all the way\n\nI have few issues with the game, none of which can't be fixed.\n\n1. The matchmaking between players tends to put somebody of higher rank with lower ranks. Not an issue for me seeing how I have the worst rank possible, but I can see how somebody with a decent rank might be upset. I also sometimes have troubles getting a full lobby to go through because people keep leaving when they see the lower ranked people in their game.\n2. There is no way to communicate to teammates in the game. You can chat prior to the game starting, but other than that, you are on your own. It makes sense because you won’t be able to communicate from across the map, but maybe a proximity chat would work.\n3. No friend queuing function. It makes sense that there is no way to queue with a friend because a team of four survivors communicating is unfair for a lone killer, but I’m sure creating a dynamic queue that will somehow make it balanced for the killer should be in order.\n4. the most irritating and final issue I have with the game is the ranking system. When it comes to gaining rank as a survivor, you are scored on objectives, survival, altruism, and boldness. The only way to gain rank is to hit a certain threshold of points so you may gain checkmarks towards the next rank. If in a game you get less than the required amount of score, then you will derank. I have an issue with this because the point of the game as a survivor is, and should, be straight up get the hell out of there alive. One game, I fixed two generators, helped a friend off of a hook, healed them, and proceeded to leave. However, I did not deal with the murder enough because I eluded him well, and I wasn’t with my teammates at all except for when I helped the one survivor. This resulted in me having a too low boldness score and a too low altruism score to reach the score needed to rank up. Therefore, I deranked. I do spectate games afterwards, and see that people will stay when the exit is open just to turn on more generators and elude the killer to gain score. This scoring/ranking system contradicts the whole purpose of surviving the killer’s wrath. Why support the issue of risking your life to save a teammate when the circumstances obviously make it a bad idea, staying near the killer to gain points, and staying after the doors are open to gain points.\n\nLike I said, these issues can be fixed as the game progresses. I do recommend this game to people who are debating whether to get it or not.\n\nEdit: O, and the stealth perk that the murder can get that makes it so if he stand still long enough, the survivors don’t hear the heartbeat until he starts moving again... That’s uh.... that’s broken. The murder can put somebody on a hook, and stand somewhere close but slightly hidden so the survivor feels safe to save his teammate because there heartbeat isn’t beating when near the teammate. Completely negates the purpose of saving somebody if you physically can’t see the murder far away, and the survivor on the hook can’t communicate that the murder is still there.","timestamp_created":1466288224,"timestamp_updated":1466295153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523608505725860596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23640751","author":{"steamid":"76561198007573406","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1908,"last_played":1495434037},"language":"english","review":"\"The Game\" itself is really awesome and has a ton of potential, but unfortunately \"The Systems\" around the game NEED SERIOUS WORK.\n\n[olist]\n[*]The Rank System is too difficult and counter intuitive to the game itself, at times. Winning too fast and totally dominating the match can Rank you down. Being too good at the game can Rank you down. You need to play \"to farm\" instead of \"play to win\" most of the time. It's not a very enjoyable experience to play Ranked in this game.\n\n[*]The Options/Settings have nothing for keybinds, sensitivity settings, and has lackluster resolution/graphic settings.\n\n[*]The Lobby/Matchmaking System completely sucks. No way to Dynamic Queue with friends, it matches people-up with WILDLY different MMR/Skill-levels, and Queue-Dodgers do not get time-outs that should increase with each lobby that is dodged. People are constantly queue-dodging lobbies, which makes starting an actual match and playing the game a nightmare at times.\n\n[*]The Disconnect/Network System does not auto-reconnecting players back to a game when they disconnected, even if they log-back-in within less than a minute. Also, disconnected player's character models disappear from the game world, instead of being left in the game to be interacted with, like how League of Legends does it. There is also a ton of lag in-game some times while other games are amazing with no lag. It can be wildly different between matches, and you never know what you're going to get. Rage-Quitters do not get punished right now, which is a real problem. They need to get time-outs for joining new games that should increase the duration for every game that they disconnect from and they should also lose Rank points, while the players that are left in their game matches need to get Bloodpoints rewarded for the disconnected player who they cannot farm from anymore.\n\n[*]The Anti-Cheat/Exploit Systems ARE NOT WORKING and there are obvious cheaters/exploiters in the game. People with Prestige and Level 50, with 4 Ultra Rare Perks, but only have 5 hours of game time played is an impossibility. Behaviour Interactive's Competitive Esports Team needs to start taking a stance against cheaters, right now, as it's only going to get increasingly worse as more cheats/exploits are discovered.\n\n[*]The Server System is non-existent. This game should have been a Client-Server architecture, but instead they went with P2P and saving Player Data on the Client. This is a HORRIBLE idea, which is just asking for cheating/exploiting/lag-switching. The game should have had dedicated servers, where our Player Data lives at, and where matches take place on. Dedicated servers would have made the game experience WAY BETTER. What a huge missed opportunity.\n\n[*]The Company itself (Behaviour Interactive) has been super bad with their Community Managers and Esports Team, when it comes to communicating and addressing issues with the community and competitive players on the Steam forums. Their Competitive Esports Team needs to start actively revoking game licenses and banning cheaters from the game, naming and shaming them on their official website (like Blizzard does), and also posting in regards to what is and what is not acceptable play within the game, so everyone who plays Ranked matches has a baseline of what they should and should not do within a said Ranked match.\n[/olist]\n\nAgain, the game itself is good and has potential, but the systems that surround the game are really beyond freaking horrible and too frustrating to make for an enjoyable experience at the moment.","timestamp_created":1466288036,"timestamp_updated":1466291544,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":966,"votes_funny":36,"weighted_vote_score":"0.849389314651489258","comment_count":44,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23640742","author":{"steamid":"76561198086194880","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":116026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1349,"last_played":1656538735},"language":"turkish","review":"Heyecanlıysanız, korku severseniz hiç beklemeyin alın parasını karşılayan can sıkmayan bi oyun ileride cok daha güzel olur playerları fazla iken yeni iken oynamanızı tavsiye ederim 2-3 ay sonra bu kadar zevkli ve bol playerlı oynanmaz 10/10 puanı hak ediyor.","timestamp_created":1466287985,"timestamp_updated":1466287985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600232481956481934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23640696","author":{"steamid":"76561198181079717","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":35,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1466034976},"language":"turkish","review":"onlıne oynanmadıktan sonra zevkı yok  beyler tek bır harıta tek bır amac oyun seneryosu bıraz daha zengınlestırılse daha ıyı olur","timestamp_created":1466287768,"timestamp_updated":1466287768,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462914377450942993","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23640591","author":{"steamid":"76561198033975836","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":29360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":129,"playtime_at_review":2083,"last_played":1660557925},"language":"english","review":"Great game, fun dynamics and great gameplay.

One being that there is no party system so if you're thinking of playing with friends you better have 5 so you cant start a private match.
