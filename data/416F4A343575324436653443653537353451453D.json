Balance changes tend to be very reactive and not gradual, and based on data points collected by the developers that do not take into account a myriad of other factors.  Killer versus survivor interactions tend to be toxic on both sides.  Additionally, the developers refuse to address things like voice comms giving survivors a significant advantage.  Rather than addressing this by balancing or changing the game to make voice comms invalid, or to integrate voice comms in a way that is balanced and works with the killer dynamic, they simply ignore it.  All of this breeds disdain and toxicity between the two sides.\nI have hopes that the game will become what much of the community thinks it can and should be, but if you're looking to buy this game, go in with eyes open, thick skin, and a fireproof suit, no matter which side you play.","timestamp_created":1575494205,"timestamp_updated":1575494205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59241733","author":{"steamid":"76561198170513299","num_games_owned":642,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1620069369},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun güzel. ürkütücü havayı çok iyi oluşturmuşlar.

As the killer, you chase four survivors around the map, trying to sacrifice them all before they can escape.  As a survivor, repair generators to power exit gates, and then activate those gates to escape.\n\nSurvivors cannot permanently damage the killer.  In a lot of 4v1 games, the 4 are actively hunting the 1, or the 1 is a (much) more powerful version of the 4.  Not so here.  In the true spirit of horror movies, the killer cannot be stopped, only escaped.\n\nBoth roles are harder than you'd think.  As a newbie killer, all four survivors will escape many times.  As a newbie survivor, you will die a lot (and it will be terrifying).  But you'll get better with practice.  A lot of practice.  (The terror never really goes away, though.  At least not entirely.)\n\nGood for fans of difficult asymmetrical multiplayer games and horror movie fans.  Lots of killers and survivors to choose from, some with movie IPs (Freddy, Michael Myers, etc.) all with slightly different \"perks\" to earn.

Trotz der Brutalität ist es nicht ein einfaches Killer Spiel, sondern kann auch strategisch und emotional werden.\n\nObwohl ich es seid mehr als 425 Stunden gespielt habe kann ich es nicht wirklich empfehlen.\n\n1. Für Neueinsteiger ist es sehr schwierig hinein zu kommen, da es sehr viele verschiedene Killer, Perks und Fähigkeiten gibt.\nEine generelle Übersicht gibt es zwar schon, jedoch hat keiner Lust sich alle Sachen durchzulesen bevor er überhaupt weis ob ihm das Spiel gefallen wird.\n\n2. Bugs... oh ja, jede menga davon...\nOft wird das Spielerlebniss einfach von den Bugs zerstört. Ob man jetzt \"Dead Hard\" verwendet, und im selben moment trotzdem vom Killer getroffen wird, Instand Healing nicht funktioniert obwohl es verbraucht wurde, oder jede menge andere Dinge. Es gibt so viele Bugs das man diese garnicht alle aufzählen könnte. \n\n3. Connection & Spielersuche\nAngeblich sollte dies mit den Servern besser werden, sieht meiner Meinung jedoch nicht so aus. Trotz eines angeblichen 50 Ping, wird man trotzdem oft getroffen obwohl man bereits hinter dem Hinderniss ist,...\nAuch bei der Spielersuche müsste einiges gemacht werden...\nAls Killer sucht man 10 Minuten nach Überlebenden, damit die Lobby dann abgebrochen wird weil jemand wähhrend des Ladens die Verbindung abgebrochen hat, und als Überlebenden erhält man manchmal Full Lobbys ohne Killer und wartet dafür trotzdem mal eine Minute.\nMacht meiner Meinung nach keinen Sinn...\n\nEs gibt hier noch eine Menge die man reinschreiben könnte, ich bin jedoch

clicked recommend and then this popped up...so lets give you a short review:\n\n4 survivors vs 1 killer ; survivors need to repair 5generators to power the exit gates to be able to open them and escape ; survivors die when they get hooked the 3rd time, the killer can hit them (2x with normal attacks) to down them and get em hooked. the killer cant die!\nas simple as that...in a nutshell...there are \"skill-checks\" for the gens, a hatch and a cooldown for the killer-hit and so on, but i dont wanna go for that in detail to keep this short.\n\ni got 2 dislikes right off the bat\nthe biggest dislike is the waiting time when playing a killer!\nanother one is that you cant communicate with other survivors (besides 2 emotes:pointing out and a \"come\" gesture), i see that this affects the game drastically gameplaywise and they thought this out...but i would love a voicechat with a range like in the game \"friday the 13th\". the fact that the killer can hear them too makes it kinda fair, cause some guys are just so confused, its kinda unbearable sometimes! this would nevertheless be a great opportunity (but already hearing kids yelling via voicechat) for survivors, but if you play against a mid-skilled or higher killer, there is no chance all 4 will make it out alive and this would even that point.\nanyways, the dumb will be punished with death and less survivors means its harder and trickier to get out.\nsometimes thats what it takes to make it a good competition!\n\nthey add content regularly so u can constantly change/upgrade your playstyle in anyway that fits you, you can unlock perks of one character for all others so as survivor in lategame its just about cosmetics which character you play if you aready unlocked the perks you wanna play with. but as the killer you got an unique skill which is basically a special hit or a boost for your normal hits.\nthere are so many perks, perks for nearly everything one can think of (and as said regularly new content), so its up to you!\n\nsooo if you are into the excitement of hide and seek pared with getting chased horror movie style\nOR into being the killer and hunt your prey down to decide who will get out alive (...or will no one?)\neverything forged with a good mix of customization options to fit your playstyle, as both sides,\nthen come and join in, maybe i rescue you next time... or slice you with my blades
