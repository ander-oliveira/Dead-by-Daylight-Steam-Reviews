Play something else.\n\nThe community is as toxic as people claim. The developers seem to almost promote this toxicity with the tools they give to players. \n\nFace campers are an issue not dealt with, further worsened by proxy campers. However sometimes it's a borderline necessity when you're a fresh killer with under 20 games up against a team of 4 survivors who are in the 7 range with a single level 20. My experience as survivor was even more obnoxious as people farm you off the hook for points, intentionally kill them selves on hooks, disconnect on being downed one time, and you have to deal with face camping killers, I'm assured it's not like this in higher ranks... except I still see them doing it. There is no proper penalty for doing this either. There's really not a penalty for doing any toxic actions in this game. Players can even hold a game hostage if they so please, without penalty. Survivors can hang around in a level and wait above a hatch to tbag and leave.\n\nRuin: This perk is... hmm. It's essential to stop groups of four from rushing generators and needed very early on... except you don't get it early on. Meanwhile for survivors you have to deal with this perk often paired with other's that make skill checks more difficult. The general consensus is to just find ruin... except it's almost always being camped or gives off a warning via a perk to the killer. \n\nIn higher ranks you'll find people using blatantly unfair builds like Scratched Mirror on Micheal. Gen rushing survivors equipped with brand new parts for their purple toolboxes. Survivors running instant heal and adrenaline. Hatchets that instantly incapacitate you that they can carry 3 of. Players using insidious to camp hooks and mass down players as Leatherface. Actually that last one happens at all ranks.  All of this seems to have nothing done by the developers to stop.\n\nOnto the game it's self as opposed to the players :D\n\nAesthetically: Meh to good. The game is supposed to have a horror environment so it's dark and gritty but  natural that there's nothing too bombasti- oh wait no DLC cosmetics. Players and killers can wear all kinds of bright colorful outfits, and frankly I don't mind it one bit. It's adds livelyhood to the game as few people normally dress in drab boring colors designed to blend in with plants and grass. However this is counterbalanced by groups of players that wear all dark/neutral colors that help them blend in... which is kinda pathetic. Looking at you Blendettes. Most levels just feel uninspired.. I really blame the giant brick walls in the game for this as they're very samey and noticeable.\n\nGameplay: meh at best. You're sitting on a generator or trying to run in a circle around a box as a player and then drop a pallet in someone's face when they start to get close. Tedious as hell. Killers on the other hand have the joy of chasing survivors around with tons of experience at avoiding killers and abusing loops, including ones that are potentially inescapable. However I will say that it the killer end is not without it's charm. Mostly as a survivor I sneaked what wins I got. Quick time events are a no. Why do I need to spam A and D do wiggle out of a killers grasp while half the time it doesn't register the input properly? Why should I have to spam Space to not die on a hook... which is actually abused by lag switchers for easy kills.\n\nConnection. Ahem, this is where I get salty. Behaviour Interactive, take your peer to peer connection and shove it. This is hyper abused and can be affected by lag switching or killers on incredibly poor connections to get easy games. If you're on a hook and a killer uses a lag switch, it's instantly death as it counts as you missing the press. I do not care that dedicated servers are coming... for a game that's been out for 3 years and still hasn't had this issue solved. Then you have the age old issue of 4 survivors who are the difficult part of finding a match being put up against killers with 400+ ping. Of course the game does nothing to explain the connectivity issues or how to tell your ping.\n\nTutorial: It's a joke. It teaches you very little about what you need to know, and nothing to keep you alive, or stop survivors. It has lose information about the bloodweb, which is a frankly awful random leveling system.\n\nControls: Just, wow. These controls are spectacularly bad. Standing on a pallet, hit space, nothing happens, get punted into the next dimension. Try to wiggle, half of your inputs get picked up. Attempt to be kind and drop a survivor at the exit gate or hatch... R does nothing. The generator quick time events which are client side seem to have a weird delay and the animation's frame rate seems to randomly crap out and become very chunky. Slow actions seem to randomly occur instead of fast actions even when going directly at something. \n\nMy conclusion is that you should find something else to occupy your time. It's fun some of the time but frustrating most of the time due to toxicity and poor sportsmanship. At it's core, it's honestly nothing special. \n\n\n\n.... also you read all of this holy hell o ,o \n... which means you hate me or scrolled past the content. If so neat. If you actually read it, thanks for listening to my poorly written rant.","timestamp_created":1567600758,"timestamp_updated":1567600758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52434241771697998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54960545","author":{"steamid":"76561198977900520","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2168,"last_played":1653063121},"language":"english","review":"Ez  gen fix\n\nvery cool game","timestamp_created":1567598940,"timestamp_updated":1567598940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54960396","author":{"steamid":"76561198425456477","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":10679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8688,"last_played":1569846457},"language":"japanese","review":"[h1] Death Is Not An Escape\n      Pretty Good Job So Far\t[/h1]\n\n\nDead by Daylight(AKA: DBD) is a multiplayer hide and seek game where one player takes on the role of the (Stupid?) Killer, and the other four players play as (teabagger?) Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. The only way the survivors can escape is to repair five generators littered around the procedurally generated maps. If they manage it, two exit doors open, which also have to be repaired then they get to run away. Meanwhile, the killer hunts them all down using an array of sensual abilities. (but people only use common abilities like Hexs or BBQ and chilly.)\n\n\nIf the killer injures a survivor, they have to be picked up and hung on one of the many meat hooks hanging around the grim, dark locations. When the victim’s lifeforce is drained to nothing, the Entity swoops down and impales the human sacrifice with its horrible talons. Before victim's lifeforce go to zero other survivors have to choice that will go to save him or keep running their generators. \n\n\nUnfortunately, this game has countless bugs and errors. The various delay errors caused by Server ping, the absurd situation survivor climbing tree or stucking in the tree. That's why DBD users make a meme that developer's interview \"Pretty good job so far\". Also there is so much in the game that isn’t quite there. There is no tutorial or even a prerendered sequence to actually tell you the concept when you start up you’re expected to read through several instruction documents, which is a crappy way to discover the experience.\n\n\nPersonally, I think this game is a pretty funny. I really enjoy this game when I play alone or with my friends. But if developers don't fix the glitches and errors, they will see decreasing amount of people count under 20,000. Developers don't want to make shame of themselves, they must start to improve by stabilizing the server correctly.","timestamp_created":1567597956,"timestamp_updated":1567600381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672189772129058838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54959920","author":{"steamid":"76561198812013357","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":24605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1927,"last_played":1651069170},"language":"koreana","review":"dfdfdf","timestamp_created":1567594558,"timestamp_updated":1567594558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54959747","author":{"steamid":"76561198874709866","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":54095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31307,"last_played":1655842689},"language":"turkish","review":"oynamayın","timestamp_created":1567593452,"timestamp_updated":1637963341,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54959451","author":{"steamid":"76561198242608414","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":20314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6840,"last_played":1644271045},"language":"english","review":"Pretty

game has truly been a very memorable journey, there is definitely a good, a bad, and an ugly to this game. I personally feel Dead by Daylight is a must play for horror fans or people who just want a good scare every now and then or be the people who want to scare others!. Dead by Daylight is without a doubt not a perfect game as most aren't, but I believe every penny I spent on this game was well worth it. I wouldn't even mind paying full price. Within Dead by Daylight you'll come across so many different types of people while playing; people who care for each other even if they are just strangers just trying to accomplish the same goal survive, people who are complete assholes that will make you feel like an idiot for almost no reason, people that are poor sports ETC disconnecting from the game if something doesn't go their way or feel something that the killer did was not fair (which sometimes can be understood if you too see it as a good reason). People who you can relate with, have a good laugh and even become lifelong best friends, you will also come across people who you wonder are even on the same planet as you in terms of how they appear on profile/act in game. If you plan on buying this I'd suggest making sure that you are a good sport; don't just follow one survivor at a time until they die (tunneling), don't drop pallets onto other survivors that didn't do anything wrong (exception for playing with friends wanting to see them die and if they agree to trying to fight you off during the match along with the killer trying to kill your team), don't call people meaningless stupid names after the match is done its just unnecessary negative energy that nobody deserves/needs. I feel this game might help you understand a little bit more about yourself in terms of what kind of perks you like to use, how you work with others, how you kill survivors, what killers you like, what survivors you like. You might even discover if you really do have anger issues or are a poor sport after all ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. This game has A LOT of replayability in my opinion with months and months of grinding blood points to put into your favorite killers/survivors to unlock new perks even leveling them to prestige three having a full bloody outfit for them for every character in the game killer/survivor, collecting iridescent shards to unlock new cosmetics for the characters you enjoy playing as. This game might even be seen as therapeutic to some people such as myself, some people say they cant start their day off right without coffee for me its I cant start my day off right without killing people or fighting off a bloodcrazed killer coming for me. If you deal with a lot of stress killing survivors or pallet slamming a killer might make you feel better or even saving a teammate in the heat of combat might make you feel better. You can most certainly make friends in this game and forge friendships after just hours of gameplay!. If you already have close friends that enjoy horror and video games I'd highly recommend you invite them to play with you as it could be a great bonding experience. If you like horror memes this game has TONS of high quality memes in stock just waiting for you to see. In Dead by Daylight you will lose some and win some that's just how it is on this bitch of an Earth. This concludes my TEDtalk.

Very addictive especially when your drunk. \n\nPros: if you love the horror genre this game is right up your alley. Really brings the nostalgia back for beloved slashers. Some of the original designs for the killers are really good as well.\nThis game (at least for me) does take skill. There is balance in the game. If your good with survivors you'll have fan vice versa with the killer. Controls are smooth and very easy to use.\n\nCons: Some maps are to big. With four survivors and one killer it can be difficult to track people down or utilize team work. It would be nice to see a different kind of composition for the game. \nNo voice chat. Now I understand why they implicated this. It would be way to over powering for survivors to win with communication. But you can utilize 3rd party voice chat and still have the same advantage. Subjective con...but being tunneled. Nothing sucks more than joining a game and being the first one to die from tunnel vision.\n\nOver all the game is fun. Kills time and and let's you go back to the good al slasher era. It would be nice to see Pennywise as a killer and a Brandon James skin for Ghost face. I give a solid 8/10.","timestamp_created":1567573389,"timestamp_updated":1567573389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54956886","author":{"steamid":"76561198254465996","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2818,"last_played":1658262612},"language":"english","review":"it scary when you see a survivor so i must kill them and be less scared","timestamp_created":1567569909,"timestamp_updated":1567569909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54956840","author":{"steamid":"76561198119648389","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":27538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6518,"last_played":1653525442},"language":"english","review":"Very, very fun game that takes a lot of getting used to and is covered in a lot of sweat and playing for the meta.
