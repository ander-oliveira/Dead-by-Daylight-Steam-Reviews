Es verdad que hay mucho hateo al juego en lo que a bugs respecta, es verdad que los desarrolladores podrían oír algo más a la comunidad, y lo están empezando a hacer (muchos parches grandes, nerfeando cosas op como el strike, directo de los desarrolladores en youtube explicando la actualidad del juego etc), pero aún les falta un plus.\n\nCosas negativas pocas; el punto negativo que yo veo más fuerte es que el juego es limitado.

This is a very fun game to play with friends, and I have several that also own the game. This game gets my heart racing beyond what any game has ever acheived, with the terrifying atmosphere that is a dark map with a killer lurking about, searching for you. I also really enjoy the unique point and ranking system. It doesn't care how long you have been playing or how good you are. The ranking system matches you with other people that are at your same performance level at the current time, rather than with those who have played the same amount of time. Also the bloodweb and consumables are really interesting as well, I rather enjoy those. And the perks are sweet, there are so many you can get and teach other survivors.

Random freezes, crashes back to desktop, total freezes of the whole computer that required a hard reboot, lag, lag, more lag, games that seemed to start - when you were lucky to find one - then bam you were pushed back to looking for a lobby, and then it began a series of looping failings of finding a lobby.

I stopped playing for a while, hoping for updates, tried again, same issues again and again and again. \nSeriously, I loved this game. But at the moment, it's completely unplayable.

The game is so favoured to killers over survivors its not funny, which I dont understand because you can lose as a survivor and die with 1000 points but a killer who doesnt kill anyone can get min 7000. Especially since they nerfed survivors but boosted killer perks. Thats not even in addition to killers being able to cheat so easily, with no penalties. Killer hosts the lobby so they can disconnect and you lose all your points for the game u spent 10+ mins finding, knowing the killer only lost 3 pips on a ranking system that means pretty much nothing, so whoever thought of that, wtf. They can camp, rage quit, lag switch, work with a survivor, you name it. AND ON TOP OF THAT. There is a plethera of bugs and glitches. It took them 6 months to put in automatic lobby searching as a team and the current bugs I am still having TO THIS DAY is I equip an item in lobby, I bring it in but I cant use it and I lose it if I die. I cant wiggle or self heal, which is literally a waste of 2 perk slots if that happens. These bugs happen to me every 3/4 games but no response from the team and I've had these problems over 4 months now. There is also a random bug where I cant see the scoreboard or spectate at the end of the game and this is frequent as well. I think DBD makers havent been putting in the attention that a game needs to stay relevant. It was a great idea, killers and survivor characters are well thought out and are great, but the actual execution of the game is poorly executed and the team responds poorly. When Friday the 13th and Last Year arrive, this will fade into obscurity unless they get their ass in gear and stop treating it like a cash grab. So unless you want to spend 3 hours playing about 5x10 min games where you survive one, dont buy it or wait for a biiiiiiiiiiiiggggg sale","timestamp_created":1491843326,"timestamp_updated":1491922471,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477074623107910156","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31062795","author":{"steamid":"76561198190498471","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1656879421},"language":"russian","review":"игра класс, но за маняка трудно играть!","timestamp_created":1491841428,"timestamp_updated":1491841428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31061948","author":{"steamid":"76561198379772356","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1554644197},"language":"thai","review":"555+\n","timestamp_created":1491838481,"timestamp_updated":1491838481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31061419","author":{"steamid":"76561198356612177","num_games_owned":412,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":75689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20131,"last_played":1586904997},"language":"schinese","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1491836502,"timestamp_updated":1491836502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31061145","author":{"steamid":"76561198353930132","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":61457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":471,"playtime_at_review":18551,"last_played":1660277853},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno XDXD","timestamp_created":1491835634,"timestamp_updated":1513566940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31061117","author":{"steamid":"76561198336772946","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1645382076},"language":"english","review":"GOOD","timestamp_created":1491835553,"timestamp_updated":1491835553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31060528","author":{"steamid":"76561198253383948","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3746,"last_played":1651638975},"language":"thai","review":"i want the new killer for versus   William''Bill''Overbeck","timestamp_created":1491833470,"timestamp_updated":1491833470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31060479","author":{"steamid":"76561198153441581","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":17695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4360,"last_played":1652306703},"language":"spanish","review":"Da muchas horas de  diversión, pero tambien de espera para encontrar partida.

The fun is multiplied if you can bring your friends into a match with you.","timestamp_created":1491796001,"timestamp_updated":1491796001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31053390","author":{"steamid":"76561198071160424","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":42479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20187,"last_played":1659225204},"language":"english","review":"Trolling simulator","timestamp_created":1491795119,"timestamp_updated":1646514393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31053318","author":{"steamid":"76561198181493298","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":59324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28319,"last_played":1531169279},"language":"english","review":"Fun game","timestamp_created":1491794700,"timestamp_updated":1491794700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31053031","author":{"steamid":"76561198142245942","num_games_owned":567,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":43481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":978,"last_played":1632105439},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1491792679,"timestamp_updated":1574999131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484605073928833008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31052819","author":{"steamid":"76561198358822028","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4201,"last_played":1605622606},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game","timestamp_created":1491791443,"timestamp_updated":1491791443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31052584","author":{"steamid":"76561198193942869","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8925,"last_played":1535479697},"language":"english","review":"I used to love this game.

I can play killer hook one person and still have over 10k. easy blood points. but on the reverse playing survivors is basically a beat down and punishment then if you want to survive with your friends its a 14 hr wait for a queue with more than 2 people. And each time I hear about a patch it just makes the killers so much more at an advantage. I really wish you could be challanged as a killer. Survivors are at such a disadvantage that if the killer can simply watch the victim its an effortless down and Iron grasp is basically a free hook. With tier 2 or better you can take a person to the basement from accross the map. And if the hooks regen then there is no effective counter to it.
