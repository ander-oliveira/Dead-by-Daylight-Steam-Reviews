Every good piece of this game is muddied by a bloat of grinding, meta perks, annoying maps and poor balancing. Perk variety seems fun until you realize a number of them are meaningless compared to other items or perks that are direct upgrades. Perks themselves also are absolutely obtuse, demanding you either grind, wait, or pay to get it quick. A number of perks are simply unavailable to even be earned through grinding due to some killers and survivors being restricted to only paid DLC, making it so their abilities can only be achieved at the RNG shrine that only changes the 4 perks its selling once a week and also is picking from a massive perk pool. This means that perks that are restricted to DLC, particular perks you may want, can be locked behind a fairly solid pay wall. This on its own I find in a pretty low gray area for monetizing a game, but even with perks you have available, you have to grind for so painfully long.\nSay you have Bill and you have Dwight. You want to play Dwight but Bill has Unbreakable and Borrowed Time. Dwight also has perks you may want to choose. The conundrum comes from having to grind two characters for an extensive time to have an interchangeable set of perks. Once you grind Dwight's perks, or Bill's, you can finally mix and match their perks. For two survivors. And you might say, \"At least I have less grind when I just want to add one extra survivor to my roster.\" But that's not all. When you finally get to trying to unlock another survivor's perk on your own survivor, you have to hope and pray that the RNG of the bloodweb gives you the right perk and to the right tier you want, meaning you spend more BP, the currency, trying to just get the park on your survivor, on top of the lengthy grinding. And finally, once you increase your available perk pool, it eventually starts to bloat as well as other characters perks start filling up every survivor's bloodweb with perks you may not care to mix or grind for compared to others. \nPlant the same issue on killers who have even more variation between each other, with even higher perk dependency on some of them (perks they may not start with), and you have a grind hell that essentially means you will have to make DBD your job (and a job it certainly does feels like) to just get a build you want.\n\nGo play another game that doesn't demand so much of your money and time. Please. It's not like the devs behind gameplay (not art design, they do just fine) care about taking the game out of its grind, ranking, and toxicity hell hole.","timestamp_created":1647117139,"timestamp_updated":1647117181,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112063071","author":{"steamid":"76561198986487179","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20304,"last_played":1655655695},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, porém pouco balanceado","timestamp_created":1647116261,"timestamp_updated":1647116261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112062511","author":{"steamid":"76561198805094238","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1190,"last_played":1656438287},"language":"english","review":"IZKERI","timestamp_created":1647115791,"timestamp_updated":1647115791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112060256","author":{"steamid":"76561199227713953","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1650232281},"language":"brazilian","review":"é quarta-feira meus bacanos","timestamp_created":1647113943,"timestamp_updated":1647113943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112060094","author":{"steamid":"76561198799350731","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":36709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":108,"playtime_at_review":791,"last_played":1660500032},"language":"english","review":"fun game","timestamp_created":1647113785,"timestamp_updated":1647113785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112060075","author":{"steamid":"76561198042412023","num_games_owned":422,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":446,"last_played":1647585179},"language":"english","review":"What a game.","timestamp_created":1647113773,"timestamp_updated":1647113773,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535911619663238525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112060043","author":{"steamid":"76561198349845400","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":21382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":734,"playtime_at_review":15935,"last_played":1660589741},"language":"turkish","review":"getireceğiniz karakterlere sokayım","timestamp_created":1647113750,"timestamp_updated":1654986072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112060000","author":{"steamid":"76561198117259227","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":85634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7860,"playtime_at_review":34412,"last_played":1660601487},"language":"brazilian","review":"Estou em uma relação de amor e ódio com esse jogo","timestamp_created":1647113714,"timestamp_updated":1647113714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112059471","author":{"steamid":"76561198376020971","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":40754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":39703,"last_played":1660552057},"language":"german","review":"Its a love-hate relationship.

game that will make you go bald if you haven't already. The amount of stress this game provides is insane. Lots of laughs and jump-scares to be had as well.\n\nI've not touched the game for a while because it drains you, and who wants that. Some maps are in favor of the killer, and some maps are in favor of the survivors.\n\nThe only way I will ever come back to this game is if they implement a new mode. 2 killers/8 survivors. That would pull me in again, and relieve stress from the normal matches. I've reached rank 2 every time I've played. So, don't think I suck as a survivor. But when you want to play with friends that suck, it puts a stress on you that makes the game a lot less fun. So, more players would ease the risk of your friends dying immediately. \n\nAnyways, no regrets buying the game, but I will not

I opened a Support ticket about that (With screenshots) and got told that they couldn't tell me anything but will look after it. A week later the account of the person still wasn't banned.\n    I think it says more than enough that most of the community says to a) turn your profile private to prevent people targetting you and to b) turn off any communication in the game.\n\n- Resolution Limiter\n    -> since the last update you can't play in stretched resolution anymore. I got a 16:10 Monitor and two super ugly black lines on top and bottom while playing. It's to 'prevent unfair advantage'. (Just another ridiculous thing to further the competitive). Not even R6S, an ESPORT GAME, has this bs limiter.\nThis also affects the steam deck if anyone has that.\n\nIf you for some reason still want to play the game than there is 'The grind'.\nI got over... 1500? hours in this game and i don't have all of the perks i need on my characters, and certainly not enough to make any joke builds. The grind is fun in my eyes but to anyone who can't spend 16 hours a day in the game it is just ridicoulus.","timestamp_created":1647100467,"timestamp_updated":1648459605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112046782","author":{"steamid":"76561199133725341","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1647235160},"language":"schinese","review":"YYDS","timestamp_created":1647100351,"timestamp_updated":1647100351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112046774","author":{"steamid":"76561198162304074","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":26384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":921,"playtime_at_review":25463,"last_played":1660580690},"language":"schinese","review":"zzz支持北约，制裁俄罗斯是吧，我操你大爷！","timestamp_created":1647100338,"timestamp_updated":1647100338,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112046548","author":{"steamid":"76561198032524227","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":46467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46452,"last_played":1647804967},"language":"spanish","review":"El sistema de MMR (matchmaking) del Dead by Daylight es una p*ta basura.
