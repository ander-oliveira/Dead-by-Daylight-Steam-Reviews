I play Dead by Daylight to have fun and casually play a horror-game. Not to sweat in my chair and get anxious while blasting my headphones so I can hear every movement.

is potential for this game to be fun. Really there was. But lately it just feels like an abusive relationship. I remember the fun times I've had with friends in the past, real nail biting matches. Those feel like a thing of the past these days. More and more often I find myself frustrated by the experience. \n\nThe game really is held hostage by the killers. Lately it seems like survivors might as well be bots for the enjoyment it gives. Killers will tunnel survivors (oh, there's a perk for that, i hear some say), will face camp survivors (there are perks for this too), and use the Noed crutch (totem finding perks for this too, but now you have to juggle that with everything else). So... instead of finding perks that give you an edge or make the experience a little different, you are forced to equip perks that combat bad faith players. \n\nIt isn't balanced at all. If there is a killer who has even the basics down, the game is pushed in their favour something fierce. It is so easy for killers to troll survivors, it isn't even funny. The game itself will favour killers, you will often get hit through windows, around walls, because the lag will favour the killers hits. And don't get me started on how broken the matchmaking is. \n\nThis game could really take a page from the Friday the 13th books, maybe give the players a way to fight back even a little? One hit to get out of a hold? Because let me tell you, it's a miracle if you can wiggle out of the killer's grasp (why any of them would bother with the iron grasp perk. You honestly think we're going to get out of your hold unless you really cant find a hook?) You can disable hooks, but they just come back so what's the point? There is NO WAY for survivors to be even little proactive, no way for survivors to play all that differently. For killers, though? Some are ranged, some are not, some have powers, some have traps. All the variety! All the differences in game play. \n\nThere needs to be a balance here... As i mentioned at the start, toxic relationship. And i think for those of us who are frustrated with the way survivors are being mishandled, maybe it's time for a break. Time to wait for a better relationship to come along, this one just isn't worth the time anymore, and is just souring the fond memories I still have.","timestamp_created":1631237772,"timestamp_updated":1631237772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99077056","author":{"steamid":"76561198377373173","num_games_owned":546,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":76392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2073,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1660533898},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏太好了我一个7级的遇到的对手都是紫色3技能的我能说啥甚至还有外挂","timestamp_created":1631237703,"timestamp_updated":1631238284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495412856340408325","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99076957","author":{"steamid":"76561199033045393","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14958,"last_played":1659222825},"language":"english","review":"It

you plan on playing survivor you're in for a treat. The game will be rough at first until you learn the tiles and how they play into one another. By the time you figure them out you'll have earned enough 2nd chance perks to never really lose again. This dev team hold survivors hands so much they don't even have the right to be called such. Making it out of your matches is insanely easy as long as your team has room temperature IQ. If you have 1 or 2 potatoes on your team then you're probably screwed depending on the kind of killer.\n\nThe developers absolutely hate their killer playerbase. Killers are continuously nerfed, they haven't released a viable killer in 2 years. Fan hosted tournaments resulted in the strongest killers getting maybe 2 kills if they were lucky. Playing against entire teams of skilled survivors at high ranks is completely demoralising. It's frustrating as hell to know you lost because the other person literally just looked at you and ran the right way around tiles. There are no mindgames at high level of play. there are bad pallets, loops with one really short side, but outside of that theres not a single tile that a killer can mindgame to gain advantage on. All the survivor has to do is stand still at the right spots and you're moonwalking or double fakes gain you zero ground.\n\nIf you want to fully enjoy the whole game never ever buy this game. If you want to sqaud up and bully then this is the game for you. If you want to play an assymetric game where the single player is the power role.

That being said, there are some elements that stand out, good and bad, more than others.\n\nPros:\n-Great price for what you get, very fairly priced DLC/skins\n-Incredibly fun coop game\n-Perk system makes each killer/survivor feel unique and customized\n-Daily tasks and challenge-tree gives you personal objectives to work towards\n\nCons:\n-Perk system can be overwhelming to new players, especially if you are unaware that a perk is being used to cause certain headaches\n-If you play survivor: it feels like you go against the same 5 killers sometimes\n-Confusing rank/ELO system\n\nAlso, I know this game is getting a lot of backlash right now due to the newest killer. Have faith that the devs will listen to the community feedback and make the appropriate changes - they have in the past.","timestamp_created":1631229298,"timestamp_updated":1631229298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99072454","author":{"steamid":"76561199190943286","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1650,"last_played":1633224723},"language":"brazilian","review":"GOD","timestamp_created":1631229253,"timestamp_updated":1631229253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99072298","author":{"steamid":"76561198142772879","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1655067776},"language":"english","review":"Kill the people, fix the things.","timestamp_created":1631228972,"timestamp_updated":1631228972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99072270","author":{"steamid":"76561199021804195","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":14366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9893,"last_played":1657202101},"language":"russian","review":"страшылка.
