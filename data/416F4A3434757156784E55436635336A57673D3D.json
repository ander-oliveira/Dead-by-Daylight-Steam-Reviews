просто супер, давненько не было таких страшненьких игр, но всё как всегда портит баланс) Точнее его просто нет. Вас могут с 1 уровнем кинуть на мясника с 20 или даж с 50 и наоборот. Блин ребят вы гоните? Время НФС Хот Пурсуит прошло. Хотя бы сделали какую никакую сортировку кто с каким уровнем играет. Блин так угавнякать игру( В общем моя оценка 4. Я считаю поиграть стоит каждому) особенно ночью в наушниках) Будете кричать как маленькие шлюшки это стопудово)\nНа хую вертел разработчиков, не игра а пиздец какой-то когда начинаешь афигенно играть, доходишь до конца и тут тебя выкидывает. ИГра бажная за 4 дня покупки 2 раза словил баги тупо в текстурах висел.но блять эти кики заебали вкрай.\nОбратите внимание если выходишь из игры теряются очки и инвентарь. Разрабы сосут хуи.
