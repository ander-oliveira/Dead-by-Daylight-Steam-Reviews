The Bloodweb system is fun and really offers replayability to get new Perks and items, etc. \n\nHowever there are some game breaking glitches that the creators have not fixed since the start. There are trees that will eat you. Yes. Not literally but if you go to them, you have a good chance of getting stuck on their edge or inside them. You can't get out and the only way to free yourself is to get downed by the Killer and picked up. Sometimes that doesn't even work. Same thing with some Hooks in the game that the Survivors get on. Rocks as well can be glitched including random invisible areas on Maps which could ruin your game.\n\nThe Struggle system is still terrible, since most hooks are very close to eachother on certain maps and Killers can most of the time very easily get to one. \n\nThe Developers are ego filled and don't listen to the community at all. While a majority of the community are the same and toxic to the core. You will have people threatening you left and right that won't get a sniff from the mod's noses.You will have people do really awful methods to make sure they win a game or to just screw other players over such as purposely revealing their team to the Killer, working with the Killer, etc. Don't feel bad, there are some wonderful and awesome players in the game on both sides of the Kill/Survive coin. However if things keep going how they are, these shining players will drown in negativity. \n\nFor only 20 dollars, this game IS a snatch deal. You WILL have fun just be cautious of who you play with and who are on the Forums. Your fun could easily derail and sour your outlook for the game itself.\n\nGood luck in the

However, the execution is lacking and the developers seem nonresponsive. I gave this game a long time to get better, and it did a little. However camping is still has good incentives, which is a frustrating aspect of this game which will likely be its downfall. I hope this game gets better, but it is becoming a chore to play. Don't waste your time here yet, find a game with developers that listen to the community.\n\nIt is 2018 and the devs still have not addressed major problems with the game. Facecamping is still viable. Hatch standoffs are still a problem. Controls are glitchy in some cases. For example if you are standing on the hatch the game will sometimes use M1 to selfcare rather than jump in. The devs did do a good job revisiting some perks, but these changes should have been made a long time ago. Crutch perks such as selfcare, decisive strike, no one escapes death, and hex ruin still exist untouched, while exhaustion perks were needlessly nerfed into the ground. \n\nAs of now I am still playing this game as the gameplay is addictive. Going from a deadly hide and seek to an adrenaline fueled chase is the only thing this game has to keep me around. I will still play, but I will not support this game until the devs start acting like they actually play this game and understand the mechanics as well as the average streamer. This game's major problems have been obvious for a long time, and these problems are the ones the developers never seem to look at. Instead they drop new killers and perks that further serve to create new balance issues. Great job of the fat asthmatic clown that is somehow also a track star and rpg alchemist. I know, for your next killer have it be a fisherman that can throw a hook that looks like a generator, and when a survivor tries to repair it they immediately get hooked in the basement on stage 2. Ya, that would be awesome. And make the fisherman's map an ocean, and he is the only one with a boat and the survivors have to swim. The pallets don't work because they are floating.

They used to have issues with finding games with friends but they are doing work to fix it and me and my friends used to call this game \"Dead by Loading\" but not anymore!!! This game has an amazing concept and great survivor perks and Killers. This game requires skill and will improve your reaction time if you play survivor. You will be more keen to your surroundings by hearing and looking with killer. You also get to meet the community and truly, I think this is just a great game!!!\n\nEdit: After 500+ hours in, as of today, they suck at fixing hitboxes, bugs, and they seem to make most games one sided, I would recommend if you like constant issues or if you like getting tunneled/camped/farmed by killers and useless teamates, game is fun but only with friends, otherwise its not as fun\n\nEdit: Alright, 1000+ hours in. They are working their ass off and are actually listening to the community and making improvements to the game. This game is alot of fun and you dont get flamed as much any more and especially with people on console being in lobbies now. You will only get flamed if you are bad at the game and will only get tunneled/facecamped if you are either really good or if the killer is new. Still alot of fun but I still don't play it unless its with a friend because solo queue can be really painful queuing with a team with no coordination. 8/10 Still very fun to this day\n\nEdit: almost 1500 hours of playtime, still alot of fun, MMR makes the experience more enjoyable most of the time and the game feels alot better on the survivor side but queues are back to being long, love the new content and I'm so glad Hawkins is gone, but there are a few maps that need work, overall still quite enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1493849674,"timestamp_updated":1640926136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31531828","author":{"steamid":"76561198062654629","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":61910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12910,"last_played":1638119461},"language":"thai","review":"อคือตอนนี้ เข้าเกมไม่ได้มีปัญหา Launch Error ไม่ว่าจะหาวิธีแก้ทางไหนก็ไม่สามารถเล่นได้ อยากให้ช่วยเหลือด้วย","timestamp_created":1493848197,"timestamp_updated":1493848197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31531781","author":{"steamid":"76561198218474643","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9234,"last_played":1614365794},"language":"russian","review":"разработчики аутисты,каждый день клепают обновления,а игра как не работала корректно,так и не работает","timestamp_created":1493847936,"timestamp_updated":1493847936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31531494","author":{"steamid":"76561198255107940","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":62338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22666,"last_played":1632277535},"language":"brazilian","review":"Legal bem loco empolgante","timestamp_created":1493846317,"timestamp_updated":1493846317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31531276","author":{"steamid":"76561198012036994","num_games_owned":431,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":57178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":359,"playtime_at_review":7874,"last_played":1660581724},"language":"english","review":"Love this game\n","timestamp_created":1493845239,"timestamp_updated":1493845239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494423657655715942","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31531025","author":{"steamid":"76561198107205977","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":9833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7864,"last_played":1646168793},"language":"german","review":"Macht mit Freunden aufjedenfall Spaß !\nIst empfehlenswert :D","timestamp_created":1493844121,"timestamp_updated":1493844121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31529627","author":{"steamid":"76561198040290679","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1517148011},"language":"english","review":"So fun and so worth the price!
