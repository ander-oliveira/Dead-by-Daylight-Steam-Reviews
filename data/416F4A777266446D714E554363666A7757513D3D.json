But that aside, who would have thought that starting up generators and tipping over pallets as a survivor for hundreds of hours could be so fun. Generators are typically how you’ll survive a match and you need to power up 5 of them to activate the exit doors, of which there are 2. There’s also the exit hatch that can be seen once enough generators are powered up and you can either use a skeleton key in advance to escape, though those are an ultra-rare item, or you can survive long enough to be the last survivor and it will open for you if you know where to find it. Being a killer can be fun too but in my opinion the nurse is totally unbalanced and against her the pallets are virtually useless.\n\n\nOne of the best things to have come from this game for me, besides fond memories and the lingering, creeping dread and tension of trying to survive, is the fact that I’ve spent far longer leveling up characters in this game than in any other I’ve played to date, which now makes me feel that leveling up a character in a different game will no longer be anywhere near as frustrating or as time consuming as it sometimes seems to be.\n\n\nBehav10r, simply put, you have made the best 4v1 survival horror game to date – please make more in the future (oh, and be sure to make at least one of the male characters have an immaculate Dwight-like stache) :] \n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW FROM LATE JUNE/EARLY JULY:\n\nDo you like cornfields? Do you like powering on machines? Junkyards? Estates? Chainsaws? Hooks? Sacrifices? Perks, items, burnt offerings, hillbilly killers, crows and quite possibly pooping in your pants?  Well my friends, if you can say 'YES' to any of those things then you'll love this game.  It looks good, plays great and killing, or being killed, has never been more fun.","timestamp_created":1465962621,"timestamp_updated":1480122996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563648","author":{"steamid":"76561198093686912","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":15686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1517,"last_played":1645503681},"language":"english","review":"It's still in beta.\n\nEdit: Is good now","timestamp_created":1465962546,"timestamp_updated":1604626276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563636","author":{"steamid":"76561198071929564","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1562351674},"language":"english","review":"Big fun...and sexy game...","timestamp_created":1465962473,"timestamp_updated":1465962473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563620","author":{"steamid":"76561198044609547","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":1471819273},"language":"english","review":"I personally believe the public matchmaking with friends will ruin the game, but everyone won't realize that until they witness it for themselves\n\nThe solo experience is much more kosher\n\nOverall a great time for those who are able to play games alone without having a panic attack because their is no public matchmaking with friends","timestamp_created":1465962335,"timestamp_updated":1465962522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563611","author":{"steamid":"76561198027329760","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":38666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29326,"last_played":1622533375},"language":"english","review":"9/11 was better then this\n\nGo play Last year:: The nightmare","timestamp_created":1465962265,"timestamp_updated":1545163654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563600","author":{"steamid":"76561198159403203","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":6643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1609684550},"language":"english","review":"This game isn't worth your time and money in it's current state, \n\nDO NOT BUY until the devs fix the lobby problems (IF they do)\n \nMy biggest gripe with the game at the moment is the inability to join a game and play it.

Incredibly well balanced, despite how many saltine crackers out there disagree. This game is not easy, which as a gamer usually more inclined towards casual games, would normally be a turn-off for me, but honestly I have a lot of fun no matter whether I'm playing survivor or killer. My only gripe is the same as the rest of the community. While we currently live in a glorious time where Survive with Friends is a thing, it takes FOREVER to find a match.

There are problems, but the gameplay is pretty fun. Most of the people having problems with the game post discussion threads, despite stickied posts on it and about two dozen others like it, because they did not take the time to investigate the game prior to.\n\nThe game does not have ranked mode with friends currently. Why?\n- It creates an unfair advantage as the friends can use VOIP to coordinate against the killer.\n- ^ This ruins the immersion and is not the way the devs want it to be played.\n- This issue was noticed early in development, it is being worked on; however, this requires balance so that the killer is not underpowered.\n- It's far too easy for a friendly killer and a friendly survivor to farm a crapload of blood points.\n\nSolution? There's a mode for it and it's the top priority of the dev team; it will allow up to 3 friends to play (based on current information). They've been working on it for over a week, so bare with them or honestly GTFO and stop whining. No one gives a crap about you refunding.\n\nThere's no microphone or chat. What kind of teamwork game doesn't let you communicate?\n- Communication, microphone or text, ruins the immersion of the game.\n- It creates an unfair advantage 4v1. \n- The devs specifically did not want it as a feature.\n- You CAN get by without communicating. If your team sucks, they suck; however if you find good players, you will notice an unspoken communication between them, as with all games.\n- This is NOT necessarily a teamwork based game. You can be as selfish as you want if it gets you to the end. It's all up to your playstyle.\n\nYou can't rebind keys.\n- On the way, I believe it was 2nd or 3rd in the dev to do list.\n\nYou can't change specific graphic settings.\n- ^^ It's either 2nd or 3rd on the dev to do list.\n- You should be able to change settings by forcing them with your GPU's control center.\n\nThe game is poorly optimized.\n- This is true and it needs to be improved upon. The Beta ran FAR smoother than the current build is for me.\n\nSabotaging costs too much toolbox charges; flashlights barely work.\n- Toolboxes were pretty OP during the beta, but they overnerfed them to be absolute crap. Flashlights hardly ever work. They need to be buffed/fixed.\n\nThere's hook graphical errors that cause players to float/perform weird animations/be entirely non interactable.\n- This needs to be fixed and has been a problem since beta. It was less of a game breaking bug in beta.\n\nKillers can teleport out of map, thus making the game unplayable for them, by hitting a player simutaneously performing an action.\n- Been in since beta, but is fairly rare in my experience.\n\nRanked mode is glitchy/requires too much/I lose ranked progress when killer DCs.\n- Losing ranked progress while the host DCs has been in since beta, you used to also lose your items, but they fixed that. I don't know if it preserves add ons or offerings. If you find an item, you get to keep it.\n- It used to be far easier to rank up as you could 1-3 pips based on doing okay, doing great or doing perfectly. It's too hard now to get even 2 pips.\n- Despite getting enough points for a pip, I've still not gotten pips/lost pips.\n\nPlay with friends mode doesn't have matchmaking of any kind.\n- This needs to be addressed as well. They should also have an optional VC option on friend lobbies that runs in the game (I've heard people speak before in lobbies, so I can't imagine it would be too difficult to implement).\n\nDespite these problems, I still really enjoy this game. I think it could potentially replace L4D2 as a horror-esque, extremely fun to play coop game. If you want to wait a few patches before buying it, go ahead. I totally recommend it.\nThe dev team is passionate but quite small.

The devs clearly don't know how to balance anything nor how to get patches out in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where 4 survivors attempt to escape the killer. The survivors have to repair 5 generators and then open one of several exit gates before they can leave, or if all but 1 survivor are dead, escape through a hidden hatch in the nick of time. The killer has the job of finding people and placing them on meathooks, in order to sacrifice them to his entity. There are currently 4 killers and 5 survivors. The survivors have different unique perks, ranging from self healing to destroying meathooks, which are what the killers use to kill people.\n\n The Wraith can cloak (Albeit with a loud signalling of their bell) and decloak (with their bell again) in order to surprise survivors. The Trapper sets up beartraps around the map, which can catch unwary survivors and make them easy pickings. The Hillbilly gets a chainsaw straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which can instantly knock down a survivor if he manages to land his charge, meaning, no, he can't always instantly take you down. The Nurse has a teleportation ability which lets her jump past obstacles that survivors place in her way, but if she misses her teleport then she gets stunned and almost blinded, assuming she doesn't use her remaining two very short range blinks to correct her mistake.\n\nThere's a \"levelling up\" and \"ranking\" system in play, both separate. Levelling up involves collecting XP (Bloodpoints) during matches from naturally doing what your role entails (escaping/killing) and doing it well. You then spend your bloodpoints on the bloodweb, where different perks(Equippable, permanent buffs that have several ranks), offerings (one time use, randomly activating powerups), and add-ons (Things that improve your tools as a survivor, or improve your special ability as a killer) are available for purchase. Note that add-ons will always disappear if used as a killer, but if you use one as a survivor and don't die OR expend your items \"charges,\" then the add-on should stay with you. The ranking system grades you on a scale of 20 to 1, 20 being the lowest. If you do very well as a survivor or killer, and rack up a lot of bloodpoints in matches, you will gradually climb ranks towards 1. It seems to influence matchmaking, but don't be surprised if you're a rank 20 something and the game feels like throwing you against rank 1's. Because matchmaking is hard.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay can be considered \"tense\" when you first start playing as a survivor. You don't know where the killer could come from, only that he's looking for you. You don't know where your friends are, you just know you need to fix these generators and leave ASAP. This goes out the window entirely when you level/rank high enough, then the game becomes stupidly easy and you can abuse your broken perks to handily evade the killer for 3 minutes while your friends fix every generator.\n\nPlaying killer is like playing a time attack game. You're constantly under pressure to kill survivors and you can't stop for a second. If you hesitate, the generators are already fixed and the survivors are teabagging you at the exit gate and then complaining about how laggy you were. For some reason the survivors dominate the flow of the game. If you play killer, expects lots of frustrating matches against high ranking VOIP teams determined to make your life completely unfun.\n\nThe game is definitely survivor sided and the devs refuse to admit this while regularly nerfing killers. Don't get this game to play killer. Or, if you do, get 4 friends, play regular gameplay for a while to unlock levels and items, and then only ever play Kill Your Friends mode with them so everyone can actually have fun.\n\n[h1]Visuals/Audio[/h1]\n\nThe game looks fine. I'm not much of a graphics person. It ran on my six year old laptop, if that says anything. Sound design is very important, so it really is a good idea to play with a headset plugged in. The killer FOV is always extremely limited (Unless you find a certain perk for the Wraith) so that killers are forced into tunnel vision, survivors get a third person camera to use. Apparently the game runs in Unreal 4, and this game looks pretty bad if that's the case.\n\n[h1]Major Pros and Cons[/h1]\n\nYou can rebind some keys now, which is better than what it was at the start.\n\nThere is now a party up system, which has understandably frustrated a lot of killers since people abuse this system to VOIP with their friends, guaranteeing very easy games for survivors.\n\nThe game can also be frustrating as a survivor should your teammates prove useless, as with all team games. At least in this game you don't HAVE to rely on them all the time, but they're your only ray of hope should the killer catch you and place you on his meathook.\n\nA gigantic con is the insane grind of this game. You will spend hours working to level up your characters, and you have no choice but to focus on one character to level up. Playing low level killer against high level survivor is a nightmare where the survivors bully the killer. A survivor without any perks can still win, but it's just not the cakewalk it could be. Survivors are massively overpowered (Don't let the survivor mains hear that though) and have game breaking perks letting them remove hooks AKA the only way they can die, run faster than the killer (The cooldown COOLS DOWN WHILE THEY'RE STILL RUNNING) and heal themselves in the occasional event the killer catches up to them. There are loops the survivors can run in the game where the killer literally cannot catch them. A dev with functioning brain cells could fix this in a map editor in 5 minutes. These devs took 3 months to unveil a \"fix\" that does absolutely nothing.\n\nThe only major pro is that if you manage to get a high levelled survivor you can mercilessly bully all the killers in your path and enjoy the devs pandering to you with every new patch and stream.\n\nExcept all future support aside from bugfixes that create more bugs to cost money. Enjoy paying for this early access game.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nThe game devs clearly favor the survivors. In their latest patch (In fairness, a public \"beta\" to test the upcoming patch) they debuted a slew of killer nerfs while leaving all the unfair survivor tactics in the game. Their proposed infinite loop fix does nothing at all. Playing killer past rank 10 becomes a chore and is unfun. Avoid this game at all costs and go buy The Last Year or Friday the 13th instead.","timestamp_created":1465960449,"timestamp_updated":1474485481,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563318","author":{"steamid":"76561198124069191","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":3546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1625746555},"language":"english","review":"ping is scarier than the killer","timestamp_created":1465960350,"timestamp_updated":1465960350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589282214641571045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563315","author":{"steamid":"76561198063832133","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1472269989},"language":"english","review":"I was so excited to play this game I bought it so I could play the Beta.

After playing for several more hours I have decided that this game has too many flaws in it's current form.\n\nThis should be an Early Access title, as the game is not near complete. There are a ridiculous amount of bugs, as I've been stuck in the enviroment or glitched out of being able to attack at least 10 times. The ranking system is embarassingly bad, as it does not value efficiency but just actions.  if you play the killer and manage to kill all the survivors in 5 minutes, you will DERANK because you didn't earn enough points. To rank up you have to hit then once and then let them go to heal, so you can then hit them again for more points. Absolutely mindnumbing game design. The ranking system was MUCH better in the beta, where you simply earned points.\n\nPlaying a survivor becomes boring fast. Fixing generators is not nearly interesting enough to be the main objective in every single match. The minigame is average at best, but suffers when you have to play it extensively every time you are a survivor.\n\nLeveling up feels time consuming and like a grind. You have to purchase tons upon tons of worthless one time use items simply to get a chance to get a half decent perk.\n\nOther faults worth mentioning:\n-Window Jumping, I don't now how this even got past in-house play testing\n-Hook/Hatch camping, makes for boring gameplay and stress-free escapes\n-Certain killers are worthless on some maps. Such as the Wraith when played on Coldwind farm where he is easily seen, or the Hillbilly when played on the junkyard as the chainsaw charge is useless in all the debris.\n\nThis game has potential to be a very fun asymmetrical muliplayer game, but the fact that they released it as a finished product is a sham. This game needs atleast another few months of intense development.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter giving the game nearly a year I have returned only to find it in exactly the same spot of mediocrity. They appear to have fixed the bad ranking system, but this has only been replaced by it constantly wiping your rank each season, so the beginning of each season consists of severely unbalanced matches as the good players are remixed with the bad. They also have done nothing to fix the core flaw of playing as a survivor, which is that it is super boring. I don't want to hold mouse 1 and then hit spacebar every 10-25 seconds for literally half the match's runtime. All of the new (mostly paid) DLC looks neat, but I have no interest in playing as any of the new survivors, as they will still be stuck fixing generators, and I have some interest in the new killers, but I don't think they are worth the money for a game where I already hate one of two playable sides.\n\nI have no advice for this game's developers, the only solution I can think of is completely revamping the survivor gameplay, but given how little progress this game has made in the last year I doubt that will ever happen.\n\nUPDATE 2:\nSurvivor gameplay is still abhorrently bad and consists of the same terrible minigame still. They also have yet to fix the game ring-around-the-rosey with pallets, which is as unexciting and frequent as it ever has been, though they did fix window hopping. I don't think they could update this game to be good, it simply has too many severe flaws to its core systems. I hope another one of these games comes along and actually does it right.

Doesn't matter if they didn't \"intend\" it in the original vision of the game. It's fine to have a matchmaking queue where solo queue is the only option, but there should be a queue that incoporates smaller parties of friends. It's kinda of weird not being able to play with your friends in a co-op game.\n\nA Private server is your only option to play with friends, but it's only useful if you have 4+ friends who own the game.\n\nEdit: This game is fun if you can overlook it's glaring issues. The lobby system needs work. Queuing with friends is a disconnecting fright fest that leaves you having to rejoin friend lobbies over and over. There are moments when this game is genuinely fun but more often than not it's mostly some kind of percent chance rng luck dice roll. The developers have lost sight of making the game fun. They add and nerf perks just to balance out the game without regard to fun gameplay. Perks give you RIDICULOUS abilities just so the devs can patchwork whatever idea they think is balance. \n\nMichael Myers is able to walk up to a full health survivor and literally press one button to trigger a cutscene death without having to engage in skillful gameplay. \n\nThis is VERY VERY bad gameplay. That's not fun for the killer and it's definitely not fun for the survivor. That kind of thing should be rewarded to a player if he's done something SKILLFUL. SOMETHING DIFFICULT.\n\nSome complain about the pay 2 win model. It's not overly done here but it is relevant. Some killers are absolutely braindead easy. Some are difficult to use. Until you face higher level survivors being a killer is relatively easy. \n\nOverall this game has to have some problems fixed. The matchmaking, queueing and joining system needs to be fixed. That takes precedent over the next dlc, the next nerf or the next buff. There are times where you spend more time in this game trying to start an actual game than you are playing it.

Изменено количество необходимых очков для повышения ранга. Лично я хочу играть с хорошими игроками и против хороших игроков. Отбор стал жестче...может это плюс, но чтобы прогрессировать необходимо каждый раз быть МВП...зачем? Человек снимал с крюков, лечил...но его вклад мал? Глупость...он может сделал даже больше, чем генераторные боты. А бывает так, что за маньяка вам попались новички и в первые 3-4 минуты вы уже подвесили всех на крюки...можете сказать досвидания рангу) Но еще более здорово то, что проигрывающий маньяк может покинуть бой, а вы лишитесь ранга=)\n\nБаги. Из-за отсутствия премейдов народ входит и выходит из лобби...если в вашем лобби было 4 человека, но один сбежал и за пару минут никто не зашел...Поздравляю!

I bought this game since my younger brother is visiting from several states away and figured it would be fun to sit on the couch together and play, unfortunatly local co-op is not an option in this game. But after playing a few rounds by passing the controller back and forth I relaized this game wouldn't work for local co-op at all, but we did have fun watching the other person play, freaking out when the killer was close or yelling out bad advice for where to hide/run. \n\nOverall we have played this game for a few rounds and we fell in love with it. We will continue playing to try and achieve the character perks that can be bought with the rewards earned in game. So I would defiantly recommend this game to others.\n\nA few things that some people have mentioned:\nThe killer is not OP at all, I have played the killer a few times and trust me although he is strong and impossible to kill it is fairly ease to hide. I watched my little brother literally crouch behind a car and simply wwalk around it at the same pace as the killer in order to avoid him. All of his abilities help those situations.\nsecondly, Some have complained about the wait time to be a killer. You have to understand that everyone wants to be a killer and, unlike the survivors, only one person can be the killer per match. this results in a long line for killers. but a very short line for survivors... which leads me to my third point.\nYes people will often quickly enter and then leave lobbies in an attempt to find their friends, this can be slightly aggravating but isn't a huge deal considering how quickly they are replaced with a new player.","timestamp_created":1465958448,"timestamp_updated":1465958448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23562988","author":{"steamid":"76561197980911715","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1634930251},"language":"english","review":"Man this game is fresh.

The bugs and bad matchmaking are gone, and have been gone for quite some time. The game is still fun, and the only difference is now there is a large variety of killers and some new survivors to choose from, along with new maps. It's a lot of fun to be able to play as killers from well known slasher flicks like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Nightmare on Elm Street. Excellent halloween game and excellent game in general. Good job.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game is fun, but between the matchmaking being terrible and the ton of bugs, I cannot recommend the game at this time. You guys had a beta to sort out all of these issues, but apart from maybe one bug, all of the bugs from the beta are still present in the full game on release. Also if you could give the wraith his own unique weapon swing reset animation like the hillbilly, that'd be awesome. Keep it up, proud of you.

Pre-ordered, and since I already owned Payday 2 got it for $16.99 which is a steal for this game.  Been playing all night, and it's even better than the beta with the new maps and new killers.  They currently don't have party play but the developers have said numerous times it's on it's way, if it's just you and one other person it's very easy to do a countdown and get into the same game, have played 15 games or so tonight with my friend just counting down from 3 and most of those times we actually got into the same game on the first time.  I think all the killers are pretty well balanced so far, people are complaining about the Wraith but he is actually not hard to see, he has a shimmer, the biggest thing is you just don't get the heartbeat when he's near.  But he also has no traps and nothing else to randomly stop you so it's evens out.  \n\nIf you're a fan of horror games/movies, if you like to feel your heart racing, if you want a game that when you make it to the exit you literally feel like you actually survived something horrific, get this game.

I get it that killers literally sitting at a hook, watching a player as he dies is a little annoying, but that should most definately not be a bannable offense. It makes no sense at all. I'm currently studying to be a game designer, and I have played this game since there were glitches with players floating around the map and I have loved the entire concept of this game. The machanics work smoothly and it's a fun and sometimes scary game to play with your friends. But forcing players to play your game the way you want them to is breaking almost every \"rule\" (I use this term lightly) about making a game. You should allow the players to play a game however they want. If they camp a hook, then the rest of the survivors can easily get the rest of the generators back on before the first person even dies. If a player wants to camp a hook let them, they're just hurting themselves, but they are still playing how they want to play. The next problem I have with the game is the matchmaking mechanic. I've notice a lot after playing time and time again, that even when I am ranked 20, I still get matched up with rank 1 killers. That doesn't make sense to me. Yes, it would be hard to differentiate between players who are skilled that just want to stay at low ranks to get blood points, but there must be other ways to fix this other than allowing rank 1 killers to demolish rank 20 survivors. Once again I really love this game, and want it to succeed to the point of reffering everyone I know to get the game and let me kill them! But it's getting hard with some of the aspects of the game that could be deal breakers for some of my friends.","timestamp_created":1465954898,"timestamp_updated":1479545274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23562409","author":{"steamid":"76561198052797655","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":16109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10086,"last_played":1613430733},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist super ..  Super Atmosphäre authentische Maps und man merkt das es mit Liebe gemacht ist .  Nur was ist das Problem  man kann nicht mit Freunden gemeinsam  zocken wegen den Problemen beim verbinden, aber seien wir mal ehrlich es ist ganz selten das ein Game rauskommt und man kann das volle Spiel genießen  ich denke an cod.....  Wenn man alleine spielt findet man relativ schnell eine neue Lobby.  Abzuwarten bleibt was sie mit den neuen killern  ob die Gratis dabei sind oder ob se den gleichen Fehler wie Evolved machen aber das wird sich noch zeigen. \n\nFazit:  Ein super Spiel mit kleinen Startschwierikeiten das auch ( ich denke)  relativ lange gespielt werden kann da man mit jedem Charakter steigen kann und was neues dazukriegt. ES LOHNT SICH DAS SPIEL FÜR ca. 20 Euro zu kaufen. \nHoffentlich kommen auch neue Maps und Killer aber werden sicher kommen. \n\n\nUPDATE :    Das Game ha nun noch meh  Bugs als zuvor es lädt teilweise die halbe Map nich mehr , es passiert oft dass manirgendwo  liegt und ist trotzdem auf der schulter des killers der ( z.b Geist kann sich unsichtbar machen und andere jagen ). Bild im ACC.   Der Killer ist eigentlich noch weit weg aber trifft dich auch wenn du 1 meter hinter einem Fenster stehst ( k.a ob se die range ein bisschen erhöht haben ) . Und das nervigste ganz oft springt der Überlebenscharakter nicht mir richtig drüber  er rutscht nur ein bisschen schneller und dadurch bin ich schon so oft draufgegangen dass ich das Spiel die letzten Tage gar nicht mehr so gezockt habe es nervt eigentlich wenn man entkommen wäre aber du springst schnell durchs Fenster und er Klettert mittellangsam drüber.

When someone disconnect while holding them you still stuck in place forcing you to quit. I do give them credit they fixed the cheese with window jumping in small shacks.

Wraith is lackluster, you go invis but it takes time to go in and out. Playing against good players you are better off stay out of invis because you waste time especially when someone is hooked. I've yet to lose a match as the killer, only one person has gotten away from me through the hatch (including beta).  People crying about wraith needs a nerf haven't played against people that actually know how to play survivor. Its really easy to hear the wraith coming from a mile away and its not completely invisible, imagine predator. \n\nAlso what needs to be fixed if the killer leaves you lose that match as the survivor. So if you are the last one and about to jump into the hatch then the killer disconnects you lose. \n\nThis game might be better in a few weeks so I recommend holding off until then. Its has potential just needs work. Also, there is no party system yet but they said they plan on implementing one just no word on when they will do it.
