The first few games are really an intense experience, from the survivor side at least. That's the thing about this game; survivor and killer are basically like 2 completely different experiences. The ranking system is fair, and the leveling system gives you something to do if you hit rank 1. Perks, equipment, offerings, etc. add to the variety of things you can collect and acheive. Once you get used to the game, it becomes extremely fun. Whether you play stealthy or aggressive, you can expect to have a fun experience. The developers have been adding and fixing things, so you can expect the bugs/glitches to be fixed. \n\nPros: \n- Any playstyle is rewarding and fun for either side.\n- In game elements make the game worth grinding. (Perks, equipment, offerings etc.)\n- Smooth gameplay for the most part, graphics are great.\n- Variety of characters/maps\n- Can play with friends\n\nI'm sure there's more but you get the jist.\n\nCons:\n- In game bugs can be frustrating, but usually they aren't frequent and only happens on occasions.\n- Matchmaking can be long, but it isn't anywhere near as bad as it used to be.\n\nOverall this game is a great pickup, I'd reccomend watching streamers who have been playing for awhile and are very good so you can see the gameplay for yourself.

It's fairly balanced for the most part, and it's a blast to play. Each match makes my palms sweaty. The developers have done a great job at creating a conduive atmoshphere with easy to learn controls. However, the game is currently still in production and they are still working on a lot of fixes, so this review is of the current state. \n\nWith all the positives, this game has some pretty major issues. For starters, matchmaking is like having your fingernails removed by pliers, and it's worse if you are in a group with friends. It's slow, and when you group with a friend, you attempt to find a match and it inevitably fails the first time, then it completely disbands the group. So the process is:\n\n1. Invite friend(s) to party\n2. Everyone click's ready\n3. Game attempts to find a match\n4. Game fails to find a match and returns everyone to the main menu, disbanding the group\n5. Repeat until you find a match (usually 4-7 tries)\n\nIt makes it so slow that everyone I've played with has said \"F it\" and we play solo. Solo, the matching is a bit faster. It still returns you to the menu a lot, but you can quickly requeue. For this being a multiplayer only game and not supporting grouping or parties, this is a pretty major issue. \n\nSecondly, matchmaking is fully random. A new player can get matched with the best player in the game, or the best killer. Not a huge deal, but because there is also no moderation or ability to flag / report abuse, it's quite often when a total novice will get harassed and cussed out by other players, using every name in the book, including \"kill yourself\" or \"kill your family you deserve to die because you suck\" and there's nothing you can do about it. This makes it a very unwelcoming environment for newer players trying to learn. \n\nAdditionally, I'll be frank here - the tutorials are absolutely worthless. They tell you around 5% of the game mechanics, and the rest you either learn by trial and error, or read guides published by other players. Items, leveling, add-ons, perks, etc, aren't explained in game at all. \n\nAs a killer, the gameplay gets a bit worse. If you are a new killer (like me) finding people can be very hard. If you get matched with a high level player that knows the game and the maps and how to hide, what will often happen is they will camp in the map and soak up points, and you have no choice but to sit there and wait for them to give up or escape, or just run around endlessly looking. There's no way to end a match or resign as a killer, so sometimes matches can take 30+ minutes because of this. It's made me all but abandon even learning to play as a killer, which I would love to do, but I can complete 5-6 matches as a survivor in the time it takes me to finish 1 match with a camper. There's also very little explination as to how to be an effective killer. And you can't team up with friends publically as a killer. \n\nThe game obviously suffers from a lack of killers, as they are the hosts (or DMs of sorts) of the match, and I fear this is adding to it. I want to love the game, there is a lot of potential here, but often I get too frustrated waiting 20 minutes to find a match, sometimes getting kicked in the lobby due to poor connection to the killers. \n\nThe DLC is...odd. Because of the nature of the game, skins / clothing for the survivals isn't just cosmetic, it's a critical game mechanic. Launching a DLC that turns your characters into giant shining flashlights (like a bright white track suit) seems, well, stupid for a stealth game that relys on blending in with your surroundings; surroundings that are often dark, green, misty, (dark natural colors). I play on occasion, but can't recommend it in it's current state due to the glaring bugs and issues that are plaguing it. The developers, however, seem to be very connected with the community and are working on fixes, so i am hopeful that in the coming months it will be much better. I fear though, that another developer with a bigger budget will beat them to the punch and launch a game without so many issues and kill the game entirely, though I do hope that isn't what transpires.","timestamp_created":1474760604,"timestamp_updated":1474760604,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25680996","author":{"steamid":"76561198282318847","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1800,"last_played":1482788834},"language":"spanish","review":"Es unos de los mejores juegos de el año","timestamp_created":1474759958,"timestamp_updated":1474759958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25680704","author":{"steamid":"76561198160594927","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1638801288},"language":"schinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1474758541,"timestamp_updated":1474758541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520905971527099609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25680665","author":{"steamid":"76561198166232137","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":776,"last_played":1483996202},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень интересная.

The Survivors have become overpowered and the Killer will have a very frustrating time killing all of them. Yes, you can kill up to two survivors and still rank up, but the amount of frustrating work you're expected to do to accomplish this is far from fun and satisfying and is more of a chore. Most Survivors abuse infinites and exploits and swarm the hook once a person has been thrown on. And then, when you try to keep your Survivor on the hook, you're called a camper. If you fail to catch all of them, you're teabagged and laughed at. \n\nWhen I first got this game, I mostly played Killer. My PC was having issues and the lag on Killer was more manageable. Once my PC was fixed, I went over to Survivor for awhile and made it to Rank 9 before the Ranking Season reset. In the past week before writing this, I ventured back over to the side of the Killer. At first it was fun, and I was having reasonable games. Sometimes I got all of the Survivors, sometimes I only got 1 or two. But everyone played fairly and all was fine. But once I hit rank 15, it all went downhill. Survivors started abusing infinites. They started teabagging. They started swarming the hook every time I put someone on. They would be abuse infinites and then accuse me of hook camping in the after game chat. Clearly the Survivors have no fear of the Killer, and the gameplay for them has suffered drastically.\n\nThe developers do not care about that, however. They have stated that their statistics show that the Killer is \"winning\" rounds just as well as ever. That may be the case, but those statistics say nothing about how the experience was for the player. You can still reasonably win, but the experience you will have will be fraught with frustration and trolling. \n\nFor me, presently, the only saving grace for me is that I have enough friends to play Private Matches, where I can play with people who I can trust to play without abusing exploits or teabagging or any of the garbage that you experience in online games. But that's hardly worth the twenty dollars for this game.\n\nThe experience for the Killer needs to change. I am not saying they need to be buffed, but something needs to change, because, right now, the Killer side of the game is way to frustrating to be enjoyable. And the game depends on the Killers, needs the Killers. They are essentially the main focus of the game. It is a 4v1 horror game. The Killer needs to be overpowered to a degree for this game to work.\n\nI hate to be that guy, but Friday the 13th is coming out soon, and this game will have serious competition. Regardless of your thoughts of the game, it will be competition. I predict a fair amount of players will migrate to that game. And when that happens, the developers will have to make a decision.\n\nThe Killers need to be the focus of the game. Not the Survivors. The Survivors are supposed to be lambs trying to escape the slaughter. The game needs to feel like that. Not like a broken game of hide and seek.","timestamp_created":1474752687,"timestamp_updated":1474752687,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.681865096092224121","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25679156","author":{"steamid":"76561198328163681","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1474749504},"language":"spanish","review":"fue

Lot of killers dont like to play vs premades so they usually check survivors profile and leave the lobby if necessary so you will have to find another lobby again, they also dodge games just because 2, 3 or 4 survivors join to the game at the same time so the killer think that they are premades and leave the lobby, finally killers have the advantage to see what items the survivors are going to play in that games (another reason a lot of them dodge games) and meanwhile the survivors can be playing with a full VAC Banned guy with full purple items/offerings (better ones in the game) that they will not know it till the game has started or ended.\n\nPerks:  There is a lot of good perks in this game for killers and survivors, almost all the perks have their counter part (killers have more skills that can not be countered than survivors, for example nurse calling, agitation, barbecue, blood warden, brutal strength, deerstalker, enduring, franklin demise, hangman, lightborn, whispers, stridor, shadowborn, monstruos shrine and some more), the problem is that developers tends to nerf the meta to the floor that is no longer viable using some perks, as happend with saboteur and small game (the counter part skill of the trapper unique ability).\n\nDLC politics:  As you can see the publisher of this game is the same as PayDay2 which ended up with more than 150€ in DLCs.. in this game developers are releasing payment DLCs with new killers/survivors with unique skills and abilities in the case of the killers. Its is true that you can get the new skills from that killers/survivor from the shrine of secrets (which show up perks randomly each week) with iridescent shards that you can obtain by playing games (1 per minute to a maximum of 10 per game), but you can not stack more than 1000 shards at a time and you will have to trade them for 220k bloodpoints unlocking a perk that you already now or unlocking a perk that you dont want/use and obviously the biggest problem is that you won't be able to play the new killers/survivors without paying (survivors doesn't matter at all because they dont have unique abilities as the killers). They also release cosmetic DLCs which are cheaper than the normal killers/survivors DLCs.\n\nAfter all this text I would recommend this game for the people that want to have some fun, don't care about not been able to play all the killers without paying for them and don't bother with matchmaking/lobby problems.","timestamp_created":1474737950,"timestamp_updated":1521747706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25674676","author":{"steamid":"76561198035874610","num_games_owned":4676,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":3673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2037,"last_played":1558984566},"language":"english","review":"LOBBY SIMULATOR!\n\n{Instant drop to lobby than trying to play simulator}\n\nBBD DBD!","timestamp_created":1474737362,"timestamp_updated":1474737362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478248625993728638","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25674644","author":{"steamid":"76561198246094120","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":70662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":544,"playtime_at_review":17032,"last_played":1660482185},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая хоррор игра!","timestamp_created":1474737283,"timestamp_updated":1543063662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25674609","author":{"steamid":"76561198007825175","num_games_owned":799,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57529,"last_played":1511090232},"language":"english","review":"Update: 11/12/2016\n\nSince Patch 1.3.0 there has been a major bug which wipes out players save file losing 100s of hours of progress and making people lose 1 time only legacy prestige items\n\nthe devs said to email them and that they could help\n\nthey lied, their email replies are robotic statements that they can't help.\n\ndo not give these thieves money.","timestamp_created":1474737174,"timestamp_updated":1481374458,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400233030319213867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25674579","author":{"steamid":"76561198044588618","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":149255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":177,"playtime_at_review":28306,"last_played":1660605755},"language":"english","review":"Game balance status = shattered","timestamp_created":1474737105,"timestamp_updated":1474737105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502630889415740967","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25674571","author":{"steamid":"76561198152081986","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2419,"last_played":1656249859},"language":"schinese","review":"每天沉迷于偷电。。。","timestamp_created":1474737086,"timestamp_updated":1474737086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25674447","author":{"steamid":"76561198143806289","num_games_owned":382,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":81088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24709,"last_played":1659279594},"language":"english","review":"มึงพยายามอัพแพท แก้บัคได้แล้วไอ่ควายยยยย บัคก็ปล่อยบัคอยู่นั้นอะ กูรู้นะการตลาดมึงอะไอ่สัส อย่ามาแกล่งโง่ มึงอย่าอ้างเลยว่ากำลังรวบรวมบัค และแก้ทีเดียวอะ บัคไหนที่มันมีผลมาก(เจอแล้วแทบเล่นไม่ได้) มึงออกมาแก้ ก่อนเถอะ มีเวลาทำสกินเสื้อผ้า ออกมาแม่งทุกอาทิตย์ หิวเงินชิบหาย แต่ไม่มีเวลาแก้บัค มีหลายอย่างเหลือเกินที่กูอยากจะพูด กูเก็บไว้ตั้งแต่ ตอน Doctor ปรับใหม่ตอนนั้นละ แทงหลังไม่ได้ แทนที่จะแก้ มึงกลับปล่อยทิ้งไว้ เพราะแม่ง DLC มันลดราคา มึงปล่อยให้มันบัค(ให้ผู้เล่นรู้ว่าตัวนั้นบัคจะได้ซื้อDLCตัวนั้นมาเล่น) พวกมึงแม่งสุดยอดจริงวะ พอเลิกลดราคาก็ปรับแพทเหมือนเดิม ฉลาดนักนะไอ่พวกเวร ยิ่งอัพแพทมา ก็ยิ่งกินสเปตเยอะ ควร optimize ได้ละ ภาพก็กาก กินแม่งก็เยอะ","timestamp_created":1474736768,"timestamp_updated":1593608485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528911948204040527","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwKjKrtcCf6z4YQ=="}
