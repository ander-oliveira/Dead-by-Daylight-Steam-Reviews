Without DLC content, the game doesn't have a whole lot to offer, as many survivors, killers, and perks are all locked behind paywalls.  As you most likely have heard countless times, this game is FULL of bugs and glitches.  BHVR is extremely slow at patching game issues, because they care more about profit than their own game.\n\nConclusion: game's developers are roasting pieces of garbage, game's full of inbalance for new and experienced players alike, and finally... 5$ DLC abundance taking fire over bug patches.

Anyways my main survivor now is David aka david king. I like playing him because of his perk called dead hard. Anyways perks are addons that you can add to a survivor to boost their skill and power within the trials. Every game is called a trial and a trial consists of 4 survivors and 1 killer. It's like your normal slasher game but not every game is the same. You can choose between many killers and many survivors. Many of these survivors have personalized perks which allow them to play differently from other people. My first main was meg thomas, and I picked her because she has the perk sprint burst, but sprint burst got nerfed so now I chose david king's dead hard. Dead hard is a perk that allows you to not take damage while you are injured. If you press the button on your keyboard labed E, then dead hard will activate. After 3 seconds and a little speed boost, dead hard causes exaustion. Exaustion is a debuff that stops you from using exausion perks like sprint burst and dead hard. Exaustion usually stays for about a minute, and will not go down if you are running. Anyways, running will leave scratch marks for the killer to find, and if you dont cover up your tracks the killer will find you. Anyways thats my explanation of dead by daylight or otherwize known as dbd.

Devs need to pull their thumbs out of their asses and stop sucking the dicks of killers and start nerfing broken shit and punishing toxic behaviour properly before this game will start to really do its best\n\nAs for the game ignoring all these factors and in simplest terms, either you kill and they survive, or you survive and they kill. You and your \"big brain\" team mates have to power 5 generators and get the fuck out, killer has to slam each of you on a hook and try and sacrifice you. If you get found its your job to stay up as long as possible while using the least amount of resources as possible on the map in order to stall for enough time so that as many of you as possible can escape. If possible you should try and evade the killer, but good killers rarely lose survivors and will rather just give up the chase if they feel that it will take too long to down you and it would be more efficient to focus on generator patrol at that time.\n\nBe smart, don't be a dick, and don't be toxic for no reason.\n\nUnless theyre a Nea, if you see a Nea as a killer feel free to be a dick :P","timestamp_created":1572565486,"timestamp_updated":1572565486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485723227262496948","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56078167","author":{"steamid":"76561198054185809","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":28763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26685,"last_played":1631748355},"language":"english","review":"I really like this game, it is fun to play with friends and mostly fun to play by yourself.

The survivors seem to be awefully overpowered, so why not take away:\n- all windows\n- all perks\n- all pallets\n- the hatch\n- all items\nAnd additonally make the hitboxes (even) bigger, like whole-map-wise, the killers faster (500% should be enough), the arms of the killers longer (or their weapons) and start endgame right at the beginning of the match, so those pesky little snot-survivors get 1 generator done at most, before they all are rightfully sacrificed.\nIsn't that the best idea in the world? The killers will be sooo happy and will want to play the game like aaaaalll the time! :-D\n\nSeriously, I understand endgame and some necessary changes, the game was very unfairly imbalanced before. But now the hitboxes are so big, that a hatchet literally can fly 2 meters to your side and will still hit you. I was on a hook when I saw the insane range on my would-be saviour - that can't be right! That should NOT have downed her.\nWhen a survivor vaults a window, and the jump-sequence is already over and the survivor is already running again - the killer can still struck the fleeing survivor down. Through that window. Are you serious with this? This change is fairly new, and of course I don't mean unsafe jumps, where the jumping-sequence is still ongoing. But \"safe\" jumps, that worked before, are now pointless, because you're going to get hit - whether you're still standing by that window, or are already running away.\n\nI'm pissy right know so this probably sounds like the mewling of a raging crybaby. But seriously, I enjoy the game - I do! But not when you cripple the survivor-play so strongly... The only chance of surviving any match right now is with a swf-team or a VERY good and helpful team of strangers. I can't imagine that the killer will like playing against swf-teams over and over and over... This game is attractive right now for new killers (assuming they are not matched with 4 P3-Level-7 survivors) - but against other new players who want to try the game? Pscht. Piece of cake... This discourages players. Is that really what you want?\n\nAnyway, this rant will not change anything anyway... It's probably for the best to pause the game for some time.
