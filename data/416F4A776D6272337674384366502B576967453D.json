Decent community, better on the killer side of things because they don't teabag, quit, dc even if they don't get what they want. Survivor community however is 50/50. Survive with friends, by far most toxic community. I'm a killer main, and I've gone against a 4 man group who did nothing but play like ass. Climb the rank, and I'm sure you'll find out what I mean.\n \nTLDR; game is great aside my two concerns. I'd recommend picking it up, really cheap too on sale! But this review is to at least help the community see what it has become since the DLC release.\n\nAnyway my main two issues with the game is the unbalanced DLC and the somewhat garbage customer service,\nFirst off, I can attest to the DLC being completely unbalanced. I'm a killer main but I play with a friend, and boy, those Freddy matches were horrible. Yes, Freddy might be the best Killer for SWF groups but it's not fun for duo or solo players. The dude's got xray vision on you if you're out of his terror range, and this is without having to use a perk. He speeds up as more generators get finished with a perk. He also blocks the exit gates with another. Like man, did they think about counter play when they made this guy? Flashlights are rendered ineffective because most likely you can't see his face. He's outdoing the Wraith's invisibility and Michael Myers jumpscare capability. In the dream world there is no way to wake up other than have another player with you or fail skill checks, which by the way still reveals your position. Even after that he can still put you back to sleep. \nSome balancing ideas: \nlet the survivors have a wake up mechanic similar to the snap out of it with the doctor.\nOr incorporate levels of sleep ie: drowsy-sleep-deep sleep (unable to wake).\nOr survivors wake up when they get tagged. \nOr sleep has a timer.\nOr sleep has a short cooldown before being able to put someone back to sleep immediately after waking up.\nOr remove the aura reading from Freddy if he pulls someone into the dreamworld but hearing is amplified (this can separate great Freddys to decent ones).\nOr increase the number of skill checks when you're asleep. \nOr remove being able to see survivors outside terror radius, I feel like this one broke it the most. \nOr as my friend suggested, make Freddy an event Killer (availability only during certain events).\n\nSecond line of issue: everybody knows this and I'm not the only one. They have garbage customer services. Bots answering for them and telling you they're working on it. But days, weeks, months later, nothing. I lost my progress twice now. Once on a level 15 Nurse and level 15 Jake. I actually didn't mind when this happened because I thought that's how rank resets worked. But then it happened again, Level 30 something David and Level 45+ Huntress, all down the drain. This is where I almost quit the game. It is super frustrating, I was on a crappy connection but I didn't think that was supposed to be an issue though. I know people have had it worse and have not had their things returned for months. Mine's ongoing for nearly a month now but yeah 60+ hours just disappears that easily.","timestamp_created":1509678757,"timestamp_updated":1511397847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36232240","author":{"steamid":"76561198329401061","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":24175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1633125883},"language":"italian","review":"BloBloBloBloBloBloBellooooooooo!","timestamp_created":1509678458,"timestamp_updated":1509678458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36231955","author":{"steamid":"76561198182810907","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15998,"last_played":1653620008},"language":"english","review":"Rip Freddy.

Adrenaline courses you, checking back and fourth in areas trying to find the survivor. And once you find your prey, the epic chase begins. You as the Killer has to make sure not to waste too much time with this one person unless you have certain perks like the Obsession which buffs you for doing certain objectives against one certain person. But back to the chase, you find yourself having to dodge obstacles that Survivors use to get away much easier from you, if you're able to succeed in cutting them off or catch up, you now have to hit them at least once(if the survivor is injured) or twice( if they're not injured). Once the Survivor is down, your main objective is to then hook them and IMMIDATELY look for other survivors, because a Killer that waits for his victim to die on the hook only wastes their time and helps the Survivors repair the generators (without any threat) which are needed to escape(Plus, camping is cheating and just stupid). Once the survivor is on the hook other survivors will try to get them off, but you must make sure to not let them repair the generators. If you're able to do this 3 other times to the other survivors, you win and is satifying. Others may escape, which is expected if you are a new Killer or if the Survivors have good jukes and aid each other, or if you let them get too many generators and escape through the hatch or gate. Killer is so fun to play! BUT THEN, there are the Killers I know people hate and just go \"BS\" when they see it, know the Killers that make people go, \"WOW!\" or \"What the (insert)\", and know the Killers that people have fun wih making the say \"YAY!~\".\n\nKEY\nThat's BS Killers= Killers that are too easy to play and make people hate you and is not balanced\nYAY!~ Killers= Skilled (OR) fun to play against and balanced\nSorta Fair Killers= In between\n\nThe Killers: (Ones I mainly play and sometimes play, some are NOT heavily reviewed because I haven't played them)\n(Normals Killers and DLC Killers)\nNormal Killers\nEvan MacMillan-The Trapper: \"IT'S A TRAP!\" (YAY!~)\nYou guessed it, the Trapper traps traps!...Oh wait, cut that part out, the Trappers core ability is to place bear traps around the ground being able to place as many as he can with the ones that are provided by the area. Once a Survivor runs over a trap, they will be caught in it and have to struggle out of it counting as 2 hits which equals instadown. Survivors can get rid of his traps, but first they have to find it, there are also perks that help the Survivors them a bit easier. You can of course also hit people instead too when chasing them. The Trapper is balanced too and takes tactics. I myself as a Trapper, I make it more fun for the Survivors as in some Trappers put Beartraps uner the Survivors the moment they hook someone so the Survivors have to disable it(Which alerts you where they are), since I play more fair, instead of doing that, I put my traps in places where Survivors would want to run if I'm chasing them and I never place traps under the Survivors. Trapper is my favorite to play as. Survivors Ratings would be 4/5 to play against again\n\nMax Thompson Jr.-The Hillbilly: \"yeeeeeehaaaAAAAAAAAW\"*Gets louder* (YAY!~)\nThis Killer is really fun, CHARGE UP THAT CHAINSAW AND YEEEEEHAW! You'll find yourself zooming through the area, trying to one shot people with that charge to instadown them. You can also teach yourself to charge and quickly swing one shot someone standing right infront of you. This guy takes some skill to play here and there. Good survivors can easily juke him and if they have the right douchey perks then yeah. Using the Chainsaw for getting around the map is also useful. This one is my second favorite. Survivors Rating would 5/5 to play against\n\nPhilip Ojomo-The Wraith: I'm bullied and no one likes me... (That's BS)\nOh this guy...So, just an quick fyi, don't play him. No one likes him. He's REALLY camoflauged and sorta invisible when he enters the BS form. As a survivor, you sense NO PANIC which is needed for telling you if the killer is getting closer, but this is only when he is invisible, but it doesn't matter because he would already be right on top the survivor when he uncloaks. This is my least favorite killer because I know people don't like playing against him. He's just not fair and is boring to go against. Survivors Rating would be 1/5 to play against.\n\nSally Smithson-The Nurse: Ugh, why can't people be as skilled as me...? (YAY!~) (Hardest to master)\nHoly zoinky, the Nurse flys all over the place and zooms here and there, technically teleporting! Sounds OP af right? Wrong, everytime you zoom, you will stun yourself and wow it is annoying, but mastering these zooms can reward you easily being able to avoid obstacles and getting to running Survivors quickly. Survivor perks though sorta overpower her, but mastering this nurses moves will have people respect you and see you as a master. Survivors Rating would be 5/5 to play against. (You'll rarely see this Killer sadly...)\n\nAnna-The Huntress: *Sings the Lalala song from Smurfs\" (Haven't played her, will update soon)\n\nDLC Killers:\nMichael Myers-The Shape: Hey...Uh, there's this guy that's just staring at me... (YAY!~)\nThis is my favorite DLC character because he is of course a classic, actually kinda of spooky to play against when a survivor, and is the second most balanced out of all of them, surprisingly. A Michael Myers, your main objective is to literally just stare at people. Then you'll level up your meter to level 3(from staring) and once you reach level 3 of stalking, for a duration of time you'll be able to one shot people instead of having to hit them twice, you also gain a obession which is a certain someone that you will usually be bullying the most throughout the game. So make sure you stay out of his line of sight Survivors! Survivors Ratings would be 4/5 to play against.\n\nHerman Carter-The Doctor: I see you~ ZAAP! (That's BS)\nSo, I haven't played this guy yet.....But trust me, as a survivor and going against this guy, you would just want to leave. Survivors Ratings would be 1/5 to play against. Sorry, I don't buy Killer's that are BS.\n\nLisa Sherwood-The Hag: Swamp Lady Thing (That's BS)\nThe Hag fits her name because you're an donkeyhole for playing her, she INSTANTly teleports to you if step over a ALMOST INVISIBLE trap that jump scares the Survivor and allows the Hag to teleport to you. The only thing she succs at is running because she's a bit slow, constantly, every Hag you'll play against will probably place a trap under a hooked Survivor and you can only get rid of the traps with a flashlight which you wont always have as a survivor. I haven't bought her because she's BS and is annoying. Survivors Ratings 2/5 to play against. \n\nJunior Sawyer-The Cannibal: Leatherface guy (YAY!~)\nThis is my opinion but probably because I succ at him or it's because of how he is. But he SUCCS, Leatherface's ability is to swing a chainsaw(sound like someone else)but multiple times, but he does it while standing in place sorta and swings way to long while standing in place. It can hit multiple Survivors at a time, but to easily counter that just don't all be together or too close to each when ever someone is being chased. (Haven't bought)Survivors Ratings: 5/5\n\nThe Nightmare-Freddy Krueger: Literally the meaning of \"You can run but you can't hide!\" (Eh)\nAs a Killer Main, I can't exactly say Freddy is game breaking or ridiculous, though I can say he seems CLOSE to being balanced. To me, he's weaker than the Wraith and more fun to play against the Wraith. He can only damage people if they are put to sleep but he is completely invisible and the so. He has to first find someone put then put them to sleep and then he can damage, sees u 2.

Outra coisa também são os bugs gráficos, mas isso é de boa, são muito engraçados e não tão corriqueiros, mas já presenciei bugs de conecção que ocorrem 1 a cada 10 vezes, onde o jogo não acha sala infinitamente, fazendo você ter que fechar e reabrir o jogo, também o jogo é muito vazio durante o dia, em compensação é lotado pela noite.\nPontos positivos: O jogo é muito emocionante, o clima de tensão é constante, o jogo oferece brutalmente mais pontos pra quem fizer ações de ajudar outros sobreviventes o que faz os jogadores interagirem entre sí, até na hora de salvar, que é quase suicídio mas com sucesso tem ótima recompensa, outra coisa é a presença de sustos que em um jogo online é muito difícil de se ter, mas o ambiente faz lugares onde o assassino pode aparecer além de que alguns podem aparecer subtamente, o que é um pouco ruim como eu disse nos pontos negativos mas isso também tem sua graça no jogo. O assassino também ganha mais pontos se pendurar uma pessoa mais de uma vez, o que faz ele dar espaço para que outras pessoas salvem, o que é muito apoiado pela comunidade, sem campers! O jogo remete muito aos filmes de terror dos anos 80 o que faz realmente você se sentir na pele de um ator tendo que ajudar seus amigos e fazer de tudo para sobreviver, caaara, eu amo isso! E quando você fica por ultimo então? Haja coração!\n\nResumindo, minha nota final é 8, o jogo vale muito a pena comprar, se possível, espere promoção, ele sempre abaixa 50% de semestre em semestre.","timestamp_created":1509651114,"timestamp_updated":1509651114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36224924","author":{"steamid":"76561197986489599","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5990,"last_played":1641911052},"language":"english","review":"Trash game.. they put out DLC content just to modify it in less then a week of it's release.","timestamp_created":1509650854,"timestamp_updated":1509650854,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497099369764328003","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36224923","author":{"steamid":"76561198360142673","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1638662177},"language":"russian","review":"Топовая игрушка залипнуть можно,РЕКОМЕНДУЮ!\n","timestamp_created":1509650849,"timestamp_updated":1509650849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499375790357589722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36224709","author":{"steamid":"76561197993313762","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":124078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104018,"last_played":1645333192},"language":"brazilian","review":"Killer Freddy estragando o jogo, total desbalanceado.","timestamp_created":1509650262,"timestamp_updated":1509650262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36224624","author":{"steamid":"76561198193463607","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8243,"last_played":1634407033},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра","timestamp_created":1509650026,"timestamp_updated":1509650026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36224527","author":{"steamid":"76561198406409728","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1616733020},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is a great game with plently of maps and a plentiful variety of survivors and killers to choose from. From my experience I've ran into almost zero issues and couldn't be happier with the performance of the game. I could honestly play this for hours and bringing friends only adds to the fun. To be honest, I've played plenty of rounds and I've come to appreciate the multiple tactics that is surviving every killers different game styles. However, and here it comes, Freddy is undoubtably a very powerful foe. I'm not going to make the argument that he needs to be nerfed. I just believe that he needs to be ... tweaked slightly. I've had my fair share of wins and losses but not once having came across Freddy have I nor my randomly matchmaked party been able to successfully escape him. I invite challenges in games, besides that's what makes them way more fun, but Freddy is most definetly an overwhelming enemy. I in my good faith hope they find a fair way to balance the character for both stressed survivors and blood thirsty killers. If no compromise can be made or even the developers don't want to make changes I can accept that. So long as they add a feature where survivors can choose which Killers they DO and DO NOT want to encounter in matchmaking. It's a longshot but if that's what it takes I'll bite. Lastly, before anyone proclaims I'm a sore loser I'd like to contest that because I've played enough to have many Wins / Losses and I'm fine with that. However, when players start disconnecting in game or bite the dust once Freddy is the killer that's when there is an issue. Freddy has pretty much manifested himself into the in-game meme equivalent of certain death / failure itself.

Давайте сделаем полностью невидимого маньяка который затягивает тебя в сон... Как выбраться из сна? Вам надо либо провалить проверку реакции (и то не факт что она тебе выпадет) или тебя разбудит тиммейт... И тут 1 проблема. Фреди видит тебя через пол+ карты когда ты в мире снов и как от него убежать чтоб ты очнулся и он заного не затянул тебя в сон? Вот именно выжившим просто некуда деваться! Я сам успел поиграть за него... Помимо мира снов вы ещё и дали ему предмет (выжившие вас не видят когда \"засыпают\"). Учитывая последних УБИЙЦ я уже чувствую что в следующем обновлении мы увидим маньяка который будет видеть выживших через всю карту, бегать в 2x раза быстрее обычного и валить всех в предсмертное расстояние с 1-ого обычного удара, а для лучшего комбо добавить ему способность \"Медсестры\" (телепорт).

Si vous avez toujours rêvé d'incarner Leatherface, Krueger, Jason, vous devriez adorer. Le gameplay et bien pensé et assez équilibré, que l'on soit un tueur ou un survivant. Les boogeymen inventés pour le jeu sont très réussis et différents à jouer.\nQuelques points noirs non négligeables: s'il n'est pas difficile de trouver une partie en survivant, c'est parfois plus long pour un tueur. Graphiquement, ce n'est pas terrible mais le tout est sauvé par les décors et l'ambiance.\nEt enfin je trouve toujours inadmissible que l'on soit obligé de payer pour avoir des éléments censés ête présents dans le jeu d'origine, comme pour les nouveaux tueurs par exemple.\nUn bon jeu multi cependant, parfait pour jouer avec une bande d'ami(e)s et surtout pendant la période d'Halloween!
