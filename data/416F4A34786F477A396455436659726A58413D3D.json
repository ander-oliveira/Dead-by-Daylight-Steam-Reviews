The game revolves around about 4-5 objective that need to be down (simple enough right) the only thing stopping you is the killer. The killer are the main concern in my book as they are overpowered in a no scary way but full on cartoony way. The chainsaw killer has a skill that does a dash with the chainsaw... well lets just say I was trying to survive against a killer on skates. With no cool down team it seems the killer flys around the map with ease too much ease. The Churchbell Killer has his natural speed way too high. You can \"stun\" the killer by blocking the their path at the right moment which on paper sounds good but in the game it did completely nothing. The Churchbell Killer felt as if I was trying to run from a faster surivior. Also the hooks are more of annoyance then scary... (another rude thing is the killer can easily camp the hook and literal get a 100% kill.). \n\n\nMy recommendation buy it when it is finish unlike most Alpha or Beta games now a days.","timestamp_created":1468578364,"timestamp_updated":1468578364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24331577","author":{"steamid":"76561198158343021","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":55707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1196,"playtime_at_review":34701,"last_played":1660603525},"language":"german","review":"Good way to see everyone die","timestamp_created":1468578292,"timestamp_updated":1648376842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24331558","author":{"steamid":"76561198084595815","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1559127260},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist total unfertig, man findet überhaupt keine Lobbys und es gibt zu viele Bugs.

While before it was funny, it's now just annoying. I can no longer say this is a game that you should buy. Every problem with this game can be boiled down to two things.\n\n1. The devs\n\nNow, in all fairness, this game was REALLY fun for a first outing from a dev. And yes, I did think the devs were cool before. But, the devs have no focus and I think they don't know how to change anything without breaking it. It feels like the publisher is forcing them to make DLC quickly and push out changes without fully testing them. \n\nThere's a bug? Yeah, we might fix it, or we'll just push out a buggy DLC for $7. Something is underused? Okay, we'll buff it so it's TOO good. Something is overused, but not complained about? Okay, let's nerf it to the ground.\n\nI do not think that a game can remain stable with no focus, and the devs are slowly moving away from that focus, trying to shake up the meta without knowing how.\n\n2. Player Entilement\n\nYep, the toxic community I joked about is even more toxic now. To the point where I just don't want anything to do with it.\n\nGamers nowadays are way too entitled and whine at the devs to add stuff to a game or they feel like they can be complete assholes because they can. Dead by Daylight is just a massive example of this.\n\nKillers are whiny bitches. Survivors are whiny bitches. If you even do something mildly skillful, you're gonna get flamed/camped/sandbagged, because 'You're better than me, you're going to get camped and die.\"\n\nThe devs listen to all this. They READ the reddit posts and the steam fourms and see whiny post and whiny post and decide to change it based on that. I thought they did their own tests. Nope, I was wrong. They respond better to negativity.\n\nSo devs, listen to some of my negativity.\n\nThis game is failing. The community is making it fail. The devs lack of focus and direction are making it fail. By changing my review from Recommened to Not Recommended, I am telling others to STAY AWAY. Maybe I'll come back later and see if anything has changed for the better, or if you manage to create a patch without adding game-breaking bugs.\n\nDead by Daylight: NOT Recommened. (21/1/2017)\n\n\nOriginal Review (ages back when I could still enjoy the game)\n\nThis community is pretty good.\n\nSome of the playerbase: Hey, devs. You're game is shit because there's no Survive with friends option. Refunded.\nDevs: We know. We're working on it.\n\n[i]When the (broken) Survive with Friends update was pushed:[/i]\nDevs: Sorry guys. We're rolling back the update. Survive with Friends is bugged right now. We're going to fix it.\nSome of the playerbase: WTF!? You add the option then instantly remove it!? Shitty devs.\n\n[i]When the Survive with Friends update actually came out: (practically nullifying lobby hopping)[/i]\nSome of the playerbase: WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK DEVS!? Now we can't kill survivors because they are working together and communicating! Can I get a refund for over 100 hours over gameplay for this broken game?!\n\nDevs: [i]drinking the tears of the salty players[/i]\n\nDespite what people say, the devs are cool guys. They listen to player feedback and balance the game according with their own tests and data, and then deal with all the negativity that the salty players get from having OP things balanced.\n\nAlso, to the people who say that 'killer is OP' or 'survivor is OP', did you even READ the description. It's an asymetrical game, meaning that it's unbalanced on PURPOSE.\n\nThis game is great, and deserves at the very least a 'Very Positive' score.","timestamp_created":1468573811,"timestamp_updated":1484968879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538112044334411621","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24330380","author":{"steamid":"76561198119793516","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1561192052},"language":"tchinese","review":"the fution that survive with friends require user to READY again and again if no match can be found, it is very troble,hope this problem can be improve","timestamp_created":1468572658,"timestamp_updated":1468572658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329759","author":{"steamid":"76561197989205292","num_games_owned":722,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":15895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15867,"last_played":1633629122},"language":"swedish","review":"PogChamp game.","timestamp_created":1468569392,"timestamp_updated":1562224718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329707","author":{"steamid":"76561198124564822","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1494076268},"language":"english","review":"Full of bugs,unballanced and problably the game will die very soon.","timestamp_created":1468569105,"timestamp_updated":1468569105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509554147720336914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329658","author":{"steamid":"76561198013694230","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1635426153},"language":"tchinese","review":"請問有會出MAC版本嗎 朋友想玩 但是沒有MAC版本","timestamp_created":1468568824,"timestamp_updated":1468568824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329374","author":{"steamid":"76561198099844941","num_games_owned":720,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":1179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1495701722},"language":"schinese","review":"我明明都把游戏删除了他都能在steam里自动更新这是为什么？？","timestamp_created":1468567245,"timestamp_updated":1468567245,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329226","author":{"steamid":"76561198073259392","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3763,"last_played":1587567574},"language":"english","review":"Now with survive with friends :D 10/10","timestamp_created":1468566415,"timestamp_updated":1468566415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329191","author":{"steamid":"76561197963835230","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":43806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3186,"last_played":1655652888},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gutes Spiel, sowohl die Idee als auch die Umsetzung.","timestamp_created":1468566247,"timestamp_updated":1468566247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519723773002624512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24329130","author":{"steamid":"76561198082923236","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1647069167},"language":"english","review":"It advertises a great time with your friends, yet.... you can't have that.

The devs of the game love to nerf everything into the ground on one side while heavily favoring the other side. Now i have about a pretty even split of 200 hours on both sides so from that let me tell you about how this game goes. The community is toxic, it doesn't matter if you play \"fair\" or scummy or even if you're on the same team you're going to get something along the lines of \"You suck. I hope you get aids, and i will murder your family and rape your dog.\" at the end of every game. While there is an option to turn off after game chat sometimes both sides had a great game and you want to offer a friendly GG only to be met with go kill yourself  85% of the time and maybe a GG the rest of the time.\n\nAs a killer- You have to deal with toxic survivors using exploits that the devs accidentally put into the game and watch as the devs tell you that they will fix it soon™ until it's been so long that they just announce it as a feature. You also have to deal with unbalanced perks and mandatory perks for almost all killers except a very special one. Not to mention a huge inbalance in the game called survive with friends which let's survivors team up and queue into a game with anywhere between 1-3 of their friends, which may not sound bad by itself but when you add in 3rd party voice coms it becomes the bane of your existence. Along with the overpowered items that all 4 survivors can bring into a match. Just imagine whatever game you play having this huge overly powered item before it got patched and the multiply that by 4 except it never gets patched.\n\nAs a survivor- You have to deal with killers who camp you on the hook, which makes it nearly impossible to be rescued without a certain perk. You also have to deal with killers who abuse the games mechanics and make it impossible to get off of the hook. (The hook is what the killer puts you on to kill you after they have downed you) IF that wasn't bad enough you have team mates hungry for a free huge chunk of points at your expense who will unhook you in front of the killer only for you to be hooked again and die faster. You will also have to deal with troll team mates who go out of their way to sandbag you. There servers are also p2p so if you get the bad luck of playing with someone who plays on a potato then you're just out of luck sadly.\n\nEven with all of that as long as you have tough skin and enough time to grind past the early levels then it'll be a great game for you.\n\nThe reason I switched my review to a negative one is because there is an issue that has been running rampant that causes players to loose all of their save data. This has happened to me twice now, The first time they were very helpful and it took about a week for them to fix it since they seem to work 9-5 Monday through Friday with no support on weekends. After this first setback happened I backed up my save files and kept playing until it happened again and destroyed not only my  main save but also my back up save files. As of this review i have been waiting for 6 weeks for a response and have gotten nothing outside of a auto reply saying \"we are very busy we will soon be with you\" even after I opened a second ticket that an admin of the forums that works for the company told me to do. SO there goes a solid 400 hours of my life wasted.\n\nIf you're willing to take that risk and nothing I have said so far has turned you off buy this game! It was fun enough for me to dump 400 hours into it. Just be willing for the lack of support (sometimes) and honest communication from the devs.","timestamp_created":1468564986,"timestamp_updated":1560919889,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24328786","author":{"steamid":"76561198315108208","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2691,"last_played":1634289092},"language":"english","review":"It's better than you think,even you hanged by killers all the time,really a good game！！","timestamp_created":1468563878,"timestamp_updated":1468563878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24328744","author":{"steamid":"76561198135796338","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1500894696},"language":"schinese","review":"68   very good   ~~cool\n","timestamp_created":1468563577,"timestamp_updated":1468563577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24328682","author":{"steamid":"76561198098632958","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2705,"last_played":1632216587},"language":"schinese","review":"来改评测的，黎明杀鸡总的来说是款良心游戏，GTMD第五人格！","timestamp_created":1468563211,"timestamp_updated":1526468447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24328661","author":{"steamid":"76561198026329088","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1470201024},"language":"english","review":"SHitty Matching making","timestamp_created":1468563096,"timestamp_updated":1468563096,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24328370","author":{"steamid":"76561198174546094","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1198,"last_played":1618303694},"language":"schinese","review":"Bad matchmaking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n","timestamp_created":1468561267,"timestamp_updated":1468561267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24328105","author":{"steamid":"76561198190891951","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1469345588},"language":"schinese","review":" Where is Chinese language ????????????","timestamp_created":1468559672,"timestamp_updated":1468559672,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24327984","author":{"steamid":"76561197998426383","num_games_owned":442,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":18778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2857,"last_played":1654743905},"language":"english","review":"I really, really enjoy this game.

As has happened only a few other times in my life, [i]as soon as I saw the game being played[/i] I knew that I would enjoy it. What I saw was a masterwork of game design, distilling everything I liked about the old Evolve experience into a game that didn't also want to be a shooter. What I saw was a perfectly balanced game of cats and mice. What I saw was something I expected to spend thousands of hours playing with my friends over the coming months.\n\nI could not have been more wrong, or more disappointed.\n\nIn my illustrious 42 minute career, I was the Killer three times. In the first round, I successfully \"downed\" my opponents three times, and all three times I was too far away from a hook to actually kill them. In the second round, I did not see a single enemy [i]even while watching the exit[/i]. In the third round, the players actively exploited me to get as much experience as possible, eventually dancing within the safety of the exit. One, probably out of sympathy, briefly hopped out of the exit to let me get a single hit in before escaping.\n\nOne of Evolve's greatest strengths was its rich soundscape. In this game, on the other hand, the soundscape is actively deceitful. Your own footsteps and grass rustles drift behind you, and the only noises I heard my opponents make were healthkits and barricade drops. The upshot? The [i]instant[/i] my enemy was no longer onscreen, they were safe. Often I would surprise them around a corner, successfully marshaling my Evolve instincts to \"head them off\"; but they [i]always[/i] saw me and [i]walked[/i] away before I could hit them with my stubby little arms.\n\nThe strangest thing is that the game I just played looked like it was [i]months[/i] of concentrated development effort behind the game I saw in the videos earlier today. What happened?\n\nP.S. This will be the first game I ever refund on Steam.\nP.P.S.

Yea it really is a lot of fun and recently they added \"co-op\" gameplay which is really nice. Playing with friends is one of the best parts of this game.\n\nWhy i leave a bad review:\n\n1 With the recent add of co-op gameplay (not private lobbies) i was really looking forward to play some with my friends and actually get blood points. But this is where one of the biggest flaws in the game occour. The game for some reason has the worst matchmaking system i have ever seen in my entire life. When you click look for game it will only search for this many seconds, 30 sec at most i believe. It will then say match not found instead of requing you to save time. Alone you can just spam the search for game button til you find a game, but in co-op lobbies every1 has to ready in order to start quing. And with the insanely huge amout of did not find game popping up. Readying up over and over again instead of having a reque as long as every1 has readied up once. Ive used 30 minutes with my friends pressing ready quing for 5 seconds before we get a did not find, and have to ready up again. The only way ive been able to play with friends so far is because of the damn private lobbies. \n\nIf any developer is reading this. For the love of god, upgrade the fucking search for game setting you have made. im tired of sitting down clicking search for game over 100 times to find a game, and not beeing able to find a game in co-op (survive with friends) beause of this.... like the game is now. Dont buy it, too many flaws you really dont want to have........\n\n2 Edit: Recently found out random people can join your private lobby despite not beeing on your friends list. in 1 day ive found more buggs and flaws than i have in any other game\n\nThe devs of this game really need to fucking improve the damn matchmaking. I dont want to spend time queing over and over again. Get something to autoque me or to keep quing so i dont have to spam find match. Jesus fucking christ, before you update anything else fix the matchmaking... its not worth buying this game while its this bad......","timestamp_created":1468526505,"timestamp_updated":1469557919,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24321077","author":{"steamid":"76561198173982369","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1540120843},"language":"russian","review":"Один из лучших убиваторов времени","timestamp_created":1468526358,"timestamp_updated":1468526358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24321069","author":{"steamid":"76561198077127277","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1539027929},"language":"russian","review":"Дрисня","timestamp_created":1468526334,"timestamp_updated":1468526334,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498058885335922241","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24320833","author":{"steamid":"76561198125726996","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":15189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13718,"last_played":1631371732},"language":"english","review":"Decent game overall , a bit too repetitive .\n 7.5/10 In my opinion","timestamp_created":1468525512,"timestamp_updated":1574460747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24320767","author":{"steamid":"76561198284160982","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1206,"last_played":1602696590},"language":"english","review":"mmmm....
