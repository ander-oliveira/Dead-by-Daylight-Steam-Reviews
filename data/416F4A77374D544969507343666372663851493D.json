The objective is to complete generators which are scattered around the map in order to escape the trial. The catch is, there is a killer who is hunting you the entire game with the aim of stopping you from escaping. Their task is to stamp on generators, hook you and kill you in the end. The game is played with 4 survivors and one killer.\n\nThis game can be toxic beyond belief which is a big flaw in the community. occasionally you find some kind players however that's rare. I recommend getting this game if friends are available to play too as that's when you have the most fun. Solo queuing can be frustrating as survivor due to the lack of help most random survivors provide you, however when you reach the lower ranks the players are better meaning more chance of being helped. I like to play with friends as survivor however when I'm alone or just am in a killer mood i usually play that. It's a lot more entertaining in my opinion as i can relax a little more and feel like I'm winning the game whereas if I'm survivor, getting hooked is annoying.\n\nRegarding the check-list above, i will be going over my answers and explaining why i picked each one. Make sure to read this as I'll explain a lot due to some of the questions having more than one answer.\n\nThe graphic's are pretty good, I'ts nothing incredible however it does the job really well. I usually play on low graphics just due to the lighting difference giving me a slight edge on the game. The higher your graphics are, the darker the game is. As the game is generally quite dark, you would really like every bit of brightness you have. I've even gone to the effort of alerting my monitor brightness just to make it more entertaining to play however that can ruin the colour of the game. Have a look at the pictures on the store for this game as it looks identical to that tbh.\n\nThe music is a big aspect to this game due to it being more immersive and a whole lot more scary. When a killer is in radius you can hear your own heart beat, however when he gets even closer music starts to play. There are different types of music for certain characters however it purely depends on who it is. There are certain distances which plays different noises and when you're in a chase it also plays music. The music style is really good for the game as it makes it feel so much more action packed. It brings up your heartbeat and you want to leap out of your chair out of panic. \n\nThe difficulty can be tough. Reasoning is, if you want to play well you need to learn certain mechanics such as \"360's\". This is when a killer strikes at you but you do a manoeuvre to avoid the hit. This is really well executed in the higher ranks however as a purple ranked survivor and killer it can be tough to master. I've started to get the hang of it and i can usually perform it against lower level killers however against a more experienced person you have to master it. There can be a lot of tutorials online for different skills if you really want to try-hard the game. The reason i selected \"Easy to learn / Hard to master\" is due to the fact that the main understanding of the game is really simple. Just complete generators and escape. Most of the time you will want to hide in a locker but it still works. Its just taking the extra step to really master the game which is tough. \n\nThere is a reason this game has been named \"Dead by Buglight\" and \"Dead by Laglight\". This game has a history of game-breaking bugs and lag which impacts the game heavily. If you're a console player, the lag makes the game almost unplayable. Most of the bugs that I've experienced were fixed in the most recent patch however there can always be a new one around the corner due to the variety of ways to play. Currently I haven't experienced too many bugs, however there are some they are still in the process of fixing. \n\nThere is not a main story of the game which leads to a story mode. However the reason i selected the ones i did is because  each character (survivor and killer) has a backstory which you can learn about. If you select the character, there is a large amount of text which details their backstory, along with how they came to be how they are. Some killers, such as Spirit, have a really sad backstory. The Spirit spotted her father killing her mother and he then kicked her through a window and she died too. That's the reason she is how she is, as her character is crying and always looking sad. However there is also killers such as the Doctor who tortures people with electricity for his own pleasure. There is a thing called a \"Tome\" which is similar to a battle-pass however you can learn more in depth about each killer. Currently its about The Clown, it explains his backstory well.\n\nThis game is very stressful sometimes. This can be due to the killer which is the reason a large amount of the time however sometimes game play can annoy you. The reason i also put \"Fun\" and \"Challenging\" is because the game is actually really fun and I've had a ton of good times on it. You can't flaw the game but more of the players. But it is really challenging on the higher levels. I'm only purple rank (around 8 as survivor) and I'm playing against some good killers occasionally who understand how to counter basic 360's. The game is mainly ran on how the killer plays in my opinion. You can plan a gen-rush and think you're ready for anything, and they can have gen regression and prevention perks. They could tunnel, face-camp etc. Its purely on the killer which makes the game a whole lot more difficult.\n\nI don't have the most incredible PC. My computer can run each graphic type (Highest-Lowest). I'm sure some computers might not be able to run it however I've never ran into any computer based FPS problems. \n\nThe game-play can be played for a large amount of times. I only have around 200+ hours however my girlfriend has 400+ and i know a lot of people have hundreds. This game could be played for less than a hundred however if you really enjoy the game, time flies and before you know it you've got 200 hours. \n\nThe quality for price is good in my opinion. While some bugs could impact your experience and some killers can ruin it, the main game is really fun especially with friends. £14.99 isn't very expensive for a game of this size, especially with the different play-styles and variations to your game. As a killer you can use different add-ons which can impact the game in different ways, and as a survivor you can use different perks to find which ones you like to play the best for you!\n\nOverall this is a good game, I really recommend buying it, especially if you have friends you will play with.

A unique product indeed but misses the game element [/h1]\nThis game is unique, unique in its concepts and unique in how this is the only game I ever came across that has 50% agony, toxic players and 50% fun game-play. \nThe game concept is unique, interesting and expansive, quite a lot of franchises characters are also part of the game so it makes it even more catching to be in it.\n\nLets go further into the review though\n\nThe purpose of a game is to entertain, enjoy, relax or simply ..make you feel you had fun.\n\nThis however, is the only game that is capable of doing it only at 50% efficiency. \n[b] Why you ask? [/b]\nNumber of reasons \n\nThere are 2 aspects of this 5 person game. \nA 4 man survivor team \nA killer that goes against the survivors \n\nIf you play as a survivor \n[list]\n    [*] Unbalanced matchmaking\n    [*] Unable to communicate effectively \n    [*] Teammates either don't speak your language or just disconnect, kill themselves if they get hit first, this happens often\n    [*] A 4 man lobby with 1 disconnect has to fix 5 gens (3 users with 5 gens) and based on killer, this is an instant unbalanced setup \n    [*] You either get one sided camped by killer and have teammates just hide in corner until you die or get saved by teammates that unhook you in-front of killers so you die first \n[/list]\n\nIf you play as killer (this is the worst bit) \n[list]\n    [*] You are playing a multiplayer game...ALONE, yeah, the players you will play are gonna be against you. but that's the game concept..maybe this doesn't count?\n    [*] You get players that either troll you or are too noob to go against, there is no balanced matchmaking on this game \n    [*] Game pits newbie killer characters against rank 1 and 3 at times\n    [*] You get cussed at, made fun of in end game chats for playing your role, your role as killer is hated that bad that you will get meme reported or made fun of for ..killing. \n    [*] If you want to farm, no way to communicate with the survivors before hand so they can leave the lobby before match starts, nope, some survivors will disconnect after they see you farming\n[/list]\n\nI got 615 hours on this game, i can tell you this\nThis is not a game that aims to give a team level of fun, this game feeds of the agony of one side to then make the other side feel better.\nThe concept is so unique that it loses half its potential right away due to how its made, you cant enjoy without making 4 players feel bad or making 1 lone killer feel miserable for sucking at their game. \n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone who knows the concept of sympathy, empathy or is of a soft nature, don't buy this game please you will just feel annoyed half the time just like I do.\n\nThis is one of my first review on entire steam (used to play games but well..as a pirate) ..I regret making this one of my first most played game, solely cause friends wanted more players.","timestamp_created":1628088758,"timestamp_updated":1630424267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531288444995880127","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96933949","author":{"steamid":"76561198880774013","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1144,"playtime_at_review":6012,"last_played":1660474108},"language":"russian","review":"Игру не советую покупать по многим причинам, но вот одни из них: токсичное поведение игроков, большой количество читеров которые могут просто крашнуть сервер во время игры, отсутствие баланса между выжившими и маньяком. Плюсы: игра местами очень интересна и затягивает, атмосферная и последний плюс у игры попросту нету конкурентов и яляется лучшей в своём жанре. Подробнее о минусах в игре очень злое комьюнити и всегда в конце игры либо маньяк или выживший напишет в чат что ты кемпер, тунелер, токсик с фонариком и тагдалие, и главная проблема этого что токсичное поведение порождает больше токсичности. Читеры, читеры в дбд не редкость со стороны маньяков и выживших, но чаще всего выжившие являются читерами как я заметил и могут использовать лаг свитчи с ещё более извращёными читами вплоть до краша сервера во время матча. Баланс, в игре суть такова если ты выживший и играешь один то большой шанс того что ты проиграешь из-за поподания в команду не понятных игроков против маньяка который без должной командной игры выйграть нельзя, а если ты играешь в пати то считай что победа уже на половину в кармане. И последний пункт который я не добавил это баги в игре куча багов если ты играешь за маньяка или за выжившего, от застревания в текстурах до страных ударов длиной в 2 метра или не регистрируются удары. Плюсы перечеслять смысла нету так как я уже рассказал их рание и объяснять побробние смысла нету. Для меня игра оказалась средненькой, так зайти покатать пару вечеров и забыть на несколько недель.

Sure, the game is fun if the there are no such players in the match but in every 10 matches, there're bound to have at least one of their kind in 6 of them. I don't just mean the campers, tunnellers and such but also the toxic fellow survivors that are sometimes working with the killer. Even in one instance that I recorded, the killer let the said survivor go after that survivor snitched on the rest of us throughout the match.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a real punishment for those toxic players. The only thing that I can do apart from the seemingly useless reports are to leave the match (you probably would call it rage quit. That's probably true. If you're invested in this game as long as I have, you probably will be as well). The thing is, leaving the match prematurely would get myself banned from matchmaking for a period of time, while the campers, the tunnellers, the snitches can keep enjoying the game and spread their toxicity in other matches.\n\nAnd then there's the severely unbalanced killers, especially Bubba, the Leatherface. The thing about Bubba in this game is, it's every camper's wet dream. Very easy to camp with Bubba, especially if you attach add ons that lets Bubba to use his chainsaw over a long period of time. His chainsaw can hit the survivors down in 1 hit and he can use it over and over again with little limitation. So, yeah. Would still play this game but honestly, bit disappointed with the

you play survivor you get tunneled and camped every game and you cant do anything about it because the mmr does nothing but give you campers/tunnelers. you can try to have fun as killer but after getting 1 4k you get put with red rank bully squad survivors that do nothing but ruin your game. overall mmr has ruined the game it teaches new killers to do nothing but camp and tunnel, it teaches
