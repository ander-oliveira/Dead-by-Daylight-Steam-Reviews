You guys are just bad.\" \n\nPlay as killer. \nSpooky nurse.\nHook survivor.\nImmediately leave to go check out some generators elsewhere.\nCheck back on dirty, hookered body every now and then.\n\"Wow, camping? How does it feel to be pure cancer?\"\n\nI'm salty.\nThe survivors are salty.\nBut I understand now.\nSalt tastes good.\n\nThis game is hella fun and succesful jukes can be pretty satisfying, especially when you get those 'heat of the moment' scenarios and the monster just completely loses you and runs off in the opposite direction while you cheekily crouch in the middle of a cornfield. Or those satisfying times when you see a sneaky survivor in the distance, crouching behind a rock or climbing into a locker, thinking they're safe, only for you to round the corner and deliver the final blow before they even know what's happened.\n\nThough there are some bugs I've encountered:\n\n- There's the basic falling through the ground bug but that happens in a lot of games and it's only happened to me once in DbD, when I was playing as the Trapper. It didn't blink me back to the map after falling for a certain amount of time either. Just got stuck there in skybox oblivion forever. Free win for those four, lucky souls. (Oh god don't do it! If you play as the Nurse, for the love of God, don't try to blink up the basement stairs.)\n\n- Survivors try to jump over barricades or hide in cabinets, but getting caught by the monster and picked up during these animations sometimes causes the survivors to glitch out and get stuck in the air. They even orbit parralel to, and around the monster, like they're attached to a certain point of him, as he spins around. Everyone is confused and visually it's hilarious. The monster can just drop them on the ground and pick them up again which fixes the issue, but it really breaks your immersion when you see this happen. Still funny though.\n\n- Playing as a survivor, occasionally any kind of interaction with a monster can cause your game to crash, which is a pretty terrible bug considering the rules of the game. I sometimes notice people 'disconnect' after they get picked up or hooked by a monster. I thought they might just be rage-quitting, and I'm sure there's plenty of that out there, but after my own game has crashed at exactly these points (right after a monster's finished their animation of picking me up, or placing me on a hook) my game just ctd's and I can't help but wonder if it happened to those people as well. This is pretty rare; I've got just under 150-ish hours and it's only happened to me three times, but it's still pretty concerning when it does.\n\n- Adding to that last bug if you're playing as a killer, on the off chance that a disconnected players character magically remains in the game, absolutely DO NOT try to interact with them. I know it looks like an easy kill, as they just stand there complacently, but that empty body is now actually a deadly trap (for killers). Don't pick them up and don't try to hook them. You will get stuck and freeze anywhere between 10-20 seconds (in my experience) for reasons I still haven't yet deciphered. You CAN try and slash them and leave them on the ground to bleed out, but that's as far as I would go in that regard. Also, this happened to me only once whilst playing as the Trapper.\n\nRegardless of all this, there is still a pretty solid game hidden underneath. You'll be enjoying yourself (or stressing out about being hunted down like an animal) more than dealing with any bugs and whatnot.\n\nEquipment, add-ons, and offerings are all consumable so use 'em as you get 'em or hoard them all like some sort of digital kleptomaniac (like me), because you can only use them once. But perks are good. You get to keep those, for the most part. (You'll lose your perks and have to earn them again if you choose to 'prestige' but if you decide not to then you keep them forever.) Make a bee-line for perks as soon as they show up on the bloodweb or you'll regret it.\n\nThe hefty buggery brings the score down quite a bit and if you're looking for a perfect experience then you will probably be disappointed. In that case I'd strongly recommend waiting for those bugs to be fixed before making a purchase. However, 98% of the time I'm still having great fun, so at the very least I'll give it a 5/10. Or a 6 if we're being generous. Pretty good. I still recommend it overall.

Also unlike like others, and I'm not saying they aren't having problems, other than people backing out I've never really experience long matchmaking times so in that respect I have no complaints.  \n\nNow, despit all that their can be a fair amount of frustation, expecially when factoring in that you're playing against actual people, who you know behave like people.  Do you get stomped on occasionally and camped?  Do people try to exploit routes in the maps?  Sure but fixes are being worked on for the camping and I don't recall knowingly having infinites used on me.  Has my game crash?  Yep, twice but both at the start of a match and given how much enjoyment I'm having they didn't phase me too much.  The game still need some balancing and work but the developers seem to be actively working on it.\n\nIn short, 8.5/10 would get facecamped again.","timestamp_created":1478498502,"timestamp_updated":1478498502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517492234706878662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26469985","author":{"steamid":"76561198318652441","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3458,"last_played":1572501992},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game love the new dlc but Michael Myers need to be nerfed a bit because he is really over powered at the moment","timestamp_created":1478498247,"timestamp_updated":1478498247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501231014728546143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26469706","author":{"steamid":"76561198308612000","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1002,"last_played":1642004124},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏刷血点的太多了，bug太多，优化和屎一样，由于电脑配置至今还在20段鱼塘，和小伙伴一起玩还是挺好玩的","timestamp_created":1478496216,"timestamp_updated":1478496216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26469688","author":{"steamid":"76561198118406176","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":75734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10448,"last_played":1594550394},"language":"thai","review":"Dead by daylight \nเป็นเกมสที่สนุกมากคับ\n ทั้งฝั่งผู้รอดชีวิตที่ต้องเอาตัวรอด และฝั่งฆาตกรที่ต้องไล่ล่า\nอยากให้ปรับปรุง เรื่องของการหาห้องเล่นทีคับเพราะมัน หาห้องยากมาก ถ้าต้องเล่นคนเดียวรอนานสุดๆ ยิ้่งเป็นคนชอบเล่นเกมส์คนเดียวด้วย ไม่มีเพื่อนมีฝูงรอห้องไปเถอะ บางทีรอเกมส์ค้างไปเลย ปรับปรุงด้วยคับ ผู้ดูแล ขอบคุณคับ","timestamp_created":1478496114,"timestamp_updated":1478496114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26468818","author":{"steamid":"76561198080718882","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":49043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":304,"playtime_at_review":10713,"last_played":1660479194},"language":"english","review":"The game was finally fixed and now I love it :)","timestamp_created":1478489490,"timestamp_updated":1528094109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26468740","author":{"steamid":"76561198031267650","num_games_owned":695,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":17263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17132,"last_played":1658603652},"language":"english","review":"Seriously, DON\"T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAY SURVIVORS.\n\nGame system favors killers too much, because the developer wants killers to buy DLC. It is their business model.\n\nThe developer do nothing about killer camping, but do their best to remove survivor infinity sites.\n\nAs a matter of fact, clever killer should ignore infinity sites, because survivors want to stall. It is nothing wrong. It is a reasonable (and skillful) survivor strategy. On the other hand, Survivors have no chance to escape if a killer camp besides the hook.\n\nI must admit, this is a bad gaming community, because 95% survivors are selfish. They [u][b]pull victim off the hook for easy game points, but not for better chance of escaping.[/b][/u] You will find that I am telling truth, because even the killer standing next to the hook (Camping), the “Rescuer” still always pull the victim off. Result? The Killer and the “Rescuer” get more game points, and the victim dies instantly because of the second time hooking.\n\nThe developer could balance the system easily, by [u][b]giving no game points for saving victims[/b][/u], then, all the survivors would consider saving people for better chance to escape, instead of easy game points.\n\nHowever, once again, The developer do nothing (even encourage) about killer camping because they want to please the killer (selling more DLC, of course).\n\nThose DLC are so unfair that survivors have no perks to defend against killer’s abilities. Trust me, you won’t buy those DLC if you play survivors. Those DLC increases the fun of the killers, not survivors.\n\nWhy would I use my time and money to amuse the killer ? \n\nI don’t mind being chase and slaughter. (You may find that I am survival horror fan, by checking my game library.) But there is no fun in this game because of the bias from the developer.\n\nThere are lots of survival horror to play with. Don’t waste your money and time on “dead by daylight”.

Если и появляются какие-то баги, то они обычно разовые.\n\nТеперь можно более подробно разобрать игру. \nИ первое: лично мне нравится, в каком направлении идет игра. Играть стало сложнее, но интереснее. Новая маньячка добавила огромного интереса в геймплей, с ней появилось много игровых тактик. Радует, что разработчики потихоньку начали исправляться, не лепить глупые вещи на подобие Майерса, а создавать что-то действительно интересное.\n\nВторое: добавили новый античит, и теперь новые сейвленные персонажи не грузятся. Старые, насколько мне известно, никуда не делись, но хотя бы отсутствие новых УЖЕ радует. Меньше неадекватов, господа и дамы, и больше интереса.\n\nТретье: появилась возможность отправлять репорт! Ура! На самом деле, это очень важная вещь, так как люди теперь трижды подумают, прежде чем кемперить или посылать кого-то по матушке. Лично я в восторге от этого. Но помимо репорта можно отправить еще и лайк игроку, игра которого тебе понравилась. Не знаю, какие плюшки с этого получает игрок, но видно, что народ стал УЧИТЬСЯ играть, а не тупо орать каждый раз \"Кемпер!\", если проиграл.\n\nЧетвертое: геймплей тихо, но верно стараются разнообразить. Игра стала сложнее, нафармить очков теперь тяжелее, приходится учиться играть, чтобы получить хороший результат и сохранить рейтинг. Стала больше оцениваться дружная командная игра, а кемперство теперь \"лечат\", и лечат адекватно, давая что-то взамен. Меня это дико радует.\n\nВ минусы можно добавить все те же старые баги. Но, насколько я вижу, их стараются исправлять, так что... Можно отнести их к временному явлению.\n\nС последним DLC разработчкии явно постарались на славу, я ждала именно Ведьму, для меня она просто идеальный маньяк - смесь техник игры Траппера и Колокольки. Прекрасно.\n\nВывод: игра стала исправляться, стали ужесточаться правила, геймплей стал более разнообразным. И это очень радует. Так что теперь игру можно порекомендовать к покупке. Не идеал, но путь выбран правильный.","timestamp_created":1478482390,"timestamp_updated":1481425523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485051333904266357","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26467313","author":{"steamid":"76561198031796805","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1495589574},"language":"english","review":"While i do reccomend the game. here are a run down of my pros/cons. \n\nCons first!: literally spent my first 6 matches with the game crashing every time i did any action.
