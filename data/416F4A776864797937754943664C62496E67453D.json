Die Devs balancieren das Spiel langsam mehr und mehr der erste Schritt dazu war das neue Emblem/Ranking System. Jetzt wird es auch was bedeuten einen hohen Rang zu erreichen. Es gibt viele verschiedene Killer und Survivor was den Spielspaß nie verschwinden lässt! Jeder Survivor hat seine eigenen persönlichen Perks, die aber mithilfe des erreichens der Level 30/35/40 oder des Schreins auch für alle anderen Survivor verfügbar sind. Das gleiche ist mit allen Killern.\nDas einzige wirklich negative ist, dass durch das neue Ranking System fast jeder 3. Killer ein Camper ist teilsweise sogar ein Facecamper was den Spielspaß vermießt. \nSonst ist das Spiel wirklich top habe nichts auszusetzen!\n\nUpdate: Nach nun über 2000 Spielstunden(habe einen anderen Account für dbd) kann ich hinzufügen, dass das game langsam langweilig wird. Red Ranks sind anstrengend, viele Perk bugs(Dead Hard), zu viel wird generft. \nAußerdem bei jedem patch gibt es sogenannte 'Map-Holes' ein Beispiel dazu hier: https://www.twitch.tv/evoz__/clip/LazyRoughCrowOpieOP?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time\nDas schlimme daran: Wenn man ein neuer Killer ist, weiß man nicht, dass es sowas gibt und dass dann vielleicht Survivor ohne dass die gens gemacht wurden oder die Luke erscheint einfach rauskommen da fragt man sich schon, wie das jetzt passiert ist.\nDas meist negativste mittlerweile, ist die Community.\nDead by Daylight hat eine der toxischsten Community's die ich je gesehen habe. Nicht mal in COD gibt es so eine!\nAbgesehen von dem schlechten, gibt es aber auch gute Sachen!\n\nWie z.B. das neue Archive. Es funktioniert wie ein Battle Pass(ich denk ma jeder kann sich darunter was vorstellen). Was dir ermöglicht, Accessoires zu bekommen, die es wahrscheinlich in dieser Farbe/Form nicht mehr geben wird. Zu dem wurde die Nurse generft die einst der stärkste Killer im game war was auch ganz gut ist trotzdem hätte man die Nurse nicht so demütigen dürfen, devs ;) Auch ich war ein Nurse Main.\n\nNach wie vor kann ich das game empfehlen wer sich dafür interessiert. Aber glaubt mir, wenn ihr in den Red Rank Bereich kommt(Rank 1-4) werden die Runden sehr, sehr stressig und ihr werdet auch den einen oder anderen Rage moment haben, sagt mir nicht ich habe euch nicht gewarnt ;)\n\nSonst sage ich noch: good luck and have fun fellow player of the fog! :)","timestamp_created":1524302313,"timestamp_updated":1573574096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541914522647857666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41600441","author":{"steamid":"76561198331645250","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":74039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60921,"last_played":1650375081},"language":"japanese","review":"暇つぶしで１０００時間もしてしまうほど中毒性があります","timestamp_created":1524297969,"timestamp_updated":1524297969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527601659297943115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41600411","author":{"steamid":"76561198395070763","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9286,"last_played":1655583731},"language":"russian","review":"прекрасная игра мне очень нравится всем советую","timestamp_created":1524297793,"timestamp_updated":1524297793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41599779","author":{"steamid":"76561198107775848","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10432,"last_played":1653120730},"language":"koreana","review":".","timestamp_created":1524294757,"timestamp_updated":1524294757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41598519","author":{"steamid":"76561198047743989","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9553,"last_played":1603391102},"language":"english","review":"Game started off as a lot of fun.\n\nUpdate by update, the development crew seems to listen only to the top 5% of players who have 5000+ hours when it comes to updates.\n\nLets be real, not all of us are top 5%...\n\nSo the endless killer/survivor battle of this ones better than the other purely relies on the top 5%.\n\nNeedless to say after the last update, Previously i was rank 6, I can't even get below rank 20.  This is me getting 15k bloodpoints plus.  Pallets were shrunk to near non existant.  Can't even escape through windows anymore.  And any response you ask for all you get is \"get good\".  Well sadly enough not all of us are top tier 1000 hours into this game.   Start listening to the real majority of players and stop listening to the killers who rank up super fast into the top 5%.\n\nI rarely write reviews, but after a couple hundred hours into this game, i regret buying it. \n\nThe community is straight up toxic, if a killer doesn't kill all 4 survivors a \"gg\" is few and far between.\n\nAnd if you do survive and make it out, you don't even get to rank up a pip.  Even if you hauled !@# getting generators running.\n\nBalance for this game is WELL overdue, and the community refuses to admit it.  I personally have held off purchasing the addons as i see them as a waste of money at this point.\n\nIf you want to be shafted by admins every step of the way, then this is the game for you!  If you want a community of killers that will automatically assume you have a group of 4 overly qualified players on survive with friends.  This is for you!\n\nIn reality as not every killer realizes, sometimes when you queue as 3 friends, you get a brand new survivor that isn't a pro.  They bring your entire team down to their level (which is perfectly fine).  However the community of killers automatically assume every player should be a pro.","timestamp_created":1524287595,"timestamp_updated":1524287595,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41598510","author":{"steamid":"76561198432764412","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2311,"last_played":1655868259},"language":"brazilian","review":"pica","timestamp_created":1524287557,"timestamp_updated":1524287557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531914889812469482","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41598454","author":{"steamid":"76561198227602192","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":22679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14095,"last_played":1586191633},"language":"thai","review":"ตัวเกมเป็นควยอะไรว่ะเข้าเกมก็ได้มีปัญหาเยอะมากแก้นู่นแก็นี่นั่นหมดแล้วน่ะมึงจะเอายังไงกับกูหน้าหี ผู้พัฒนาหน้าหีมากๆควยสัส มึงลบเกมนี้ไปซะไอ้สัส ปัญหาเยอะไอ้เหี้ย","timestamp_created":1524287250,"timestamp_updated":1524287250,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41598294","author":{"steamid":"76561198119580861","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":24871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5478,"last_played":1656302874},"language":"english","review":"Very in balanced and continues to buff killers and nerf survivors to the point of absurdity full of bugs and glitches just seems like the developers care more about creating new killers then fixing the game","timestamp_created":1524286333,"timestamp_updated":1585777389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518652260303497314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41597830","author":{"steamid":"76561198048582315","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":36125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1988,"playtime_at_review":16040,"last_played":1660522147},"language":"tchinese","review":"遊戲對於新手而言會較為不友善，但是關鍵技能點出來後差異不大，較可惜的是由於技能傳承，人類之間較無特色，反而鬼的特殊能力相較有趣。","timestamp_created":1524283468,"timestamp_updated":1572533970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41597362","author":{"steamid":"76561198185920231","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4045,"last_played":1529076774},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是好游戏，但是有些的地图地形的设计和匹配机制实在是有些诡异。寒风农场有些地方屠夫过不去而求生者可以，我一个一个技能都没有的新手屠夫匹配到的全是满技能的人皇，这种匹配机制实在是难以忍受。","timestamp_created":1524280585,"timestamp_updated":1524280585,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411792755126953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41597085","author":{"steamid":"76561198135588451","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":48580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":67,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1660594928},"language":"english","review":"my wallet hates this game","timestamp_created":1524278978,"timestamp_updated":1654638907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41597032","author":{"steamid":"76561198423599710","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1183,"last_played":1589380276},"language":"thai","review":"God","timestamp_created":1524278733,"timestamp_updated":1524278733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41596571","author":{"steamid":"76561198395274162","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":203932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":245,"playtime_at_review":13091,"last_played":1660355258},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game!

Well, I am here to tell you how great this game actually is.\n\nFirst of all, if you are scared of horror movies and the genre itself, this game is fine for you. Personally I hate horror movies and I can't really watch them, but I can play this game just fine and still have a great time with intense gore. Also, something I would like to point out is don't let the bad reviews about bad balancing issues ruin the game for you. However, they are partly right. Not every killer in the game is good, in fact there are only three top tier killers (Hillbilly, Nurse, Myers.) Survivors can have ridiculously good perks, but the killer can as well. Trust me, anyone who is saying killer is impossible to play is completely wrong. There are plenty of perks that are amazing on killer, here is a few: BBQ & Chili (This basically lets the killer see any survivors that aren't near the recently hooked survivors), Nurse's calling (Let's you see the aura of healing survivors from about 20/24/28 meters away), and NOED or No one escapes Death (When the exit gates are powered, a dull totem is turned into a hex totem that makes it so survivors are one hit, so the killer can just hook everyone before they escape.) I know if you are reading this review, you may have no idea what I am talking about and thats ok. This game has some bugs, everyone knows that, but so do other games. There isn't a single game out there that is absolutely perfect and has no bugs. In the end, I feel like this game was very worth my $20 and I hope to keep improving as I keep playing this game.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are worried about the hefty amount of DLC for this game, don't worry. The devs are implenting a way to unlock DLC characters by playtime, so you won't have to pay to get them.","timestamp_created":1524232694,"timestamp_updated":1524286182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41587000","author":{"steamid":"76561198310523652","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":17102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3798,"last_played":1659074683},"language":"thai","review":"I love Kyouko.","timestamp_created":1524231376,"timestamp_updated":1524231376,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41586926","author":{"steamid":"76561198127866436","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1138,"last_played":1589717024},"language":"japanese","review":"ゲーム自体は面白いのですが、プレイヤーのマナーが致命的に悪く、私はプレイをやめました。\nあおられても平気な方なら継続的に楽しめるかも。","timestamp_created":1524230993,"timestamp_updated":1524230993,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467815130949020386","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41586920","author":{"steamid":"76561198095343532","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":102438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20774,"last_played":1653697075},"language":"koreana","review":"잘풀리면 정말 갓겜 티배깅 당하거나 매질 당하면 정말 똥겜","timestamp_created":1524230953,"timestamp_updated":1524230953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41586326","author":{"steamid":"76561198192274334","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":46078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16691,"last_played":1651295891},"language":"schinese","review":"怎么说呢，这游戏刚玩是恐怖游戏，开黑就变成了欢乐游戏。农场主与偷电贼不得不说的故事。这游戏其他都好，就是优化差，bug多，希望能有所改善。","timestamp_created":1524228214,"timestamp_updated":1524228214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41585778","author":{"steamid":"76561198095739343","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":32812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32812,"last_played":1605630786},"language":"russian","review":"Ужасная игра,не тратьте своё время на неё никогда,я вас прошу!","timestamp_created":1524225624,"timestamp_updated":1605630902,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41585721","author":{"steamid":"76561198263683896","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5101,"last_played":1619715533},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1524225360,"timestamp_updated":1524225360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41585485","author":{"steamid":"76561198064614501","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":16789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10615,"last_played":1647320909},"language":"koreana","review":"개걸레같은게임 어우 살인마새끼들 맨날 캠핑이야 게임 개찌질하게 하네","timestamp_created":1524224238,"timestamp_updated":1533318164,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54227912425994873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41585302","author":{"steamid":"76561198188694228","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1643,"last_played":1524064267},"language":"russian","review":"В Dead by Daylight я уже играю только по фану.

Veteran players already have a HUGE advantage over new players in mastering the mechanics and maps of the game, but as a new player you're going up against people who ALSO have full perk setups when you're starting out with none (in beginner matches). If this company wants to net-gain rather than net-lose players they would be well advised to try and bring a little more equity to the new/early player experience. Perhaps implement perk limitations by match Rank (1 perk max for Rank 16-20, 2 perks for Rank 11-15, 3 perks for Rank 6-10, 4 perks for Ranks 1-5) to help make low rank matches more competitive rather than the bloodpoint farm they often seem to be for veteran players.\n\nI'm recommending this game but with a WARNING to new players. Just go in expecting to get crushed (and sometimes trolled) for your first many games and you'll have more and more moments that are remarkably fun in a way that is unique to this game.\n\n*EDIT*\nSince my review, there have been some updates to the way matchmaking and ranking occurs that help remedy my earlier complaint about early matches being unrelentingly imbalanced for the new player.
