4 kurban ve 1 katil arasında geçiyor kurbanların amacı tüm jeneratörleri tamamlayıp kaçmak katilin amacıysa zaten belli herkesi öldürmeye çalışmak. pozitif yanları oyun gerçekten eğlenceli ve heyecanlı, kurbanken jeneratör mü yapayım katilden mi kaçayım arkadaşımı mı kurtarayım derken kurban tarafını cidden baskı altına sokuyor ve oyundaki katil size yaklaştıkça gelen gergin müzik gitgide artarak sizi panikletiyor tabi oyunu çok fazla oynadıktan sonra bunlar pek bir etki etmiyor ama yinede çok güzel detaylar var katil tarafında ise her katilin kendine özel bir gücü olması bayağı hoş. Bazı katiller çok over powered diyenler var ama her katilin kendine has bir gücü olduğundan her katili farklı bir şekilde counterlamanın yolu var örneğin Hillbillyden kaçmak için dümdüz koşmak yerine bir yapının yanına ani dönüşler yapıp dodgelanabilir ya da Deathslinger için vurulmadan önce objelerin arkasına geçilip engellenebilir. Negatif yanları ise son patch yayınlandığında oyunun tüm orjinalliği ve zevki gitti, karakterler sabit dururken heykel gibiler bundan önce bir tedirgin şekilde duruyorlardı yani atmosfere daha uygundu. Ve facecamping, tunelling ve teabagging gibi şeyler oyunun içine ediyor. ekibin bunlarla daha çok ilgilenmesi lazım, hala bir sürü optimizasyon sorunu var, bunlarla ilgileneceklerine gidip yeni katil ve yeni mapler ekliyorlar. Bunlar dışında oyun gayet güzel ve zevkli oyun kurban ya da katil tarafından yana değil ve dengeli, kazanıp kaybetmeniz sizin oynayışınıza göre değişiyor. Parasını hak eden bir oyun iyi günler.","timestamp_created":1613005589,"timestamp_updated":1613005589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86369070","author":{"steamid":"76561198341328620","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":35975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22277,"last_played":1654388524},"language":"english","review":"I really like(d) this game until the new release.

It could feel unbalanced at times but that's just how the game was made. However, the new 4.5 patch changes everything the community loved about this game. The hud is now a mess, reminding me more of a mobile game than a full console/pc release. The movement most players have spent hours mastering has been completely overhauled overnight. This changes come in spite of the communities suggestions and comments asking for BH not to make these changes. As of now, I can't see myself playing this game with the current changes in place and would not recommend a new purchase of the game until BH starts to take community feedback into their updates.

This is exactly what happened with Dawn of War III, The Culling, and Friday the 13th to name a few. The developers of those games made unwarranted and unasked for changes to their game and then proceeded to bite the bullet andkeep those changes even after they had received negative feedback from their community. All of those games were completely dead within 3 months of making those changes and sticking through with them. Because DBD has a much larger player base than those games it is more likely the players will significantly drop over an extended period of time. But this game could easily lose half its player base within 1 year if they keep doing this to their community. The game is bugged and the animations did not even need changes in the first place. I played a match where the match just ended when one person used the key to open hatch. Just instantly match end even though only one person went through the hatch.

I got used to the new UI (at smallest scale possible) and the hitboxes/desync are mostly gone (for now), as are the other issues mentioned in my old review.\n\nThe game is fun under certain circumstances. If you have at least one friend to play with as survivor, it is a much more entertaining experience. As a solo Q player, you will have days where you get straight up awful matches (camping/tunelling killers and/or bad teammates) and days when your games will be satisfying and fun. You must have the nerve for it.\n\nAs far as killer is concerned, it is also a mental excerise. If you want chill games, you can dodge SWF groups and keys in lobbies, since the killer queues are extremely short. If you can't be bothered with that, try to distance yourself from any toxicity that you may come across. Avoid the flashlight clickers because this annoys the hell out of them. Break chases if they take too long. When it comes to camping or tunneling, think about how you feel when another killer does it to you. Seriously unfun and boring. But hey, if you want to do it, knock yourself out, it's your game.\n\nAll in all, if you want to be good at this game, you need to give it a lot of time. Probably a lot more that most games out there. Make no mistake, this is no casual game, no matter how they try to promote it that way. You need time to learn the mechanics of killer and survivor and you need experience in order to be able to work well with your teammates and predict your opponents' moves. If you plan to play this for a couple of hours every weekend, save you money and your time and look for something else. \n\n\nREVIEW FROM THE 4.5.0 PATCH (in order to remember what BHVR can do to this game)\nI cannot recommend the game in its current state. The latest \"patch\" has brought some awful changes, that make DBD almost unplayable. First of all, the absolutely horrendous new UI. Before the patch, all the info that a player should be aware of while playing were neatly placed in the bottom left and right of the screen, in a perfectly working hud that did not need any change whatosever. After the patch, all that info is spread all around the screen, which makes it very hard to keep track of everything, while also limiting your field of view. This new setup is that of a mobile game, but if you play on pc or, even worse, on your console with a big TV, you will struggle. Additionally, the life meters of the survivors are so minuscule that you can barely see the progress bar. All in all, there is nothing that I like about the new UI - even the character portraits look out of place, the 'adept' portraits would have been a much better fit.\n\nThe new animations of the survivors feel extremely stiff and robotic. Plus they come with the bonus (a bug?) of way bigger hitboxes that let killer hits connect from ridiculous distances, thus making it extremely hard and frustrating to play as a survivor. Also, the \"Unbroken\" emblem is, well, broken and it will not reward any points if you don't actually survive the match, which means: a) less bloodpoints awarded, and b) unfair de-ranking. There are also lots of bugs that have appeared on new (walk-though walls in Asylum) and old maps (funbus) after this patch.\n\nSo until all these have been dealt with properly, no don't buy this game.","timestamp_created":1612996921,"timestamp_updated":1621532130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550835013389587402","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363987","author":{"steamid":"76561199062197399","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":140911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":440,"playtime_at_review":65360,"last_played":1660398085},"language":"english","review":"AS LONG AS YOUR ARE PAITENT YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE MAPS","timestamp_created":1612996906,"timestamp_updated":1612996906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467698812484741211","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363939","author":{"steamid":"76561198411121836","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1655539968},"language":"english","review":"It is fun co-op\n","timestamp_created":1612996832,"timestamp_updated":1612996832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488801449537277222","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363859","author":{"steamid":"76561198012477223","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":37510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6136,"last_played":1650323814},"language":"english","review":"game was great when it wasnt a mobile game.","timestamp_created":1612996713,"timestamp_updated":1612996713,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363830","author":{"steamid":"76561199109516046","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17142,"last_played":1631062581},"language":"english","review":"the game is atleast fixed for now, so if they keep it as it is im fine.","timestamp_created":1612996675,"timestamp_updated":1614169648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500439167022705078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363807","author":{"steamid":"76561198259880950","num_games_owned":738,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":100098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25882,"last_played":1651076838},"language":"koreana","review":"병신 게임이 이번 패치로 개씹병신 게임이 되었어요","timestamp_created":1612996647,"timestamp_updated":1613165862,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363759","author":{"steamid":"76561198004407950","num_games_owned":581,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":26794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":93,"playtime_at_review":16777,"last_played":1660601815},"language":"english","review":"Game's alright but that Myers was butt-cheeks!","timestamp_created":1612996570,"timestamp_updated":1613204844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86363693","author":{"steamid":"76561198121460506","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":51299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41551,"last_played":1655584473},"language":"english","review":"Anyone with more than 5 hours on this game can tell you its a pile garbage after the most recent patch.

Why is somebody with over 1,000 hours in this game writing a negative review? Well, the answer is simple. This game has it's moments. I've played it a lot, and have had fun with it for the most part. However, there is a glaring problem with the game, that is destroying everything I love about it, and upsetting the community more and more every day.\n\nPros\n\nSo, as you've probably seen, DBD is an asymmetrical horror game. Although I wouldn't really call it a horror game anymore, it's more of just a competitive game now. But the first few times you play, the game is terrifying. It's good fun to play survive with friends and get your socks scared off, or just to have a casual horror experience. But, as I said, the more you play, the game gets less and less scary, and more competitive. Don't take this as a bad thing, because the competitive part of the game is what keeps me and everyone else playing it. It has very addicting and fun gameplay. The game gives you your money's worth, and DLCs are not necessary to have fun in the game. Overall, this game is very fun if you're interested in the horror genre, or if you're looking for a rather simple competitive game to play, especially with friends.\n\nMine (and everyone else's) problem with the game\n\nNow that I've covered why I've played the game so much and keep coming back to it, let's get into the reason why this game is so very controversial. The one and only thing that has been destroying this game and ruining everybody's experience with it, are the developers. Time and time again, the developers proceed to show just how out of touch they are with their own game.\n\nBalance\n\nThere have been many many perks, addons, and killers that the community has been asking for changes for for actual YEARS. Either because it is too strong, or just because it's too unbalanced for the other side. The meta for the game is usually just the same perks every single match, because they rarely ever release newer strong perks, substantially buff other worse perks, or nerf the perks in the meta. And don't get me wrong, there are a LOT of perks in the game to choose from, it's just that there are very few perks that are actually decent in helping you survive/kill. After a while, the game becomes extremely stale because of these reasons.\n\nUnwanted/questionable changes\n\nDespite the meta in the game never changing, the developers of the game are constantly releasing new content. They release new killers and survivors very frequently, and with those updates come balance changes and \"quality of life\" changes. However, if I'm being completely honest, these changes are rarely ever good. Whenever they buff a perk, it's still not very good. Whenever they release a killer, it's usually not a viable killer. And the \"quality of life\" changes for the game that the developers think are good, are almost never good. All of these things make you wonder... do they developers even understand their own game, after all of this time working on it? A recent example of changes that nobody wanted is the recent \"new and improved\" UI. Don't get me wrong, the old UI was perfectly fine. All of the information you needed to know was neatly packed in the bottom left/bottom right side of the screen. However, when the developers came out with a PTB (player test build) showing the new UI, everything is now scattered all over the screen, and harder to see by people with vision disabilities. So, as expected, the community told the developers that this new UI wasn't good, and that it shouldn't be added to the live game. A month passes, and the mid-chapter update is finally released. And, to the shock of the whole community, hardly ANYTHING was changed from the UI on the PTB. It's still the scattered mess that it was a month before. This begs the question: what was the point of the PTB if the developers didn't listen to the community census?\n\nBugs\n\nIf you start playing this game, I'm sure you will immediately start running into bugs. With every update to the game, there is some weird new bug. Some of the bugs are just funny visual bugs that don't affect gameplay, but some bugs completely lose the game for you if you play killer, and some bugs can get you killed if you play survivor. And occasionally, there will be a bug that survivors find that can be extremely abusable, but instead of fixing it, the developers just ban people that they find doing it. This can lead to people unknowingly finding a bug and getting banned for no reason. Also, the game's servers can be extremely janky and laggy at times, which make some of the hits the killer gets on you look like they hit you from very far away. This sometimes makes the game unplayable.\n\nGreed\n\nAs previously mentioned, the developers have a new killer released every 3 months, and they have shown to stick to this schedule very tightly, an example being the most recent chapter: A Binding of Kin. On paper, the new killer, The Twins, was a pretty unique idea for the game. You were able to control two characters at once throughout the map. However, as usual, this killer wasn't very strong. And, for this update, there was an UNGODLY amount of bugs with the new killer/reworked maps. And, as everyone pointed out in the PTB, the devs made a massive oversight on a very simple way to counter the new killer, which was just to go into a locker whenever the killer was using their power. Despite all of the bugs still unfixed and all of the counters to the new killer still standing, the time was coming where they were supposed to be releasing the new killer on schedule. Did they delay the chapter to fix the amount of bugs, or tweak the killer's power? You guessed it: no. They stuck to their schedule and released the update in a complete buggy mess. This just shows that the developers only care about the income for new chapters rather than the community.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter all I have to say about DBD, I still encourage you to buy it if you are interested in the genre. This is the only somewhat decent asymmetrical horror game on the market, and like I said, it has its moments of good fun. However, if you're willing to stick around, be prepared for godawful updates to the game that completely ruin it for you, and be prepared to be angry at the developers for their bad decisions.\n\nTL;DR: The game is fun at times, but the developers make terrible updates and changes for the game that make them seem extremely out of touch and ruin the game for the community.","timestamp_created":1612995027,"timestamp_updated":1612995027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552980124950408936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86362682","author":{"steamid":"76561198237115080","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":65437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7577,"last_played":1656959044},"language":"polish","review":"Do pizdy ta giereczka po ostatnim upade rip 360 jak i normalny zasieg killerow","timestamp_created":1612994955,"timestamp_updated":1612994955,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589823603630065918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86362679","author":{"steamid":"76561198075193901","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":108480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29059,"last_played":1658462273},"language":"english","review":"It's okay.

Just say you want killers to be able to 4k in their sleep.\nKiller is the easiest it's been since the game's release and you're buffing them again while nerfing survivors... again.\n\nIt's a massive shame I've wasted so much time and money on this game and now I won't even be able to get a refund. I hope this review can spare some people their money. \nDon't buy this game. It's a bug filled, spaghetti coded nightmare with worse and worse patches every update. The devs are out of touch with their own game. We've had a rubber-banding issue for a minimum of a month now and the devs, while they are aware of this (they used to take even longer to become aware of these game-breaking bugs) most likely don't have the slightest clue on how to fix it, much like they don't know how to fix the FOV issues on some of their killer characters (mostly the Hillbilly).\n\nThey claim to care about accessibility, but they announced that they'd like to change the ONE survivor perk that made the game accessible to d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing players.\n\nThey claim to care about everyone having a \"fun\" experience, but only now, 6 years after the game's release, have they made any changes to attempt to address the camping and tunneling issue that has existed from day 1 while encouraging MORE of the MOST unfun strategies, slugging. \n\nOn top of all of this, their response to the sheer number of hackers in the game is, for lack of a better term, lackluster. Nonexistent even. The way they handle banning people from the game is if they're caught by Easy Anti-Cheat, but the hackers know their way around that. The people who have sold the hacks have said that they have sold the hacks to a MINIMUM of 10,000 people. Small hacks like a little boost to speed or a reduction in a cooldown, just enough to make you question whether it's actually there or not. Those aren't caught by easy-anti cheat. Larger hacks like permanent DS, instant healing, flashlights without having one, teleporting a survivor to you as the killer, FLYING... Apparently also not caught by easy-anti cheat. Reporting these hacks? Does nothing. The report system is a JOKE.\n\nThe devs are also blatant liars. They claim that their ideal, balanced match would be 2 survivors killed/sacrificed and 2 survivors escape. They then released data on the kill rates by killer that show that the majority of the killers on the roster have kill rates between 60%-80%. The ones that are under 50% are the ones with higher skill ceilings. So how do the devs respond? By saying kill rates are lower than they would like. \n\nThis rated M for mature game has a chat filter. A chat filter that, when they implemented it, they claimed would NOT filter profanity, only slurs and that the filter would be a toggle that players can turn on and off. And yet here we are with a filter that filters profanity, half the character names, and a good portion of the perk names. And this was their \"solution\" to people being racist, sexist, and homophobic rather than banning people who used slurs in the chat. Why not get rid of the chat entirely or give us a button that says \"gg\" instead?\n\nAnd now they're changing the perks that the killer community have been crying about for years in an effort to change the \"meta\". But all that's going to do is shift the meta to more of the same, just in a different way and change which perks the killer community will cry about to see nerfs next. First it was Self-Care, when Self-Care got nerfed, they shifted focus to DS. DS got nerfed, so they shifted focus to Dead Hard. Dead Hard is getting nerfed, so they'll shift focus to Sprint Burst. Killers will still run 3-4 gen slow down perks despite gen repair speeds being slowed, but they'll run DIFFERENT gen slow down perks. \n\nDBD in 2016 was survivor-sided. \nThey had a while where the game actually felt balanced and challenging for both sides and they've decided to COMPLETELY ruin it. I'd say I would become a killer main with these changes, but if I want an easy game, I'll just go play Stardew Valley or Minecraft instead.\n\nSave your money. This game wouldn't be worth it if you could get it for free. There are absolutely ZERO redeemable qualities left in this game.","timestamp_created":1612994664,"timestamp_updated":1655941599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509090900421142578","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86362473","author":{"steamid":"76561197980111947","num_games_owned":494,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":128568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125061,"last_played":1658552026},"language":"english","review":"The parent company, Behaviour, repeatedly pushes updates to this game containing content that damages many game play and continuity aspects.
