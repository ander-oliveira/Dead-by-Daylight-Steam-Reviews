Nun, wo es das ist, hab ich es mir gekauft und ich war mehr als enttäuscht. Die erste Runde war's noch lustig als Überlebender, aber es hat stark nachgelassen nach der zweiten Runde. \n\nUm etwas genauer zu werden..\nfolgendes gefällt mir:\n- Grafisch ist es cool und stimmig. Düster und dunkel gehalten, so wie es sein sollte.\n- Die Atmosphäre ist gut. Vom Killer hört man nur bestimmte Töne, und diese auch nur wenn er in der Nähe ist. Das macht das ganze spannender, ist aber bei denen die sich unsichtbar machen können ziemlich nervig. Mehr dazu weiter unten, bei den Sachen die mir nicht so gefallen haben.\n..und das wars auch irgendwie schon.\n\nDinge die mir nicht gefallen haben..\n- Das Matchmaking. Unfair ist noch untertrieben. Ich starte meine erste Runde und hab weder Perks noch sonst was, wie denn auch? Es ist die erste Runde. Mein \"Gegner\", der Killer, war viel höher, hatte einige Perks und was weiß ich nicht alles. Es war nicht seine erste Runde, um es anders zu formulieren.\n- Die Killer. Das ich die ersten Runden noch relativ unerfahren und schlecht bin bzw. war, möchte ich nicht bestreiten, denn ich war definitiv kein Profi oder sonst was. Trotz allem finde ich dass alle Killer viel stärker sind als Überlebende, obwohl es davon vier gibt und vom Killer nur einen. Bestes Beispiel war die Runde in der ich in der Nähe vom Killer gespawned bin. Was soll sowas? Ich hör direkt am Anfang der Runde schon die Melodie von Freddy (DLC Killer) und bin 10 Sekunden später am Haken aufgehängt worden, und das wars dann. Nach ganzen 20 Sekunden war die Runde für mich komplett vorbei und ich durfte zuschauen. Wow! Dazu kommt noch: Freddy ist unsichtbar, wie einige andere Killer auch.\n\n\nNaja, ich find das Spiel nicht gut. Hab mich, wie gesagt, zwar drauf gefreut, hab mich aber ehrlich gesagt vorher nicht wirklich informiert oder Videos zu geschaut, einfach weil ich mich nicht spoilern lassen wollte.\nFür Leute die damit leben können, mit dem was mir gefällt und dem, was mir nicht gefällt - greift zu, noch ist's im Sale.\nFür alle anderen.. ich hab euch gewarnt. Ich persönlich hab's wieder zurückgegeben. Hab mein Geld wieder, aber bewerten wollt ich's trotzdem mal.\n\nViel Spaß.

Sadly, since they released the NEW DLC, Freddy, the all winning killer, ruined the game balance, he has no real downsides to his kit, and the killers I met, have claimed Freddy was tested heavily and called balanced. Yet he has the following buffs: 1. Freddy is always invisible, unless he pulls you into the dream world. 2. When in dream world there are 3 ways out, Fail a generator, or med kit skill check,   Have a teammate wake you up,   OR get put on the hook, which really isnt a good way out.   3. IF you manage to escape his Terror Radius while in the dream world, YOU GET HIGHLIGHTED while in there.    4. FROM MY EXPERIENCE, He has a hell of a lunge on his attacks, I have been hit from feet away, or from the other side of a pallet that I have already slid over. \n\n5. Not really a major buff, but still creepy: HIS AURA of detection has his \"Theme song\" being hummed.\n\nWould normally of gave this game a Thumbs Up, but since they have released Freddy, Nope. I would NOT BUY this game at the moment.\n\nALSO, If you downvote, and disagree with me, Please tell me below, the following 2 things, Why do you disagree, and have you played survivor against freddy yet, or have you only played freddy.","timestamp_created":1509223894,"timestamp_updated":1509226325,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533838927745819092","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36089974","author":{"steamid":"76561198181708781","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1924,"last_played":1599170490},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Game Review [/h1]\nThis game is extremely fun, don't get me wrong, but the new DLC that involves the killer Freddy Krueger is absolutely atrocious.

As of Jan 2022 they have apparently stepped back from that and Pinhead's voice lines are returning. This is positive. However, this review vote will remain negative until they publicly distance themselves from that technology going forward.\n\nThe previous tentatively positive review remains below:\n\n----------\n\nFun for as long as you don't care about the outcome of the matches and just see this as a Halloween lark or nothing serious. The honeymoon period may last for a hundred hours or more - and maybe you will always see it that way. For this period of the game, so long as it remains fun and stress free, it's a recommendation. \n\nBeyond that, after you reach competency, and then once you level up a few times in terms of understanding the meta mechanics, the game does not reward investment - it punishes it. You will realise just how prone to abuse you are, on both sides but particularly as killer, and how the devs simply do not care about dealing with this (and have never done, in the years since release). At the highest level the game is completely broken apart by coordinated 'survive with friends' teams communicating outside the game. Most perks are designed with no communication in mind and so they are either considerably weakened at best or downright abusable by coordinated survivors. The worst part is there is no way to avoid playing against these teams. They should have long since had a 'ranked' (competitive) matchmaking mode of their own, but unfortunately they are even thrown into the mix against literal newbie players. These games are toxic enough for experienced killers with hundreds or thousands of hours in the game, let alone new players (and in DbD anyone with less than a few hundred hours is essentially new).\n\nBUT WAIT, that's not all! The game updates regularly and the creative team are talented. Part of the reason the game has achieved such longevity is the frequently appearance of new characters and maps. On the other hand, these updates also bring many unbalanced mechanics and game-breaking bugs, some of which are never fixed. Even if they are, the underlying game is unstable to the point where you will see unfair nonsense happening pretty much every match without fail. DbD has the sweaty competitive atmosphere of an esports game but lacks the responsive match engine or dedicated balancing to keep it in check.\n\nBut hey, like I said, the honeymoon period is truly a lot of fun. If you can avoid getting invested, if you can avoid caring about your ability and improving, if you can turn a blind eye to the absolutely rampant toxicity (or if you just laugh at that kind of thing...) this is the game for you. Otherwise, you're paying for the honeymoon period alone: anything beyond that comes with a serious health warning.","timestamp_created":1509223201,"timestamp_updated":1641436182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493716329336166382","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36089644","author":{"steamid":"76561198037803410","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4072,"last_played":1584227688},"language":"latam","review":"Muy entretenido y más si juegas con amigos.","timestamp_created":1509222952,"timestamp_updated":1509222952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36089619","author":{"steamid":"76561198103100898","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32551,"last_played":1658684575},"language":"english","review":"Game play is the same every game. you fix a generator. killer chases you. killer get you. you go on hook. player saves you. you go right back to fixing a generator.

Matchmaking is a joke in this game, you can be the only experienced player in the lobby and your teammates are still trying to figure out how to hit a skill check. The events are very repetitive and grindy with the rewards being mostly awful reskins. Ingame filter is not even worth going over and the report system does nothing. A battle pass that makes you pay $10 that gives you awful looking charms and reskins with only like 3 new skins.

Im \"Freundesspiel\" ist es möglich alle Perks zu benutzen (sei es Killer oder Überlebender) und auch die Map kann man sich aussuchen :) \n\nIm \"öffentlichen Spiel\" bekommt man Blutpunkte die man auf den Killer oder auf einen Überlebenden verwenden kann (updatesystem) so schaltet man perks frei und bekommt auch Items (nur beim Überlebender) die man in die Runden mitnehmen kann was manchmal sehr nützlich sein kann^^\n\nSo das ist eigentlich das Spielprinzip und noch ein paar Pro und Kontras!\n\nPro:\n-> Kann mit freunden gespielt werden\n-> Rundenbasiert\n-> Auch nach mehreren Stunden spielbar\n-> Viele Überlebende\n-> Viele coole Killer\n\nKontra:\n-> Paar blöde Bugs\n-> Meisten Überlebende/Killer nur als DLC verfügbar\n-> Facecamping/camping vom Killer, so das ein Retten vom Haken unmöglich ist\n-> Neuer Killer viel zu OP\n-> Viel zu viele Hacker\n\nIch würde das Game zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht mehr empfehlen.\nVorwarnung: Es gibt sehr viele Camper (zwar nicht alle) also wie schon gesagt ohne ein \"dickes Fell\" oder \"viel Geduld\" wird euch das Spiel nach 5 Runden kein Fun mehr machen... \n\nSo zum neuen Killer muss ich auch mal was los werden, \"Liebe Entwickler, wenn ihr das Game noch länger am laufen lassen wollt und es auch noch verkaufen wollt, ein gut gemeinter Tipp: Nerft Freddy Krüger, er ist mit seinen Perks viel zu OP\". Ich weiß das einige denken \"Hör auf zu heulen\" oder \"es ist nur ein Game\" aber wenn man 5 Runden gegen ihn gespielt hat, sehnt man sich zurück zum Trapper :D  Und ich spiele das Game sehr gerne und macht auch immernoch Bock, allerdings wenn ich denk Killer dann rausbekomme das es der Killer ist möchte man echt das Game schon Quitten... also aus meiner sicht Kein Rang 1 mehr für überlebende (die team orientiert sind), die sich dann als \"arsch\" verhalten und nur an sich denken kriegen das vllt hin.  Also bei dem Killer braucht man nerven aus Stahl!!! \n\nHoffe euch konnte der Review etwas helfen :)","timestamp_created":1509217641,"timestamp_updated":1516649562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36087341","author":{"steamid":"76561198205180192","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":38710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19890,"last_played":1648068791},"language":"english","review":"the devs don't really care about fixing the main problems of this game and the fanbase is utterly toxic and garbage (most of it), the game had and still has its ups and downs but mostly downs as time went by","timestamp_created":1509217367,"timestamp_updated":1627315819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36087263","author":{"steamid":"76561197994431753","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1518949182},"language":"koreana","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1509217156,"timestamp_updated":1509217156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508130073547363281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36087210","author":{"steamid":"76561198377983507","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":47161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21604,"last_played":1626875329},"language":"german","review":"so nach über 300 Stunden mal mein Senf dazu :\n\nZu Anfang hats noch Spaß gemacht mit und ohne Freunde zu Spielen.\nMitlerweile jedoch muß ich echt sagen das ist einfach nur noch ein Spiel für Leute die gerne andere Killen wollen. \n\nDas gesmmte Spiel wimmelt nur noch so von extremen Face - Campern , und Leute die ein so lange Tunneln und Campen bis man freiwillig aufgibt und stirbt , oder man Disconected. \nUnd oh Wunder das kommt immer öffter vor das in den Überlebensrunden auf einmal 2-3 fehlen weil sie einfach rausgehen dann.

  Dead by Daylight is a very well balanced, horror game that doesn't rely on jumpscares. I was afraid that after maybe 20 hours or so the gameplay would get stale, but it hasn't. There are a multitude of features in the game that do a good job of keeping it fresh. Each Killer/Survivor has their own \"Bloodweb\", which is essentially the way you level up each character. You accumulate Blood Points by playing the game. The Bloodweb for each progressing level is procedurally generated, meaning even if you prestige a character by hitting level 50, that character's Bloodweb progression will be completely different than before. The perk system allows you to tailor exactly how you want to play, and each character has three unique perks.\n\n   While DBD is a great game, it is not perfect. There have been balancing issues in the past upon release of new Killers, Survivors, and/or maps, but the devs have done a good job of addressing them, at least since I've started playing. The latest Killer, Freddy Krueger, is quite overpowered right now, but I would imagine he may have some nerfs coming his way in the future.\n\n   All in all, I'd give Dead by Daylight a 9/10. I was originally torn between purchasing Friday the 13th or DBD, but the price difference was the main tipping point for me, with DBD being half the price of Friday the 13th. I feel from the two choices, I made the better one.

Just a sidenote: I own this game for almost a year and played significant number of hours as a survivor main, so I guess I can be a rightful critic.\nI regret to say that I [b]DO NOT[/b] recommend this game because of 2 main reasons.\n[olist]\n    [*]The new killer is [b]blatantly[/b] unbalanced and it's not me being a pussy. I am pretty good at adapting to various unfavorable conditions like Bear Grills but Freddy goes far and beyond everything. His abilities cannot be countered in any way. He is completely invisible which makes The Wraith a mere joke. However, you can spot his footsteps in the grass, but let's be honest - they are still barely visible and 90% of the cases you are busy with other stuff such as repairing the gens which are often located behind walls/inside buildings. He can see you whenever you are outside of his terror radius if you are asleep which mocks the whole concept of stealth gameplay and hiding. Speaking of sleeping, it is also hard to wake yourself up: you either need a friend who will (oh my God) clap his hands like a cheerleader instead of giving you one big healthy bitch slap OR failing a skillcheck. People do not often play SWF, so finding a teammate can be tricky. Oh and btw, you will probably have to go out of his terror radius to find one. Y'all know what happens next. Another way to wake up is to fail a skillcheck, a gen or self-healing works just right. Do I have to say that doing this will give away your position to a killer with a bright spotlight? You also fall asleep way too easy. Why don't make the killer focus some sort of a crosshair on a survivior for X seconds? Once in the dream world, all you gotta do is pallet looping.  Some salty killers expect you to sprint away ignoring any windows/pallets [strike]because they suck at this game and mind gaming is a rocket science for them[/strike], so pallet looping can also get you facecamped to death. Good job, BHVR. As I said before, you cannot counter his abilities. None of Laurie's perks seem to be working neither in reality nor in the dream world (according to the Reddit thread). TL;DR - you are hopeless. I gave this killer a benefit of the doubt and assumed that the problem is in me. But the overwhelming amount of negative feedback and other shit on literally every social platform kind of says that Freddy is OP, not in a good way. You can even see the Steam notification on the product page saying that there are suspiciously a lot of reviews from 26th to 28th of October. The graph also shows a peak of negative feedback. Y'all connect the dots, right?\n    [*]Another thing is absolute ignorance of the devs. Instead of fixing a whole lot of bugs, they put their efforts into creating another P2W killer. One of the major issues seems to be a massive loss of progress. I personally experienced that 2-3 weeks ago (note that I've been playing DBD for a year) and STILL do not have my BP back regardless of the reports. My buddy lost his progress twice in a span of what...2 weeks? If this does not change, WinRAR will be a much better purchase than this game.\n[/olist]\nTo sum it all up, I think I would have to boycott the game until they nerf Freddy or publicly announce anything related to fixing him. It is fantastic how you can fuck up the whole game, set the community on fire and turn them against you without double checking the killer. Well done,
