I enjoy playing with my friends and my sister. If you enjoy horror and want friends to join in on the fun of being chased by serial killers, ghosts, and supernatural beings then this is a great game. If you enjoy adrenaline or surviving hardships with a team, it would be great to pick this game up and play as a survivor. And if you want to chase poor people around and enjoy being a killer or torturing people in games, then you should def pick this game up for the killers. You can also play both! So i highly recommend, great game and worth the hype it's got. Will continue playing and hopefully i see you there.

Very fun. Every match is different. Different map, different killer, different perks. The formula is the same, but otherwise you don't know what to expect until you get it, and that's a huge part of the experience for me. The community is full of dicks, people can get offended easily. Play a good killer match or be a survivor that's trying to improve in chases and you get cursed out by someone who might have misunderstood you. \n\nThat's every game though right? Despite that, it's well worth the experience. More fun with friends for sure. Survivors are team work heavy. Relying on randoms when you don't know each other's whereabouts and perks is difficult, especially now that there's cross platform and you can't really message pregame when the lobby is mixed. \n\nSpeaking of mixed, matchmaking is still pretty hit and miss. When it comes to it improving the last few months, people agree to disagree on that. I've noticed quicker games, and quality of teammates I can't really say. I originally played this on xbox for three years until I made the switch to PC very recently, and I've always had a range of good experienced team players and cruddy ones that don't know what they're doing half the time. \n\nIt's stressful and graphic, so if you don't like either of those then don't play it. The title speaks for itself. You're going to get jumpscared and startled and frustrated. As a killer, I believe the stress is amplified since there's more things to keep track of and that you're responsible for. The devs like adding new features and constantly change the game, but sometimes they don't necessarily listen to their community and will blame the lag based on their servers and not fully optimized game on their community's internet (as quoted from a developer live stream I heard once). They're interactive but often break their own mechanics. Nothing's been destroyed in my opinion, but expect changes you won't agree with pretty frequently.","timestamp_created":1601248667,"timestamp_updated":1601411203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76684992","author":{"steamid":"76561198424630433","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":63974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63478,"last_played":1604238371},"language":"russian","review":"Четкая

I've played the the game off and on for a few years, and have experienced what this game has to offers. All the gameplay mechanics allow for the killer to win. For example, not only do you have to fix the generators, but you also have to worry about that killers ability. Freddy and the dream world, The Pig and her traps. The hatch (that opens if you're that last one alive) can be closed by the killer. So, even though you've survived long enough they make you still have to fight your way out.  \n\n  Then there's the chase. As a survivor, while in chase you have a 2 options. Drop a pallet on the killer or get lucky by having them loose you. The killers are faster than you, you have NO way of fighting back, And half of the killers can 1 tap you. When in chase you can drop pallets or vault. The only 2 things you can do to try to out maneuver them. However, with a combination of bad server desync and this horrible snap mechanic the killer winds 75% of chases.\n\n  For example, when I'm being chased by the killer and I got to vault over a window, the character dose not smoothly transition into jumping the window. Instead, they will snap onto the window to line up the character thus loosing and speed or momentum. After you vault the killer can still reach over the object and get their hit off. When jumping down a 2 story building the killer can be at the top and still hit you as you are falling halfway down. \n\n  I could add more, but I'll leave it there. I understand the argument is that killers aren't easy to play, but I'm pretty sure if you stack a killer with 10h under their belt against survivors with 10h, the killer will win. same with comparing at 20h, 30h, ect.

(camping, tunneling, slugging, etc) (survivors badmouthing, and throwing.)\n\n2. the update was what we needed later not now, the bugs needed to be fixed. instead of improving the game, it added more bugs into it than fixing it. some mechanics of the game are still broken and lagging, all the update did is added more lag and bugs. (if its just me then im sorry, but if others are having same issues then i feel ur pain)\n\n3. its slowly starting to lose its touch. you get the fun and thrill when u first play it, but it gets to a point where its just a game where its no fun. just running around, fixing generators, and getting targeted by the killer 24/7. the fun came and went quick.\n\n4. survivors have to deal with hand gestures and no way of communicating with them. ur stuck trying to figure out what teammates are trying to do and it doesn't help unless your force to use discord to communicate with your friends not the other survivors. communication is key to success but its hard when u had to figure out what they are doing.\n\n5. the flashlight is easy to counter and weak to use. it was helpful but not a lot of people knows or even manage to use flashlight cause killers can dodge it or turn away from it. the perks u did give us to fight back was helpful but to others who don't have that option are forced to use a flashlight they don't know how to use.","timestamp_created":1601238671,"timestamp_updated":1601238671,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493421077728271484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76678414","author":{"steamid":"76561198012364394","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":16446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5385,"last_played":1626715011},"language":"english","review":"really really fun until u run into a red rank 4stack or an ebony mori","timestamp_created":1601238505,"timestamp_updated":1601238505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76677993","author":{"steamid":"76561198310302968","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1625457268},"language":"brazilian","review":"até agora não tive problemas com a tal comunidade toxica \n\nmas eu joguei apenas 3 horas então...n posso dar meu veredito ainda\n\nmas recomendo o jogo pois achei bem divertido e tals","timestamp_created":1601237928,"timestamp_updated":1601237928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76677963","author":{"steamid":"76561198419184813","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1601351926},"language":"english","review":"scary af","timestamp_created":1601237885,"timestamp_updated":1601237885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76677876","author":{"steamid":"76561198298143637","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":24850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18911,"last_played":1657662222},"language":"russian","review":"Насади на кукан своих близких, 10 кемперов из 10","timestamp_created":1601237781,"timestamp_updated":1601237781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76677802","author":{"steamid":"76561197978943561","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":59657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2218,"last_played":1655051979},"language":"english","review":"[h1]A full priced game with a F2P/P2W model[/h1]\n\nSo I'll just start this off by saying that I'm one of the [u]4.0%[/u] of players who have unlocked the [u]Rank 1 killer achievement[/u] at the time of re-writing this review.\n\nDo not buy this game.

It's a get-on sale game at best, but at the same time, I think it might be THE game in it's genre to get at this point in time. Crossplay made sure of that. \n\nIt's a game of cat and mouse where 4 people face off against a single person. The four people playing on the same team control \"survivors\", who (after hundrers and hundreds of hours of grinding) will be nothing but interchangeable skins, but at the start will have unique boons to them.\n\nThe single player against this fearsome foursome will be playing a killer, either someone you might know from another IP such as Ghostface from Scream of Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre or a killer unique to this game. Each killer has a unique way of causing mayhem and again, grindable perks.\n\nThe survivors can't really communicate, unless you group up on discord or something, and try to power up generators. Doing this requires quick-time events. Hell, half of the things you do as a survivor are quick-times. There is very little mechanical skill here. You will also be running away from the killer, juking him, pissing him off with a flashlight to the face or dropping pallets on his dome. You can't kill him, but you can make him wish that he was dead. \n\nThe Killers are a varied bunch, ranging from psychos with chainsaws to ancient mummies that spew poison and plague to killer clowns. They aren't entirely balanced, and some require prodigous amounts of grind to actually be good and cover their weaknesses. They are fun to play however. \n\nBUT!!!!\nThe base game is extremely barebones and has very little variety in killers or survivors. They are all powerfull and give you great perks, but they aren't that varied, compared to the full experience. So be prerpared to grind. A lot.\nWay too much.\n\nSee, I feel like this game doesn't respect my time whatsoever. It's fun, sure. It's frustrating, sure. But it's absolutely insane in the way the grind is set out. To get perks out of a character, you need to level them up to level 30, 35 or 40 out of 50. This requires in-game experience points (blood points) that you spend to unlock perks, gear and whatever. And the amounts are pretty fucking dumb. The first few levels might be 10'000-15´000, which is attainable in a single match. Further levels might range from 30´000-50´000 points. All in all, it's around a MILLION points for a single character to unlock their perks for others.\n\nAnd then they might spawn in a random level up grid.\n\nAnd you need to grind points to get them.\n\nI'd love to play some fun and zany builds, but I have to play SO FUCKING MUCH of bog-standard, lame and even bad builds before I can get to the fun stuff. Like THOUSANDS of hours. The Archive (seasonal pass or whatever that shit every game nowdays has) alleviates this and actually provides some alternatives focus points for the player in the form of challenges, and the free version is kinda nice too.\n\nAnd I really don't think I like this game that much.\n\nOh yeah, the matchmaking is ass, the cosmetics are super expensive, there's a ragequitter in every other game, the balance is wonky at best (solo survivor is doable but ultimately unfun, so play with friends).\n\nAnd \"Survive With Friends\" that allows for comms is ass.","timestamp_created":1601227200,"timestamp_updated":1602707221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76668952","author":{"steamid":"76561198023913125","num_games_owned":393,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1601226756},"language":"english","review":"If you're expecting to just jump in and play be warned, you should probably invest time in learning the perks etc. Might have been more accessible to new players when it launched but not so much now.

Como superviviente, te unes a un equipo de 4 donde debes esconderte de un asesino y activar 5 generadores para poder escapar mientras muestras tus capacidades de supervivencia, trabajo en equipo y agilidad. Mientras que el asesino debe evitar esto y darle caza a los supervivientes para \"sacrificarlos\". Desde la perspectiva del asesino, debes mostrar velocidad, intimidación y estrategia para eliminar a los 4 supervivientes antes que escapen. Ambas partes tienen sus diversas habilidades que pueden darte una mínima ventaja sobre el otro para cumplir con tus objetivos.\n\nSin duda, el juego es perfecto para jugar ya sea solo o con amigos, posee una gran comunidad y un buen soporte recibiendo actualizaciones y nuevo contenido como nuevos mapas, supervivientes y/o asesinos originales o licenciados, muchos de ellos son de películas del genero de terror (si te gustan ese tipo de películas, el juego es perfecto en esencia para ti). También posee un muy buen balance entre supervivientes y asesinos, y aunque tenga algún que otro problema de equilibrio, el juego siempre busca solucionarlo. Mas que nada, depende de tus habilidades y experiencia in-game para ganar.\n\nPor supuesto, el juego posee puntos negativos, aunque el mayor problema de todos actualmente es su comunidad toxica. En sus inicios el juego era enormemente toxico y era común una discusión al final de la partida. Aunque poco a poco se a intentado solucionarlo, aun las actitudes toxicas continúan en el juego, reflejándose especialmente in-game. Por lo demás, diría que es muy escaso. Hay muy pocos bugs visibles o que afecten la jugabilidad y tampoco me llegue a encontrar con algún cheater hasta ahora. Pero honestamente ninguno de sus puntos negativos son relevantes de momento. Por lo que recomiendo el juego sin duda si te gusta la supervivencia, cooperación y cazar jugadores.\n\nDado a que este juego es muy jugado en mi grupo, me gustaría invitarlos a mi [url=https://discord.com/invite/JpH24gV8DH] servidor de discord[/url] para organizar partidas de Dead by Daylight.

- игра неоднозначная, некоторые ее любят, некоторые ненавидят, остальные ненавидят, но продолжают играть. являющаяся практически единственной достойной в своем жанре и не имеющей альтернативы, она заставляет мириться с многими недостатками.\n\nесли вы решили встали на путь маньяка, нужно знать: эта игра требует определенных навыков и приличное количество часов на их освоение. но даже это не гарантирует вам победы на высоких рангах, ведь хорошая тима с дискордом вас просто переиграет и уничтожит.\nзато вы научитесь контролировать ситуацию и предсказывать действия соперников, приобретете хладнокровие и станете [strike] машиной для убийств [/strike]  непоколебимым человеком, имеющим иммунитет к токсикам. плюс, так как разработчики часто нерфят/бафают различные механики игры, то это научит вас адаптироваться к чему-угодно :)\n\nза сурвов весело играть с друзьями. данная сторона тоже требует определенных скиллов - умения мАнСиТь например, ну и как минимум знать особенности маньяков, и, вследствие, осуществлять контрмеры против них. в соло (опять же на высоких рангах) играть сложновато.\n\nесли устали от игры и от токсиков и хотите разрядки, откладывайте мета-перки, берите фановые билды (например на подвального буббу или стелс-клодеттку) и наслаждайтесь процессом горения у соперников. также разнообразить однообразный процесс поимки сурвов/починки генераторов помогут челленджи™\n\nперсонажи в игре довольно колоритные и интересные, каждый со своим прописанным лором. для фанатов классических и не только хорроров есть (вау!) лицензионные персонажи. возможностей для фанатского творчества более чем достаточно.\n\nчто радует, так это то, что разработчики не забрасывают игру и занимаются обновлениями (даже если это заключается в починке одних багов, и появлении других). вот, например, они графику недавно обновили, главу выпустили, живем.\n\nв общем и целом, дбд - это затягивающее болото, но болото интересное, я тут всю жизнь живу и всем советую.","timestamp_created":1601222059,"timestamp_updated":1601222099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616619348526000977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76664454","author":{"steamid":"76561199070890930","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":27236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6075,"last_played":1653301996},"language":"schinese","review":"玩一局两局就出现无网络连接
