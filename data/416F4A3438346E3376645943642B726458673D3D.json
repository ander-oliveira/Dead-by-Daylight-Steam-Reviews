Altough the game is a bit stressful from the Killer PoV it offers a great ammount of satisfaction in return so it balances out. When it comes to survivor, it's all about getting away with what you're doing and if you're playing with your friends you can certainly have a blast while doing it. It is true the game has its issues here and there, they are MINOR compared to how much fun it is. I'm a rank 1 survivor and a decent killer so I think my opinion has some experience behind it. Don't listen to all these reviews that complain about the survivor / killer being too fast or the game being impossible from a certain point of view, it's not accurate. The killer is very strong and a very strong killer will always get a lot of points. Kills don't matter in this game, their only purpose is to boost the ego of the killer. Statistics of this game show that only a few percentage of the games played result in 4 kills for the killer or 4 survivors escaping, it is rare. Most games just end with 1, 2 or even 3 survivors dying or ecaping, it all depends how good your teamwork is and how much you know about the game. If you'll ever buy the game and decide to play survivor you will need to be pacient. The survivor is the hardest to rank up with at the beginning of the game but gets a bit easier once you get the hang of it and you become able to recognise opportunities. On the other hand the killer is the easiest at the beginning of the game but it gets harder once you encounter higher level survivors. I hope my review helps you and if you ever need any more tips feel free to add me and I will respond. The game is very good and I recommend it whole heartedly.","timestamp_created":1471010961,"timestamp_updated":1471010961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561451494693756104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24842672","author":{"steamid":"76561198064577317","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":21590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":236,"playtime_at_review":5707,"last_played":1660394053},"language":"french","review":"Le jeux est grave bon, on s'amuse de ouf dessus avec des amis et même sans (si jamais vous en avez pas on pense à vous :sisi:), malgré des bugs à la con par-ci par-là le jeux reste quand même excellent et je trouve que récemment les dévelopeurs ont réussi à créer un vrai équilibrage entre les survivants et les monstres.

Mas vc vai perceber que mais do que esses objetivos, você tem que fazer BLOODPOINTS, que você obtém realizando específicas ações dentro da partida, como fazer os geradores, sabotar ganchos, curar os coleguinhas, etc. Com bloodpoints vc evolui seus personagens e sobe de ranking. Essa é a principal ideia dentro do jogo, e a ideia de evolução é o que te faz querer continuar jogando. Portanto, entenda que é um jogo MULTIPLAYER e, de certa forma, \"repetitivo\", por falta de um termo melhor. \n\nPontos positivos:\n-O jogo cumpre a tarefa de te deixar tenso durante as partidas (se você for um novato);\n-Sistema de lvl(bloodweb) diferente e divertido;\n-Jogo em que você se diverte tanto jogando com amigos quanto solo;\n-Visuais legais;\n-Vai te render muitas horas de jogo (se você curte esse estilo de jogo e não se importar tanto com os problemas do jogo);\n\nPontos negativos: \n-Bugs;\n-Muito fácil subir de rank, o que o faz meio desnecessário;\n-Alguns perks melhores do que outros (sprint burst, barbecue and chili, self care etc), o que de certa forma te obriga a escolhê-los;\n-Comunidade tóxica (desentendimento entre \"survivor mains\" e \"killer mains\")\n-Balanceamento: jogo muito difícil de balancear, devido ao fato de ser assimétrico (4x1), o que gera muitas reclamações vindas dos dois lados, tanto killer mains quanto survivor mains. Ex: Alguns perks melhores do que outros (sprint burst, barbecue and chili, self care etc), o que de certa forma te obriga a escolhê-los; certos killers (personagens) são mais fracos que outros, o que torna a vida do jogador bem complicada; etc.\n\nApesar de tantos pontos negativos, eu recomendo que você tente se estiver realmente interessado nesse estilo de jogo, afinal, não é a toa que o jogo mantém uma boa quantidade de jogadores. Como no quesito de balanceamento, você vai se frustrar bastante, mas tente não reclamar muito no começo, pois sendo um novato não vai entender tanto do jogo e pode acabar reclamando ou dando sujestões idiotas.\n\nDeixo minha nota final 7/10.","timestamp_created":1470971762,"timestamp_updated":1532125111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24835992","author":{"steamid":"76561198089444177","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":114460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":103,"playtime_at_review":16819,"last_played":1659581905},"language":"english","review":"great game! keep up the good work devs! 278 hours and no plans of slowing down anytime soon :D","timestamp_created":1470971604,"timestamp_updated":1470971604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439162194728851318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24835568","author":{"steamid":"76561198103513467","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":139750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6655,"last_played":1637723978},"language":"russian","review":"Пока не почините баланс. ибо попадать на 13-14 ранге против красных рангов невозможно играть!","timestamp_created":1470968323,"timestamp_updated":1622812693,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24835469","author":{"steamid":"76561198302626420","num_games_owned":803,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":73889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47498,"last_played":1498731846},"language":"english","review":"为什么要回到这个没有快乐的游戏？为什么要这样折磨自己？你的快乐永远都是建立在对方的痛苦之上。报复社会吗？开挂封，刷血点封，改成就封，拔线也封，你他妈什么都封，有本事把游戏做好杜绝根本问题好吗？有人走捷径我他妈为什么不走，傻逼吗？这就是封的理由？游戏环境极差，这个游戏根本不可能有新人，因为每把进去必定秒死，玩的时间越长越是折磨，因为你改变不了你的队友。载入也跟看PPT一样，越更新BUG越多，也是牛逼。开个加速器100ms，还不如像以前一样屠夫主机不好么？服务器搞你麻痹啊。游戏机要钱，游戏要钱，DLC要钱，衣服要钱，加速器要钱，键鼠转换器要钱，联机会员要钱，匹配时间长电费还要钱。时隔3、4年重新评价，是因为我傻逼又去买了个主机版的玩，真的高血压游戏，草你吗，只想把制作组全家杀光，制作组全家女性强暴奸杀。不说了，我我得去销毁steam帐号了","timestamp_created":1470967737,"timestamp_updated":1616855922,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495098024606704712","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24835268","author":{"steamid":"76561198212490484","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5726,"last_played":1630256720},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game can play for hours on end!","timestamp_created":1470966552,"timestamp_updated":1470966552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487152010202407837","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24835069","author":{"steamid":"76561198013079681","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":21471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1633027829},"language":"english","review":"Camping = You're bad\n\nIt's a completely legit strategy, but realizing that killers that camp stay at level 20 for a reason.","timestamp_created":1470965229,"timestamp_updated":1622940489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528052687644958496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24835029","author":{"steamid":"76561198031848399","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1720,"last_played":1538102511},"language":"english","review":"Really enjoying this game...
