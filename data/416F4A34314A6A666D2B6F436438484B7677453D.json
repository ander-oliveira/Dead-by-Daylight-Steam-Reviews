The mechanics seem solid although there are some killers that are more annoying to play against than others. one complaint that i have is it seems to take a really long time to get into a game as the killer because the survivors have to connect to your lobby and then the game can star. there is a bug right now where it will only let 3 out of 4 survivors join the lobby. i think that playing as a survivor is a lot more fun than playing killer but that is just my opinion. if you are like me and mainly play shooters than give this game a try because i found it to be a nice change of pace.","timestamp_created":1555824742,"timestamp_updated":1555824742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50243919","author":{"steamid":"76561198358240555","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":152607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2168,"playtime_at_review":21415,"last_played":1660592945},"language":"schinese","review":"前天打了2把8W血点卡加载，再进的时候没了。昨天把黑妹从42升到45，晚上看的时候又没了。ok,fine.   然后打了到凌晨升到48，现在一看42.

In fact, the core game, whether you are playing survivor or killer, is so much fun when it works that it's worth a shot despite its myriad of issues. I have found myself addicted to playing DBD certain nights, with the fabled \"one more game\" pulling me back in when I should be in bed. As such, the good first:\n\n*Large variety of killers. If you wish to play the \"one\" in the 4v1 gameplay, you will definitely find at least a couple of characters that are enjoyable to play. Behavior has done a good job adding new killers to the game throughout its life.\n*Survivor gameplay is simple, but fun. It's easy to grasp your objective (fix generators, escape, help teammates, etc.). But learning how to loop the killer in chases is when the survivor meta becomes intense. \n*Consistently updated. This is a double edged sword (see below), but the developers are active in updating the game, so there is a slew of steady content every few months. And the DLC is, in my opinion, mostly reasonably priced.\n*Far superior to console. Duh, but after playing killer on PS4, KB+M controls and 60 FPS are a godsend. In fact, the Steam version makes the console look unplayable by comparison.\n*Playing with friends is a lot of fun, though it can obviously be abused. \n\nNow, the bad and these may be enough to turn off a potential purchase:\n\n*Bugs. The game has consistently had bugs since its release. Remember those updates I talked about? Like clockwork, a new bug or two will follow any content addition. These range from gameplay to matchmaking to stability. It runs the gamut. The community has pleaded with Behavior to take some time to fix the issues with the game, but they have yet to do so. They fix one, another replaces it.\n*The ranking system is worthless. You earn \"pips\" by doing well in certain actions throughout the game, but you don't gain anything for going up in rank. The rank resets on the 13th of every month, so there's no reason for them to not give some kind of reward at the end of the season. Also, a recent update made pipping extremely difficult at certain ranks, so if you are good enough to get to red ranks, good luck finding a game.\n*Toxic community. This is primarily on the survivor side, but there are some extremely awful people who play this game. If you play killer, expect teabags, early disconnects, being accused of \"tunneling\" and \"camping\" at every turn, and holding games hostage. I often encounter survivors who complain even when they win! Killers are not immune to toxicity either, but there are many more survivor players than killers and they are some of the whiniest gamers I have ever come across. I have played both sides extensively, so I am not biased towards either.\n*Though there are a wide variety of killers to play, they are not very balanced. Behavior has improved this overtime and it's much better than it was a year ago, but it's still not where it needs to be. \n\nThose are some serious cons, but they haven't yet stopped Dead by Daylight from being one of the most fun multiplayer games I have ever played. The fact that I have bought it twice speaks volumes, as I am not the kind of person who typically does that. Just be willing to overlook some big issues before you take the plunge.","timestamp_created":1555804065,"timestamp_updated":1555817749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487288117408752441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50240426","author":{"steamid":"76561198153626019","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1624209055},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра!","timestamp_created":1555797214,"timestamp_updated":1555797214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50240153","author":{"steamid":"76561198090362929","num_games_owned":1463,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":37740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11122,"last_played":1659333818},"language":"english","review":"The game is buggy as hell, and everyone with less than 1,000 hours is complete garbage, this I can attest to, I'm really bad.

Короче в этот период я больше всего горел и желал скорее прокачать фулл перса, хочу пояснить что фулл перса с третьим престижем+50 и со всеми игровыми перками я закончил примерно через 280 часов, то есть получилось 680 часов. И да, я не только одного перса качал, чтобы вы поняли мне пришлось открыть сначала на других сурвах их мейн перки, а это 40 левелов каждому)0), также я качал манов, естественно качать манов до престижей я не стал, ибо мне кажется что это скучно, на сурвах ты можешь покрасоваться перед тимой, -Вот, смотрите, я фулл престиж+50, и все такое, а ману это совсем не интересно.\n   К чему я сейчас все это пишу, игра сильно затяжная, бладпоинтов дают мало, а если ты наконец добьешься своей цели в прокачке, как я например, то станет совсем не интересно, каждая катка становится до ужаса скучной, либо ты бегаешь пол матча от мана и изи сбегаешь, либо тебя на изи насаживают на кукан, тут другого не дано. \n   Признаться честно, пишу я это в порыве гнева, ибо я очередной раз сгорел на эту игру, пояснять почему я сгорел не буду, думаю это совсем никому не интересно, т.к в дбд это обычное дело, когда ожидаешь от игры какого-то развлекательного контента, но вместо этого игра портит тебе настроение. Сейчас в игре меня держат только разрывы, это что-то похожее на ритуалы, + за них дают фрагменты, которые в свою очередь открывают небольшие пояснения в сюжете, а также ввели новые шмотки, вроде как брелки(ну я их так называю). У сурвов они находятся на поясе сзади, а у манов висят на крюках. \n   Хочу наконец подвести итог, эта игра успела мне сильно надоесть, хотя играю я в нее пару раз в неделю, по несколько матчей за раз(примерно 3-5), после я сильно устаю от этой игры. По моему мнению эта игра уже скоро не сможет удерживать аудиторию, ибо контент гнилой, и в большинстве случаев после каждого матча одна сторона недовольна поражением. Лично мне всегда было неприятно только из за того что я потерял свои 5к очков, а ведь это совсем ничего по сравнению с затратами на прокачку сурвов и манов. Под конец напишу, что игра неприятная, долго в нее играть не стоит, мало кто захочет терпеть такой контент, наверное только мазохистам понравится играть в такое, однако если вы все равно испытываете интерес к этой игре, то лучше посмотрите геймплей на ютабе, особенно стримы, там вам покажут наглядный пример шандеца этой игры, лично я рекомендую Гришу, все на этом.","timestamp_created":1555751405,"timestamp_updated":1579705190,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50229110","author":{"steamid":"76561198740809072","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":47843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16751,"last_played":1637475119},"language":"english","review":"Fun game but the servers blow.

I was really rude to him before I knew he was a part of the dev team (He eventually proved it), but he took it like a champ and answered all of my questions that he was allowed to answer. He patiently sat there with me for like 15-20 minutes and showed to me that not everyone at Behaviour is all bad, and that they truly listen to their players. When you include the recent changes to ds, end game and farm maps, you can tell that this company is doing their best to put their past behind them and listen to it's players.\n\nThis game is my lover, but I've never had a rockier relationship in my life.... (I play killer and survivor)\n\nLet me start off by saying that the format of this game is great. I love the challenge, the skill caps, the techniques methods and customization. The game gives you something to grind for without making it feel completely necessary, and rewards you for smart play (in most situations). The mechanics at play feel good, and intuitive (apart from the occasional questionable hit or medium vault), and everything is so very rewarding. I love to sink in an hour or 2 of this game every day that I have free time (and sometimes go on multi-hour grinds just for fun).\n\nBut this game isn't all rainbows and sunshine. The game has problems deep down in its core, starting even with the development team. The game has had problems, from the release date, due to the small team having strongly differing opinions on how they want the game to go. There seems to be some sort of communication breakdown, and no one is on the same page. This has been proven multiple times by public postings from developers that COMPLETELY contradict popular opinion and even other developer's opinions. This game can go through multiple design changes in a very short time. \n\nSecondly, the team does not listen to the public, including on reports and toxic players. I have never seen a player receive a ban in this game for toxicity, bug abuse or exploiting. Recently, the developers expressed their desire to get rid of 2 game breaking bugs, but there has been almost no communications prior to this one on the problem. I have a tendency to save the profile of the person who does things like 1. body blocking as killer, 2. purposefully sandbagging as survivor and 3. dcing multiple games (smaller community, you see the same names from time to time), and have never seen any action taken against them. Its frustrating. I can't tell you the last day that I had no dcs in this game (and most days have multiple for any kind of reason). The community sees it as a joke or meme and I just see it as a waste of time.\n\nOn the terms of games ruined due to dc, there has been a bug in game for almost a month now that force-dcs and crashes games in load, causing an EXCEPTIONAL amount of disproportionate games where a survivor or 2 didnt load in. These games are effectively unplayable at this point due to game balance. I have had this happen to me EVERY DAY since this bug started, and I have to force close the game, take the derank for \"disconnectiing\" and lose my add-ons. \n\nAlso, if the killer dcs or all the players dc, then you are effectively fucked. The game morte often than not will derank you for not doing enough besides the fact that you weren't aloud, you lose your addon (imagine losing the rare and coveted double point addons), and you are expected to be excited about your rank. \n\nFurthermore, The community is extremely toxic. The game revolves around unfun techniques (camping and tunneling and hook rushing, broken mechanics (there is a killer in the game that legitimately has no counter play in a chase that, if i get in my game, has resulted in at least 1 person dcing 90% of the time), and tbagging. When these mechanics are talked about, we are either given a \"so waht, its a technique\" from the devs or a bs \"Nerf\" to the technique that doesn't fix anything. This game would benefit from player polls.\n\nFinally, killers host the game. While they are getting rid of this in 2 months, that means this game has had 3 years of killers lag switching, playing with horrible ping (do you like rubberbanding?) and being hit in situations where you should be safe, but you lagged so hard that the killer got the hit. It's not usually their fault in the last situation, because on their screen everything is correct, but on ours all it looks like is you got hit by something a mile away. Its not fun. Gladly they are fixing this one, but if you want to play this game be patient with the HORRIBLE hosting system.\n\nHopefully this gives you a good representation of this game. Baseline, its fun, and for its priceline, its a great pickup. I just wish a different developer had gotten their hands on this game, because these devs just aren't coordinated enough.\n\nTL:DR; buy it but know it has problems. Don't buy if you are prone to rage.
