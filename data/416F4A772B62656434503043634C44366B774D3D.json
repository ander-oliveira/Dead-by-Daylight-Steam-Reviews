bums me more than anything to say that I do not recommend this game anymore.\n\nI have been playing since late 2017 on the Xbox, moved over to steam a few years later.\n\nWhile I love this game, and always will, the direction it has taken isn't healthy. To begin, a lot of people have found the newly added MMR system to be a bit draining and I happen to be one of those people. Your MMR is spread evenly among your survivors and each one of your killers has a unique MMR, but still have a baseline rating. That sounds great, but where the problem lies is how it tracks your rating. Survivors are tracked through how often they escape the trail and how long the match lasts. Killers are tracked on how many survivors are killed and how long the match lasts as well. This is heavily flawed, there is so much more to a round of Dead By Daylight than how many kills you achieved or if you escape or not. If MMR is the direction the team is going in, it should be reading the game as a whole, not just the end of the match. \n\nBehavior should take a step back from the big DLC releases to diagnose the health of their awesome game. What would help Dead By Daylight is a big bug fixing/balance changing patch. With each and every chapter being pushed, it feels as if the game takes one step forward and two steps back. While the state of the meta pushing more towards the new boon totems and anti-loop killers, why not give some light to everything else? Bring some low-performing killers into the spotlight, change gimmicky perks or optimize the performance of the game? Dead By Daylight would benefit hugely by a big patch. Get people excited about this game again!\n\nLastly, the community would love more transparency. Tell use your thoughts, Behavior, acknowledge us. We want what is best for the game and we hope you do too.\n\nI think it goes without saying that I am not finding this game fun anymore. Countless hours spent learning this complex game and leveling up my characters will forever be cherished, but I cannot play this game right now. I do hope Behavior takes a step back and outlines what they are going to do from this point. Dead By Daylight will never die, it has a monopoly in the asymmetric horror genre, but it is sure gonna lose some of its playerbase.","timestamp_created":1639628767,"timestamp_updated":1639628767,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537712931632995605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105903683","author":{"steamid":"76561199071270553","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1929,"last_played":1658330345},"language":"schinese","review":"跟朋友玩很有意思\n","timestamp_created":1639628477,"timestamp_updated":1639628477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105903651","author":{"steamid":"76561198162882416","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":15033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":409,"playtime_at_review":1399,"last_played":1660238890},"language":"english","review":"this game is fun but fuck Wraith","timestamp_created":1639628413,"timestamp_updated":1643571878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105903537","author":{"steamid":"76561198273766970","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":12237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3724,"last_played":1656585711},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, может затянуть на долго, стоит взять со скидкой, много контента.

I have played off and on for years now (only have 80 hours), and I can say without a doubt this game is a different kind of toxic. I have given up being a killer. I always get matched with top rank survivors with cross character skills. I cannot say for sure if they have comms, but it is endless loops, lots of trolling, and the inevitable bombardment of horrible comments in the post match lobby. Before you say the obvious, I KNOW. I need to get better. Only way to do that is by grinding and after getting matched with so many sweats who are itching to show what 7000 hours can do - I am not interested anymore. I play more survivor now. Still get matched with killers I have no business playing against but it is more bearable. Still get trolled, body blocked, and witness the toxic chat very frequently. Survivors working with the killer is definitely a buzz kill but what can you do? Reporting does pretty much nothing.\n\nI do think this game is very fun if used for private matches with friends. If you are new to the game you are too far behind. The matchmaking will be kind for a few games, but soon the door will be opened to show this game's true colors. Vicious cycle of unfair matchmaking, survivors trolling because of unfair killers, and killers trolling because of unfair survivors (from their previous games).\n\nThe current and upcoming DLC is cool. If you happen upon one of their big sales then I would recommend buying. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble. The try-hards and etc. probably do not agree with this but they are not the ones this is for (they just want more noobs to troll and hook lol).","timestamp_created":1639612362,"timestamp_updated":1639612362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105895067","author":{"steamid":"76561199130048676","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1658467401},"language":"english","review":"i love it","timestamp_created":1639612260,"timestamp_updated":1639612260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105895060","author":{"steamid":"76561198317391668","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5531,"last_played":1653375893},"language":"english","review":"if you want to torment yourself and or your friends play this game. :)","timestamp_created":1639612247,"timestamp_updated":1639612247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105894996","author":{"steamid":"76561199051408967","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":748,"last_played":1644283356},"language":"english","review":"I died 0/10","timestamp_created":1639612127,"timestamp_updated":1639612127,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105894882","author":{"steamid":"76561198346775059","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1654058081},"language":"english","review":"Pretty awesome game to play with some friends.
