If you have friends to play survivor with however, this is one of the most fun games you could play. But until matchmaking is fixed and killers get buffed as a whole (with the exceptions of Nurse and Spirit) I cannot recommend the game to people looking forward to a good experience as killer.","timestamp_created":1650947849,"timestamp_updated":1650947849,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494487524032592773","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114490092","author":{"steamid":"76561198957520203","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":9665,"last_played":1659875262},"language":"schinese","review":"我是傻逼","timestamp_created":1650946771,"timestamp_updated":1650946771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114489630","author":{"steamid":"76561198898141930","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1426,"last_played":1656722508},"language":"english","review":"A horror pvp game that can scare true veterans.\n10/10 great game","timestamp_created":1650945989,"timestamp_updated":1650945989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114489590","author":{"steamid":"76561198147292603","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":29097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28881,"last_played":1657235073},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta piola no lo compres","timestamp_created":1650945924,"timestamp_updated":1650945924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114489041","author":{"steamid":"76561199213397731","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2556,"last_played":1652652653},"language":"spanish","review":"juego de mierda arreglen los bugs con el deterioro y la enfermera","timestamp_created":1650944974,"timestamp_updated":1650944974,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114488344","author":{"steamid":"76561198372809329","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16000,"last_played":1651521855},"language":"russian","review":"лучшая игра, forever of the best","timestamp_created":1650943888,"timestamp_updated":1650943888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114488271","author":{"steamid":"76561199191676298","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":12639,"last_played":1659758052},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom, primeiramente vou falar um pouco das suas qualidades. Dead by Daylight é um jogo extremamente único, tendo uma mecânica que pelo menos me surpreendeu bastante, sendo uma inovação gigantesca trazendo uma junção de Filmes de Gênero Thriller dos Anos 80 com um sistema relativamente atualizado de game play. É simplesmente lindo ver como os poderes fluem no jogo, uma variação gigantesca de Assassinos, Poderes, Perks, etc.. (Como sou main Killer basicamente estou opinando em relação a isso, mas também jogo bastante de Survivor regularmente pra manter o equilíbrio e saber jogar contra eles também hehe).\nMas então, tirando essa parte bonita do jogo, tem a parte competitiva e o famoso \"MMR\". Após jogar por um tempo você provavelmente vai subir no MMR e se deparar com os mesmos tipos de Players, basicamente como se você estivesse jogando contra NPCs porém com uma certa toxicidade (não são todos) e uma certa imprevisibilidade (porque vários usam táticas que contra-dizem um pouco as mecânicas básicas do jogo), infelizmente após um tempo serão sempre as mesmas coisas. Como Survivor avançado você provavelmente vai jogar contra umas 200 Nurses, mais uns 150 Blights e mais umas 200 Spirits com basicamente perks semelhantes. Como Killer avançado você provavelmente **só vai jogar contra maluco usando Boon Totem de Cura, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable**, em fim... Basicamente por causa dessa competitividade e desequilíbrio de jogo, as pessoas acabam praticamente virando NPCs, usando literalmente praticamente sempre as mesmas coisas que concordam com a Meta de tempos em tempos.\nPorém... Simplesmente amo esse jogo, e acredito que justamente por ser um jogo tão bom as pessoas se deixam se levar tanto pelas Metas e etc... \nMas, em fim, recomendo comprar Dead by Daylight 100%, eu não me arrependo de ter comprado e inclusive comprei todas as DLCs de Killers, justamente por ser tão divertido e fluir tão lindamente. (E pra constar, provavelmente no futuro o jogo vá a ter grandes mudanças então muitos dos contras que eu listei aqui podem ser abolidos, como essa questão de sempre usarem as mesmas perks, uma meta louca, etc) De qualquer forma, obrigado por ter lido minha avaliação e espero ter ajudado caso você já tinha interesse em comprar mas ainda tinha dúvidas! Pode confiar, compra, é muito bom (tanto pra jogar sozinho quanto pra jogar com os amigos)","timestamp_created":1650943759,"timestamp_updated":1650943759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697356462478637695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114488172","author":{"steamid":"76561198864201111","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":30046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":70,"playtime_at_review":16478,"last_played":1660276295},"language":"english","review":"i refunded this game so i can buy food","timestamp_created":1650943600,"timestamp_updated":1650943600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114486742","author":{"steamid":"76561199095922428","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1660170910},"language":"brazilian","review":"legal","timestamp_created":1650941363,"timestamp_updated":1650941363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114485837","author":{"steamid":"76561198377299517","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":23,"playtime_at_review":10181,"last_played":1659795269},"language":"schinese","review":"我的意见是，加强屠夫。","timestamp_created":1650940065,"timestamp_updated":1650940065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114484859","author":{"steamid":"76561198050819292","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1653253275},"language":"english","review":"Super fun game to play with friends or solo.

21-го года, после внедрения \"SBMM\" системы игра за киллера превратилась в посмешище, киллер больше не несёт какой-либо угрозы и приобрела облик фестиваля токсичности выживших из-за ощущения абсолютной доминации, силы и безнаказанности на протяжении матча в связи с отсутствием какого-либо разумного баланса в игре для игроков высокого уровня навыков. Разработчики данной игры абсолютно не имеют понятия, что означает скилл - убийства/побеги? ЛОЛ Хорошая работа, ребята! Теперь генераторы чинятся в течении 5-ти минут, а про бесконечный хил я вообще молчу. Про игру за выжившего также стоит упомянуть, но кратко, игра превратилась в бенефис кемпинга/туннелинга и потеряла какой-либо фан. Вот результат работы разработчиков и вышеупомянутой системы за последний год, но главное, чтобы добавлялись новые скины и ивенты, это же приоритетней, просто ужас.....И вот, спустя 2.5к часов в игре, решил удалить данное творение, жаль, отличный концепт, но ужасный сервис. Категорически не рекомендую к покупке!\n.\n.\n.\nAugust 2021, the \"SBMM\" system implementation, the game for the killer turned into a laughing stock, the killer no longer poses any threat and acquired the toxicity shape festival of survivors due to the feeling of absolute dominance, power, and impunity throughout the match due to the absence any reasonable balance in the game for high skill level players. The developers of this game have absolutely no idea what the skill means - kills/escapes? LOL, Good job guys! Now, the generators are being repaired within 5 minutes, I don't even wanna talk about the endless heal. The survivor side is also worth mentioning, but briefly, the game has turned into a camping/tunneling campaign and has lost any fun. Here is the work result of the developers and the \"SBMM\" system over the past year, but the main thing is the new skins and events, of course, that's \"more important\", this is a \"priority\", awful.....And now, after 2.5k hours in the game, I decided to delete this creation, sad, excellent concept, but terrible service.

start this off, I have over 1500 hours on DBD on Xbox, before I made the move over to Steam, starting from scratch. I also play both killer and survivor. So where do I even begin with this?\n\n[h1]I think we did a pretty good job so far[/h1]\nFor me, the game in it's objective is the exact same as it was years ago when the game launched. The script has never been deviated from. What even is a win? Is getting hatch a win? Did you win if you ran the killer for 5 gens and your 3 teammates got out but you died? On the killer side is 3k a win if the 4th survivor gets hatch? No one knows and everyone interprets it differently. Even the devs can't give an answer and it's [b]THEIR[/b] game. When streamers do escape streaks or kill streaks, they have to outline what the rules are because the game doesn't differentiate.\n\nNotable updates and changes take so long to be implemented. This makes the game feel stale. How long did it take to fix keys? Moris? Both sides were given such powerful tools that they could use to make the other side's experience miserable and it took years for changes to be implemented. New maps have been so few and far between over the past couple of years. The graphical reworks are stunning, and the devs deserve tremendous credit for that, but ultimately the maps are the same with a new lick of paint, the novelty wears off after just a few games.\n\nSpeaking of things that never seem to change, the survivor meta has been the same for three, four years? Dead hard, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike are your staples with the only new introduction being Circle of Healing. A perk so strong that the devs are now struggling to balance it. The killer meta has changed, but the strongest perks have always been the ones that slow down gen progression. Unfortunately, as effective as these are, they make for an incredibly boring experience when playing survivor. Remember Forever Freddie? Yeah I try to forget too.\n\n[h1]MMR[/h1]\nNo one wants to play a game and get stomped on so playing with and against players at your skill level, particularly for newer players is great; in theory. The reality has been completely different, does anyone have a good word to say about MMR? The old ranking system was far from perfect but it felt more natural, and you could see ranks. The current visible ranking system is pretty much correlated with your playtime and doesn't mean anything; it only impacts on the number of bloodpoints you'll get at rank reset. The determining factor on who you are matched with comes from the SBMMR which is invisible to all players, so you never actually know what level you're at. Luckily there a few clear giveaways that you're at high MMR. If you're playing as survivor then you will most likely be playing against Nurses and Blights, with the odd Leatherface and Huntress thrown in. You will very rarely see any other killers. Why? Because the difference in power level with those listed above, particularly Nurse and Blight are far superior to every other killer who will get stomped at the highest level. A top level Nurse can probably down an entire team in around the same time it takes Trapper to gather and place his traps. Y'all remember when Nurse could Blink five times consecutively? Fun memories. As well as playing against the same killers every single game, you'll see a lot of sweaty strats. Everyone can play the game however they like, this isn't a criticism just an observation. At high MMR you will be camped, you will be tunnelled and yes, they most definitely have NOED. The main issue with NOED is that it contributes so heavily to kill rates which the devs are then seemingly use to make decisions on balancing. From the killer's perspective, what are they supposed to do? In my opinion, the survivor is the power role, not as a solo, but if the killer is facing a 4 man SWF at the highest level? You've probably already lost multiple gens in your first chase. At high MMR this will be your experience every other game. There is an absolute irony that you try so hard to \"win\" to increase a rank you can't even see, to make your in game experience more and more miserable with every success.\n\n[h1]Doing gens, you?[/h1]\n[b]The survivor experience.[/b] You'll be camped. You'll be tunnelled. If you do your objective too quickly then you'll be called a gen rusher which then means you're fair game, apparently. In solo, salty survivors will kill themselves on hook or dc on first down. Play for hatch. \n\n[h1]GGEZ[/h1]\n[b]The killer experience.[/b] There is a lot of hypocrisy on the topic of toxicity, as the killer you drew the short end of the stick, congrats. You've probably heard of the survivor rulebook. You probably thought it was a joke; no it is very real but there is one fundamental flaw, it changes from person to person. There are a couple of key ones though. First, don't camp. Yes that includes if the survivor on hook's teammates have just bombed the hook, you gotta take a stroll to the other side of the map and let them heal. That's survivor rulebook 101 my friend. Don't tunnel. This one is tricky because some people genuinely don't understand what tunnelling is and have their own interpretation. Oh and no Lightborn. All the sick survivor plays involve flashlights, so you're practically hacking if you run Lightborn. Having a flashlight on macro isn't annoying you're just tilted. Booping the Snoot = free escape. Teabagging isn't toxic. If you run NOED then you're a little bitc...well you know. Now here's the best part, most important rule of them all actually so listen up, it doesn't matter if you followed every single rule, it doesn't matter which killer you played, which perks or add ons you used, it doesn't matter how the survivors played, good or bad, if you \"won\" the game, you played incorrectly. Confusing right? Survivors [b]hate[/b] losing and they'll have no problem telling you everything you did to seemingly ruin their experience. But if the survivors \"win\"? You're going straight to teabag central at those exit gates and you'll probably get hit with the GGEZ in the post game. The classic. And this brings me to probably the single biggest issue with DBD.\n\n[h1]The Community[/h1]\nThe DBD community is one of the most toxic I have ever had the displeasure to be a part of. Not the entire community, I have had many positive memorable interactions, but for every one of those, I can recount at least ten bad ones. The way the DBD community treats each other is, at times, horrific. My Xbox inbox is filled with hundreds of messages from players I met on DBD, salty that they lost. It was only when I started watching DBD content on YouTube and Twitch that I realised I wasn't the only one getting messages like these, particularly when playing killer. Within the space of an hour on Steam, I was called a re***d by one SWF and then told to kill myself by another. What had I done to get that reaction? I killed them and \"won\" the game. I've seen countless interactions like this on YouTube, many far worse and there are absolutely zero consequences. The devs stick their fingers in their ears and refuse to acknowledge this kind of thing goes on. Using the in game report feature is the equivalent to writing something on a piece of paper, scrunching it up and then lobbing it in the bin. Whilst whatever happens in game, should stay in game, there has to be accountability for those who use racist, homophobic or otherwise serious abusive behaviour towards other players. How could I possibly recommend DBD to anyone? Game communities should be a safe space for its members, DBD is not it.\n\nAnyway I've rambled on for far too long so I'm going to take some advice and I'm going to play something else. Maybe I'll try Civilisation or something.","timestamp_created":1650868076,"timestamp_updated":1650868076,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":416,"votes_funny":24,"weighted_vote_score":"0.865022480487823486","comment_count":24,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114439844","author":{"steamid":"76561198454174654","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7871,"last_played":1655392841},"language":"schinese","review":"非常棒的恋爱游戏，鬼很萝莉人很猥琐非常的nice","timestamp_created":1650866952,"timestamp_updated":1650866952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.698602259159088135","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114438720","author":{"steamid":"76561199036175352","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3655,"last_played":1656290580},"language":"schinese","review":"好","timestamp_created":1650864842,"timestamp_updated":1650864842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114437361","author":{"steamid":"76561198418593304","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":5805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5801,"last_played":1655861112},"language":"english","review":"It's a really fun game!

I like the concept of this game which is to fix all 5 generators without dying or killing all 4 survivors. I find the art in the game amazing the customised dressing on charters is an awesome addition to the game. I would also like to point out that this game has evolved a lot in past years from bugs and even the art design. You get to choose perks as a survivor or killer, some perks help you with avoiding the killer and some help you with helping your teammates. Killer perks are used to help you kill all 4 survivors or to be more silent. It all depends on what you choose. You can also play with friends which are all survivors or go into customs and have your friends be survivors and killers. I would suggest this game to everyone that's into learning tricks. Some tricks could be looping around obstacles or doing loops around the killer just to not get him. Getting scared is part of the experience of this game. One downside of Dead by Daylight is being able to deal with all the toxic players in this game. It can get hard to stay calm when the killer is camping.
