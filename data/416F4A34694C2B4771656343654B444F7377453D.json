If you're playing a survivor, be sure to find and que with friends to increase the likelihood of survival above 0% against all the camping, tunneling tryhards. Given that this game will inevitably ruin friendships and you will have to play alone sometimes, queue as Claudette then stay in the tall grass until either the hatch or the gates are opened. If you're playing killer, remember to play Yakety Sax as it will help lower any mountaing frustration over every loop then the tension can be further eased by face-camping. When they complain about it at the end screen you can remind them that you were the one being punished for your actions by not patrolling the gens, and thus it doesn't matter it totally screwed over the survivor that got 85 points for being facecamped and ruins any fun. This tip won't help whenever you run into a group of survive-with-friends where all of them are running d-strike and bringing flashlights. The only solution for that is to run franklin's demise, hit the items out of their hands followed by a prompt disconnect as that'll lose their items along with screwing over their ranking and points.

To say I’m disappointed is putting it lightly. I have put over 5000 hours and money into this game. I am not happy at all with what Behaviour has been doing with the game lately as it has been continuingly getting worse. A few months ago, they released The Twins. A killer with an awful design that has a terrible experience on both sides. If you ask me, they should have never been released in that state. Recently, they were called out for ignoring requests for accessibility changes to the game that people have been asking for, for years. They threw together a photo that showed scratch marks with different shades of color and said that they’re working on it in response only after people with a sizeable following started speaking out. And now? They put forth a Public Test Build a few weeks ago that overhauled the UI and survivor movement that a lot of people weren’t happy with and which a lot of people didn’t ask for, but they went ahead and pushed it to Live anyways cause they thought that people playing the PTB was a small percentage of the community. I don’t usually put this kind of review out but I feel new and potential returning players have a right to know where this game is at right now. They recently put out a tweet that says they’re working on a solution to our feedback, but until then, I’m leaving this review up.","timestamp_created":1543293821,"timestamp_updated":1613001124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568480253219604492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47102643","author":{"steamid":"76561197980147897","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":76745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10729,"last_played":1657956604},"language":"english","review":"Game is best with friends.

this game is great. It really is especially if you're a fan of horror movies or creepypastas. Playing as survivor has this certain thrill of running away from something you truly fear (unless its freddy krueger ironically) and playing as the killer grants you the satisfaction of hunting. The game is constantly adding new characters and maps and the community can be a fun toxic happy place for horrorcore fans.\n\nALSO THEY ADDING BUNCH OF WAIFU MONSTER BITCHES SO GET ON THIS SHIT","timestamp_created":1543271065,"timestamp_updated":1575069837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47084180","author":{"steamid":"76561198063402133","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5719,"last_played":1571587692},"language":"french","review":"Mon coeur balance entre pouce bleu et pouce rouge et pour des raisons bien précises.\n\nPouce bleu car le concept du jeu est génial, vous incarnez au choix un tueur (michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc...) ou 1 survivant parmi une equipe de 4. Le premier doit tuer les survivants quant aux autres, ils doivent s'échapper en risquant leur vie a tout moment! (frissons garantis!)\n\nAutant être clair le jeu est (a mon avis) bien plus interessant du côté tueur. L'idée d'incarner une légende de l'horreur/épouvante et de se mettre a zigouiller pour pendre les malheureux a un crochet et les sacrifier a L'ENTITE!!!!!! (ou pas...) Quoi de plus jouissif! \n\nA tout cela s'ajoute (pour les tueurs et les survivants) jusque 4 compétences qui permettent d'apprecier le jeu encore plus.\n\nLes survivants n'ont aucun moyen (in-game, je reviendrais la dessus plus tard......) de communiquer a part quelques gestes basiques. Ils sont donc 4 mais livrés a eux mêmes. Avec un peu d'intelligence, ces derniers se regroupent afin d'accomplir le premier objectif du jeu, remettre en route l'éléctricité aux moyens de generateurs a réparer. Ceci fait ils doivent ensuite ouvrir au moins une des 2 portes de sorties de la zone afin de s'en échapper et cela en évitant de se faire attraper par le tueur! (il existe aussi une trappe cachée pour les plus filous d'entre vous!)\n\nMAIS!!!!!!!!     Pouce rouge! \n\nAutant le jeu et son concept sont super, autant la communauté est toxique au plus haut point!!!!!\nEntre le tueur qui va facecamp un survivant pendu comme un saucisson a son crochet par pur sadisme et etre sur qu'il va rejoindre papa Entité, ou alors des survivants qui se prennent pour Rambo armés d'une lampe torche et qui courent de palette en palette pendant que ses petits copains s'organisent via teamspeak pour réparer les générateurs, vous vous retrouvez impuissant, face a une équipe de troll qui profite des mécaniqmes du jeu pour vous humilier in game mais aussi dans le chat de fin de partie, vous qualifiant de noob et j'en passe, comme 4 gosses de cité qui s'acharnent contre le petit Jean-François de la ribambelle de Perlinpinpin.\n\nConclusion : Jeu top, vous pouvez l'acheter, mais sachez qu'a partir d'un certain rang dans le jeu, vous vous heurterez au petits trouducs/kikoolol qui ne savent pas perdre dignement.","timestamp_created":1543270835,"timestamp_updated":1543270835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47084049","author":{"steamid":"76561198031548908","num_games_owned":331,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":19231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1838,"last_played":1647095869},"language":"english","review":"this game is too good for its price but its better with friends since there is no VOIP in-game.
