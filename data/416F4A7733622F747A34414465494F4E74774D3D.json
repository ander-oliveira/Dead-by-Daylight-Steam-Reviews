game has a fun concept, and unique gameplay, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it. Here are a few reasons why:\nYour game experience completely depends on the behaviour of the other players. I know this is not uncommon in the world of online games, but in Dead by Daylight, the opponent/your own team has the power to simply prevent you from playing the game, and this is something the game incentivizes.\n\n I have played this game for almost 1000 hours, and I'm pretty good at. At the same time, there are long stretches where I lose 90-100 % of my matches. The game isn't designed to reward \"skilled\" plays. Nor do wins necessarily make you feel accomplished. My point is that the outcome of the game is inevitable; if there are a number of little things your team mates individually do right, and little things the opponent does wrong, you will win. The outcome is generally not dependent on your actions. You might argue this is inherent to team games, but in this case it makes me feel like there's no point to \"doing your best\".\n\nAlso, winning in this game is not about completing the objective of your team. It's about humiliating the opponent. Either a killer stomping the survivor team and standing and nodding over their bodies for 4 whole minutes before they bleed out, or the killer being proven completely impotent and unable to kill the survivors before they prolong the the killer's suffering by tea-bagging and clicking their flashlights at the exit gate. In either case, both sides exchange racist and homophobic slurs in the end game chat. Again, maybe this isn't unique to Dead by Daylight, but due to the reasons I listed above, this game makes it acutely painful and I would honestly caution anyone with pre-existing mental health problems from playing.","timestamp_created":1651985343,"timestamp_updated":1651985343,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115133664","author":{"steamid":"76561198878562428","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":885,"last_played":1658590682},"language":"schinese","review":"上瘾兄弟 一点不夸张","timestamp_created":1651985299,"timestamp_updated":1651985299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115133623","author":{"steamid":"76561198122403621","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":7031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6344,"last_played":1657774350},"language":"english","review":"its too scary","timestamp_created":1651985245,"timestamp_updated":1651985245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115133459","author":{"steamid":"76561199011992560","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7428,"last_played":1656901087},"language":"english","review":"This Is A Great Game Iv Had it For 2 years Its So Good That I Cant Stop Playing it🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪\n","timestamp_created":1651984980,"timestamp_updated":1651984980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115133175","author":{"steamid":"76561198267044812","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":38942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1703,"playtime_at_review":22953,"last_played":1660213689},"language":"brazilian","review":"(y)","timestamp_created":1651984473,"timestamp_updated":1651984473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115133126","author":{"steamid":"76561198929656249","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":29671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1853,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1660525042},"language":"english","review":"Susie my beloved.

Playing killer in this game is akin to have your skin flayed and turned into leather whips which are then used to beat you into somber submission before they tear each and every inch of your flesh from your bones, overcook it with too many spices, and force-feed it to you while pouring pure lemon juice mixed with ghost pepper flakes into your eyes. And the worst part is you'll queue for match after match despite all of that. And if you want to play as one of the other four players who play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and killed? Good luck! With the wonders of a half-assed skill based match-making you - yes, you! - can enjoy the experience of either facing the newest killer of your life or a no-life loser who has already wasted their life away playing this dumpster fire of a game. And that alone is an insult to dumpsters all across the world.\n\nNow, you may be wondering, just how bad can the game get? *Surely* it can't be all bad? Well, sure, you could queue with friends and enjoy the terrible pain together, because that can be quite fun, but otherwise yes, it IS all bad. Match after horrendous match. Buckle up and get ready for imbalanced perks, maps, and killers. Some killers, if skilled enough, will kill you no matter what you do. Some may never have the chance to get more than one kill. You, as killer, could bullied so hard you wonder if life on earth is the real hell. Or you could get face camped by a baby bubba who you looped for a solid thirty seconds and spend the rest of the game on the hook. Have fun spending the next twenty minutes in a broken queue.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThis all being said, the current state of the game seems on the rise, which is to say they are finally bothering to attempt to fix some of the glaring problems. One of the newest killers, the Dredge, is a very fun killer to play again, and with the new PTB reworking a majority of the META perks the game is heading towards a newer state that might actually better the game significantly. After playing roughly ten or so games today, I can say I enjoyed a majority of them, though I only played as a survivor and I was with friends.\n\nThat is to say that the game can improve, and seems to be trying to. If it continues down this path, this post may also change to a positive review, though I still can't outright recommend it as it sits now.","timestamp_created":1651980022,"timestamp_updated":1657066630,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115130402","author":{"steamid":"76561198284148682","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":613,"playtime_at_review":1821,"last_played":1660527947},"language":"english","review":"shtabey shtab","timestamp_created":1651979732,"timestamp_updated":1651979732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115130059","author":{"steamid":"76561198802788852","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1075,"last_played":1656597012},"language":"english","review":"good game and i love it","timestamp_created":1651979182,"timestamp_updated":1651979182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115129977","author":{"steamid":"76561198875842017","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1653255000},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo muito divertido, por mais que seja repetido, você sempre tenha que fazer geradores e etc!

Definitley do some research before getting into this and give it a try. I appreciate this title since there's so many different complex ways to play the game starting from a simple baseline and idea that the developers have implemented.\n\nThe main thing that the developers need to fix or try and change in the game, is their general pitch of this being a \"Casual\" oriented game when developing things like MMR for a fairer game. As soon as they added this, it discredits this as being a casual game in general. The MMR should be split into two playlists, one competitive and one non-competitive even if it splits the player base. I think in general this was implemented so new players don't feel like they were getting stomped on when starting out, so that the game can retain players better, but I think the method of going about this is all wrong. They've been trying to fix mmr for a while at this point, and the effort is appreciated but in general complaints won't stop happening for this until the two playlists are made as its a scapegoat for all of the larger problems of the game.\n\nOnly thing that's extremely terrible about this game, is just the community online largely being annoying (Mainly twitter). In game Its usually fine, you meet a lot of nice people as long as you play with the general rules of etiquette for both sides (no purposeful tunneling, clicking, etc). \n\nSee you in the fog.","timestamp_created":1651973747,"timestamp_updated":1651973747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115126714","author":{"steamid":"76561199083771981","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8805,"last_played":1655774544},"language":"english","review":"curve billy is not fun but i cannot resist","timestamp_created":1651973639,"timestamp_updated":1651973639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115126325","author":{"steamid":"76561198089251772","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53462,"last_played":1655672598},"language":"english","review":"The community is probably the worst part of the game.

Only redeeming quality is it has cool horror-slasher movies licensed characters, yet about 3 of them are actually good, plus its filled to the brim with bugs, glitches and desync that come (and usually stay) with each update, making it so there will always be another patch to clean the mess the other update brought with it, alongside its own fair share of bugs. Game also has a bunch of cheaters and hacker bots, similar to Team Fortress 2. \n\nThe game also is essentially unplayable as Killer unless you buy The hag, Clown and Blight DLCs for you to not get completely outperked by survivors in a match. The survivor side is mostly fine with perks, having all of the meta for free and you also dont need to level up each survivor for their power since all of them are basically a skin.\n\nAnd last but not least, the community is really sensitive, if you camp, tunnel or even patrol gens as Killer you will be yelled at and get called racist or homophobic slurs on the endgame chat, same goes for survivor if you bring the meta perks and are actually decent at looping, the Killer most likely will call you names and slurs on the endgame chat, without mentioning they will also probably only go for you and throw the game just to get you killed. This game as survivor is also completely team based, so unless you got 3 other friends that have made the mistake to buy this game, solo queue will basically be hell on earth, having you facing teammates that do nothing all game besides hiding or self healing every time they get injured by the killer instead of doing generators, teammates that think they are the best players ever and then disconnect when they go down in 10 seconds, teammates that wont unhook you and leave you reach second stage or even die on first hook and teammates that will actively throw the game, sandbag you and sabotage the match for you and your other teammates. 3/10, do not recommend.","timestamp_created":1651963392,"timestamp_updated":1651963392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115119618","author":{"steamid":"76561198102664942","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":61737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":924,"playtime_at_review":51948,"last_played":1660534202},"language":"english","review":"Still love this game...","timestamp_created":1651961835,"timestamp_updated":1651961835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115118999","author":{"steamid":"76561198877927007","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":29144,"last_played":1659984645},"language":"english","review":"Toxic game, but you get used to it","timestamp_created":1651960922,"timestamp_updated":1651960922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115118336","author":{"steamid":"76561199070589974","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":8923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8923,"last_played":1636518925},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, entrega muchas horas de entretención, diversidad de asesinos y supervivientes, lo que permite tener partidas muy distintas según el emparejamiento que se realice.
