much as I didn't want to change my 2017 review where I was having a blast with the game, the game has gone down hill over the last year or 2 to the point I do not recommend it.\n\nAt first it was fun, the people behind it we fun but they have no competition now and the game is in shambles, console players are getting HUGE performance issues and no fix, balancing in this game feels non-existent, the community is for the most part rather toxic and so many small things that build up. \n\nA chat censor was added what feels like a few months ago that censors things from \"kill\" to \"Meg\". A character's name, they added a match making cool down after you DC, BRILLIANT, now you lose a bit of rank and have to wait 5 minutes (time that stacks up with more DCs) before going in again and ruining a match. But with the game in it's current buggy state, a lot of people are crashing and as a result, getting a DC penalty. I've been slammed with 15 minute DC penalties once after 1 day of trying to have fun with friends, then they took the cool down away as they knew their game was causing crashes but they brought it back while the game still crashes. \n\nWhile the game at it's core is fun, with the amount of bugs in the game that you may encounter, it can easily be ruined in seconds. With the lack of competition it feels like the devs don't care about putting effort into fixing the game because there is no other like it on the market right now that you can go to instead and they know this. While the skins they add are nice, the re-designs and quality of life updates help, the game looking like it is running on a PowerPoint on console and freezing up for a second when you get hit on PC are some of a handful of things that personally have just ruined it for me.","timestamp_created":1499942052,"timestamp_updated":1627810427,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33500192","author":{"steamid":"76561198251678076","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":95659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5041,"last_played":1655387468},"language":"czech","review":"very good game","timestamp_created":1499941763,"timestamp_updated":1499941763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33499960","author":{"steamid":"76561198212700408","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":4593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1088,"last_played":1589530753},"language":"koreana","review":"모르면 맞아야지\n\n뉴비면 맞아야지\n\n살인자면 맞아야지","timestamp_created":1499940935,"timestamp_updated":1507519780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33499521","author":{"steamid":"76561198387613876","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10474,"last_played":1593808260},"language":"russian","review":"СИМУЛЯТОР ЕБЛИ, И БАГОВ","timestamp_created":1499939201,"timestamp_updated":1499939201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33499358","author":{"steamid":"76561198202692282","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":24321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15565,"last_played":1637784689},"language":"brazilian","review":"★━━━━━━Gráficos━━━━━━★\n❎Roblox 2\n❎Aceitável\n❎Estiloso\n☑️Bom\n❎Perfeição\n❎Cada frame foi feito a mão\n\n★━━━━━━Requisitos━━━━━━★\n❎Calculadora\n❎Notebook da escola\n☑️Computadorzin\n❎Pc geimer\n✅Computador ligado em uma usina nuclear\n\n★━━━━━━Historia━━━━━━★\n❎Não têm historia\n☑️A história não é o foco\n❎Historinha para boi dormir\n❎Vale a pena prestar atenção\n❎Historia muito boa\n❎Top 3 histórias\n\n★━━━━━━Jogabilidade/Aprendizado━━━━━━★\n❎Só andar para frente\n❎Flappy Bird 3\n❎É simples mas tem umas mecânicazinhas\n☑️Você vai apanhar bastante no início\n❎Precisa de 300h+ para poder clickar\n\n★━━━━━━Tempo de jogo Médio━━━━━━★\n❎Você provavelmente vai jogar pouco\n❎Só para descontrair\n❎O jogo tem um fim e não vai muito além disso\n☑️Você provavelmente vai jogar bastante\n❎Você vai ver sua vida passando lá fora enquanto joga\n\n★━━━━━━Audio e Musicas━━━━━━★\n❎Meu ouvido ta sangrando....\n❎É melhor você botar uma música no spotify\n❎Éehhh ta tudo certo\n☑️Os sons são precisos ou a música é incrivel\n❎HMMMMM MUSIQUINHA\n\n★━━━━━━Bugs━━━━━★\n❎Nunca aconteceu comigo\n❎Bugou uma ou duas vezes\n☑️As vezes pode ter alguns bugs que atrapalham\n❎Ubisoft....\n\n★━━━━━━Idade das pessoas que jogam━━━━━★\n❎Crianças\n❎Adolescentes\n❎Adultos\n☑️Todos\n\n★━━━━━━Compra?━━━━━★\n❎Ta esperando oque??

Dies wird man logischerweise aber nur in der Theorie erleben und das ist doch auch das Schöne.\n\nSpiele variieren, die Stärken der verfügbaren Killer, sowie der Spieler dahinter variieren. Und wenn man nicht toxisch ist, dann macht ein Spiel auch häufig Spaß, wenn man als Killer keine vier Kills geholt hat oder als Survivor nicht entkommen ist.\nAppell: Erkennt vielleicht auch mal den Skill eures Gegners an und versucht aus euren Fehlern zu lernen. Denn das Grundprinzip ist so, dass der Killer die Survivor zu Fehlern zwingen muss/sollte.\n\nZusammengefasst: Dead by Daylight ist ein wunderbares Spiel mit natürlich kleinen Fehlern (an die sich die Devs aber größtenteils begeben). Und man kann definitiv eine tolle Formkurve des Spiels erkennen, denn die Devs haben es geschafft das Spiel von den Begebenheiten sehr balanced zu gestalten, sowie tolle Maps, Killer, Perks etc. in das Spiel zu integrieren.

Jugaba de survivor. Quedaba primero, escapaba, descolgaba, loopeaba algo, me divertia. Gente se acercaba a mi perfil a decir cosas alentadoras. Saben? No se cuando cambio todo. Pero desde ya hace algo de tiempo. Solo entro para encontrarme (rango rojo) con killers campeando, jugando sucio y en el peor de los casos usando programas externos. Y cuando juego de killer hay partidas donde todos mueren facil o pasa que JUSTO cuando me acerco a alguien bajan los fps o justo cuando voy a golpear el survivor hace un movimiento extraño. Intentare explicar. Cuando pasa el tiempo y un juego no refresca sus reglas, contenido o manera de jugar, pues pasa que el humano astuto se adapta y tiende a romper las reglas porque ya sabe hasta donde estan los limites. Entonces, almenos en rangos rojos la vida en dbd para un jugador casual solo mode es insoportable porque o los compañeros de turno mueren rapido o a uno lo insultan hasta cansar porque si tiene la habilidad de sobrevivir al killer. Y si buscas grupos o algo, al final es gente interesada que se incomoda si no vas a su ritmo. Miren, si yo pudiera evitar haber invertido tanto dinero en el juego. No lo dudaria y haria algo mejor con mi salud mental. Porque de ser una experiencia divertida, de la nada se convirtieron en dias de agotamiento mental, aburrimiento, monotonia. Para colmo es imposible si quiera hacerte el buena gente siendo killer. Mi consejo seria, evita comprarte o gastar dinero en esto. Al final te arrepientes y no tiene nada que ver el ser bueno o malo, si lo consigues de manera gratuita o que alguien te lo compre, pues dale, asi no sentiras decepcion o que fuiste muy tonto.

Who knows how much more work the devs will put into fixing it.  \n\nThere are no dedicated servers.  The Killer always hosts, and he can mess with his internet to make you lag or disconnect himself, wait for the survivors to DC, then get back in and get points.  Half of your games will have a disconnect.  It takes about 4 tries to get a game going if you play with friends.  \n\nAlso- your save is stored locally.

The Killer tries to catch and kill them. \n\nWhile Survivor play in third-person the killer plays in first person.  [/b]\n\n[b][u] Fun factor  [/u] [/b]\n\nI have been playing Dead by Daylight since a while now, been playing other Survival-horror games like Friday the 13th, Propnight & Home Sweet Home:Survive. But Dead by Daylight will be forever the game that reminds in my heart. If we just ignore the fact of the unbalanced MMR system you can actually have fun in Dead by Daylight. It is not a beginner friendly game and even people that come back to DbD will find a hard time playing the game but the more frequently you play it the better DbD turns out to be.\n\n[b] Survivor [/b]\n\nPlaying alone as one survivor and 3 other random survivors is possible but very hard and not really that much fun. \n[i] I really recommend here to play ATLEAST with one premade.  [/i] Playing with one more person than yourself improves the fun factor by a lot. A full \"survive with your friends\" ( 4 people ) group is the best at this point. But as I said, you can play the game alone and have fun or with just one more friend :)\nEverything can be fun. ♥\nBut as someone who is new or came back to the game, play with atleast one more friend, it will not frustrate you by a lot. You can atleast count on eachother!!\n\n[b] Killer [/b]\n\nPlaying as a Killer can be very hard and frustrating especially when you get experienced survivors and you dont have any good perks in your build. But I can highly recommend Killer!! Especially when you are new you should maybe play the Killer for one round and after Survivor just to figure out how Killer works but even if you just play Killer, it is completely fun and makes a ton of fun! Killers have a shorter matching time than survivors because they are more full survivor lobbys than actually killer. So you can faster come to play the game. I really love playing killer when I am all by myself and dont know what to do. Trying to outplay the survivors and try to control the game is actually hard but it makes so much fun! The more perks you have the better it is! Different perk builds can change your Killer experience by a lot! Try it out~ ♥\n\n[b][u] Control & Gaming [/u] [/b]\n\nAs I mentioned the survivors play in third-person view and the Killer in first-person. Each Killer and Survivor can carry 4 Perks and 1 Offering with them. The Perks can have big impact on your gameplay and your surroundings. Some survivor perks are working on others, generators, totems, enviroment and Killer, depending on which one you have with you. Killer Perks can also work on survivors, generators, exit gates, repairing/healing speed, enviroment and yourself. \nBringing Offerings into a round can bring you more Bloodpoints, higher chance for map, enviroment change, starting with other survivors together/for away from the killer, and much more other things. \nWhile Survivor can Carry Items with them (Keys, Flashlight, Flashbangs, Maps, Toolboxes, Medkits) one at a time with 2 Add-Ons (which can \"upgrade\"/\"buff\" your current items) the Killer has their Weapon with their Ability instead of Items. But they can also improve their Weapon/Ability with Add-Ons. \nSurvivor can not kill the Killer, they can only run, blind(with flashlights, flashbangs, persk,etc.), loop, stun(pallets, perks, etc.) or take protections hits for other survivor to go against the Killer. \nThe Killer can actually hit the Survivors with their weapon and interact with them with their Ability. They can short hit and long hit survivor with their weapon. Each Killer has their own Ability, check them out by yourself and try out which one you like more~♥\nWhile Survivor are repairing generator they get quick time events where they have to hit skill checks by clicking at the right second the space bar. When they are being picked up by the Killer they have to wiggle (old: with A and D) by succesfully hit over and over again the skill checks. When Survivor get in second stage on the Hook they receive skill checks which they ALSO have to hit to not instantly die by the arms of the Entitus.\n\n[b][u] Graphics [/u] [/b]\n\nOne thing that we have to mention at the beginning... They are updating visuals over and over again when they become old. Behaviour is ALWAYS improving and never failed on the Graphics, in my opinion. They are respectable for the game Dead by Daylight is. Even the Skins that they bring out are outstanding. \nYou can lower your graphics which makes the game brighter most part. But even with low Graphics it doenst look the worst. Of course its the most beautiful when you play on the highest Graphics but if your computer cant come up to that point, you are still not missing out the beautiful game. \nIf you are colourblind you can actually change the game settings to how you like it to be/how its moe comfortable for you!\n\n[b][u] Sound [/u] [/b]\n\nOverall the Music is dramatic and fits the atmosphere. The sound effects are leaning on realistic sounds. Some Killers & Skins have their own sounds which makes them unique and wonderful. Survivors are mostly heard screaming and crying. I never had a moment where I thought that is is REALLY Nasty, of course some weird slimy things in the enviroment actually sound slimy and if your watched \"Stranger Things\" the Demogorgon portals sound 100% the same as in the series. But for the aspect that it is a Survival Horror game where you have to escape several Killers with their unique Ability I think its pretty good in the sounds for each Killer. \n\n[b][u] Replayability [/u] [/b]\n\nYES!! Its not a game where you play it once and there is nothing to do anymore. It is a game where you played Matches, you try to win over and over again. You try to level your Characters, maybe farm some comsetics and Perks. Maybe you wanna prestige all your Survivors and Killers? You can do all that. It takes a long time to come to a point where you have nothing to do. Even if you say \"Lets get the highest rank!!!\" Every 13th of the month we actually have a rank reset in Dead by Daylight, The higher your ranked the higher your Bloodpoint reward is. Survivor and Killer ranked are seperated! So you can get max. 2 million Bloodpoints.  You can also play with 5 friends together via \"Kill your friends\". You dont earn bloodpoints there but you actually can try out Perks and just have fun with friends :D\nThere is no End in Dead by Daylight. They bring out every 3 to 4 months a new Killer/Survivor out. So then you have AGAIN something to try out, to level and to just figure out.\n\n[b][u] Support & Discord [/u] [/b]\n\nI encountered a few errors in Dead by Daylight, thats okay, it is a big game and sometimes things happens. I wrote the Support and they always were there to help me. They 100% answer your inside 48 hours. But they replied to my Ticket inside of 12 hours. The support is YOUR FRIEND... they try to help you. Even if you find small bugs in the game or something weird happened. Please write them, they listen. Behaviour is doing such a amazing job and they really need to be praised more for that.
