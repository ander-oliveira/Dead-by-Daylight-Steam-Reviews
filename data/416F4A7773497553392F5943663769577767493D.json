(Legion and Cannibal can make it easy to hit rank 1 for beginners). Survivors can do alright most of the time. (yes, even if you solo not every game is perfect, but you will find your luck) I also, personally think Purple ranks are more toxic compared to Red ranks..\n\nCons of the game would be (but not limited to) :\nlong queue times, toxic community such as swf sweaty tryhards in post game chat, facecamping killers (those who tunnel idrc about), basement bubbas (so many teammates will throw the game trying to save someone..)\n\nnevertheless,\nI would recommend this game to anyone, the more I play the more stuff I learn.
