There's no way to level up, or anything else.\n- Really poor balancing.\n- You can't change mouse sensitivity in game.\n- Not much content.\n- Will probably die in a few weeks due to most of the factors above.\n\nIf this was a large scale publisher, this game would get lambasted. Instead, it's effectively a early access game, without the EA title, and people seem moderately okay with that.\n\nUnfortunately for me this game is really only fun with friends, and its hard enough to put together a group.\n\nOne saving grace though, the forums have a pretty active Looking for Players section, which I'd recommend.

I've played 4v1 survival games, a great example of one (that just got poor marketing due to cosmetic day one DLC) is Evolve.  Evolve shines where Dead by Daylight fails.  \n\nAs a survivor you have to deal with (at this point in time) 1 of 3 killers.  The main mechanic to evading killers is awareness (seeing the killer) and your senses telling you the killer is near via a heartbeat sound. However, one of the killers completely circumvents this mechanic.\n\nI'm sorry, a CORE mechanic to your game and everyone is honestly surprised that everyone is picking the Wraith?  How droll.  And for anyone saying \"well I've won X games as hillbilly\" or \"I've evaded the wrath plenty of times\"  Guess what,  a good wraith is going to be far enough away from a particular spot (not moving) and unless you have the eyesight of a raven,  you aren't going to spot him in time to run away. \n\nAs the survivor it's an extremely frustrating experience being unable to see your fellow survivors unless they are in mortal peril.

Bringing us into the land of Slasher horror films. Something not a lot of games venture into, if at all.\n\nYou can play as a Slasher, or a Survivor. Survivors have a third-person perspective and have audio cues to know if the Slasher is close, but not its exact position. A small red light on the ground shows the Killer's vision, letting you know the Killer is RIGHT behind you when you're being chased, if you even DARE to look back. When you're being chased, the Slasher is slightly faster. But this is balanced out with ways to avoid the killer. Throwing down pallets to block him while you run off in tall grass or hide in a closet or something. Your objective is to activate 5 generators with 3 other survivors, and then escape. Sounds simple, but it's a lot harder than it sounds. There is no voice chat in ranked matches, so plans cannot be made.\n\nThere are three Slashers, each with different abilities. You have the Trapper, who uses Bear Traps to trap survivors in choke points during chases, or stop them getting to the generators, from helping survivors, etc. The Wraith, who has a cloaking ability. \n\nMany users are complaining that this slasher is Overpowered. The cloaking prevents survivors from hearing the audio cue that plays when the Slasher is near. However, before the Wraith can go invisible, a bell toll plays, announcing that he's cloaking. Players then have the option of continuing what they're doing, or be more careful.\n\nThen you have the Hillbilly, that has a Chainsaw dash ability, able to cut down a survivor in one-fell swoop.\n\nAll three of the Slashers have a melee weapon that takes down a survivor in two hits. One makes them bleed, two downs them to a crawl. When slashing, there's a slight cooldown for when you hit a survivor. When you hit a survivor, the Slasher wipes the blood onto his sleeve, and he slows down for a few seconds, allowing the Survivor to get a headstart. Fair trade in my opineon. If the slasher was able to do two swings in rapid succession, it wouldn't be very fair.\n\nThe goal of the Slasher, no matter the type, is to either kill or sacrifice all the Survivors by putting them on meat hooks. Once again, this is harder than it sounds. Survivors can help eachother, getting others off meathooks, healing eachother, helping repair the Generators, etc.\n\nThe game has one core gameplay mode, but two ways to do it. Ranked is as simple as it sounds. Play as a Slasher or Survivor against random online people. Or you can do Kill Your Friends mode, which is the same but in a private match for at least 2 people(One person HAS to be the Slasher). Now, the big difference between the two. In ranked mode, you score blood points which you can use to upgrade your character. Give them new perks, and items to use. However, in Kill Your Friends, this stuff is blocked. I'm guessing this is mainly to stop people from farming points. [u]If this is something that bothers you, you might not want to spend money on this. Be warned.[/u]\n\nSpeaking of points. There is a character customization point, or loadout. Which allows you to add items to your character.(As stated above) There's not many choices of clothing and cosmetics as of yet. This is likely to be added in future updates, along with new play modes.\n\nMaps are of relatively medium to large size, all of which are dark and forboding, and are procedurally generated. Generators in a place you might know now, will be switched in different plays.\n\nI think this game is quite fun, and is a pretty good horror game that will make you tense up.\n\nPrice is pretty damn low for something of this kind of quality, only $20. Ten dollars more if you want the Deluxe edition.\n\nGo ahead and get this game if you wish, and enjoy yourself, you masochistic maniac, you.","timestamp_created":1465947400,"timestamp_updated":1465947400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23561039","author":{"steamid":"76561197977989869","num_games_owned":582,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1467236290},"language":"english","review":"No Party system besides that it's good.","timestamp_created":1465947248,"timestamp_updated":1465947248,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507258892059326172","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23561008","author":{"steamid":"76561198082560402","num_games_owned":526,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1653001383},"language":"english","review":"I almost enjoyed this game.  Unfortunately, I cannot give it a recommendation.  This game ran absolutely horrible on GTX 970 - AMD 8320 combo and it also felt very unplished.  I found the menus to be somewhat buggy and the graphics to be sub-par for the performance I was getting.  The overall UI of the menus looked great, but do to the buggy feel, they couldn't win me over.  The game itself was neat.  After playing two matches (and losing both times) I felt like this game lacked any depth or playability.  I felt as if I had experienced the entire game within just those two matches.  I base this feeling on how similar the matches felt.  Both were on different maps and with different killers, yet everything felt the same.  I really wanted to like this game and maybe I should have played a few more matches and also tried playing as the Killer (i had little to no interest in being the killer, I wanted to be a defenceless teenager once again) but I just didnt have the feeling or the urge in me to play that I had been hoping for.  I would buy this game again for $5, max.  I feel bad for saying this but this has been my honest and not very good review.

Obvously this means that there is a considerable amount of teamwork invovled but unless you group up with some friends it is going to become very difficult to actually co-operate with anyone since there is no in-game voice chat. Even if there was no voice-chat it would be nice to have some sort of in-game callout system where you could call out to your teammates in hopes of linking up with them, but risk the monster be able to track you down because of it. \n\nThe level up system is very ingenous yet simple. Every time you play a mission you collect a certain amount of \"bloodpoints\" (basically XP) depending on how well you perform and what you do. As a survivor, healing a wounded teammate or helping them out of a bear trap will award you some extra points, whereas as a monster you get point for killing survivors and trapping them. These points are pooled together and you can spend it however you want. There are three monsters and four survivors and they all do something a little different. Leveling up is going to feel similar to a skill-tree, only instead of a tree, it's a web, and instead of ONLY get perks and abilities, you also get consumable stuff (a flashlight, for example) that you may or may not lose when you use it in an online game (games with friends, however, will not consume these).\n\nYou can also customize each survivor and killer (I always choose whatever is hardest to see in the dark or tall grass) which adds another layer of personalization. \n\nOverall I would definitley recommend picking this up for $30, so far the servers seem a little empty to finding an online game is a little difficult but if you can get 4 or 5 friends into it then this game is going to make a lot of your gaming nights fun.","timestamp_created":1465946351,"timestamp_updated":1465946351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498340845108032227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23560850","author":{"steamid":"76561198041540255","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":186,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1660498573},"language":"english","review":"please make us able to play with friends online :) its much more funn that way ;) i rate this game 8/10 :D","timestamp_created":1465946256,"timestamp_updated":1465946256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501659154891967773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23560847","author":{"steamid":"76561198136337256","num_games_owned":538,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":10051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1206,"last_played":1574226290},"language":"english","review":"best murder simulator of 2016 and best hunting simulator of 2016 but on a serious note play this game its awesome it is just as thrilling to be chased as it is to chase and i can fore see more killers and survivors too come totally not  because of the payday 2 masks.so far 3 killers with different powers and 4 survivors that act pretty much the same outside of unlock differences","timestamp_created":1465946238,"timestamp_updated":1465946238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498340845108032227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23560845","author":{"steamid":"76561198020962583","num_games_owned":1203,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1479533233},"language":"english","review":"Pros: \n\nGreat Concept\n\nCons:\n\nTerrible Execution\nPoisonous Community\nPoisonous Devs\nLong \"Q\" Times\nBeta Was Way Better\nImbalanced\nLittle To No Budget\nTerrible Models\nEven More Terrible Rigs and Animation Schemes\n\nCareful when you purchase.

Through my couple matches of the game it was fun and it still is but there is not alot of teamwork, and I would just watch as everyone left me to hang after I gave myself to the killer for them to get away. Also there is alot of camping when it comes to the killer. All my games the killer just sits at the hook watching as they die and it doesnt give us the chance to save them.

Other than all that I love this game its fun and it gets the heart pumping.\n\nAlso I don't know if this is only me but when I try to be the killer I can never find players to join so I have yet to be the killer.","timestamp_created":1465945735,"timestamp_updated":1465945735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23560737","author":{"steamid":"76561197972425292","num_games_owned":782,"num_reviews":142,"playtime_forever":15946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10869,"last_played":1646106417},"language":"english","review":"Developers use players as a crutch to make up for the unfun aspects of this game.","timestamp_created":1465945728,"timestamp_updated":1644532438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23560725","author":{"steamid":"76561197977201254","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1465945049},"language":"english","review":"Refunded! feels more like a early access game then a fully \"developed\" game, can really see the 6 year development  put in..... 10/10","timestamp_created":1465945679,"timestamp_updated":1465945758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480873912572860718","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23560722","author":{"steamid":"76561198067206987","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":160,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1660591283},"language":"english","review":"So this is going to be my first (and most likely only review) on a game on the steam platform.
