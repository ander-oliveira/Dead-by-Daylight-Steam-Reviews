Заметили? Стим не зацензурил. \nИз плюсов могу подчеркнуть оптимизацию, так как даже на моем ведре которая помогала мне делать яичницу и медиум-прожарку мяса оно идет в 50 фпс, хотя железо не соответствует рекомендуемым параметрам, что б вы понимали у меня GTX 650 1GB RAM и FX-4300 Quad core processor, но все мы знаем что он нихуя не quad. Там 4 ядра крч дрисня.\n  Так же как и в любой другой игре в этой параше можно рофлить с друзьяшками если они у вас есть (Все мы знаем что у тебя нет друзей). Главное меню понятное и приятное в обращении, думаю если вы зайдете быстро разберетесь. Графика не заставляет вырывать глаза и блевать Drake face's, но и особо не порадует. Среднячок. \n  Геймплей за выжевшего скучный, хотя у каждого свое мнение и дабы не вызывать когнитивного диссонанса и споров с разными мамиными критиками просто скажу, что можно либо заводить генераторы и шкериться от маньяка, либо бегать от пяьного отчима стометровки прикрываясь досками и прыгая в окна. Все на ваш вкус. \n\n Минусов существенно больше чем плюсов, однако они не такие значительные. Ну, во-первых если вам попадется мудила с пингой под 300 который живет в средней азии, лагать будет прежде всего у вас, а он все так же спокойно играть. Так же это токсичность сурвов. Токсил ли я?da, много раз? da, но не повседневно, скорее по настроению. Токсичность коммьюнити в дбд действительная проблема, но решать ее не стоит и сейчас обосную свою интерпретацию мысли. Во-первых, то что перед палетой приседает уебище и мигает вам фонарем еще не значит то, что вы имели половое соотношение с его мамой а она была куртизанкой, а его папа вовсе ушел от него. Все же нужно принимать в свой аспект тот факт, то что это всего лишь игра и обращать на пиксельный свет от фонаря или пригинающуюся модельку внимания не стоит. Мое личное мнение.\n  Так же в игре ОЧЕНЬ низкий онлайн за сурвов, однако только в сравнении с манами. На 20 рангах лобби приходится ждать за маньяка около 10-15 минут, однако за сурвов ты находишь его в три-четыре секунды, но это и обусловленно тем что за выживших геймплей не такой динамичный, ведь если все будут бегать от маньяка генераторы вы все не заведете. \n  РАЗРАБЫ ЛИЖУТ СУРВАМ, изо дня в день слышны эти слова из уст детей, которые не могут понять то что если разработчики примут позицию маньяков, в лобби скоро будет один выживший и четыре маньяка. Если быть серьезным, выжившим пиздец как усложнили жизнь, а маньякам и по сей день вешают баффы, попутно нерфя перки сурвов. Это одна из серьезных причин, объясняющая почему маньяков намного больше чем выживших. Не секрет что это вина Очидо и его компании, но я его не осуждаю. Из-за иронии этого самого очидо над разработчиками, те фактически объявили ему локальную войну и вырезают паллеты, нерфят сурвов только для того что бы ему хуже игралось и его ролики выходили реже, но они херят новичкам интерес к игре, а так же забывают что очидо привлекает новых людей в ДБД.","timestamp_created":1537441685,"timestamp_updated":1537441685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545189499855041504","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44834482","author":{"steamid":"76561198322981703","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6256,"last_played":1656776513},"language":"czech","review":"Very nice game :D","timestamp_created":1537440570,"timestamp_updated":1537440570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505813956260681152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44834310","author":{"steamid":"76561198401768664","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":967,"last_played":1580991926},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏现在对萌新挺好的，以前所有技能都要点的时候才最操蛋了\n现在进去人物就有三个技能，挺好的\n就是现在人有点少\n我排好久都排不到人","timestamp_created":1537439654,"timestamp_updated":1537439654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44834211","author":{"steamid":"76561198028795294","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23907,"last_played":1653672021},"language":"czech","review":"veri gud gejm but kamprs ar anojing and this gejm tejks mi lyfe so i rekomend to not plej yt","timestamp_created":1537439159,"timestamp_updated":1602707875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44834093","author":{"steamid":"76561198814820049","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":56196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":53,"playtime_at_review":27418,"last_played":1660582641},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor juego para conocer gente jajaja","timestamp_created":1537438441,"timestamp_updated":1537438441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525268018245697021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44834062","author":{"steamid":"76561198450839560","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":83997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2949,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1660606002},"language":"english","review":"Fun.

I main the killer Huntress, so I understand how to play without having to do any of those things, and just how to just have a fun match. Though I played on the Xbox version way before switching to PC, my only complaint with switching is that some killers that were free on Xbox I had to pay for here. Same for survivers, otherwise this game just takes patience and trying to just cool off after a match. I've been called a noob more times then I can count Pregame just for being a low level surviver.

Дизбаланс, его частичное отсутствие. Баланс постоянно чередуется то к выжившим, то к убийцам, и никак не может прийти к нормальному балансу, стоить выжившим завестись имбой, - то это чинят спустя 1-3 месяца, аналогично с убийцами. И да спустя три месяца, так что вы можете абузить имбу.\n2. Хитбоксы и пинг. Хитбоксы - всё это зависит от вашего пинга, вы будет получать удары за метры откуда его нанесли. Я игрок с 100+ пингом поэтому я частенько с этим встречаюсь.\n3. Хакеры(читеры) они кишат в DBD как минимум одного хакера из 20 игр вы обязательно встретите. Они буквально бушуют внутри игры, делают что хотят, удерживают ваше время в игре, а главное портят вам вашу игру, и самое смешное остаются безнаказанными. Ибо в DBD я даже не встречал подобное, чтобы хоть где-то была шумиха, что большинство хакеров получили свою карму. Античит бесполезен.\n4. Потеря духа ужасов. Каждое обновление делает игру менее страшной, убийцы теряют свой убийственный дух, особенно это коснулось Фредди с его реворком, после этого этот убийца стал для меня не больше чем машиной убийств, про других убийц молчу. Другими словами убийцы подобные ему теряют свою каноничность.\n5. Бессмысленность в рангах, или матчмейкинга.

Lobbies go on for eternity and playing as a survivor no one works together and killers just camp you on hook. So far not fun at all and apparently only gets fun after you play forever and get to higher ranks. I only want to play as the killer but as I said after waiting in an empty lobby for 20+ minutes I gave up on that. Probably going to get a refund.\n\nIt seems like playing as the killer is the best part of this game and from twitch streams and other media it's what got me to buy DBD. I read some old forum posts about killer lobbies not filling up and people either responded by trolling or saying \"be patient and rank up\". So essentially there is no solution and you have to sit for 10-30mins in an empty lobby to play as killer and rinse and repeat for idk how many matches until you get to a high enough rank where the lobby times are shorter. \n\nSOLUTION: Waste hours of your life in empty lobbies to get slightly faster lobbies...... COOL.\n\nSomething is clearly VERY wrong with match making when starting out you can't get a killer lobby full but in literally not even a second you can get into a survivor match. This seems like one of those games where it is only fun with friends and solo play is pure cancer.\n\nGraphics are decent and the concept COULD be fun if you have to patience to trudge through the endless empty lobbies to get to experience it. It isn't a player count issue either considering something like 100k people play this game every day.\n\nOVERALL 3/10\n\n+3 for cool concept.\n-7 for road blocks in the form of massive lobby times to play killer as a new player.\n\nP.S.-Devs maybe show some sense of urgency in fixing the killer lobby issue because Im sure Im not the only person who is going to end up refunding this game because they don't like wasting hours of their lives in lobbies.\n\nOh and I'm alt tabbed right now in a killer lobby while I wrote this review and before this I was watching twitch for a while. Going on 30mins with no one in the lobby. Looks like a refund is on the way. I'll give this 1 hour and 45mins and if I only get to play 1 killer match then it's refund time.","timestamp_created":1537381118,"timestamp_updated":1537381118,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44814128","author":{"steamid":"76561198006246605","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":51627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35940,"last_played":1586465689},"language":"english","review":"Yes, I played DbD over 600hours.\nNo, I still do not recommend it.\nThose hours accumulated over quite some time and a lot of them I earned by playing with friends for the luls.\n\nNow that this is out of the way, why do I not recommend this game?\nBecause it is a very poor execution of a nice idea with a lot of bad mechanics, lot of useless stuff, poor game design and one of the most toxic communities I have seen in my many years of gaming.\n\nSome words on bad mechanics:\n- stealth gameplay is not rewarded\n- stealth gets removed more and more from the game (more and more detection perks for killers, hardly any stealth perks for survivors)\n- very hard timepressure on the killer right from the start, encouraging a \"no quarter given\" playstyle\n- pallet looping (spots where a survivor can loop the killer around an obstacle with a pallet, can result in a huge waste of time for the killer and is no fun at all to play, neither for the killer nor for the survivor (at least I did not have fun when I had to do it)\n- jungle gyms (same as above but with windows)\n- many ways for the survivors to reduce the effect of mistakes they make (self care, deceisive strike, flashlights, hook sabo, hook blocking...)\n- hardly any way for the killer to controll the game in such a way that it shifts in his favor\n\nuseless mechanics\n- many perks you will never ever see in a game.  On both sides there are some \"must haves\" or at least very good (sprint burst, self care, ds, urban evasion, adrenalin...) (barb, ruin (almost impossible to get a nice game as killer without ruin), enduring, iron grasp...) while the rest is just garbage.\n\npoor game design\n- its just boring. They have many different maps already yet the objective remains the same. Generators. Was it so hard to come up with something more fitting for the maps? Or how about an early-mid-late game? Or a way to prevent 3 gens from popping in the first minute or for a survivor to get hooked and facecamped within the first minute? Is that supposed to be fun?\n\ntoxic community:\nWell, alot was said already about this community and yes, both sides contribute to that, absolutely no doubt.\nI played as a killer main so the example I can give is from the killer side.\n\nI was playing the Huntress and had a perk (whispers) with me that told me when a survivor was within a certain range. Not exatly where just that some is nearby. Right from the beginning one of the Survs. DCs. I dont know if rage or an problem with his connection, but since I try to play fair I think ok, that sucks for them, earn some points and then let them leave.\nSo I chased them around a bit, noticed that they were not very good and then deceided, ok, I need to show them I dont wanna kill them. One of them was just down so I went over to pick him up and carry him to a gen when he DCd.\nOk, I thought, you must tread those remaining 2 VERY gently.\nWhich I did, I did not down one of them again, but by the time they had done (finaly) all gens, one was injured.\nI had chased them over the hatch so I knew where it was and I knew, they knew too. \nThen the opened the gate and one left.\nOne was still around and I knew, ok now the hatch is open.\nI went to the hatch and yes, whisperes triggered so I knew the wounded guy was nearby.\nI just stood near the hatch and he had all the time in the world to leave through the gate. \nBut he did not.\nInstead he stood behind a tree nearby so long that the ravens came and alerted me of his position. I went over to him, smacked him down and hooked him where he died of course cause there was no one to safe him.\nGame ended and as I was expecting he immediatly startet to rage, called me a babykiller and a hatchcamper and complained that whispers is only used by pussies.\nSo after I played super nice without killing him and with giving him all the gens he needed and enough time to escape, he raged and complained and insultet me, as if he had been entitlet to escape through the hatch....\n\nConclussion:\nUnless you love imbalanced games with bugs and poor game design and a lot of grind and useless stuff and if you enjoy getting bullied by tryhards and knowitalls.... please, just stay away from this game!\nThe devs started taking some steps in the right direction... but I fear its to little to late.","timestamp_created":1537381007,"timestamp_updated":1583906052,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44814091","author":{"steamid":"76561198198940605","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5150,"last_played":1657869777},"language":"german","review":"It is a very nice game","timestamp_created":1537380832,"timestamp_updated":1537380832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44814079","author":{"steamid":"76561198248324154","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":95,"playtime_forever":114188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9451,"last_played":1658729464},"language":"turkish","review":"cok fena alın oynayın anlarsınız :D","timestamp_created":1537380754,"timestamp_updated":1537380754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44814023","author":{"steamid":"76561198362000488","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":3251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1878,"last_played":1655229943},"language":"german","review":"DBD ist best alle kaufen ^^","timestamp_created":1537380483,"timestamp_updated":1537380483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44814018","author":{"steamid":"76561198005086378","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":75779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10763,"last_played":1658252420},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game if you like asymmetrical PvP, like Evolve.\n\nIt's not a perfect game.
