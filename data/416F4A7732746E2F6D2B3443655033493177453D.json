So if you are looking for a good community that aims to thrive and prosper you're definitely in the wrong neck of the woods.\n\nThere are plenty of bugs, the main one being the Dev believing that they can handle a computer beyond plugging it in.\n\nPlaytesting is evidently not a thing despite bhvr studios claiming otherwise, which if true can lead you to the conclusion that these guys are complete freshmen when it comes to anything related to this game or gaming in general.\n\nDon't get me wrong, from time to time when they feel like doing something out of sheer boredom they might try to balance the game, but only after the community has been crying about it for a few months.\n\nAnd do not get me started on the DBD Forums where the community as well as the community councilors really start to shine in all its glory. It is what you would imagine when met with the idea of a ROBLOX Forum, only alot worse. I would rather subject myself to having feces flung at me by orangutans at the Zoo than having to wade through the endless drivel and entitlement that is going on over there.\n\nThe game has a \"Ranking System\".\nLet me try that again.\n\nThe game has a habit of assigning a random number to your Account which is called your \"Rank\" going from 20(lowest) up to 1(highest).\nThe higher you get the more salty the stew will become, the more often you will be told to go kill yourself because some scrub across the country decided it would be a great idea to spend most of his time in life playing a game that he sucks at, knows that he sucks at and consequently became so frustrated that he even started to believe that spewing out shitpost after shitpost on an online computergame would be a good idea to solve his problems.\n\nNot to mention that you will have ranks across the board in your lobbies regularly even so after they have \"fixed the matchmaking\". Pretty good job so far, right?\n\nYou are new to the game and want to play killer? Get ready to be bullied by survivors that are 10 ranks+ above you.\nYou are new to the game and want to play survivor? Same thing vice versa.\n\nNow the game concept is far from complex and the basics can be learned rather quickly.\nBeyond that it is all up to how much time you invest into the game to learn how to master it.\n\nHaving said all that, I am having alot of fun with the game and I don't even know why. It is strangely addicting despite its many flaws.\nIt is very grindy and you will spend hundreds of hours if you want to unlock every perk.\nEven more so if you want to prestige all characters, which will likely take you anywhere between 500-1500 hours.\n\nCan I recommend the game?\nNo.\n\nThe same way I cannot recommend anybody to start smoking cigarettes.\nMost of the time it will taste like shit, you'll get addicted and it will hurt you in the long run.\nAnd still there is something strangely rewarding about the game.\n\nIf you really looking to get it, wait for a sale that happens rather frequently. Hold off on the DLC until you have played for atleast 50 hours, have tried out both survivor and killer side of the game and played enough matches to realize how things are running in this game. You're definitely in for a loopy hellride.\n\n1/26/20 In updating this review, I remain with it. Devs continue to make decisions that make no sense while failing completely to communicate with the playerbase.\n\n8/11/20 Another update half a year later. Hopped back in to check up on the state of the game.\nIt's even glitchier than it has been before. Even saw the exact same bug within 2 minutes of starting\nthe first round. Well Played BHVR.
