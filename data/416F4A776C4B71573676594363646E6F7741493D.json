Tea-bagging, after game communications, hatred for what you run/what you use, who you play as, which map you choose. All aspects are going to gain hatred from someone.\n\nThe game is fun- especially when you get to understand the mechanics behind both sides, along with certain 'rules' you set for yourself when playing killer, surviving alone, or surviving with friends. Perk combos allow for some interesting play styles, although not all are optimal. Some perks are not even worth getting or playing with sadly, but you can learn those yourself either through guides or just playing.\n\nthe game is annoying when you deal with certain combos are made, to where the game is almost to surive against or if the whole surviving team is working together with talking as well. But those can be off-set by grinding people. Kinda people who just want to grind for those sweet BP. Eh.\n\nIt's a game you have to see and check out.

Now when I say fun game I don't mean that the game will be fun for every second you play it , that's just impossible. This game can be lame as hell , but when it is fun , it is VERY fun. Now I think dead by daylight is a good game meaning that it has the traits of making the player enjoy it , that including being fun , not terribly hard to learn , and being at least somewhat balanced. And at last the game is unique from most other games and genres, now this is where comes one of it's biggest problems : it's so unique that it is difficult to balance. For example , counter strike global offensive has been out for ages , and lots of shooters like Valorant have learned from mistakes of games like CSGO and that knowledge could be used for balancing out newer patches of games. While with DBD you can't really learn off of other games's mistakes so it's difficult going from a clean sheet of paper. \nBefore I say anything , I don't think the killers , perks, and items im going to be talking about are unplayable against, I just think they make the game be frustrating to play which makes it unfun. I think there are builds , items , and killers you can absolutely abuse to reach the highest rank, and I myself have abused the killer Wraith to reach the peak. And as loads of people start to abuse these things , the community becomes much angrier and in the end more toxic, which is I would say another problem in dbd . People are extremely toxic because you brang certain perks . items , or addons. As though I think this is more of a community problem than game problem , I think it still is good to know for all the people that wanna get into this game. \nBut despite the negativity I think dead by daylight is a great game as it gets updated very often , has a creative dev team , and is one of a kind. I just wanted to say , Thank you BHVR and happy 5 years of this great game , keep it

of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote.\n\nFor starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.\n\nBut you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.\n\nAs Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked.\n\nI mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.\n\nBut what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10.\n\nI wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do.
