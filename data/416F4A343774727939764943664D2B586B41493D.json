By DayLight[/h1]\n     Gra, w której na mapę ląduje pięciu graczy. Czterech z nich stają się bezbronnymi ludźmi, z kolei piąty zostaje seryjnym zabójcą. \n      Zadaniem uciekinierów jest wydostanie się z zamkniętej mapy po przez naprawienie i włączenie odpowiedniej liczby generatorów prądu, pozwalających na otwarcie bram i ucieczkę z terenu mapy, zaś zadaniem zabójcy jest uniemożliwienie tego. Gracze po stronie uciekinierów, przed rozpoczęciem rozgrywki mają możliwość wybrania dla siebie postaci spośród 22, (nie wszystkie są za darmo większość jest z DLC), tak samo jest z graczem grającym zabójcą również posiada opcje wyboru spośród 20 killer`ów (jak w przypadku ocalałych, większość killerów jest płatnych). Rozgrywka trwa do momentu ucieczki ocalałych przez bramy, lub ukryty właz, albo gdy wszyscy uciekinierzy zostaną zabici przez mordercę. Po zakończonym meczu gracze otrzymują punkty krwi, za które można ulepszać postacie. W samej grze znajduje się około 15 lokacji, na których znajdują się różnego typu przeszkody i skrzynie z przedmiotami. Osoby grające uciekinierami widzą grę z perspektywy trzeciej osoby, zaś morderca ma perspektywę pierwszej osoby, co utrudnia mu odnalezienie ocalałych np: w wysokiej trawie.\n       Sama gra podoba mi się i polecam każdemu kto planuje zakupić ową grę, ponieważ po przegraniu 100h w tę grę cały czas czuję chęć powrotu do niej i ciągłego grania szczególnie ze znajomymi, gdzie dopisuje nam humor, oraz nasza kooperacja.

Surprise surprise.\n\n[h1] I can't decide if I should classify this game as an abusive relationship or some kind of stockholm syndrome. [/h1] \n\nTL:DR - There's too many gameplay and balancing issues to ignore unless you fit into 1 of the 2 categories above, which it seems like a majority of players do.\n\nThis game is only popular because there's no competition yet. Games like VHS and Evil Dead are similar but don't have as much traction as Dead by Daylight. Evil Dead was just released and looks extremely fun compared to DBD.\n\nI don't launch the game anymore unless my [u]one[/u] specific friend asks me to play, and it's usually just to meme on it/destroy killers.\n\n_________\n\nBuy it on a sale if you're looking to play Survivor and have at least 2-3 friends. It's probably one of the worst games in my library to solo queue in since there's always strong inconsistency in your team's skill level compared to yours. If there is at least 1 survivor on your team that isn't too skilled, the rest of the match will become an unenjoyable struggle. \n\nIf this happens, you'll most likely be running the Killer around for a majority of the match while your teammates are hiding in lockers or crouching around the map (which isn't how they help you escape/win).\n\n_________\n\nDon't buy it if you're looking to have a single non-stressful match as Killer. Survivors will most likely dominate you in the slightly higher ranks and you'll be juggled around with their coordination, crutch/second-chance perks and their occasional flashlight/fast toolbox.\n\nThis is the reason why I, and many others, don't play killer anymore.\n\n_________\n\nIf you have some morals and a decent Survivor team, you'll occasionally feel bad for winning because of how badly you beat the Killer. There's matches where the Killer gets 0-25% of their objective done at the end of the game. Just feels like a bullying simulator half the time because of how imbalanced everything is.\n\nIf the Killer is doing too well, survivors will just DC (disconnect) or give up and stop moving all together. \n\nIf you're playing a Killer they don't like (usually the strongest ones like Nurse and Blight), the survivors will also DC. I've honestly done that too, but that was back when I didn't really know how to play the game and I thought some aspects were too overpowered/uncounterable, like Bubba's chainsaw. I've seen survivors with more than double my playtime do that in high MMR. It's toxic and they 100% know how to play against the Killer but chose not to because it's harder than other ones you can face.\n\n_________\n\nThe gameplay developers also make extremely questionable decisions. Most updates make the game worse for killers and better for survivors, which fits the bias they've had for years.\n\nThere are currently 204 perks in the game (including DLC). Killers have 97 perks while survivors have 107. You can only use 4 in a match. \n\nIt sounds like there's a lot of different combinations and perks builds you can do, but there is so much bloat and terribly designed perks in this game that most people only run the same 5 meta perks because the other 100~ are inferior due to how they're all balanced. You'll occasionally see someone using 1-2 off meta perks, but they're usually paired with the 5 meta perk options I mentioned above. This makes the game very stale very quick. \n\nYou can obviously not use any of the 5 meta perks to shake things up, but anything else is a severe downgrade in a majority of the matches.\n\nI won't go any further into their bad gameplay decisions, but anyone who's play for long enough (and isn't a brainwashed survivor main) knows there's a lot of them. The developers also have too much of an ego and ignore ideas that would better the game. If they didn't think of the idea themselves, there's a 99% chance it'll never be in the game.\n\nThe art team/developers on the other hand are amazing at their jobs. Environments on the updated maps are fantastic and so are the skins and killer designs. Main menu and killer chase music is usually great.\n\n10/10 for the art team and music team. Sorry your talent is getting thrown into this game.\n1/10 for the developers who thoughts endless speed healing circles were a good idea.\n\n_________\n\nEverything I've said is all on top of Dead by Daylight being one of the most toxic gaming communities (teabags and macro/autoclicker flashlight spamming, endgame text chat), random and purposeful DC's from both sides, paywall perks that are need to win most matches in the current meta, mindless in-game point grinding that's exponentially getting worse with every update, face camping (which is a pretty viable killer strategy but is the most boring play style in any game I've ever played) and roleplaying Killers (Bubba's basement box defending, which is basically throwing the game and not making it fun for anyone).\n\nDead by Daylight is not a great gaming experience. It's better than it was years ago, but the gameplay development isn't going in the right direction. I don't launch the game anymore unless my one friend asks me to play, and it's usually just to meme on it.\n\nThis game is only popular because there's no competition yet. Games like VHS and Evil Dead are similar but don't have as much traction as Dead by Daylight. Evil Dead was just released and looks extremely fun compared to DBD\n\nOverall, watching DBD on Youtube and living vicariously through Tru3 or Otzdarva is more enjoyable than actually playing the game yourself.\n_________\n\n[u] Here are some other reviews that are pretty accurate: [/u]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/NemesisSieg/recommended/381210/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/december_man/recommended/381210/","timestamp_created":1593133897,"timestamp_updated":1653079500,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71356589","author":{"steamid":"76561198399758714","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":24420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16195,"last_played":1654387736},"language":"schinese","review":"修最好的电机，挨最毒的打","timestamp_created":1593133388,"timestamp_updated":1593133388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71356348","author":{"steamid":"76561198271348427","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":86,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1593130655},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel oyun beğendim","timestamp_created":1593133077,"timestamp_updated":1593133077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71356317","author":{"steamid":"76561199023935835","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1660489972},"language":"schinese","review":"No Jason Wohess","timestamp_created":1593133048,"timestamp_updated":1605380353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71356312","author":{"steamid":"76561198299383426","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1635212926},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดีครับ","timestamp_created":1593133041,"timestamp_updated":1593133041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71356243","author":{"steamid":"76561198856522322","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1648349242},"language":"brazilian","review":"hi","timestamp_created":1593132954,"timestamp_updated":1593132954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71355572","author":{"steamid":"76561198363521862","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":11293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7844,"last_played":1654699377},"language":"schinese","review":"每次当屠夫我都血压飙升：）","timestamp_created":1593132233,"timestamp_updated":1593132233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71355558","author":{"steamid":"76561198107904703","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":18407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7060,"last_played":1651953152},"language":"latam","review":"𝚄𝚗𝚊 𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚊 𝚌𝚘𝚜𝚊, 𝚞𝚗𝚊 𝙲𝚕𝚊𝚞𝚍𝚎𝚝𝚝𝚎 𝚎𝚗 𝚎𝚕 𝚝𝚎𝚊𝚖 𝚎𝚜 𝚒𝚗𝚜𝚝𝚊 𝙶𝙶, 𝚎𝚜 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚘 𝚎𝚗 𝚕𝚊𝚜 𝚙𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚌𝚞𝚕𝚊𝚜 𝚚𝚞𝚎 𝚜𝚒𝚎𝚖𝚙𝚛𝚎 𝚖𝚞𝚎𝚛𝚎 𝚎𝚕 𝚗𝚎𝚐𝚛𝚘 𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚘.
