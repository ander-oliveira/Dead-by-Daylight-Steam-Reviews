I have never purposely dc'd in my life.\n\nThe game knows I didn't DC, it still gives me my points, but bans me from playing because fuck me, right?  I deserve to be punished since the game barely functions.  \n\nReminds me of how the game de-pips my ranking when ANOTHER player DC's.  The is a horror of a game, but not in the way you think.\n\nI would be an a**hole if I recommended this game to anyone.\n\nBut I'm still gonna, because it's awesome.  The bugs are many and are usually just ignored.  You can buy DLC that barely functions and it might get fixed in a few months.  Some never get fixed.  Matchmaking is terrible, the survivor community is entitled and embraces toxicity.\n\nBut it's so much fun killing them.  Survivors will taunt you for no reason, they'll dance around like they won even when you win, they'll berate you after game no matter what.\n\nBut you can kill them.  Killing people who annoy me is so much fun.  Being the killer is so much fun.  There's no game like DBD.  Even at my angriest and most frustrated, I come back and as soon as I start killing I remember why it's worth it.\n\nSo I would recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1607459992,"timestamp_updated":1616862870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81857275","author":{"steamid":"76561198954007207","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1783,"last_played":1655579438},"language":"english","review":"it

played a lot of Dead By Daylight recently and it's cemented itself as a staple of my gaming time over the last several months. \nAsymmetric PvP pitting a Killer vs Survivors is an interesting premise, but the more I dive into it the more I appreciate it as a game in a way I haven't since Team Fortress 2. There's tons of small design decisions that help or hinder each team and create a really engaging game. Killers play very differently from survivors, and each killer offers a unique ability that shapes their gameplay. There are 66-72 perks available per side, which also keeps things fresh.\n\nThings that stand out:\nThe game itself is unlike anything else out there. The way that chases, powers, and the tools each side has is incredibly interesting and refreshing. Shorter matches also keep things from getting too crazy, and the progression keeps me interested.\n\nThe way each character (both killer and survivor) starts with 3 unique perks that after leveling that character up will become available to others. This not only shapes an initial new playstyle that can be iteratively customized, but also incentives players to try a bunch of characters and add their tools to everyone's collection. The killers themselves provide a wide variety of playstyles, so it becomes much harder to burn out on the game. Daily quests (Rituals) and seasonal challenges (Tomes) also encourage playing different characters for bonus currency, and the Tomes provide a sort of meta progression that also unlocks lore and feeds into a Battlepass.\n\nI know progression is a stickler for may people, so I'd like to take some time to talk about it. To me it's a system that does not abuse the player, but provides a lot of reward for playing the game. Each match awards Blood Points, which are used to unlock new consumable items, perks, and otherwise progress the level of each character. There's some randomized elements to what's available at each bloodweb, but there's lots of player choice here.\n\nBlood Points are fantastic for two reasons. \nFirst, players want and need them to unlock new tools and provide a great sense of forward progress even if you feel like you're not playing well, and they are usable across all characters (so you can unlock on one while playing on another).\nSecondly, they're awarded not for \"winning\" but for completing certain actions (with some caps). This means that often times a quick match and toxic behavior will result in lower points for both sides. It's a fantastic tool for the developers to incentivise behavior that makes for the most compelling experience for both sides. (They've worked it into fiction too, but that's another topic). Also, they award points if there's a quitter in your match to mollify it a bit.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic game and I'm excited to see who gets added next.","timestamp_created":1607451131,"timestamp_updated":1607451131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81850462","author":{"steamid":"76561198380696249","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2789,"last_played":1654662646},"language":"english","review":"very good","timestamp_created":1607451126,"timestamp_updated":1607451126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81850457","author":{"steamid":"76561199078773489","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1638034680},"language":"english","review":"Ive been playing dead by daylight on almost every system, Switch, Xboxone, and Ps4, And my reviews are the same even with PC\n\nPOSITIVES\n* Its fun when your bored and want a couple of quick matches\n* They are constantly updating the game with new Quirks\n* Multiple Different Killers to Play\n* It is simple and easy to figure out the controls, not alot of thought process involved to playing\n* If you enjoy something that makes your heart pound this is the game cause the difficulty to hide, sneak, run, from one killer is the challenge \n* playing with friends is alot more fun then alone, and since its multiplayer you have the option to do so.\n* You can customize your killer and player which is always a positve\n* Graphics are decent \n\nNEGATIVES\n* The price point i feel is a little too high especially when they make DLCs every 3 months\n* The Killers is what makes the game honestly, If they are horrible , The game will be horrible, Same with Team mates So have to have an Equal balance\n* Like all online games Depending on other peoples connection depends on how your game is ran.\n* They need to make more maps, plain and simple\n\n\nThis is Just my opinion some people might have a different view and thats okay :) I still think this is a great game to play.","timestamp_created":1607451115,"timestamp_updated":1607451115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81850374","author":{"steamid":"76561198399955228","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":86300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":127,"playtime_at_review":64824,"last_played":1659871128},"language":"japanese","review":"アップデートを重ね、度重なるキラーナーフで嫌気がさしています\n惰性でプレイしていますが、新規にプレイされることはお勧めしません","timestamp_created":1607451019,"timestamp_updated":1607451019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492507368326187134","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81850266","author":{"steamid":"76561199021965897","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4421,"last_played":1658610787},"language":"romanian","review":"Este un joc de strategie, putin horror dar si foarte funny!
