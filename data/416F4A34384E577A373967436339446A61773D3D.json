This game does what is basically a friday the 13th game (only now this is very different from the upcoming 2017 Friday the 13th The Game) One person plays as one of 6 current killers, each with a special ability or tool, first is the trapper, he is the default killer that appeard in the beta, he uses a big cleaver as his primary, but can us bear traps to catch the surviviors, then there is the wraith, he uses a syth but has the ability to turn invisible using a wailing bell to catch the survivors off guard, then there is the hillbilly, he has a sledgehammer and a charge chainsaw, then there is the nurse, she has a blink ability to teleport across the map, finally there is Michael Myers(The Shape) and the Hag. Michael Myers can stalk you, the more he stalks, the more his power goes up, giving him the ability to one hit you, at last there is the hag, she is the most recently added killer, she uses traps the spawn a clone of her that she can teleport into at any time or when a survivor trips it, to be honest, the hag is too OP at this moment, so make sure that you look for patches, because this is ridiculous, otherwise, great game.","timestamp_created":1481245595,"timestamp_updated":1481378519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28262867","author":{"steamid":"76561198081256681","num_games_owned":638,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":39930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24799,"last_played":1656126272},"language":"english","review":"Changed my review from thumbs down to thumb up, previous bugs have been fixed, new content, much better then Friday the 13th.","timestamp_created":1481245448,"timestamp_updated":1505404759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28262822","author":{"steamid":"76561198053688900","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":71053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46483,"last_played":1633192455},"language":"spanish","review":"Divertido a veces","timestamp_created":1481245102,"timestamp_updated":1570491535,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28262552","author":{"steamid":"76561198097164779","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":12304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7645,"last_played":1627939032},"language":"english","review":"The more DLC That is made the less thought through the characters become why is this?

Some I haven't even started on and then on top of that there is the killers to level. At the rate they are releasing DLC, I'll never be able to max them all. If you get this to max out all the characters, killers and survivors, hunker down cause you're in for a long haul. \n\nThe survivors have their own personality per se but they become cookie cutter as each one's unique skills can be learned by the others (same for killers). The devs are trying to push diversity by buffing/nerfing/introducing skills but there are some that you have to have on both sides if you want to \"win\"\n\nThe killers have a strong diversity and each one with their own unigue way of trying to kill you. Herein lies the one major flaw. You have to be alive to aquire points in order to level your survivor if you go that route. This simple point is what divides the community and YOU WILL run into some of the nicest people and downright ugliest human beings in existance. If you get this game, you need to understand that the killer is there to....you guessed it....kill you. The killers get their points to level themselves by a number of means and it all involves stopping you from escaping and ultimately, your death. You cannot come into this game thinking everything is sunshine and rainbows or you will be in for a bad time. It is just like every other game that pits sides against one another; both sides want to win. In this game, that usually comes at a price of the other side not getting their points which leads to the constant (DO NOT GO TO THE DISCUSSIONS/REDDIT/ETC FOR THIS GAME) negative attitudes seen everywhere.\n\nAs for the developers, I am somewhere in the middle with them as their communication is very lackluster. I understand they have a mountain of players on both sides that they just have to ignore because of crying of unfairness but in doing so, they lose communication with those that actually have game breaking bugs or the worlds most unstable connection capability to get into a game at all. They do host a stream and try, but it comes off as \"troll-y\" and the best answers are \"we know of this bug and we are working on it\". Turn around time is abyssmal on bugs and there are some that are in the game since launch that are still around. They're trying but it doesn't feel like we are getting their all.\n\nTL:DR \nI think the positives out weigh the negatives for now.\n\nBuy this game if you want some scares, some thrilling chases or have a need to conjure your inner killer. DLC comes out steadily and new content is added constantly.\n\nAvoid this game if you are looking for a completed bug-free production, guarenteed lag free games, actual human players, clear lines of communication from the developers, a stable, friendly, decent community or an end game to get to.","timestamp_created":1481239838,"timestamp_updated":1481239838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28261884","author":{"steamid":"76561198121055004","num_games_owned":543,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":152489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1658095485},"language":"swedish","review":"awsome game!","timestamp_created":1481239831,"timestamp_updated":1481239831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28261800","author":{"steamid":"76561198052446066","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":90884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":63,"playtime_at_review":38320,"last_played":1660571864},"language":"german","review":"About me in Dead By Daylight\n\nMain Survivor\n\n每 Claudette Morell ♡\n\nOther Survivors i Play:\n\n每 Ace Visconnti \n\n每 Nea Carlson\n\n每 Meg Thomas\n\nAbout Me As Player:\n\n每 Toxic Flashlight Survivor\n\n每 360's for Breakfast\n\n每 Pallet Looping \n\n\nPlaying Time around 600hrs+","timestamp_created":1481239358,"timestamp_updated":1525117019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472392618656158447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28261565","author":{"steamid":"76561198324582416","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":47740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4119,"last_played":1515841753},"language":"english","review":"its laggy since new patch has alot of errors not good game ur wasting ur money :(","timestamp_created":1481238144,"timestamp_updated":1481238144,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.44871792197227478","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28261485","author":{"steamid":"76561198255718104","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6481,"last_played":1618480747},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing game!!","timestamp_created":1481237722,"timestamp_updated":1481237722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28261193","author":{"steamid":"76561198096031361","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":28726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11823,"last_played":1620533596},"language":"spanish","review":"Quiero actualizar mi critica a este juego (escribo esto el 5/3/2018) \nEl juego es divertido pero tiene muchos fallos, el hecho de que no tenga servidores propios es uno de los principales problemas para todos, pero especialmente para los que jugamos en Latino america, tambien el machmaking es una basura el Lag y asesinos que hacen el juego odioso y aburrido.\n\nEN UNA ESCALA DEL 1 AL 10 CLASIFICO A ESTE JUEGO EN UN 5/10 PERO SI COMPRAS LOS DLC 6/10 [Aunque muchos de los DLC son basura cuidado ;) ]\n\nPD:El juego no es lo suficientemente bueno para recomendarlo, pero es bastante divertido si tienes un equipo con quien jugarlo\n\nACTUALIZACION 05-02-2020\n\nArreglaron muchas cosas, basicamente el lag es casi inexistente, aunque se fueron a la mierda con los DLC, ahora todos los asesinos que salen son de pago, ya no entregan asesinos gratis cada cierto tiempo, como antes.

You're aware of your surroundings and are on constant alert for the killer. Then in the silence, a faint heartbeat is heard...you know the killer is close. As the heartbeat gets louder you decide it's better to survive than be caught, so you slowly creep away to hide behind a boulder. But it was too late, the killer spotted your crouched silhouette and starts lumbering right towards you. You sprint away, not worrying about the trail you leave behind, all that matters now... is escape. You run, looking for any path that could throw him off your trail. The heartbeat is now accompanied by a anxiety inducing grinding noise...you know he's closer. You dodge around trees and hay bales, hoping he slips up. The music and heartbeat more intense than ever and now a red glow shines on your back. You know he is right behind you know. Your blood flushes from your head, and just as the killer swings their weapon, you slam a pallet down between the two of you, stunning the killer. As you hear his moans of frustration at his ruined kill, you hop through an open window and slowly crawl out into cover. You crouch in hiding, as you watch him search the area for you. He eventually give up chase and goes off to find another survivor. You crawl away, looking for the next generator to repair and hopefully make way for your escape. \n\n\n\nIf you've ever played Amnesia, then you know about the water filled hallway sequence. Dead by Daylight is that...but for the whole time...and it's awesome!\nThis is honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time.  Are there balance tweeks to be made? Yes..But every game like this has tweeks to be made. It's a constant balance that doesn't ever really end, and I think the devs are doing a great job at it. The feeling of escape or the feeling of a perfect kill is great. Being the last survivor and finally escaping through the hatch after a long cat and mouse game is also one of the big highlights of this game. \nDont let the naysayers with \"OP!\" and \"It's BROKEN!\" and \"UNFAIR!\" throw you off...

Die Teams wollen das andere Team ausschalten durch Sandbagging um zu Gewinnen, oder halt wer am Ende die meisten Punkte hat, wenn alle tot sind, gewinnt.

Em partes, por exemplo a DLC Halloween, o assassino Michael Myers que vem nessa DLC é muito mais forte do que os outros assassinos disponíveis gratuitamente no game, porém você pode conseguir as habilidades dele comprando suas perks ensináveis com \"dinheiro\" do jogo e aplicá-las nos outros killers, isso também vale para todos os assassinos e sobreviventes, pagos e gratuitos.\n\n[*][h1][b]Pontos positivos:[/b][/h1]\n[*]Viciante\n[*]Gráficos (não são realistas, mas possui uma arte muito bonita)\n[*]Sonorização e trilha sonora espetaculares\n[*]Muitos players (o que não significa que há muitas salas)\n[*]Assustador\n[*]Conquistas desafiadoras\n[*]Boa equipe de desenvolvimente que ouve a comunidade (em partes)\n\n[*][h1][b]Pontos negativos:[/b][/h1]\n[*]Bugs, bugs e mais bugs\n[*]Sistema de servidores ruim","timestamp_created":1481213004,"timestamp_updated":1489165115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":58,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.748031437397003174","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28255029","author":{"steamid":"76561198085539831","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":25378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3929,"last_played":1650560560},"language":"thai","review":"ได้อยู่ๆๆ","timestamp_created":1481212783,"timestamp_updated":1481212783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28254699","author":{"steamid":"76561198280802252","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1513,"last_played":1580822538},"language":"thai","review":"คับ","timestamp_created":1481211621,"timestamp_updated":1481211642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28254662","author":{"steamid":"76561198128132694","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":19226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8519,"last_played":1657808020},"language":"italian","review":"gran bel gioco\n","timestamp_created":1481211460,"timestamp_updated":1481211460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28254619","author":{"steamid":"76561198287805119","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5360,"last_played":1616787767},"language":"german","review":"Super Spiel :) Wenn man erstmal ein paar Runden gezockt hat, kann man nicht mehr aufhören.
