This is a fantastic game, with great mechanics, and only about 6 or 7 major bugs and glitches. Sometimes they cause you to get killed, and that's unfortunate, but over all a good game...\n...or at least it was. Then they introduced the killer known as \"The Nightmare\". He is SO overwhelmingly overpowered that he is really no fun to play against. Also, he is PAID content, so they have effectively made the game \"Pay to win\", which is truly one of the more terrible things to be as a game. I didn't mind the The Doctor, The Shape, The Cannibal and the Hag being paid DLC, because even though they are much better than the regular killers, and still sort of pay to win, you can still out play them fairly well with stealth and quick thinking. The nightmare effectively ELIMNATES an element of the game, which is stealth and evasion, because he is COMPLETELY invisible. Also, once he is visible, (once you have aggro from him) he can see you at ALL TIMES! So either you can't see him, or he can ALWAYS see you. He needs a rework, or at the very least a handicap to make this game fun again. I almost always just give up against The Nightmare so I can get on to the next game. It's as if you were playing your favorite game, and every 5th level was a level where overpowered enemies mercilessly destroyed you and everything you were working towards, all while laughing at you. Every once in a while you manage to kill one of them, but eventually you are overwhelmed, beaten, and sent to the next level with a bunch of your stuff destroyed.","timestamp_created":1509966201,"timestamp_updated":1509966201,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46728631854057312","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36319141","author":{"steamid":"76561198003635294","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":6314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1519,"last_played":1637970201},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный пример того, какой должен быть асинхронный мультиплеер !

I sucked at first, but I got better. I gathered all those well-earned bloodpoints to earn those perks needed to give you an edge BOTH as survivor and killer honestly and cleanly like the tryhard I usually am. Soon I had a level 50 survivor and began to level others to gain their perks as well as I played, same went for a killer who I made a beast with time, patience and hard work. I really thought this game was rewarding and deserved all my bloodpoint-farming, I really thoguht I EARNED my right to all these things by giving in to the rules set by the game and I was fine with that. I had really worked hard to earn ALL that I had and I felt good about it. \n\nOh yes, all was fine and dandy until that one day when I lost ALL my progress in a heartbeat. After being kicked out from a botched lobby by the killer, I found myself staring a naked dwight and those zeroes up in the corner where my bloodpoints had been before. Oh gee-wiz, how will we get out of this one Batman? So I get in contact with the 'developers' of this game since it had been said that they had 'support' to give.\n\nOk, I write my email about what happened, I stated about what I had lost perk-wise and blood-point wise and asked IF I could get them back somehow. I waited for WEEKS to get an answer and finally, I got it. What did they tell me? Basically what they said was this: we cannot give you back any perks, only give you an amount of bloodpoints that does NOT exceed the STUPID limit that the game has set to 500 000 which means that they could only give back rouhgly 13 levels of 50 worth of character progress. Yes, all my hard work to get almost two survivors up to 50 plus a killer and all they do is shrug and say 'we don't care'. Then it happened to three of my friends shorlty afterwards, none of which recieved back what they had worked so hard for either.\n\nThis is was it came down to, non-caring developers without any feelings of need to keep their players happy or admit that their game has SERIOUS flaws. What did they do instead around a year ago? Realse shitty dlc with more killers and survivors and had no game improvements whatsoever.\n\nAnd that's when I realized, these guys are NOT worth my money or my time any longer. I decided to 'redeem' my account MYSELF and as we all know, that is hardly according to the games 'rules' but I did so without looking back. I managed to get it all back myself, thanks to this game's inept programming it was EASY to hack bloodpoints and it was even EASIER to duplicate items and perks. \n\nAfter that I played happily again and enjoyed this game to the fullest, no regrets, no mercy. I did this until NOW, about a year later, and what did I find out a few weeks ago? \n\nI got banned.\n\nOne could think I don't think I deserve it, but I kind of do. I cheated, cheaters should get banned and I eventually bit the bullet (*cough* one YEAR LATER *cough*). But let me make one thing clear: I would never have given this game so much of my time if I didn't think it deserved it and after the savefile-incident and how the devs treated it I don't care what they think is cheating or not anymore. They don't deserve the 'good' players more than they deserve our money.\n\nI guess I just wanted to say, in the end, that some things can be prevented by taking care of your players that love the game INSTEAD of treating us a money-generating cattle. \n \nPros:\nThe killers were cool and are still cool, playing both sides as survivor and killer are equally rewarding and fun when done without tryharding too much. The game has become better with time, just wished they had gotten to these changes much sooner when it was desperately needed. All in all, today, this game is good. \n\nBuy it, enjoy it with your friends BUT be wary, if something goes wrong with your game expect no help or care from above. You have been warned.\n\nCons:\nThe developers. It is sad, because the game and its playerbase deserves better. \n\nThe salty community can be horrible but don't take it too seriously, it also means that players do think that this game is worth putting effort into and that's not usually a bad thing.","timestamp_created":1509962351,"timestamp_updated":1509962576,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591060101985931396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36318284","author":{"steamid":"76561198117897841","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":157,"playtime_at_review":10650,"last_played":1660229410},"language":"japanese","review":"やめられないとまらないかっぱえびせん","timestamp_created":1509962071,"timestamp_updated":1509962071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521287143230438232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36318246","author":{"steamid":"76561198314585554","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":51774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14131,"last_played":1657417393},"language":"english","review":"Good game and verry addictive!","timestamp_created":1509961886,"timestamp_updated":1589295902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47804790735244751","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36318194","author":{"steamid":"76561198152592386","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2112,"last_played":1558851857},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1509961684,"timestamp_updated":1509961684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36318150","author":{"steamid":"76561198340739676","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1510983839},"language":"koreana","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1509961357,"timestamp_updated":1509961357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36318073","author":{"steamid":"76561198062619187","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3773,"last_played":1654872434},"language":"english","review":"Nice game to play with friends as survivors against outsider killer.

There's no attrition because of the Self Care perk which allows you to heal up without a medkit. As well as a Sabotage perk that let's you destroy all of the hooks minus the dungeon ones. Not only that, but killer's can only hook a survivor from one direction which makes sense however survivors can unhook from any angle, doesn't make sense at all and allows for cheap expoitive divehooking where both survivors can run off scot free because the killer has to stop and lick his weapon for each hit. Meanwhile both run off and heal up while other survivors are doing gen's and escaping. It's a 1v4 game, but the killer get nothing to help stop survivors unless you grind for weeks trying to get the right perks in a randomly generated system. This wouldn't be so bad, but the matchmaking is godawful and a brand new player will be put with people who have fully lvled up their characters. I have played on both sides Survivor and Killer and while I enjoy Killer it's much more stressful as almot every survivor will loop around vaults and pallets to waste your time while playing as Survivor is only stressful if your teammates don't know what the hell they're doing and it quickly becomes a 1v1, but then all you have to do is hide and look for the hatch. My biggest problem is this game does not feel like a scary game like it should, instead of survivors hiding and waiting for perfect moments they use cheap tricks to block the killer from moving, hooking, even attacking. There are all able to do this because the killer just isn't dangerous enough to need to hide from. A survivor should not be able to just sit there and pull a lever while the killer slash's their back, lick their blade, and try for another hit if they haven't already escaped.","timestamp_created":1509920524,"timestamp_updated":1509920524,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.416817009449005127","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36309583","author":{"steamid":"76561198099818593","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":46719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":25907,"last_played":1660018228},"language":"english","review":"It is going to be good game, Im going to play it.","timestamp_created":1509919383,"timestamp_updated":1528811267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.378787875175476074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36309514","author":{"steamid":"76561198033665457","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":18323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10314,"last_played":1543260771},"language":"russian","review":"Фреди все убил,  вообще все,  играть за выживших стало не реально, играть за убийцу это значит ждать по 10-20 минут  выживших.

But the glitches are just too many, and you'll just end up getting amazingly frustrated and that'll ruin whatever fun you've had already for that session.\n\nSo no, save yourself the trouble and don't invest in this.","timestamp_created":1509918450,"timestamp_updated":1509918450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517893314361572266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36309087","author":{"steamid":"76561198367217547","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":48448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45088,"last_played":1655753816},"language":"russian","review":"Не покупайте","timestamp_created":1509917837,"timestamp_updated":1633451428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36308974","author":{"steamid":"76561198071264473","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":36337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17549,"last_played":1658921870},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy entretenido, pa jugar muchas horas, que ya no tiene tanto bug y ahora si tiene un buen matchmaking...","timestamp_created":1509917528,"timestamp_updated":1543333906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36308538","author":{"steamid":"76561198131271749","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":81807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10489,"last_played":1648777375},"language":"english","review":"I think we did a good job :^)\n\nEDIT: We really did a good job :)\n\nEDIT: Everything is fine :)","timestamp_created":1509916113,"timestamp_updated":1606435443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36308370","author":{"steamid":"76561198150907478","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":38127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1658976846},"language":"english","review":"This game fucking sucks, i love it","timestamp_created":1509915608,"timestamp_updated":1649458366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36308242","author":{"steamid":"76561198407119527","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5641,"last_played":1510523613},"language":"brazilian","review":"SERVIDORES COM PROBLEMAS","timestamp_created":1509915197,"timestamp_updated":1509915197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36307497","author":{"steamid":"76561198096254482","num_games_owned":430,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":9322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4505,"last_played":1636409577},"language":"english","review":"I have been a player of the most toxic games for many years: League Of Legends, CS:GO, Rocket League, basically every free to play multiplayer out there, and dear god, I think I found the gem of the crown.\nWhen I got DbD a couple of months ago, I got a hard time getting into it, but once I did, I had lots of fun, or at least I did, before getting into ranks 15-10. Holy shit, it got into a shit show of cathastrophic proportions. Between the killers that camped every survivor they could hook because their parents didn't love them as a child or the survivors that think this is a goddamn parkour game, every game turns into a complete mess and waste of times. You sometimes find those wholesome games where 2 survivors die and 2 manage to escape, and sometimes you find those killers that kill 3 and let the last one escape, either because they want ranks to move forward or they are some kind of twisted sadistic individuals that plan to snipe the poor survivor in a future game, giving them a simple break from death. But hey those are the fun games, for both parts of the spectrum, but sadly those are really rare. Both sides of the community, killers and survivors, are in a constant war against eachother. They both think they are the underdog of the game but truth be told the blame goes to the game. This type of game will never work, it has piss poor balance on both sides, theres only a handful of remotely useful perks that are almost of obligatory use, and all the others fall flat, i'd say only 25% of the perks of each side aren't just a dead space on your loadout. This problem makes each side's perks really predictable and forces a playstyle that goes against the spirit of the game. In one side killers start camping and survivors start pallet looping, and it's a vicious cycle: a killer frustrated after a game against pallet loopers goes out to play as a survivor and play as a pallet looper, and a survivor frustrated with a camping killer, picks killer in the next game and camps every survivor. DbD will never leave this cycle, the game is completely rotten, both due to the salty and toxic community, but also because it falls flat as a game, and I don't really blame the devs, this is a really hard type of game to moderate. One of the biggest problems in my opinion is the payoff of the end of every game: you feel bad when you win and feel bad when you lose, and that should never ever happen in a videogame.\n\nTL;DR- Falls flat as a game due to toxic community and poor balancing","timestamp_created":1509912995,"timestamp_updated":1509917216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562913894653320313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36307434","author":{"steamid":"76561198347597220","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6375,"last_played":1616299183},"language":"english","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1509912789,"timestamp_updated":1509912789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36306981","author":{"steamid":"76561198389541603","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":122077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33027,"last_played":1657229874},"language":"english","review":"rlly good game, I think they did a rlly good job :D","timestamp_created":1509911359,"timestamp_updated":1509911359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51327437162399292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36306968","author":{"steamid":"76561198155629128","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1647127478},"language":"czech","review":"Nerfněte tu, co hazí sekerky jinak ok (2017)\n\njo kamo ta co hazi sekerky je fakt nahovno","timestamp_created":1509911333,"timestamp_updated":1603571276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36306934","author":{"steamid":"76561198265408166","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1641922943},"language":"italian","review":"Bel gioco e abbastanza equilibrato, se non fosse per alcuni bug che decidono la partita!","timestamp_created":1509911226,"timestamp_updated":1509911226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36306875","author":{"steamid":"76561198359543573","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6045,"last_played":1553119202},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun but the devs barely give info on whats happening.
