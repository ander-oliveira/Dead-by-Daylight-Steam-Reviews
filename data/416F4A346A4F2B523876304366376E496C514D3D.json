I really like the killers and I appreciate the huge amount of pop-culture related killers and survivors from various movies. The fact plenty of killers have their own theme while chasing your ass makes my heart warm. Although DLCs (and game itself) is better to be purchased on sale (which are often 50% off on any events on steam), I think it's still worth buying without discount. The game is buggy and it's one of the core problems there. Overall, I really enjoy playing this game and I recommend it to everyone who likes multiplayer survival horror games.","timestamp_created":1640256003,"timestamp_updated":1640256003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106345838","author":{"steamid":"76561198372169865","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1651551380},"language":"russian","review":"Вчера игру за 549 покупал, сегодня она стоит 274, ну и просто эта игра конченная,буду заходить в нее с хорошим настроением,а выходить с СУКА ХУЕВЫМ","timestamp_created":1640255434,"timestamp_updated":1640444238,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441605865955352783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106345793","author":{"steamid":"76561198123441227","num_games_owned":641,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":44319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1774,"playtime_at_review":16058,"last_played":1660128502},"language":"english","review":"Do not mind my hours. Altough the fun it offers from time to time, I am simply continuing on because I would like to get all achievements , this game does not deserve absolutely anyone's time, energy and effort and believe me when I say it, Behaviour is probably the WORST company I have ever seen when it comes to ignoring community feedback and greed. They are somehow extremely incompetent while also being obnoxious and overconfident about what they do. There is so much wrong with this game, from hit validation issues to incompetent matchmaking, to SBMM (mmr), to incompetent outdated ways of programming a game, to refusing to implement very simple solutions that could fix a lot of their server lag and other types of balancing issues but REFUSING to do so, to not punishing people enough for leaving matches or not doing it properly (such as giving the same punishment to someone whose game just crashed and someone who disconnected by their own volition )or abuse toxic playstyles like facecamping for killers (because the game awards sacrifices and not actual competent gameplay), or survivors being allowed and even ENDORSED to use stretched resolution which for a fact literally breaks the game ESPECIALLY for stealth killers like Ghostface and so so much more that you could look into by researching a bit. And (as a bonus complaint) in their sales they legit refuse to go above 30% (on select skins mind you, not all) in the in game market. There were times where the stuff they did pissed me off so badly I considered sending actual anon hate mail.

However, and this is a big however, the game is absolutely muddied by odd mechanical design choices, microtransaction pushing, cancerous playstyles from both Killers and Survivors that is self perpetuating, and a meta that is frequently just not fun.\n\nIn fact, \"Fun\" is a key word here.\nThis game is at its best when it is new and fresh and you have no idea what is going on. The more you learn about it, though, the more you realize how lazy, awkward, and ill considered many of its elements are. This will inevitably (believe me) bring you into the topic of \"Why is it designed like this\" at which point you'll be drawn to the developer's and their input. And given how the developers actually interact with their community (in the most complacent of ways), it makes many of these issues worse; they are AWARE of the community's complaints, they just don't care. Why do they not care? Because Dead by Daylight has no real competition.\n\nWhen you inevitably hit the wall built into this game and you find yourself either getting bored or frustrated, just know literally nothing is going to change. And based on that factor alone, I can't recommend this game. I've played it off and on for years, likely still will, but that's only because it just HAPPENED to become the game with Pyramid Head, Nemesis, Micheal Myers, Freddy Krueger, and various other properties in it.

e sinceridade de alguém que ama esse game, joga ele tem bastante tempo e tá insatisfeito com a situação atual dele:\n\nTodo mundo sabe o quanto eu gosto bastante do gênero terror Slasher, onde o próprio se caracteriza por ser um gênero q contém sobreviventes adolescentes ou com projetos de esteriótipos e um assassino icônico do terror. Lá em 2016, quando o game foi lançado e eu conheci ele pela primeira vez, eu senti q logo de cara eu já ia gostar dele por trazer até as telas de um videogame eletrônico o q eu sempre quis ver: Um game que coloca 4 sobreviventes contra 1 assassino. A premissa inicial do game era ser um jogo de terror online; mas ela acabou evoluindo pra um game de suspense/chasing onde você conseguia se divertir bastante enfrentando diversos Killers com habilidades bem diferentes e apresentando uma variação gratificante em relação ao design proposto dele. No mesmo ano, a Behaviour, dona do game, anunciou um crossover com a franquia Halloween, e a partir disso, eu mergulhei de uma vez no game e me senti mt imerso com as possibilidades que ele tinha a oferecer. E os anos foram passando, e cada vez mais víamos mais crossovers com franquias de terror famosas: Freddy. de A Hora do Pesadelo; Leatherface, de O Massacre da Serra Elétrica; Pyramid Head, de Silent Hill; entre outros. Os diversos crossovers chamaram atenção de muita gente pro game e ele ganhou um nicho de popularidade grande e digno para o crescimento dele ao longo dos anos, porém, n foram apenas maravilhas q ele apresentou. Durante esses 5 anos de jogo, quase 6, a engine do game foi mal refinada e, a cada vez chegava uma nova att grande, apresentando um killer novo e um survivor novo, vinha tb uma porrada de bugs e uma má otimização causando problemas técnicos ocasionais como drops de FPS ou servidores lagados. Mesmo com todos esses bugs, o game ainda podia ser muito aproveitado e qualquer jogador, até msm os casuais, poderiam se divertir horas e horas fugindo do assassino ou caçando sobreviventes. Isso tudo até chegarmos na situação atual do game\n\nDead By Daylight sempre foi um game que apresentou um sistema de MMR com intuito de um melhor pareamento entre Survivors e entre Killers e Survivors; contendo também um sistema de elo, definido por uma enumeração que ia do Rank 20 ao Rank 1. Isso tudo marcou presença até o mês de Setembro desse ano, onde um número de coisas considerável mudou dentro do game, e após isso, eu pensei em como essa mudança expôs o fato da Behaviour não ter competência o suficiente pra balancear o game. O MMR agora te pareia com jogadores de acordo com o seu número de vitórias e derrotas, ou seja, se você escapar muito de survivor, consequentemente, você vai cair contra Killers que matam muitos survivors e vencem muitas partidas; se vc escapa pouco das partidas, jogando de Survivior, consequentemente, você vai cair com Killers que matam pouco e não ganham tantas partidas. A princípio, a ideia parece ótima na teoria, mas a execução é realizada de forma ruim, frustrando jogadores, em sua maioria, jogadores que são Main Killers, e isso acontece por uma série de fatores que são um problema no game. E eu senti que a Behaviour simplesmente não consegue resolver esses problemas de forma que o game fique balanceado para os 2 lados. \n\nO primeiro problema é como os mapas são mal elaborados (Não todos), e alguns deles parecem desnecessariamente grandes. Pra quem n sabe, o jogo é composto de RNG, onde a cada partida, os objetos interativos do mapa spawnam em locais diferentes; isso serve pra dar uma dinâmica maior para o game. Alinhado a isso, alguns mapas como Haddonfield, O Jogo ou Abrigo Florestal são muito mal projetados, por que há partidas em que os geradores spawnam muito próximos, facilitando o trabalho do Killer em controlar o mapa e, consequentemente, ele ganha o jogo muito fácil, tirando a diversão do sobrevivente; e tb há mapas onde os geradores nascem muito distantes, dificultando o trabalho dos Killers em controlar o mapa, e isso consequentemente, tira a diversão do Killer, por que ele vai se sentir frustrado em patrulhar o mapa. Junte isso ao fato de que há Killers no game patrulham o mapa e são muito do que outros Killers (Eu falarei mais a respeito disso no próximo parágrafo). Em resumo, os mapas por terem um design mal elaborado, serem grandes mais e terem sistema de RNG, acabam frustrando ou o KIller ou os Survivors, tornando o game estressante para um dos lados. Por que até o jogador mais casual, que vai entrar pra jogar uma pra tentar jogar sem mt seriedade, vai se sentir frustrado por  esse problema. \n\nO segundo problema é como há Killers que são muito mais fortes que outros e isso se torna um padrão repetitivo dentro do game, mesmo nesse game onde você tem uma variedade de gameplay pela presença de perks; mas grande parte é anulada pelo meta impregnado no novo sistema de MMR. Bom, eu citei ali encima que o sistema de MMR do game e o sistema de elos mudou em Setembro desse ano. O que antes era algo mais simples em MMR, acabou mudando; e o sistema de Ranks antigos, que era composto por uma enumeração de 1 a 20, agora é definido por Cinza, Bronze, Prata Ouro e Iridescente. No Dead By Daylight, é muito claro que existem Killers que são muito melhores que outros Killers. Pegaremos de exemplo a Nurse: Uma quando bem jogada consegue acabar com o game muito rápido, devido a sua ótima capacidade de acabar de se teleportar, permitindo que ela atravesse qualquer coisa, e tb encurtando chases dentro do game, o que favorece muito o fato dela poder patrulhar geradores pelo mapa todo. Dito isso, se torna claro que a Nurse é um Killer muito forte, comparado ao Ghostface por exemplo. Mesmo o melhor de Ghostface não vai ser capaz de fazer o que uma Nurse faz, isso por que o máximo que ele pode fazer é stalkear e derrubar em um hit; sendo facilmente loopado em pallets e janelas. Este último ainda não apresenta nenhum tipo de controle de mapa. Ou seja, o problema não é o jogador de Ghostface e sim o Ghostface em si e como ele é menos forte que a Nurse. A princípio, isso não parece nenhum problema, mas as coisas complicam devido ao MMR. Quando você começa a cair com jogadores com MMR alto, q realmente sabem jogar o game, loopar e fazer gen, um Ghostface vai, com mt dificuldade, matar 1 ou 2 survivors, enquanto a Nurse, devido ao fato do seu poder tornar ela incrivelmente mais forte que outros Killers, pode levar 3 ou 4 facilmente toda partida. Isso deixa uma marca de padrão repetitivo no game, por que se cair com jogadores de MMR alto, tu vai ver apenas os mesmos Killers de sempre: Uma nurse ou um Blight; talvez uma Spirit. Aí, com um pouco de pensamento, você percebe que o game tem mais de 20 Killers e o meta do jogo te força a jogar com 2 ou 3 Killers se vc quiser ter uma partida mais justa contra os survivors. E isso afeta diretamente as perks do game, por que essas deveriam dar uma dinâmica nova pro game, permitindo que Killers testem novos tipos de coisas que implementam seu gameplay; mas a verdade é que MMR tá tão mal elaborado em atts atuais, que você, como jogador de Killer ou até mesmo de survivor, se pegar uma perk mais meme ou menos meta ,só pra brincar ou dar uma zoada na PT, você já tem dificuldades dentro das partidas por não ter pego algo meta. Em síntese, com MMR alto, vc vai ver apenas os mesmos killers de sempre usando as mesmas perks de sempre, por que o MMR do game e o meta te forçam a ficar nessa mesmice, e isso por si só se torna chato, frustrante e diminui a diversão dos jogadores. Um game que tem mais de 20 Killers e mais de 40 perks te força, com o meta dele, a usar as mesmas coisas sempre\n\nEnfim... Esse é apenas algumas coisas que eu queria comentar sobre antes de chegar a essa conclusão. Mas, no fim das contas, vale a pena comprar esse jogo? O jogo é muito divertido.
