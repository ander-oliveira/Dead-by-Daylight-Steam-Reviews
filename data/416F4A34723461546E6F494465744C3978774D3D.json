прекрасная д*очильня которая не оставит вас равнодушным! \nкак вы к ней отнесётесь - так она с вами и поступит, зайдёте, здохните и уйдёте - тогда вы просто потратили деньги. если останетесь на долго то готовьтесь прочувствовать все стадии страха, пофигизма, злости и истерии. эта игра высосет из вас всё человечное, давая свободу действий, которую будет сложно осилить. а тем кто не будет хотеть стремиться к скиллу, продвигаясь по головам, будут истерить и поливать всех своим богатым на говно словарным запасом, всё ниже погружаясь в дно. если вы хотите чего-то здесь достичь, то - живите тут! другого способа нет\n\nи, как многие ютуберы, просто игроки в это, и прочие страшные твари что тут обитают, говорят что надо просто смириться в дисбалансом, багами и комьюнити. каждый когда-нибудь(если продержится тут какое-то время) за время игры точно да столкнётся каким-нибудь мнением что дбд единственная в своём роде игра, которая может так стабильно быть нестабильной когда выходит патч.\nвы сначала частично с этим согласитесь, но потом сами с этим столкнётесь и просто а*уеете.\nразберем баг-патч 6.1.1\nтолько скачав и зайдя ничего особенного. кроме слайд-шоу на экране, проваливания в паллетки и застревания там(и тогда вы полностью во власти мана - как он выберет с вами поступить - так и будет), и, конечно не влияющие на игру,(но бл*ть) ложные статусы в послеигровом поле. к примеру играли против нюрсы, 3 здохли, один с*ебал. и что мы видим, поле где  должен быть ник мана, перки и аддоны - его там нет, пустое поле будто нас шиза прихватила и мы сами здохли, один будто ливнул, а трое будто ещё в матче гоняют против своей шизы.\nи как же можно забыть про одарённое комьюнити которое будет тебе кидать минус репы если ты играешь действительно правильно(ну мне грех жаловаться, мне с этим делом повезло, а вот другим, большинству - нет). любители что-то с*издануть на перки, при этом самим быть клоунами. быть тупым дол*о*бом, не шарить за них и говорить что ты блять с валл хаком играешь, кстати про это:\n\n\nдорогой-дешёвый чел, прочитай как работает зов нюрсы, я знаю ты это прочитаешь, сын прекрастной матери увы которую мир не пожалел и у неё родился вы*лядок, я кстати жду твоё приглашение 1х1, я скоро всех твоих друзей перепрошу тебе написать что жду тебя, одарённый овощ с человеческими повадками <3\n\n\n\nтак, возвращаемся к делу. если вам некуда тратить деньги, время, силы и нервные клетки - то пожалуйста, лучший вариант! а если хотите ещё больше прекрасных чувств и ощущений, можно ещё и в доту играть, чтобы был экспириенс прям х2\n\nи не забываем, от меня конструктивщины нету, всё в общих детялях или слишком точных, так что этот пост не для ознакомления чтобы что-то понять(бл афигена в конце поста писать что многим он не

It has to be said, however, that this has been the only game to date that has made me feel dejected and sad. Dead by Daylight has issues I can forgive; you can try to control toxicity, but it's a fools errand. It would be nice, however, if they tried. \n\nMy thoughts can be broken into two main issues. Feigning balance where asymmetry is designed is a slight of hand that BHVR never should have engaged in. Either the game is asymmetrical and one side is meant to win most often, or you try to keep the win rates 50/50. Playing with the meta to bandage poor game design, with a weak cry that it's working as intended, is not acceptable. That brings me to my main issue with Dead By Daylight: nothing works as intended. The spaghetti code becomes ever clearer with each update as small unrelated change bursts forth a game breaking bug like a Xenomorph feeding on the corpse of its 2016 code. \n\nI can forgive a toxic player base and asymmetry. I cannot forgive the game breaking bugs which can happen with every update. Working on your skills in this game means nought with rubber banding, crashes, and non-existent anti-cheat which are actively killing this game.\nI have played evenly on killer and survivor on PS4. I ground my way to every perk and play-style I could get and at one point I loved it. Faced with that same climb again on this platform, with the game in this state, I cannot think of a better way to disgrace the good name that Dead by Daylight had once built up for itself. Dead by Daylight is proof that even passion and love is not enough to carry a game like this. You need skill.\n\nIt saddens me deeply that a project that has so painstakingly and lovingly worked on horror as a genre can fall so flat with poor coding.\n\nMy hope is that this project can be built from the ground up by a studio which can handle an online multiplayer game of this scale but that it doesn't lose the passion, which BHVR piss on with every patch.","timestamp_created":1658882110,"timestamp_updated":1658882110,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119543559","author":{"steamid":"76561198990583349","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7749,"last_played":1658873696},"language":"french","review":"jeux incroyable entre amis","timestamp_created":1658881980,"timestamp_updated":1658881980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119543381","author":{"steamid":"76561199186907730","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3368,"playtime_at_review":1586,"last_played":1660598488},"language":"english","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1658881786,"timestamp_updated":1658881786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119543172","author":{"steamid":"76561198375392912","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":994,"playtime_at_review":16677,"last_played":1660343135},"language":"english","review":"I came back because I heard the game was receiving some much-needed balance and I'm not disappointed at all.
