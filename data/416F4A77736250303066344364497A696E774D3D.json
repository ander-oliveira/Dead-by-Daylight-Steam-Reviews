Its gameplay is unique in comparison to other games. DBD is in the ''easy to learn, hard to master'' category. Fortunately, the game is not ''pay to win''. The only things you can buy with real money are cosmetics and new characters. The process of leveling up a character cannot be sped up, you have to work for it. The ranking in this game does not really matter, don't get obsessed with ranking up, this is the wrong way to play it. Dying as a survivor or not killing everyone as a killer will not always mean defeat, remember that.\nHaving all your favorite horror characters in one universe sounds amazing and that's what encouraged me to buy it in the first place. They managed to fit these characters very well and even lore-wise it makes sense in a way.\nThere is and will always be a war in the community regarding whether the game is killer-sided or survivor-sided. I don't have an opinion concerning this topic. I don't recommend visiting the game's official forums, [u]just don't[/u], for your own sake. It will only ruin your day.\nAnyway, hopefully, this was helpful to someone. \n[h1] Happy escaping/killing!  ;) [/h1]","timestamp_created":1643462562,"timestamp_updated":1643462562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109020360","author":{"steamid":"76561198409019658","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1047,"playtime_at_review":4509,"last_played":1660315452},"language":"schinese","review":"玩屠夫可以有效治疗低血压症状","timestamp_created":1643462318,"timestamp_updated":1643462318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109020325","author":{"steamid":"76561198051731195","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":26968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21850,"last_played":1647456557},"language":"english","review":"Very fair.

horror game then you can enjoy shit hitboxes on both sides so bad that even if you're the one hitting you'll call bullshit, so much toxicity that the devs will never add voice chat, glitches that don't get fixed for months, a fucking stupid aim assist for killers that will make you miss and hit walls that the devs pretend doesn't fucking exist, condescending devs whenever people voice(especially killers) that something is fucked, survivors who get to deal with stupid long active frame for killer swings so when a weapon misses if they turn fast enough it'll still count because fuck you, half of implemented perks and addons being worthless and so much fun to dig through in the bloodweb for shit you actually want such as 90% of all Cannibal's addons now, Michael Bay version of Freddy, whatever the fuck they're doing with Freddy in general, Blight and Devs thinking anyone would want to pay money to smash into the awful geometry of their maps, awful events that just make people run around the map and do nothing rather then something new and fun, or we could just some more charms and snowman to annoy killers with, if you're still able to have fun with this game then that's good for you can but I can't anymore, I'll always hate you DBD for making me love you so much with mindgames and keeping horror in the mainstream gaming but I'll hate you for making your gameplay with this iconic genre be about fucking pallets and running around a circle, no wonder people try to master Nurse so they rarely have to deal with it, I can only hope something washes away this fucking mess from my memory but it won't because these all end up dying in a week or stay in early access or both, I can only hope that Leatherface game is good so that I never have to play this

They all have >400 hours in game. Upon playing, about 9/10 matches were described to me as \"just a bad match.\" Or, \"Just a bad killer.\" And were some of the most frustrating, unfair experiences I've ever had in a game. The very rare \"good\" match was tolerable at best, with no sense of reward or accomplishment, but moreover a general sense of relief. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, its slow. Incredibly slow. Walking is slow, every \"action\" simply includes holding down left click for up to 3 mintues. But there is no AFK. They've managed to ruin the possibility of distracting yourself from the boring tedium of pressing your index finger down by having random \"skill checks\" trigger which severely punish you if missed. \n\nThe perk system is beyond me. I have spent almost all ridiculously long queue times reviewing perks, but the complexity of each perk (which there are hundreds of it seems) makes the information lost to me as soon as the match starts. For every benefit of the perk there are a dozen stipulations and special circumstances that must take place for the perk to be active, and even when I think I finally have a useful one, I discover there are a dozen killer perks that counter it in one way or another. \n\nAll in all I have had one match that I remember in a positive light. The community is toxic, the devs seem to oppose community feedback, and there are several systems of progression in game, non of which are made clear but are all more complicated than the last. \n\nTL:DR don't expect to have any idea whats going on at any time (as several unexplained icons and effects can be on your screen at once) until you've invested a couple hundred hours into the game, and expect that first couple hundred hours to be an incredibly painful experience.","timestamp_created":1643439845,"timestamp_updated":1643439845,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109000754","author":{"steamid":"76561199121516345","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1657376847},"language":"english","review":"Hi!
