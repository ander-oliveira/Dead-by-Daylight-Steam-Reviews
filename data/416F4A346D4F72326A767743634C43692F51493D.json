On super rare occasions you can even find a genuinely nice killer or survivors who help you get your tasks done or generally farm bloodpoints with you, which is handy because god damn do you need a lot of bloodpoints to get any of the decent stuff in the game. \nOne of the better things in this game I'll admit is the questing capabilities, I've not long started playing again, so I have a Lot of quests, missions and objectives to complete, which gives me more of a reason to play, though some of the objectives are tedious, and having some needing specific characters...unless you're willing to put more Cash into the game, pretty much locks you out of certain objectives...but that nicely segues into;\n\nMy major issue with the game is the price...Having put almost 20 hours into the game at the time of this review I've gained just over 2k Iridescent shards, needing 9k to unlock 1 survivor or killer...yeah that's a lot of grinding, I like a fun grind and this is usually decently fun, but god damn...Not to mention if you want any of the licensed killers or survivors you need to put more money into the game, cos you know... [i]Micro-Transactions[/i] \n\nPersonally I'd say make the games OC's bloodpoints buyable, Licensed characters Iridescent buyable, except perhaps the latest characters, sure have them on more of a premium for a while while you get your licensing money back, but Ya'll have got to be Raking it in at the cost of some of these...","timestamp_created":1632610890,"timestamp_updated":1632610890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99962748","author":{"steamid":"76561199103317026","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5079,"last_played":1652651109},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1632610570,"timestamp_updated":1632610570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99962499","author":{"steamid":"76561199098543588","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":5388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1657667960},"language":"spanish","review":"tasda\nsdas\n","timestamp_created":1632610113,"timestamp_updated":1632610113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99962457","author":{"steamid":"76561198071923321","num_games_owned":837,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":36972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1099,"playtime_at_review":22901,"last_played":1660409109},"language":"english","review":"idek anymore man","timestamp_created":1632610020,"timestamp_updated":1658260315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99962180","author":{"steamid":"76561198952847522","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":8560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6006,"last_played":1650987009},"language":"brazilian","review":"PODRE LIXO SO TEM HACK E BUG N COMPREM ESSE LIXO QUERO MEU DINEHIRO DE VOLTA JOGO LIXO E PODRE\n","timestamp_created":1632609517,"timestamp_updated":1632609517,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505928874015808105","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99962165","author":{"steamid":"76561198822760978","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1636131514},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из самых не сбалансированных игр, где просто факт коопа игроков делает их фактически непобедимыми.

skill based matchmaking being added I don't think I can recommend this game anymore. I understand the update wasn't meant for someone like me who is probably slightly higher in the mmr system. The problem is at higher levels of play you have to play more optimally and in my opinion playing Dead By Daylight as optimally as possible is unfun for both sides. \n\nI often found myself intentionally trying to lose to lower my mmr just for a few games that would be fun. Aside from just issues of fun I found my queue times to become unacceptable. On one of my mains my queues took 15-30 minutes on average after spending about a day of letting myself lose my queue times averaged 5 minutes. Not only did I experience long queue times and had less fun than I used to I've experienced a significant increase in hackers. From 1 or 2 in a few months to over 6 in 3 days.\n\nYou should know not everyone has had this kind of experience with the new system but as someone who has played since launch this is what killed the game for me. If you do try it I hope you enjoy it as I did and maybe I'll be around for major updates or maybe the mmr system will be refined enough for me to enjoy the game again.","timestamp_created":1632601487,"timestamp_updated":1632601487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99957041","author":{"steamid":"76561198294852603","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1073,"playtime_at_review":11202,"last_played":1660461243},"language":"english","review":"This game is addictive and a lot of fun to play by yourself or with a group. It's a little repetitive, but they somehow found a way to make that a good thing. The developers treat each character and killer with respect, and the attention to detail is amazing. Anyone who is a fan of the horror genre, or just the old school movies will have a lot of fun playing as their favorite, either as killer or survivor. It's inexpensive and you don't need the DLC content to play (The killers are very well balanced and the game difficulty depends entirely on the competency of the player). The balance is on point and if you do decide to spend money, you won't feel cheated. Hellraiser just released and the DLC killer is just a perfect representation of Pinhead. My favorite maps are Springvale Elementary and the Gideon Meat Plant, both have loads of detail that show just how much they care about the series they pulled from. I'm going to find a way to throw some more money at the game right now actually. A+ video game, play it in the dark for the atmosphere or group with your friends and make it silly, it all

подойдёт не каждому это факт, Сразу оговорюсь я описываю общую составляющую при игре за киллера тк они отличаются друг от друга, а выжившие ничем кроме моделек и навыков.

Необычная, затягивающая атмосфера, большое разнообразие персонажей за которых интересно играть(в основном убийцы), гемплей за каждого убийцу отличается.\n2. Довольно приятная графика, не самая плохая оптимизация.\n3. В неё просто здорово играть.\nПереходим к минусам:\n1. Советую тем кто не знаком с игрой подготовиться, ведь далеко не факт, что тебе кинет соперников твоего уровня. Тебе на убийце может попасться задрот на 3к часов и не имеет значения то что ты только игру купил.(при игре за выживших может попасться кибер спорт убийца)\n2. Игра однообразна, но не в плане персонажей нет, а в том, что нам до сих пор не выпустили новый режим, новые приоритеты для выживших(что то кроме починки генераторов), каких то особых игровых механик. Только DLC и скины\n3. Не удивляйтесь если вашего любимого персонажа знатно нерфанут из за новоиспечённого это обычное дело.
