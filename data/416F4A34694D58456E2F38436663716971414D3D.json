have 2500+ hours on the game across ps4 and pc. Over the past 9 months since MMR was introduced the game has slipped into a point where the game has become nearly unplayable. The toxicity in the game is very concerning, it involves racism, homophobia and behaviour do little to nothing to challenge this. The game is a buggy mess, and shows how the developers focus heavily on cosmetics and dlc's over general maintenance on their game. The game itself has so much potential, but was beautifully executed until behaviour started to slip. There has always been bugs, but when you are able to play a day of the game and come across 5 or 6 hackers, exploiters and or hateful toxicity, it looses its magic. DBD is not a competetive game but behaviour have tried to implement a competitive edge. By making a basic matchmaking system that works off of kills and walking through the gate at the end of the match. This has bred some very frustrating play tactics. All in all, this was used to be great. But i do not feel the same now. In its current state i would say don't give behaviour your money. However, a year ago I would have said the opposite. If you want to play the game, just hack it, you'll probably have more fun and its not like there will be any kind of punishment :') (4/10 stars for gameplay quality) (9/10 for value for money, simply due to the amount of hours i have played vs the amount the game costs).","timestamp_created":1646062472,"timestamp_updated":1646062472,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111243272","author":{"steamid":"76561199224115481","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2919,"last_played":1656249684},"language":"schinese","review":"刺激","timestamp_created":1646062371,"timestamp_updated":1646062371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111242429","author":{"steamid":"76561198085491979","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1657736029},"language":"english","review":"- DIFFICULTY -\n\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n☑️ Easy\n🔲 Normal\n🔲 Hard\n🔲 \"Dark Souls\"\n\n- GRAPHICS -\n\n🔲 \"MS Paint\"\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Meh\n🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game\n☑️ Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n🔲 Masterpiece\n\n- MUSIC -\n\n🔲 Bad\n☑️ Not special\n🔲Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n\n- STORY -\n\n☑️ This game has no story\n🔲 Like playing \"Temple Runners\" for the story\n🔲 It's there for the people who want it\n🔲 Well written\n🔲  Epic story\n\n- PRICE -\n\n🔲 Underpriced\n☑️ Perfect price\n🔲 Could be cheaper\n🔲 Overpriced\n🔲 Complete waste of money\n\n- REQUIREMENTS -\n\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\n☑️ Average\n🔲 High end\n🔲 \"NASA\" computer\n\n- LENGTH -\n\n🔲 Very short (0 - 3 hours)\n🔲 Short (3 - 15 hours)\n🔲 Average (15 - 50 hours)\n🔲 Long (50 - 90 hours)\n🔲 Extremely long (90 - 110 hours)\n☑️ No Ending\n\n- FUN -\n\n🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\n🔲 Repetitive\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\n☑️ Ride of your life\n\n- REPLAYABILITY -\n\n🔲 It's a one - time experience\n🔲 Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months / years\n☑️ Definitely\n🔲Infinitely replayable\n\n- WORTH BUYING -\n\n🔲 No\n🔲 Wait for sale\n☑️ Yes","timestamp_created":1646061493,"timestamp_updated":1646061493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111241368","author":{"steamid":"76561198217493668","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1331,"last_played":1656225290},"language":"schinese","review":"匹配系统及其弱智，尤其是对屠夫来说，低段位技能不全把把匹到比你高好几个大段的满配人，设计师是不是家里人死了啊？\n The matching system is very retarded, especially for butchers.

이게... 참 애매함\n좋은 게임인데 운영이 거지같은건지\n나쁜 게임도 맞고 운영도 거지같은건지\n\n게임 외적으로는 공포스럽고 숨막히는 술래잡기이며 꾸준하게 살인마나 생존자들을 매력적이게 뽑으려하고 심지어는 다른 호러무비에서 콜라보로 들여오는 경우가 많아서 되게 호평받을만 함.  실제로도 영화 캐릭터들의 설정에 충실해서 각자의 능력도 정말 개성있는 경우가 대부분임. \n\n근데 속을 까보면 좀 다른 분위기가 상당히 눈에 띔. 공포라기 보다는 그냥 괴물들 나오는 술래잡기 탈출게임. 분위기는 호러틱하게 짜놨는데 유저들이 유쾌하게 구는 경우가 많아서 생긴 사례이고 이건 그럴수 있다고 넘어갈순 있음.\n\n우선 실력차 비슷한 사람하고 매칭시켜주지 않는 매칭 시스템, 그러니까 잘하는 살인마한테 계속 잡혀 죽는 생존자가 되거나 잘하는 생존자한테 농락당해서 하나도 잡지 못하는 살인마가 되어버리는 매칭 시스템 때문에 초보 유저들에게는 진입장벽이 상당히 높은 편에 속하고(살인마 측은 훨씬.)이마저도 생존자는 운빨을 타면 그럭저럭 어렵지는 않게 해나갈수는 있는데, 이게 낮아질 기미가 안보임. 제작자들이 뭘 들어먹는게 거의 없음. 차근차근이라기엔 너무 느림. 여전한 문제라고 봐도 무방.\n\n그리고 비매너 플레이/농락/고의패배/핵(그러나 본인은 핵 본 기억이 없음)이 상당히 존재하나 거의 재제를 안함.\n\n일단 살인마 이야기나 해보자면 게임 구조 자체가 살인마가 불리한데다가 뉴비분들은 살인마 잡아보더니 고수 유저들에게 농락당해 몇명 희생시키지도 못하고 이게 뭐야 하는 마음으로 꺼버릴 확률이 높음. 너스가 사기캐라고 해서 너스 들어본다? 너스 능력 통제가 어려워서 너스를 던짐. 그리고 이러니까 사람들이 살인마 말고 생존자로 넘어가서 살인마 유저를 찾기가 힘듬. 그래서 살인마를 찾고 찾느라 생존자로는 매칭 엄청 오래 걸리는데 살인마로 하면 1분도 안되서 매칭 잡히는게 다반사. \n\n게임 자체는 분명 재밌음. 근데 문제점을 고치는건 개발자의 몫인데 아직 근본적인 문제는 여전히 현재진행형인듯.","timestamp_created":1646053770,"timestamp_updated":1646053955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111235383","author":{"steamid":"76561198830120540","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15758,"last_played":1658931032},"language":"russian","review":"Значит

You can only fix so many generators, be hung on a hook, or loop a killer so many times before you're ready to uninstall and find something else. That's literally all the game is. No amount of new maps, characters, or perks will balance that out. Game is fun for a few hours at best, until you move up the MMR rankings then you're playing with and against one of the most toxic communities I've found across the internet. As survivor, get spotted at beginning of the game? Get hooked and face camped 60% of the time. If you manage to get off, get tunneled for 70% of the time. Play as killer, and get treated like you're trash by the survivors if you don't 4k. You can't win. Play with your friends makes the game bearable but not before you realize you can't unlock any in game rewards like this. All in all, not a horrible game, but not something I can see sinking an extended period of time into. It's a very limited experience in my opinion, and I've tried very very hard to like the game. Just not something I would ever recommend another person to play because it's not if you are you gonna have a bad experience with this game, it's a matter of when.","timestamp_created":1646034380,"timestamp_updated":1646034380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111221403","author":{"steamid":"76561198288090975","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":70715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58859,"last_played":1658921527},"language":"koreana","review":"개쓰레기게임","timestamp_created":1646032870,"timestamp_updated":1646135513,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111221139","author":{"steamid":"76561199232828070","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":527,"playtime_at_review":7064,"last_played":1660559151},"language":"schinese","review":"入手玩了一段时间了，80块钱很超值，音效环境氛围和心跳的模拟感觉超一流。\n\n目前看来优化做得不是很好，操作略微生硬，而且对于新手及其不友好（前期没有可用的好技能）。","timestamp_created":1646032456,"timestamp_updated":1646032456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111220976","author":{"steamid":"76561199179118133","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":11229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":35,"playtime_at_review":8176,"last_played":1660032045},"language":"english","review":"If I could change one thing about my life it would be to never play this game.","timestamp_created":1646032181,"timestamp_updated":1646032181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111219885","author":{"steamid":"76561198821291489","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29678,"last_played":1657566756},"language":"english","review":"(Honest review)\nDead by daylight\nthis game is really fun at the start, but it slowly turns into a dumpster fire.\nIt is a simple cat and mouse game, 4 people do gens and a killer tries to kill them, but thats not all. \nwhen you start, you'll do a few games get scared maybe once or twice and you'll have fun and maybe get some friends and you guys will enjoy the game for a while, to the point you might come to play it on the daily. You’ll probably start watching videos on how to get better with your games and maybe even try some fun things in a game, and all of this will slowly but surely make you climb the ranks towards the road to hell.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nmid-game\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nyou’re still motivated to keep up with DBD news and updates as well as playing a decent amount of rounds. However, you start to notice campers during the game, but you feel like its not bad enough to sour the gaming experience. so you keep playing and during this time you may play killer or perhaps, you won't, you'll keep playing with friends and just enjoy the game except for the few times here and there, but overall the game is nice. you enjoy the updates, and you have your friends what more can you want? you watch YouTubers like otz, jrm and even maybe noob3 (come back please) but overall it's not bad.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nlate game\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou’ll find out this game is the same thing every time which isn't bad on its own. except it's the same people almost every single round.  face campers, tunnelers, and you can't even enjoy a game without waiting in the lobby to 5 mins to a whole 2 hours. \nNot only that, when you hit rank one in both game modes and you either get shi* talked every game or you get tunneled out every game.\nHowever, you still play because it's bad, but it could be worse and it does get worse.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthe end\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n you'll either master one of the two game modes and toxicity gets thrown at you left and right in a form of comments at the end of games. if thats not enough. perhaps, the long wait in lobbies for a match can cool you down before sweating your as* against potential campers and tunnelers, or going against red ranks killers/players to leave you behind the dust and then maybe teabagged at the end of the game. \nat this point, you might continue this vicious cycle of playing or stop all together. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmy story\nwith 500 hours I have in this game, I honestly don't regret it but wished I spent less time on it. It was fun and I met new people. At the end, learned some new things. I don't take this game seriously due to the the toxic community. and plus i cant do a single killer game without someone cheating or talking about how I tunneled them when they did a gen off hook. This game WILL make you mad and upset. and you shouldn't take it seriously. I get on from time to time only to swf but other than that, it's a game that I recommend not to take serious or you'll end up regretting it.\n\n\ntldr: DBD is fun don't take it serious or you'll end it regretting it. take breaks watch your health and whenever someone is being toxic, just say you love them because they need it.\n\nRecommend but play at your own risk.","timestamp_created":1646030629,"timestamp_updated":1646050142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472414940595626831","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iMXEn/8CfcqiqAM="}
