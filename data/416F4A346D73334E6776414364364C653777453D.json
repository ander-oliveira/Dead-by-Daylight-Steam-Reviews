Yo tenía 10 años cuando mi madre le dijo \"Si realmente algún día quieres ver a tus nietos graduarse, tienes que parar inmediatamente.\" Los ojos se le llenaron de lágrimas cuando se dió cuenta lo que realmente estaba en juego. Lo dejó instantáneamente. Tres años después murió por cancer de pulmón. Fue muy triste y me destruyó. Mi madre me dijo \"Nunca fumes. Por favor no le hagas pasar a tu familia lo que tu abuelo nos hizo pasar a nosotros\" Yo estuve de acuerdo. Ahora, con 21 años, nunca toqué un cigarro en mi vida. Y la verdad es que me arrepiento de no haberlo hecho, porque este juego me dio cancer de todas maneras.","timestamp_created":1580666693,"timestamp_updated":1586579544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62872390","author":{"steamid":"76561198055471431","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":101667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":121,"playtime_at_review":15786,"last_played":1660093700},"language":"english","review":"A lot of fun, good for any group size 1-5. Pretty balanced and stable. If youre brand new I would highly recommend watching a youtube video for new players as it will make you significantly better as either killer or survivor. There is a significant difference in how good you are in your first game (where you will be terrible most likely) and your 5th game where you will have a much better idea on what you are doing. If it is your first game remember: sound on and the generators make an ominous noise right before a skill check is triggered.

Ive been playing it since it came out, and been through it all. But nowadays its just a fcking joke. The Devs only care about one thing now, money. If u are new to this game or consider buying it: dont. All they wanna do is get u invested so u spend some money on skins, battle pass etc. As soon as you reach a certain level of skill, you realize that the game is fcked and basically unplayable for one side. They just keep nerfing all the killers except for 3 and cant get their shit togheter. Speaking from a killer point of view: this game is just frustrating. As soon as you manage your way through all those bullshit loops and pallets and finally down a survivor, there are already 4 out of 5 gens done, and you basically lost at this point. To all the players who love this game: try playing killer for once and you will understand me. Im just too burnt out and done at this point. Maybe one day they will realize that an \"Asymetric Horror Game\" needs to be fun for both sides, or at least when all the killer players are done with this bullshit. I hate to see this game becoming like this, i really enjoyed it for the most part, but now its just not worth it anymore. The Devs dont even know what they are doing at this point, hiding the ranks instead of fixing the broken matchmaker, who ranks rank 1 killers against rank 12 survivors. Refusing to fix any of the general problems of the game, like genrushing and broken loops, and instead focusing their resources on new skins and dlc, basically forcing us to pay for the new perks, which badly bandage the problems they refuse to fix.","timestamp_created":1580664591,"timestamp_updated":1581153339,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62870371","author":{"steamid":"76561198229220632","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":25305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1658248589},"language":"polish","review":"The amount of bugs is crazy","timestamp_created":1580664287,"timestamp_updated":1597503024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547236382961273193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62870025","author":{"steamid":"76561198312032431","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":46705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25056,"last_played":1628370113},"language":"english","review":"1","timestamp_created":1580663892,"timestamp_updated":1580663892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62869635","author":{"steamid":"76561198870851748","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":489552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39283,"last_played":1656696428},"language":"schinese","review":"无尽的BUG，ZZZ教你平衡","timestamp_created":1580663469,"timestamp_updated":1580663469,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562496662139892578","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62869254","author":{"steamid":"76561198984986658","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":235,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1660060927},"language":"english","review":"good game\n","timestamp_created":1580663074,"timestamp_updated":1580663074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62869215","author":{"steamid":"76561198932984458","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":80018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":95,"playtime_at_review":1142,"last_played":1660575579},"language":"thai","review":"very funny game","timestamp_created":1580663032,"timestamp_updated":1580663032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62868872","author":{"steamid":"76561198938032934","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1597709136},"language":"italian","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1580662635,"timestamp_updated":1580662635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62868615","author":{"steamid":"76561198006131935","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2203,"last_played":1641463710},"language":"russian","review":"Игра сделана в необычном жанре и если рассматривать игру стандарнтыми персонажами, которых ты получаешь КУПИВ игру - то всё вроде бы неплохо.

You can get put with people who just joke around, or people who actually takes the game very seriously.\n\nIve played a lot of both Survivor and killer, I used to like killer a lot more due to the power you get, and the fact that you can completely destroy a team. But since Ive started to reach the higher rank survivors, I get bullied a lot, thats also due to SWF which Im okay with, but still a bit annoying if you go against 3 rank 2-3 and one rank 17 and you yourself is a rank 13-10 killer.\n\nRecently I've been playing a lot of survivor, because I've been playing with friends. And holy hell, I've never had so much fun without taking the game seriously in any way. Just fucking around with your friends and the killer is extremely fun and gives all players a great time. \n\nPersonally I've gotten to the point where I couldnt care less if I win or lose, as long as I'm having fun. Sure its nice to win everyonce in a while, but wheres the point in playing it if youre not having fun? \n\nOf course every game has its downsides, and DBD's biggest downside is probably its toxic community. Whether you're playing killer or survivor you can get trashtalked for your smallest mistakes. And even worse if that same person dies by their own fault, yet blames the team. \n\nAnd if you're playing killer and doesnt do very well, the survivors might trashtalk you because you're either a newer player or they out skill you. \n\nBut at the end, the game is really fun by its self.

Point blank. I'll explain EXACTLY why. First off, the gameplay itself. The gameplay for survivors is: Gens, run from killer. That's all there is to it. This is an incredibly linear thing for survivors. I wish there was more to do and to explore so that you can find multiple ways to escape, or fight back against the killer like Friday the 13th does. Everymatch feels the same, and it does not feel like a Survival Horror game like how it is advertised to be and how everyone would prefer it to be. For Killers, it's a better style of how to play this game with downing and hooking, so it does feel more like a survival horror but playing killer is tedious because the survivors have the advantage. In my opinion, killers should have the advantage if you're trying to survive. Surviving should be a challenging and feel rewarding when you do, but it never does feel rewarding, just empty. Therefore, killers don't have the same feel or reason that they had before.\n\nThe Community is a mess. It's full of entitled brats on both sides who will complain about their side of the game, call the otherside OP when they lose and be extremely entitled and toxic when they win, trashtalking and doing ingame actions to purposefully make other people have LESS fun. I don't care if they play the game and win in an unfun way, but going out of your way to make it unfun for BOTH sides is why this games playerbase is declining. Don't forget the communities constant whining about everylittle thing. \n\nThe devs themselves. They have a huge hacker problem they refused to fix for years on end, instead reworking killers. I'd rather not have to face hackers. And they doubled down on showing that they don't care with bringing the game out for free on Epic Games, allowing these hackers infinite accounts to mess with people. This was a silly move. Along with the constant amount of NFTs and orther moves the devs make that make no sense and don't help the game. Constant cosmetics and having to spend money or HOURS playing the game to unlock one singular killer or survivor is too tedious and a money hungry strategy which makes this game even more awful. And to get the best perks that the survivor or killer gives you and all killers/survivors to have, you either put those thousands of hours (which most people won't, it's too much time) or hand over your hard earned money. It's an awful business practice. This is not a rewarding feeling either.\n\nThat's my thoughts on this game, the only positive i'd give it is the fact it's the only live service survival horror MP game on the market, but considering the hot pile of garbage it is, that's not a good sign.","timestamp_created":1580656725,"timestamp_updated":1649963806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534344732761383057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62863111","author":{"steamid":"76561198123397352","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":13919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":188,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1660239967},"language":"polish","review":"Czasem bugi, ale bardzo polecam :)","timestamp_created":1580656379,"timestamp_updated":1580656379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62862870","author":{"steamid":"76561198043267640","num_games_owned":739,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":29685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3166,"last_played":1634668420},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenaaaaaardo el juego","timestamp_created":1580656089,"timestamp_updated":1580656089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62862530","author":{"steamid":"76561198171941585","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":72017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37768,"last_played":1649528653},"language":"russian","review":"Do not buy this in 2020, good developers just kill the game by picking up killers.

Эта игра страдает от больших проблем. 1. Баланс: Если ман играет против рандомов (сурвов без связи), то он в плюсе, если против него играет группа сурвов со связью, то они в плюсе. А ещё от многое зависит от спавна досок и генов. Так же все маны не сбалансированы. 2. Цена: Тут хочу донести одну мысль. То, что было дбд ей не является, т.к 80% игры - DLC. А что бы бесплатно получить какого-то мана, нужно гриндить 9000 осколков, если вам понравился какой-то сет на мана, то покупай за реальные деньги, или гринди 21 600 осколков. 3. Система лобби: есть давно существующие ошибки, например ошибкa 500, из-за которой если какой-то чел ливнул во время загрузки, то матч отменяется, раньше хотя бы если какой-то сурв ливал при загрузке, кол-во генов уменьшалось, а если сурв ливнул во время игры, то кол-во генов не уменьшается. Так же если вы хотите на какую-то определённую карту, надейтесь на удачу или берите подношение на неё. Я бы переделал так что бы ман создавал лобби и выбирал карту, а сурвы могли выбрать в какое лобби отправиться. 4. Геймплей: Геймплей однообразный, нет новых режимов, и скорее их никогда не будет. 5. Главная минус дбд - отношение разработчиков: они превратили эту игру в подпольное казино по продаже скинов и длс маскируя под нормальную игру. Они не исправляют проблемы, которым 5 лет (например кривые хитбоксы топоров Анны), они всё делают методом тыка, например понерфили руин, не угадали, сурвы стали быстро заводить, понерфили Биляса, снова не получилось, бафнули Буббы, вроде правильно сделали и так далее. Они сами не понимают что делают.\nИтог: Не рекомендую покупать и играть в дбд на данный момент, потратьте деньги на что-то более полезное. А если вы с друзьями не жалеете денег на эту переоцененную игру, если вы хотите отыграть 50 часов с ними в приватке, эта игра может не такая плохая. Две причины такой популярности: 1. Постоянные коллабы с другими играми, фильмами и сериалами. 2.
