Игра недостаточно страшная, но в некоторых моментах так и хочется завизжать. Несмотря на больше кол-во обновлений баги все-равно есть(некоторые безобидные и даже забавные, а другие просто портят игру). В игре присутствуют читеры, но за все время, которое я наиграл, ни разу не были встречены мной. Несмотря на то, что тут присутствует ранг, который калибруется каждый месяц, игры по ним не учитываются(т.е. вы можете быть маньяком с 16-15 рангом и играть против пати сурвов 1-4 ранга со связью). Есть отдельные индивиды(та что там грешить, я иногда такой же бываю), которые токсичят на всех кто им не угоден, но иногда это оправданная злоба, если сурв отказывается играть и просто как-то помогает ману. Естественно если играть с друзьями, то это полный угар.

Not only that but the licensed characters add so much to the game with their clever references through perks, add-ons, and cosmetics, yet the originally created survivors and killers all have a unique charm and interesting writing. The rank and matchmaking system defintely needs work, but it's easy to look past that. With the recent animation overhauls and graphic updates rolling out, now is the time to catch a ride, especially with Christmas coming up! This game has so much love poured into it, and has improved heavily since it's release.

If I'm being honest this game wasn't even that good back in 2018. I only play this game because this is one of the only game my friend and me can playing together since he's still on console. With update 6.1.0 this game is horrible to play as survivor. The pallet placements are a joke. 95% of the pallets on this game the killer can literally walk around them quicker than it takes for you to throw them down. You get hit through the pallet even if you manage to throw it down half the time and vaulting windows is no better. Breakable door make is so the loop that wasn't very good to begin with is even worse. 50% of the times your first hook will be your last. Killers tunnel you for the littlest thing. But don't you worry because the DEVS came up with a brilliant idea to counter that. You know get 5 seconds of endurance and 7% haste status effect whenever you get unhook and if your teammate runs borrow time you get an additional 10 seconds. If the killer is willing to wait Decisive Strike which is a perk that allows you to stab the killer if they pick you up within 60 seconds of getting unhook, they'll definitely wait out 15 seconds of endurance for you. Solo surviving is pretty much a death trap. No one ever does a gen and they die very quickly. They did buff a few perks for survivors that allow you to have the endurance status effect but you literally can't do anything while you have it or else it deactivates. So your team will now follow the killer around to take an extra hit for no reason or they spend half their time blessing boon totems. Generators take longer to do and with all these generator regressing builds it makes doing them a nightmare. Hooks are way too close to each other. They should just take the wiggle ability outta the game. Almost impossible to break free. Exit gates placements are always killer sided. 80% of the time the killer can stand in one place and watch both door or do a brisk walk to see the other. Your pretty much as good as dead if your the last survivor during the endgame collapse unless you some how get extremely lucky with the door placements.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had fun playing this game and after 1 round I'm ready to quit regardless if I survivor or die. You have to play so dirty to win that it makes the game not fun on both sides. This is from someone who plays mainly survivor.\n\nIf you do get this game I highly suggest you play with a 4 man survive with friends. It's about the only way to have fun.

ventaja si no entiendes bien el juego, así que no esperes salir vivo siempre y con amigos es MUCHO mejor. \nEste juego lo recomiendo por que lo he disfrutado, es divertido jugarlo como sobreviviente ya que es muy desafiante y produce una sensacion muy intensa de nervios. Como asesino es una experiencia muy distinta ya que es más relajada y te ayuda a sacar muchos puntos, aun asi. pasa que hay colas de 10 minutos donde la partida dura 3-4. espero que te sirva este mensaje en tu desicion c:","timestamp_created":1605137734,"timestamp_updated":1620664293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.671462595462799072","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79125248","author":{"steamid":"76561198352558167","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8093,"last_played":1642705541},"language":"english","review":"game has a lot about it and is very fun. i love being a killer and finding new ways to trick players to down them","timestamp_created":1605137697,"timestamp_updated":1605137697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jrHq3PUCcLDrrQI="}
