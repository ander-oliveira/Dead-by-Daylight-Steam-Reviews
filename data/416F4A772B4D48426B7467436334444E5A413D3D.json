I have not played as much as I wanted, and the reason is what everyone knows. The game is Broken.\n\nThere's a debate going on about this for quite a long time. The issue is the balance. Killers, those clowns running around the map have a problem. Is they lack control. I'm not going to talk about how frustrating is to have 3 guys running around you while carrying their friend to a hook, forcing you to chose between camp or defeat, and either way not having fun. We all know how that feels. We all also know how it feels to have a facecamper in front of us and having to let a friend die. Not funny. At all.\n\nHow did it come to this? Well, if you ask me, the game has a good design, with a terrible performance. \n\nKillers don't have any control of the match. When you play other games of the same style you are able to choose the hunting ground, to remove players from the match with a bit of effort. To slow them and hunt them putting odds agaisnt the survivors. To make use of your power as the bloody Killer. But they can't do any of those things. To kill someone you actually need an add-on. All you can do is run across the map, praying for the dumbass to screw the loop. The lack of power of the Killer side is kinda sad. \n\nThe problem of the survivors is they have the upperhand, but only if they play as a team. And yes, after looping some guys and making the killer mad, you are probably going to get facecamped, but to be honest, if you dont face Myers, Hillbilly or Leatherface, facecamp is easy to deal with. But my point here, is survivors are supposed to be a team. There a 0 mechanichs to reward selfish gameplay, yet only those who make it out gain points. I believe it would be healthy to reward survivors as a team, they work as a team, and the guy who looped the mofo allowing the others to repair gens and got facecamped in the end deserves those escape points, because without him, maybe the rest of the team would not be getting them. I would not mind to allow the killer more \"killing potential\" and dying more often if I get that victory and those points after the match because the rest of my team made it. I don't get mad when I die in Siege but my friends win. \n\nSo, to sumarize:\n-Killers should have more control over the match.\n-Survivors should be rewarded as a team. \n\nAs now. I would not buy the game. I would play Friday 13 or other games where the roles of both factions are actually accurate.","timestamp_created":1478141567,"timestamp_updated":1520300889,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26393929","author":{"steamid":"76561198337197475","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1631006165},"language":"schinese","review":"匹配 的太慢了，其他都挺好的刺激0.0","timestamp_created":1478141418,"timestamp_updated":1478141418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26393928","author":{"steamid":"76561197999108164","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":52179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":67,"playtime_at_review":452,"last_played":1660527388},"language":"english","review":"Used to love this game but MMR took all the fun out of it.","timestamp_created":1478141413,"timestamp_updated":1644205882,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499982863664627075","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26393671","author":{"steamid":"76561198263652093","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1486906788},"language":"schinese","review":"万圣节乘打折入的，现在如假包换萌新一枚，但还是当树皇当的不亦乐乎，游戏做的很不错，感觉新手还是玩鬼比较好，真心希望有老司机带带我，最后还是安利一波，玩着绝对爽。","timestamp_created":1478139704,"timestamp_updated":1478139704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503722071647644043","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26393670","author":{"steamid":"76561197986648082","num_games_owned":370,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1499742025},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely horrible for one reason and one reason alone.

I imagine this is probably a great game to play if you have five close friends who are all starting out at the same time or are willing to remove their perks and add-ons to level the playing field, but if you're going in with expectations of being even a half-decent survivor or killer right off the bat, just forget it.\n\nOften matchmaking will place beginning survivors against rank 1 killers or beginning killers against rank 15+ survivors. Even rank 20 survivors are often level 30+ with an entire setup of efficient rare and ultra-rare perks. And how do you level up fast to catch up to everyone else? By winning, of course. Good luck with that as a killer when most survivors know you're coming even before you do. Some may argue that you can still level up just by losing over and over again, but I didn't favor the killer side of the spectrum to let everyone get away every match and occasionally get lucky here and there and catch someone. As a survivor, killers don't feel scary and as a killer I don't feel powerful. I just feel lonely trying to find someone to share a chase with.\n\nIn addition, at least 1/4 of the community is toxic or just sees a beginning killer as good fodder to farm bloodpoints from. There was more than one match where I had to keep chasing people away from the last remaining generator to force them to just leave my game so I could move on or sat and watched them teabag right at the barrier where I could hit them, but was gauranteed to not catch them. If you're just beginning now and want to try as a killer, I'd wait for the new Friday the 13th game on the way. Hopefully it won't use this awful leveling and perks system that just makes the game a pain to get into for beginners.\n\nA game like this should be a trial in hardship for survivors and a power trip for killers. Right now it's just not either. I plugged through ten hours of the game hoping things would get better as I leveled up, but it's just way too hard to level up when I can't actually get any points from winning games.","timestamp_created":1478138513,"timestamp_updated":1478138513,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26393335","author":{"steamid":"76561198297588115","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":18642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1603369959},"language":"thai","review":"เลิกเล่นแล้วครับ","timestamp_created":1478137611,"timestamp_updated":1634185143,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26393325","author":{"steamid":"76561198212420271","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":797,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1660094571},"language":"english","review":"Be prepared to never win against Michael Meyers.

The first game was really fun, after the first few games, the novelty wore off and the horrible balancing issues this game has really shined through.\n\nPlaying as a new player survivor with other randoms is almost impossible to win, the game heavily favors the killer (some of you may say that is how the game is built but I will argue it is a fundamental design failure).\n\nAs a competitive game (which it has a mode for) it should be balanced, but tipping the balance in favour of the killer is therefore a contradiction of the design of a competitive game. In a perfectly balanced game both sides should have an EQUAL chance of winning and that is not the case in this game.\n\nTake evolve for instance, a beginner of that game still has a good chance of winning any game they play because the monster is balanced towards the other 4 hunters. This game however, unless you have team coordinations and extremely good perks you cannot win.\n\nFor instance, playing as survivor, no matter what I did it always alerted the killer. Okay, so I go to hide? Well the killer can move freely and find me. Okay so I am caught? The timmer till you die in INFINATELY MORE FASTER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO SAVE YOU FROM ANOTHER SURVIVOR.\n\nIt seems you need more skill as a survivor than a killer which is really un-balanced\n\nIn a perfect world, new players going into this game should win at least one of the games they play (e.g. evolve) however, this game is completely not balanced for new players.\n\nI think the developers really need to pull this game off the shelft or make it open beta, had I known this game to be this bad I would've never bought
