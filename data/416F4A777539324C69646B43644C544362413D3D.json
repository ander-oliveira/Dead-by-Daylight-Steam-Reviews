It's a fun game apart from some of the mechanics which just become frustrating. Toxicity of MOBAs aside, I get that I'm not supposed to win every game, and that pallet looping is a thing, and I'm not frustrated at survivors getting away... I'm frustrated with the artificial methods of hindrance that killers have. For example, to balance the powers, most killers have a \"stun\" period where you sit there looking at the ground. And when you are in the middle of a hot-blooded pursuit, those 3-5 seconds feel like an eternity. Get hit by a pallet, sit there and wait, break the pallet, sit there and wait, miss your ability, sit there and wait. After doing that thousands of times, the mechanics of balancing out the killer's abilities to kill just get frustrating. It's a lot of lead up with a 2 minute looping chase, just to be frustrated at the last second by a miss, or a pallet, or a swung-at window, or a dead hard, or just anything that frustrates the last two minutes you spent fighting for every inch of ground you gain on a survivor, just to start the whole process over again. I keep quitting, and then coming back \"2 get gud\", thinking maybe I can try this tactic, or that perk, or that somehow I am just not running my chases right, but then I realized that I wasn't frustrated with the interactions of killers and survivors, but with the mechanics of the game. I don't think they can fix that, so I'll keep trying to \"get gud\", but as it stands I can't recommend the game because I really just hate the mechanics. Oh, and additionally the fact that some killers are only good with add-ons. Add-ons should bring spice to a game, not be necessary for a killer. And why the heck do add-ons have negative aspects? The fact that it's a limited use item and can't be used every match should be its negative aspect. A consumable item that grants one positive benefit and 3 negative hindrances that you have to freaking pay in-game currency for is freaking stupid (for both killers and survivors).","timestamp_created":1482089604,"timestamp_updated":1652898970,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453891","author":{"steamid":"76561198175808205","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":57337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":336,"playtime_at_review":38836,"last_played":1660596997},"language":"english","review":"fun game but not reliable because of the bugs","timestamp_created":1482089000,"timestamp_updated":1561921857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453885","author":{"steamid":"76561198125007211","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1654462426},"language":"german","review":"Realy nice game if u have a good Graphic-card...","timestamp_created":1482088977,"timestamp_updated":1482088977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453876","author":{"steamid":"76561198217891664","num_games_owned":682,"num_reviews":112,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1601493538},"language":"japanese","review":"私がお勧めします\n非常に良いです\n陽気な\nおかしいです\nシンプルな目標が、良いです","timestamp_created":1482088948,"timestamp_updated":1482088948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.387523293495178223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453561","author":{"steamid":"76561198051420851","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2220,"last_played":1598167143},"language":"english","review":"Honest to god this game is pretty good.","timestamp_created":1482088011,"timestamp_updated":1482088011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453499","author":{"steamid":"76561198199894563","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":36053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22450,"last_played":1659275410},"language":"english","review":"Fun game .","timestamp_created":1482087810,"timestamp_updated":1511658270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453286","author":{"steamid":"76561198015295824","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":117875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":102832,"last_played":1660586804},"language":"english","review":"I got this game pretty much since release, and i must say it has had a serious amount of ups and downs regarding bugs and that type of annoying stuff. But ever since a few months ago alot got fixed, the bugs which are around now are fairly minor usually.\n\nThere are still bugs, which are these: Although most of them barely apply these days to most people.\n\nFPS drops (NEVER had this myself).\nPallet teleporting (drop pallet, teleport to the wrong side for some reason).\nGetting kicked out of a lobby.\nInfinite loading screen.(i have this barely once a month).\nWeird hit registration sometimes on killer side.\n\nThere's a few issues left to solve for them, like perk balancing, hit registration, some stuck animations occasionally, map glitches which form blockades on weird spots, but the MAIN issue is stilll: \"region lock\". They stated they had region lock at some point, this proves every day to be simple bs, i'm from Holland and i keep getting these laggyass chinese crapkillers and such. They have never fixed this issue, and it;s been around since release. So if you can't handle requeuing often because of some chinese prick in the wrong region then you might as well not get this game.\n\nAnother thing is survive with friends, alot of people cry 24/7 how unbalanced it is, exept that if you as a killer have learned how to play, you can predict SWF movement and kill a bunch based on that, personally i only play with one friend usually, but i face 3 / 4 SWF groups often, i tend not to have issues killing them unless they bring instant-blinding flashlights.\n\n\nBasically the result is this:\nPro's\n- You can play with friends (3max).*survivors only*\n- The game even though it has his flaws is simply funny as fuck.\n- The blood web(( Where you research your perks )) has had massive improvements, which means instead of spending 150k per bloodweb(which is ALOT) it's now 50/70k per bloodweb.\n- The daily challenges their bloodpoint rewards have been (thank fuck) finally adjusted properly, instead of a lousy 20k, thei're worth now between the 50 and 200k bloodpoints.\n- There's several map types, and of that map type there's probaly 4 different variants, which means it will take a bunch of maps before you get the exact same map and layout again. (Although i tend to be unlucky and get the same map 6 times in a row haha)\n- Last month they FINALLY added a ping indicator, meaning you can avoid most of the china kids with 100000 ping\n- The game is fun to play, alone or with a few friends.\n- Killer is fairly easy to learn (Excluding the nurse for most people).\n- Survivor is really easy to learn, considerinig it involves logical steps, run around. Be tracked & seen, crouch or walk and be fairly safe. Hiding behind objects is the best way to go. Don't over-use lockers.. Etc\n\n\nAs killer the game is fairly easy to learn, however i would not advice new players to play the nurse. Personally im a nurse main, but the nurse is difficult to learn for alot of people.\nNo killer is the same as the other. Examples below:\n(trapper) - One killer lays beartraps, \n(hag) - Another killer lay's teleport traps. If triggered that killer can teleport to that specific trap.\n(nurse) - One killer can teleport freely around the map, and suprise any running/walking survivors. fairly easy.\n(hillbilly) - One killer has the ability of running across the map with a chainsaw, whoever he hits on his path will die instantly.\n(leatherface) - One killer also has a chainsaw, but is a close-range frontline massacre. Meaning not only one,  but the whole team can be killed by his chainsaw attack if they're around him.\n(the shape) - One killer has the ability of playing the entire match without hearthbeat, meaning nobody will hear you coming. You however are slower then all other killers that way, so this killer has the option of leveling up during the game. Granting you movement speed at rank 2, and at rank 3 granting you instant-downs.\n(Wraith) - One killer has complete invisiblity, although this sounds really nice. This is at the moment the weakest killer of the game. They are planning to release a rework on him though, as this killer is so weak he can't do shit most of the matches.\n(huntress) - This is the only killer which has ranged attacks, she starts with 5 hatches. And has the ability to throw them as she wishes, meaning even on range you won't be safe from her attacks.\n(doctor) - This killer is simply boring as fuck to play against, he has 2 attack styles, one which makes him able to zap people around him, showing their location to him, this ability has 3 stages meaning the more a survivor gets hit by his electricity, the higher stage they go. The more stages they get (max 3) the more weird stuff the survivor can encounter. Weird skillchecks, fake pallets, fake killer halicunations, sudden hearthbeat out of nowhere. ETC Where as the other  fighting ability he can simply smack you on the head.\n\nAll this means you have to play different against each killer in order to survive, no killer is the same. Forcing you to adjust your playstyle. That's what makes this game fun. Although fighting the doctor is simply boring as it is annoying.\n\n\nThe game's Cons so far are : (excluding the massive amount of issues they had 6 months ago)\nNo region lock even though they said at some point they had it. Meaning laggyass killers are hosting continuesly. (Thank fuck there's a ping inidicator now though)\nNo proper servers for matchmaking, meaning the killer is the host, as stated above the killer can be some china kid with the ping of 1k.\nSome maps have some glitches, like trees blocking chests. Or simply spots which should be accessable.\nSometimes the hit registrations are off, something which should not have hit, hits anyway.\nDropping down pallets to create distance between you & the killer sometimes doesnt work properly, as you get teleport to the wrong side of the pallet.\nMatchmaking occasionally takes forever, although this used to be a problem. Not so much anymore now.\nOccasional infinite loading screen tends to happen, usually means 1 of the survivors has crashed during loading, causing the game to stuck for others.\nYour teammate survivors can be the dumbest people on the planet sometimes.\nThe end-game chat tends to be nothing but salt from either sides, best to just close the dam thing and move on.\nPeople have had save file losses for some reason, personally i never experienced it. It's easily avoided by simply backing up your save file once a week atleast.","timestamp_created":1482087161,"timestamp_updated":1542882113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488346308469772339","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453223","author":{"steamid":"76561198089600093","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1564005274},"language":"italian","review":"Ottimo da giocare in compagnia ma per la ricerca di partite si necessita del dlc Trova Lobby venduto separatamente","timestamp_created":1482086941,"timestamp_updated":1482086941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453134","author":{"steamid":"76561198193014639","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1524846492},"language":"russian","review":"Cкачай и узнаешь)","timestamp_created":1482086638,"timestamp_updated":1482670465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453123","author":{"steamid":"76561198352182641","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":183196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1330,"playtime_at_review":85783,"last_played":1660600673},"language":"english","review":"LuL","timestamp_created":1482086613,"timestamp_updated":1608239673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453042","author":{"steamid":"76561198068248489","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":32936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7898,"last_played":1642085877},"language":"russian","review":"Кривое, ебаное, дисбалансное говно.\nЕсли ты думаешь пробывать или нет, поверь не стоит.\nС каждым годом игра все хуже и хуже.\nМогилка уже готова, ей осталось только туда лечь.\n\n","timestamp_created":1482086397,"timestamp_updated":1645191383,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28452971","author":{"steamid":"76561198009808715","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":37863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10395,"last_played":1640654394},"language":"english","review":"You Play 175 hour in game and lost all your points\\perks and level.

Here's my current take on it.\n\nGood points:\n\n1. Spooky and atmospheric. Once you've played as killer a couple dozen times, it's not too \"horrifying\" anymore, though.\n\n2. Unique asymmetric multiplayer cat-and-mice gameplay. It's a good idea at its core. Fun, even.\n\n3. Easy learning curve on Killer. You'll want to read a guide or two to learn the ropes, but it's not hard to catch novice survivors even without perks or items.\n\nBad points (why I don't recommend):\n\n1. Huge learning curve on survivors, made worse by the lack of good perks for newbies. The developers have nerfed some of the more overpowered perks so the power increase isn't as big as it used to be, but until you (randomly) unlock the high tier stuff, evading the Killer is extremely hard. Even veteran players would have a hard time escaping if not for their top tier perks. (Note that these newbie Survivors can very well be your teammates.)\n\n2. There is no record of wins, losses, escapes, or deaths. The few words it says after a match is over (\"Disgraceful Defeat\", \"Merciless Victory\") mean *nothing*. That means the game isn't a competition. It's a sandbox.\n\n3. The game encourages point farming. Because there is no real victory or defeat, the only thing that matters is reaching the point thresholds (7000, 10000, 20000) to influence your skill ranking, and maximizing points per minute. \n\nRather than fixing generators and escaping, veteran Survivors will deliberately bait the Killer into chasing them because this is the biggest source of points. You get points for being chased, for losing the Killer, for dropping pallets on the Killer, for healing yourself, for rescuing teammates from a hook ... and you miss out on all of this by being sneaky and safe.\n\nAmong experienced players, it's not uncommon for a game to end with everyone's points hovering around 15,000. Everyone wins. What's the point? To get more perks so you can farm faster? Why?\n\n4. The maps have a wide range of favoring Killer or favoring Survivors. The maps with \"infinite loops\" are not quite as bad as they used to be since the recent addition of the Bloodlust mechanic (killer speeds up in very prolonged chases). But Killer should always hate to see Autohaven Wreckers, and Survivors are probably not too happy on maps with few mazes, windows, and pallets.\n\n5.

When it works, it can be a lot of fun. But more often than not it doesn't work because of the sheer imbalance and the developer's inability to actually fix anything. Also, be warned, the community in this game is the most toxic and hurtful I have ever seen. DOTA and LOL do not even come close to the levels of pure salt and harrasment you will receive from your opponents, including spamming insults all over your Steam wall or any other social media accounts people can get a hold of. It is absolutely disgusting and the devs refuse to do anything about it other than filling out a mountain of paper work just to report someone. \n\nThere are some glaring problems in this game that a lot of the 'veteran' players don't want to admit exist. Camping a hooked survivor is one of them, where the killers hangs around a hooked survivor until they die. The other survivors have no chance at all to save their teammate and the only real counter is to use the time to get generators done. But it just sucks being the person on the hook and it sucks not being able to even attempt to save them. It's not fun gameplay for anyone involved but the killer. What happens as a result of it is often a better idea to keep working on objectives instead of helping teammates, because camping essentially gives you free time to win the game. Sure you probably win the game, but it's hardly fun.\n\nSecondly some killers are just way overpowered. Some are too fast, not giving you even a remote chance to escape. Others have the ability to plant traps which they can teleport to instantly which feeds back into the camping issue above. Overall the game is unbalanced. A moderately experienced player with the right perks who abuses an overpowered killer has the potential to make any match incredibly frustrating. And no game should aim to be frustrating, it should be fun for all involved. Even if losing and dying every once in a while is part of the game.\n\nThirdly, the game just isn't optimized well. Framerate is questionable. No dedicated servers means you're at the mercy of the player who hosts the game. If they have a bad connection you'll be lagging all match long and probably lose because of it. Matchmaking itself is horrible at times. During off times it seems to do its job, but once it gets even a little busy in the evenings the entire matchmaking system sh*ts itself. Random disconnects from lobbies, randomly kicked back to the main menu. It all happens, and in some cases it happens many times in a row.\n\nLastly, the community (survivors especially) is incredibly toxic, and no effort on the developers part to easily report this behavior. If you like being verbally abused by a team of 12 year olds after every game, this is the game for you without a doubt.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe overall impression of this game is that it feels a lot like an early access title. Lots of bugs, lots of balance issues, lots of optimization issues. Instead of fixing them the developers rather focus on bringing out DLC that unbalances the game even further with more overpowered killers.\n\nUntil the mentioned issues are fixed I can't really recommend this game, even though I do enjoy playing it.

And happily I can do it again but this time, give it a positive opinion. \n\nGame is quite unique. Few titles seems to share similar premise but none is like Dead by Daylight. Despite visibile pass of time between now and premiere, game still look valid. sound and music are fine, although may be a bit buggy. Im saying may be as I'm not sure whather it's actual a bug or by design. But killer created sound like Huntress Lulaby or Hillbilly chainsaw are not coming from killer's directions. While it may be okay form most of killers as their sound is valdi indicator oftheir general distance when out of Terror radius, Huntress Lullaby seems to be coming form direction opposite to killer.\n\nWhen it comes to fun.. It is fun. Mostly. As long as you are not exactly competetive. Game is heavly skewed toward killers to a point where certain mechanics become obsolete (like wigge or sabotage). So when you start at Rank Level 20 and will graduaty go down, it's perfectly fine till Rank 9-11. Unfortunately when you get to this \"mid\" tier of games you will see significant lee variety of killers, facing only few who are current \"meta\" and they will be played by killers with Wallet or really experienced ones... \n\nAnd what do i mean with Wallet? Thios game has by now a lot of DLCs which offer new killers and survivors. Every killer and survivor has his \\ hers own set of perks that can \"pciked up\" by other characters if play particular charcter long enough. All of those things can also be bought with in-game currecny called Iridiscent Shards but... it's grindy. Really grindy. I have atm around 135h og gameplay and I could buy like 2, maybe 3 additional characters with Shards. Devs make it a bit easier as every few days you can buy perk from shop (using Shards) with fraction of character cost but you you would have to be lucky to get those you want. So yeah, sort of pay to win so to speak. \n\nSo yeah, as long as you are here for experience - not stats - this is good game for you. If your reason to play is to beat other players... yeah, it may be for you. Just get few cruicial DLCs and play the killer.","timestamp_created":1482079691,"timestamp_updated":1564869467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28451000","author":{"steamid":"76561198088884655","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3,"last_played":1471191906},"language":"german","review":"Unbalanziert durch Gamer die nur mit Spielern spielen die ihrem Level genügen, also sehr offen die Community!","timestamp_created":1482079615,"timestamp_updated":1482079615,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28450915","author":{"steamid":"76561198143304094","num_games_owned":390,"num_reviews":304,"playtime_forever":11065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":384,"playtime_at_review":1146,"last_played":1660606856},"language":"english","review":"Addictive game but needs some balance about maps and killers... it was my 2016 review\n \n EDIT: WOW the game improved so much... !!! 2019 !!!

Esto quiere decir que si el equipo de la persona que esta jugando como asesino no es un computador potente, tardaras en iniciar la partida y muy probablemente tendras lag. Tambien si su conexion a internet no es buena, al hacer de servidor para 4 conexiones extra a las que envia y recibe datos, tambien contribuira al lag. Ademas si alguno de los otros 4 jugadores no cuenta con buena conexion tambien tendras lag. Pero este SIEMPRE pasa en todos los juegos on line, no es nada nuevo, es algo que todos conocemos y hasta que no tengamos conexiones de 1gb disponibles en todo el mundo es algo que siempre habra.\n\nOtro punto a considerar es que por cada asesino hay cuatro victimas, lo que repercute en el tiempo de encontrar partida disponible. Consideren que por cada 5 jugadores solo hay un servidor disponible. Ahora esto no quiere decir que pasaran horas, en todo el tiempo que he jugado no he tardado mas de 10 minutos en encontrar partida, y eso las veces que tarda, generalmente me tardo mas decidiendo como gastar mis puntos de sangre que encontrando partida.\n\nEl matchmaking tambien es algo que muchos aborrecen, si, puede pulirse, yo con nivel 17 me han tocado partidas con jugadores nivel 3 y 2 (mientras mas bajo mejor). Hay que considerar que es un juego reciente, tiene pocos jugadores, si, generalmente hay alrededor de 7000 jugadores conectados pero aunque parezca un gran numero al imponer mejores reglas para nivelar las partidas causaran que se tarde mas tiempo en encontrar una disponible. Asi que por el momento, mi comentario es que el matchmaking si se puede mejorar pero no es una buena idea que lo hagan.\n\nOtra queja que he leido de los asesinos es que su power level es muy alto en comparacion con las victimas, no es cierto, no esta desproporcionado, si un asesino es mas rapido que las victimas y si lo juegas bien subes mas rapido, pero alguna ventaja debe de tener ya que es uno contra cuatro, si entre las victimas no cooperan el asesino siempre va a ganar, pero si cooperan minimamente siempre habra alguien que escape.\n\nUna que siempre leo es \"este asesino se la pasaba campeando\" cuando leo esto lo primero que me viene a la mente es que no entienden el juego y en este caso si me refiero al juego en si, hay diferentes perks (mejoras a equipar)  que permiten crear el estilo de juego que mejor te parezca, y si, hay perks que pueden hacer al asesino el camper perfecto, pero es un estilo de juego, es algo que el juego permite enojarse por ello es un sin sentido. Decir que el asesino trampero estuvo un campeando es como quejarse de que Jade Park se la paso saboteando, para los que no lo conocen Jade es una victima que se especializa en sabotear al asesino. Y con esto no quiero decir que el trampero siempre sera camper, hay tramperos que se especializan en cazar y Jade Park's que se especializan en ayudar a los demas. Como dije, cada quien los personaliza como mejor se adapte a su sistema de juego. \n\nAdemas si estas jugando y te das cuenta de que el asesino es un camper, simplemente no te acerques a ese lado del mapa, ve por los objetivos que esten lejos de el....y lastima por el sobreviviente que ya haya capturado, a veces es necesario sacrificar a uno o mas companieros para sobrevivir y que mejor que no seas tu el sacrificado.\n\nPor lo anterior yo le doy una calificacion de 9 sobre 10. Y esto porque no hay ningun juego perfecto, todos pueden mejorarse. El juego es muy bueno, comprenlo de verdad no se arrepentiran si les gusta el genero de terror. Si lespuede llegar a sacar uno que otro susto.\n\nPros: \n\nEl sistema de juego es muy bueno y original, 5 jugadores, 4 de ellos cooperando para escapar un quinto. \nTodos los personajes a pesar de estar enfocado a algo puedes personalizarlos como mejor te acomoden.\nVariedad de asesinos, y al ser controlados por gente real nunca te tocara un asesino jugando del mismo modo a pesar de que usen el mismo personaje.\nDe igual manera, nunca sabes quienes te tocaran de companieros sobrevivientes, y apesar de que todos llegaran a jugar con el mismo personaje no necesariamente tendran las mismas aptitudes.\n\nContras:\n\nHay cortos tiempos de espera para encontrar partidas.\nPuede haber lag en algunas.\n\nInsisto, es un buen juego, solo recuerden que dependiendo del rol que tomes es la estrategia que deberas seguir. Como asesino debes planear cada movimiento ya que juegas contra 4 personas mas, como jugador puedes decidir si ver por ti mismo o ayudar a los demas, recuerden que la fuerza de los sobrevivientes esta en el numero....pero a veces al ayudar a alguien ayudas al asesino.","timestamp_created":1482072301,"timestamp_updated":1486958187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28448511","author":{"steamid":"76561198093554024","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":33361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1985,"last_played":1637831237},"language":"japanese","review":"数日間プレイしたがロードが長すぎる\nゲームを起動して８割はロードやマッチングをしている時間\n実際プレイ時間以上に待たされる時間の方が長い\nさらに無限ロードみたいなもあり待っても進まなかったり\nそれが数回に１回はなる\n\nゲームが出来ないゲームはクソゲー以下だと思う\n\n\n\nゲーム自体は最初は追う追われる緊張感があるが\n敵が放棄したり舐めプしだすととたんに緊張感も何も無くなる\n\nそれに今は上級者がほとんどで今からやるにはオススメしない","timestamp_created":1482071799,"timestamp_updated":1482139895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4979991614818573","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28448250","author":{"steamid":"76561198352084800","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1569839869},"language":"koreana","review":"非常好玩","timestamp_created":1482070990,"timestamp_updated":1482070990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28448179","author":{"steamid":"76561198192162814","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":23643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":489,"last_played":1657756451},"language":"english","review":"[b] Awesome ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","timestamp_created":1482070721,"timestamp_updated":1482070721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589850544929504395","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28448122","author":{"steamid":"76561198004461624","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":21104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3344,"last_played":1656153117},"language":"koreana","review":"일단 게임이... 로딩엄청길고 버그 많고.. 한글화좀해주세요...!!!!!!\n그래도 나름 재미는 있네요..게임한번하기가 어려워서 그렇지..무한로딩..엄청짜증남...!!!!!","timestamp_created":1482070544,"timestamp_updated":1482070544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28448089","author":{"steamid":"76561198260956867","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11759,"last_played":1657640226},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Daylight is a really funny game.With Friends it is one of the best games!! love it","timestamp_created":1482070454,"timestamp_updated":1637883555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28448039","author":{"steamid":"76561198264083237","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10388,"last_played":1578766997},"language":"schinese","review":"我买的是bug，你凭什么给我带个游戏。\n——————————————————\n2017.5.10为杨永信点赞\n——————————————————\n2017.10.26期待弗莱迪和兔耳凤敏","timestamp_created":1482070270,"timestamp_updated":1509011907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28447997","author":{"steamid":"76561198101119702","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":40502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15666,"last_played":1648645669},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric 'horror' survival game.
