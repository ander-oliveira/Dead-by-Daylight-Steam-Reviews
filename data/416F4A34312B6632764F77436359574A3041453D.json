Playing against killers felt like an impending cycle of doom and despair, and it felt frustrating fruitlessly trying to outrun a killer with any idea of how to play the game. Now I'm 200+ hours in, and I've never experienced this kind of \"I am glad I was wrong\" phenomenon with any other game. \n\nNot only is there a solid amount of depth between all the different perks and items, but the gameplay itself has got me discovering more and more ways of being that much more effective as both a survivor and a killer every time I play it. As a Survivor, the ways in which you can outsmart the Killer are numerous (and outright ridiculous), and the feeling of satisfaction when you and your friends make it out alive is remarkable. The early hours as a survivor are tough, and there isn't a great way of finding out what to do and not to do as a beginner, which may deter newer players, but I personally find the learning process rewarding. It's not always about making it out alive, but getting that much better for when you take on the next trial. But the game isn't called \"Survive by Daylight\", and it's when you quit running and get to slashing that things really take an interesting turn.\n\nI think I can pinpoint the moment I began turning around on this game when I first played as a Killer. The feeling of brutally shutting down the survivors' efforts and outsmarting them is immensely satisfying, and the roster of Killers leads to distinct learning curves that makes me interested in mastering every single one of them. Not only that, but playing as each of the Killers allowed me to better understand how to beat them when me and my friends try to survive against them. I came to this game trying to survive, but I think it's playing Killer that will keep me to stay.\n\nPositives aside, I would have to say my biggest complaint with this game is the balance issues, particularly how the game leans towards Survivors (which is impossible to believe if you only play Survivor). I'm aware that the developers are constantly working to make the game as balanced as possible, but the combination of numerous bugs and connection issues can add up to some pretty frustrating matches. I'd also appreciate if there was a better means of avoiding certain players so as not to repeat some very toxic player experiences I've had so far. \n\nI could talk on and on about this game (and I just might some time), but I will definitely say that this is a worthwhile $20 well spent, and I'm really happy to see that the developers are steadily adding more and more content to make this a long-living community.\n\nBe kind to one another, and for the love of all that is holy please stop tea-bagging after you slam a pallet down. It's very unbecoming.

I bought this game roughly 2 months ago, and I've learned quite a bit about playing it, and the main thing I've realized is that the game itself and the community that play it are not welcoming to new players at all. \n\nThe game itself makes it very hard to play at a high level unless you grind for probably about 100 hours, potentially more if you want to play both survivor and killer. The reason it takes so long, is that you have to grind characters to level them up in order to unlock abilities for all the characters. Now, you CAN still play both survivor and killer without meta perks, but once you start to get to higher ranks, it gets much more difficult to win games without them, especially as killer. I'm at about 85 hours currently and have finally unlocked I think 4 of the meta abilities for killer alone. One might take less time to unlock meta perks, but when I first started playing, I didn't know how necessary it was to grind certain characters, so I was just leveling up everybody. \n(I want to note that the devs have said that they're trying to make their game more approachable for newer players, so hopefully this will change soon.)\nEDIT: They made it so it's SLIGHTLY easier to grind for perks, but only marginally, so I'm going to keep this part in my review. I've doubled my hours since posting this review and I'm still grinding for certain meta perks.\n\nThe community in this game is super toxic, definitely one of the most toxic communities I've seen. Not everybody is an asshole, but a very large percentage are. If a killer doesn't like you, or how you play, they'll only go after you, or camp your body when you're hooked so you'll die. Survivors tend to be toxic regardless of who you play or how you play. They'll Tbag constantly, or point at you any time they stun you. Also, if you don't play how the others WANT you to play, they'll flame you in the chat after the game's over. I remember one of my first games, my teammates were flaming me in chat after the game because I unhooked him too soon, so he ended up going down twice in a row. I was like rank 17, still didn't know how the game works. I've been flamed by both killers and survivors a ton in this game, but it tends to mostly be survivors that do it. I've just turned off chat in this game now.\nEDIT: The game has somehow gotten even more toxic lately. Tons of survivors are now disconnecting from games and I'm not sure why it started, but it has started ruining about half the matches I play. Until the devs do something about DCing, then this game is going to keep spiraling into the shitter.\n\nAlso, survive with friends is a very unbalanced thing in this game. One of the ways the game is balanced is the fact that all the survivors lack communication, so they have to be weary of who the killer is, where he is, what he's doing, etc... using small clues that the game gives you, so that they know when it's safe or not to do certain tasks. When 4 people queue together as survivor, that throws all that in the toilet because they can use 3rd party voice chat to tell each other where the killer is, what he's doing, which pallets are used and not used, etc... This is essentially \"easy mode\" for survivors, but I don't think they devs are going to do anything about it, because if they removed it or limited it, a big chunk of their player base will disappear because a majority of the players for this game are survivor players. It also doesn't help that survive with friend players tend to be the most toxic of all.\n\nKiller also has very overpowered things, like Mori's and the omegablink nurse (base nurse is fine) but I think the big difference between them and survive with friends(SWF) is that Mori's aren't actually all that fun to use, but SWF is very fun to do because you're playing the game with your friends, and that's obviously going to be more fun to do.\n\nAlso, as a bonus note, the developers like to turn a blind eye to stream sniping in this game. I've seen quite a few streamers get (very blatantly) sniped in this game, and they devs have stated that they're just okay with it, and they're not going to ban them, even when it persists for days, weeks, or months.\n\nBUT if you have thick skin, can put in the time to grind for perks, but are okay with the game being unbalanced in some ways, then this game is a lot of fun. It's just a lot to get over before the game becomes enjoyable.\n\nTLDR: \nA LOT of grinding in this game (may be changed in the future)\none of the most toxic communities I've encountered\nsearch with friends is overpowered (probably won't change in the future)\ndevs are okay with stream sniping\n\ngame and community not welcoming to new players, but if you can get over all the humps, it's fun for the most part.","timestamp_created":1565499374,"timestamp_updated":1571466780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508190393447875977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54560123","author":{"steamid":"76561198347772366","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":48752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23654,"last_played":1651987438},"language":"koreana","review":"갓겜 보장","timestamp_created":1565493508,"timestamp_updated":1577370977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487835794687271118","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54559907","author":{"steamid":"76561198843186698","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3039,"last_played":1611057501},"language":"koreana","review":"데바데 사랑해 절대 잊지 않을게 ㅠㅠ 다른 사람들이 손가락질 해도 난 너를 보듬어 줄 거야... 토구 사랑해... 언니 휘파람 너무 좋아요...","timestamp_created":1565492135,"timestamp_updated":1565492135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54559654","author":{"steamid":"76561198350490330","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1063,"last_played":1594435685},"language":"english","review":"Dis is my ish!!!","timestamp_created":1565490426,"timestamp_updated":1565490426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54559632","author":{"steamid":"76561198405785471","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1565488748},"language":"english","review":"I heard about this game from friends, thought it would be a good idea to get.

Nothing is clear about it. And, this creature, the Entity has affected normal, classic people, who've been through a lot more than anyone can even imagine.\nSome of them have died, or have almost died, and the Entity was the only chance to live. Some didn't die, but the Entity has taken them and used them.\nNone of those have tried or learnt, how to escape the Entity itself, so, they work with it. They bring her Survivors, people, to Sacrifice them for it. That way, the Killers have to Hook those Survivors, instead of Killing them.\n[spoiler]Do not expect, that this game is based on reality. It's not.[/spoiler]\n\nSo, the Survivors have to repair the five Generators to give the Gates enough of a power to be opened. Once they open them, they can escape, but in the meantime, the Killer is hunting them. The Survivors can run, use windows, wooden Pallets, that can be dropped, (...), to escape the Killer.\nOnce they reach the area in one of the two Exit Gates, they've escaped the Realm, and have survived that day.\n\nThis should be enough for the basic informations about this game, but gameplay differs from them a bit, so, take it in mind.\n\nThe Developers are well aware, that the Survivors, those players, can use unarthorized third party programs, that gain an unfair advantage over the Killer - over the players without even being punished.\nThis game wasn't meant and isn't meant for voice communications, but because something went wrong, they've allowed them to use it.\nThey can't afford to make them as a bannable offense, as they may lose around 60 % or more of their whole playerbase, if they do so.\nIn short, even here is being applied a term, ''money > fun, fair-play.\n\nAnd, the most annoying part.\nThe Developers haven't learnt a thing. Instead, they've decided to give the majority of their, this, playerbase (to the Survivors) an option to leave, to disconnect from the match without any further punishment, except of not gaining any Bloodpoints from the match, that are being spend on upgrading your characters.\nThey can even keep their Items, that can cost from 3 000 Bloodpoints to 19 000 Bloodpoints. That has been acknowledged numerous times, no response, no action has been taken.\nYes, they've told us, that they do ban people for leaving very often, like 2/5 off of their total number of matches played, so, almost never.\n\nAnd, a part of it, that can basically rid out your feeling about winning the match, if you play as a Killer, that there's a Hatch, AKA black door., that spawns randomly in the map, whenever there's only one Survivor remaining.\nSo, the Survivors can easily just disconnect, and the last Survivor can escape without any effort, just because that player has decided to do so.\nIt's been acknowledged, and nothing has been done about it.\n\nAnd, a bit of a grimm part, why this game isn't suitable for people, who can't take being insulted, harrassed, threatened, getting wishes to die, their family to die, (...).\nThe community is mostly very annoying, thanks to the way they tend to behave. I don't mean to throw everyone into one single bag, but if you beat them in the match, they're able to spam on your profile page, into your comment wall, that you're, ..... I'll rather not elaborate it any further, as I'd have had to break the Steam rules in order to do that.\n\nThere is no Valve-Anti-Cheat ban, so, that's why none can be banned for using third party programs.\nThe game isn't that well optimized, so, you do need a bit better PC than the current average is nowadays, and that's it.\n\n\nThink twice before buying the license to be able to play this game.\nIt can really change yourself into a very annoying person, who can't take any criticism, who has to be angry, who can't control himself / herself, and so on.\n\nIf you're interested in what I've meant about the harrassments and insults, feel free to take a look at my profile page, at the comment wall of mine.\nYou'll see, what do I mean, and quickly understand, why I am so much against this game.\nYes, I do enjoy it to some degree, but every sinlge insult, no matter against whom it has been used kinda makes me feel, like I don't belong to this community.\nThe majority doesn't respect the PEGI recommended age, so, expect the same community as from Rocket League - A community, where you'll highly probably meet a five year old people, therefore kids, who can't control themselves.\nThe thing is, they don't care, that they're not even aware of how stupid they do look.\n\nI can't recommend this game, right now, as the harrassments and insults are normal, because the Developers can't afford to ban the majority of their whole community, the community of this game.\n\nIf you decide to join us, I do really wish you a lot of luck, but even more of health. Those people don't think before they act, they can change your whole yourself, if you play this game very often. Be careful out there.\n\nSee you in The Fog!\n\n***\nYes.. And, don't even bother with the support. They'll gladly ignore you - Both, BHVR and Valve.","timestamp_created":1565439376,"timestamp_updated":1598969781,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513683676719665527","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54549196","author":{"steamid":"76561198381710469","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":7178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5994,"last_played":1580480299},"language":"english","review":"One of the best Horror chasing games 10/10 (You will Enjoy It)\n","timestamp_created":1565438543,"timestamp_updated":1565438543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54549014","author":{"steamid":"76561198041184223","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3003,"last_played":1658245660},"language":"norwegian","review":"Underholdende spill, litt vanskelig i starten, men veldig gøy når du har lært det og unlocka flere perks","timestamp_created":1565437637,"timestamp_updated":1565437637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54548514","author":{"steamid":"76561198376317713","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1058,"last_played":1642011524},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень интересная, спасибо разработчикам, что интересно играть как за маньяка, так и за выживших, что очень важно.

This game IS NOT a horror game. It's more a survival type of game we're the survivors try to fight back at the killer. You as a new player probably want to play killer because you will be strong like god and all. But you are better of watching a guide so you will know what the expect. You need a strong will and the ability to think positive instead of negative. You need the ability to say \"Fuck off!\" to anger or sadness. Keep learning. Watch a few guides for the basics.
