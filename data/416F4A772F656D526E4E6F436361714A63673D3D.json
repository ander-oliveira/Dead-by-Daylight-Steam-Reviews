But it is really hard to fix. Cause survivors are actually only to strong on a high skill level\n\nSurvivor Items in generall:\nIf a survivor pulls the plug he doesnt loose the item\nWhen the killer disconnects normally or also with the plug you lose your items almost every time. Also offerings like Black Ward won't save it.\n\n-Balance on the maps:\nI must say the maps are in a pretty good balance now. They need remove some pallets here and there but i feel with bloodlust the killers and the surviors are in a pretty balanced state.\n\n-Matchmaking is random. Even tho they say it is fixed. It is acutally not.\nRank 1s Get rank 20s in the game. Also almost all of the rank 1s cant play the game properly. A new rank system is needed.\n\n-Queue time as SWF (surviving with friends) is horror. Doesnt work at all. The survivor game inviter must search in specific regions to find games which is pretty annoying and time wasting.\n\nWhat i like:\nEven though there are alot of cons i love to play the game, with friends or with randoms or as a killer. It all makes fun and i must say the game needs some more adjustment but it is in a pretty good state now and i can give a postivie review! :)","timestamp_created":1487073116,"timestamp_updated":1495346463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29918914","author":{"steamid":"76561198053549767","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1505764007},"language":"english","review":"Game can be annoying but has amazing potential.\nBut easy to die and only about 1/10 games you will actually win as a survivor.\nGlad they finally added the option to play with friends.\n7.5/10\n","timestamp_created":1487072490,"timestamp_updated":1487072490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29918879","author":{"steamid":"76561198072909738","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":101406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6528,"last_played":1622098411},"language":"thai","review":"1.4.0 launch error ทำให้ไม่ได้เล่นมา8เดือน และหลังจากกลับมาเล่น \nระบบยังสุ่มผู้เล่นใหม่ไปปนกับผู้เล่นเก่าอยู่ ผู้พัฒนาขายแต่ของดีเอลซี บัคเยอะในกลุ่มคอมมูนิตี้บ่นกันอยู่\nเล่นเป็นคิลเลอร์หาห้องนานโคตร บัคทุกแพทต์ที่อัพเดต เล่นกับเพื่อนถึงจะสนุกเล่นคนเดียวแปปเดียวก็เบื่อ","timestamp_created":1487072282,"timestamp_updated":1574871698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29918582","author":{"steamid":"76561198354562535","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":282,"playtime_at_review":7231,"last_played":1660317577},"language":"thai","review":"I updated it but it did not matter.

I dont have the best computer by any means, but this game really doesn't even look that good on ultra so I don't understand why it giving me such bad problems. Not only is this game laggy, the mechanics are terrible which I was hoping to be fixed in the latest patch but honestly they have seemed to have gotten worse. Killers hit you when they are stunned or when they aren't close to you. But possibly the worst mechanic in this game is wiggling out of a killer's grip. Countless times I've experienced filling up the bar then somehow being thrown onto a hook 2 seconds later. Killers also need a massive nerf. All killer perks are super useful and most survivor perks pretty much have no use, with the exception of about 8-10 for all characters. The main problem with killers is Mike Myers and the hill billy. Any killer that can instantly down you without any perk should not be in the game and their should also be no killer perk that lets you kill every survivor the first time you get them down. Another problem in the new patch, that's small compared to other gameplay problems, but is still very annoying is the adjusted hitboxes for skill checks. I was playing a game where I got the skill check right on the edge of the great zone and I ended up failing it somehow. Possibly the biggest problem in this game is killers that camp. I get that this isn't a glitch or bug in the game, but there needs to be a penalty added to the game for staying in a certain radius to a hooked survivor. The also needs to be a serious overall in the matchmaking process. Sometimes it takes upwards of 15 minutes for me and two or three of my other friends to find either a killer or one more person. This could be fixed if there was servers instead of having the killer host, which would decrease seriously laggy games. There should also be penalties for leaving a match as a killer or survivor a certain amount of times. So many times I've gotten into a game and a teammate leaves which puts my team at a serious disadvantage or worse a killer leaves and I lose my offering and progress towards ranking up. One other problem in this game is how sometimes a survivor will spawn so close to the killer. I've even been able to see the killer before I can start moving, which instantly ruins the match. For the next few patches here's what needs to be fixed: Let someone be able to escape the killer as soon as they wiggle out, reposition hit boxes for survivors, have skill checks be true to the zone that it shows you, penalize killers and survivors that quit mid game, fix matchmaking times, nerf killers being able to instantly down someone, remove the perk that lets killers instantly kill all survivors, penalize killers that stay close to a hocked survivor/exit and most importantly find a way for the game to be less demanding. This game has serious potential to be great, but I definitely will not be playing as much if at all now until there is some serious performance updates, balancing in gameplay, various glitches and bugs removed and a better system for matchmaking. Would not recommend the game AS OF NOW, but I think if most, but preferably all of these problems were fixed this could be one of the top survival games out there.","timestamp_created":1487031987,"timestamp_updated":1487031987,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524175703525543213","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29911383","author":{"steamid":"76561198197445767","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":44957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32932,"last_played":1608243453},"language":"english","review":"Instead of telling you all the pros and cons of Dead by Daylight, I'll first make a list of all the bugs, glitches and other flaws that still happen to me and my friends regularly over 6 month after the game was fully released:\n\n[list]\n[*]The game freezes or crashes while searching for a game, entering a game or playing a game.\n[*]It often takes literal hours to get into a lobby.\n[*]Matchmaking is terrible. You, as middle rank Survivor, can end up with three low rank Survs against a rank 1 Killer. Or you play against 4 rank 1 Survs as rank 20 (lowest possible rank) Killer. There are no limits for this idiocy.\n[*]There is a feature to play \"Survive with Friends\" together with your steamfriends. However, you often end up alone in the public lobby while you friends get disconnected.\n[*]If you actually made it into a game, you might be the only Survivor left. It can happen that your teammates get disconnected during the loading screen, especially when the Killer has a bad internet connection.\n[*]The game works with a so called P2P connection. That means, that it depends on the lobby host (the Killer) if there is lag or not. Of course there is lag in many games (no, it's not my connection).\n[*]The lag doesn't only affect your movement, but also the skill checks. The indicator will tremble which makes it really hard to succeed the skill check.\n[*]Skill checks often pop up after you went away from the generator. But then you can't even do them successfully anymore.\n[*]There are skill checks that can't physically be done successfully. When the skill-check-area is in the first third of the circle, you only have 0.3 seconds time to react. The shortest reaction time of a human is between 0.2 and 0.3 seconds. This is the time your brain needs to realize what's happening. Then add a few tenth of seconds for your muscular response (clicking space) and BOOM...skill check failed.\n[*]One Killer, the Nurse, can hit you even if he doesn't aim at you. There is an autoaim mechanic that basically let's her hit Survivors automatically if she roughly aims in their direction. The worst abomination of that mechanic is when you run past the Killer quickly, but the killer hits you anyways at an 180° angle.\n[*]The Killer's hit range is under special circumstances ridiculously high. There is a perk that allows you to run faster for a short period of time (Sprint Burst). If it activates while the killer starts performing a hit, you will run away from him, but get hit anyway at distances of over five meters. My high score was when a Nurse got me even though I was already so far away that the heartbeat-rate went down.\n[*]One of the Killers has a chainsaw that kann down you immediately. This chainsaw can saw around corners, through walls and at rare occasions even at an 180° angle. It's magic!\n[*]Some perks don't always or hardly ever work (Decisive Strike, Premonition, Selfheal, Crows from the Shadows).\n[*]If Decisive Strike does work, you can end up stuck in the ground, unable to move.\n[*]In some occasions, the normal sprinting doesn't work after you've been hit.\n[*]You sometimes get locked in the crouching position until you get hit by the killer.\n[*]Pallet vault doesn't always work. Especially when the killer is standing in the space where the pallet should drop. This is extra awesome, since there is a game mechanic that should allow you to rescue a Survivor that is carried on the Killer's shoulder by stunning him.\n[*]When you drop a pallet, it happens many times that the game suddenly teleports you to the side of the pallet you were coming from, directly into the Killer's arms.\n[*]While being carried by the Killer, you should be able to wiggle free. But the wiggle bar doesn't always show up. Same goes for the recover bar.\n[*]When two interact-able objects are close together (e.g. a closet and a window) and you press space to get through it, you might get sucked sideways into or through the other object. The button layout generally needs improvement since too many actions are on the same buttons.\n[*]From time to time you get stuck in stones or in between trees.\n[*]The progress bar doesn't display exactly how far you have progressed. It fails in its entire existence: The exit gate doesn't open, the generator doesn't finish, the Survivor doesn't unhook and the hook doesn't get destroyed when the bar is already entirely full. This means that the Killer can still grab you when you already should have finished.\n[*]When you get grabbed by the Killer, he can hang you on a hook. Then another Survivor has to unhook you. However, you might die randomly before they even get the chance to rescue you.\n[*]You can also die while being unhooked (before the time runs out).\n[*]Or unhook generally doesn't work and you are doomed.\n[*]One of the Killers can lay bear traps. If one of them is close to a hook (but not directly under it) you can get sucked into the trap while unhooking.\n[*]In certain locations, the traps sink into the ground and become invisible.\n[*]The Survivor and Killer models are \"solid\" objects. You can't just run through them (usually, but there is also a glitch were you can). Players can use this to block others in narrow passages and Killers can prevent Survs from unhooking by just standing in front of the hook (body-blocking).\n[*]To prevent players from hiding afk in a closet, the devs have added crows that will fly above a still standing Survivor after a while to give out their position. The problem is, the crows come way too early. If a Killer searches the area where you are more thoroughly than usually, you can't move that much. The crows will appear and basically get you killed.\n[*]As Killer, grabbing Survivors while they unhook or escape through the hatch sometimes doesn't work.\n[*]You don't always get your bloodpoints and pips after a game.\n[*]There are a maximum of three daily rituals (challenges where you get bonus points) at a time. Usually you should be able to replace unfinished ones with a new one every day. It often doesn't work for days.\n[*]A friend of mine lost all his items, addons and offerings that were on the second pages of the loadout screen.\n[*]And last but not least: There is a bug that resets your entire game progress and you can't do anything about it. Thus, if you have really bad luck, you lose hundreds of hours of playtime.\n[/list]\n\nWell, that just have been the bugs. There are more reasons to not buy Dead by Daylight:\n\n[list]\n[*]The devs randomly ban people without specifying any reason.\n[*]To stop people from using infinites (running circles through badly placed obstacles so that the Killer can't catch you), they boarded up most of the windows in the houses. As a result, you now often run into a dead end and end up dead.\n[*]In addition, if you jump through a window three times in a short period of time, they get blocked by some magic fence.\n[*]The stupidity of the pallet placement is hard to comprehend. There are pallets right between to two trees. Guess what, that doesn't stop the killer, since he can walk around trees! Shocking, isn't it?\n[*]The ranking system is weird. You get points for getting chased, but not for staying hidden and thus alive. You can escape and still lose a rank (pip). There are also games where the Killer doesn't murder a single Survivor and still gets twice the points he needs to rank up (get a pip).\n[*]The game allows players to destroy the fun of all other players. I'm talking about camping, body-blocking and infinites. I know, this sadly had become normal in online games, but that doesn't stop me from pointing it out.\n[*]The developers rather focus on pay2 win  or overpriced cloathing DLCs instead of finally fixing all these bugs.\n[/list]\n\nDon't get me wrong, DbD can be fun at the beginning, especially with friends. But you'll often end up upset after playing and the fun you had can't eradicate your anger. Don't do this to you. It's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1487030626,"timestamp_updated":1511663091,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":174,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.774792075157165527","comment_count":32,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910937","author":{"steamid":"76561198189399370","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1768,"playtime_at_review":8091,"last_played":1660607183},"language":"spanish","review":"malditas gonorreas ese parche de mierda no arreglo nada antes lo empeoro perras asquerosas","timestamp_created":1487028027,"timestamp_updated":1487028027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476774275302886963","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910809","author":{"steamid":"76561198216291000","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6530,"last_played":1509007393},"language":"russian","review":"вроде стало норм, но если писать в чате на русском то появляються вопросительные знаки","timestamp_created":1487027200,"timestamp_updated":1487235194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910801","author":{"steamid":"76561198260315250","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1642594307},"language":"koreana","review":"돈지랄 씹조지게 만드는 게임","timestamp_created":1487027155,"timestamp_updated":1599298597,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487046629190444946","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910757","author":{"steamid":"76561198121708682","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":36031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3295,"last_played":1642776118},"language":"spanish","review":"Esperas infinitas si quieres jugar con amigos, por favor solucionen ya este problema.\nNo se puede jugar en grupo en este juego no fomenta el cooperativo.","timestamp_created":1487026960,"timestamp_updated":1487026960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495049476623535156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910716","author":{"steamid":"76561198083542771","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":174596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":204,"playtime_at_review":107359,"last_played":1660594412},"language":"brazilian","review":"Achava que era bom, já tava bom mas tinha que mudar melhor porque já não estava muito bom, tava meio ruim tambem, agora parece que piorou","timestamp_created":1487026740,"timestamp_updated":1575117416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527696549892425537","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910674","author":{"steamid":"76561198036682706","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":93292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2039,"last_played":1615663077},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juegazo, pero tiene muchos problemas si quieres jugar con tus amigos, y mas problemas aun si sois 3 premade.\n\n________________\nGreat game very fun, but lots of problems if you want to play with your friends, and even more when you try to 3 premade.","timestamp_created":1487026551,"timestamp_updated":1487026551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495049476623535156","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29910118","author":{"steamid":"76561198260277656","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":55526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3641,"last_played":1656077669},"language":"french","review":"Magnifique jeux.

Wenn man allerdings als Killer spielen möchte wartet man schon relativ lange, um überhaupt in eine Lobby zu kommen. \nDies ist darauf zurück zuführen dass immer mehr Killer spielen, da das Spiel komplett auf Killer balanced ist!\n\nStändig kommen neue Updates mit Maps und Perks, neue Killer sowieso.\nImmer bessere Austattung für Killer, nach guten Perks beim Survivor sucht man bei den neuen DLC vergebens bzw. werden seltener, die man für \"gut\" oder \"brauchbar\" betiteln kann.\n\nDie Änderungen sind somit nur für den Killer zum Vorteil!\n\nT-Bagging, Camping (Facecamping), und tunneln sind hier angesagt, wer damit nicht klar kommt sollte besser seine Nerven schonen und Rate vom spielen ab.\n\nIch selber Spiele beide Seiten und merke das Survivor fast gar keine Chance mehr haben sich überhaupt zu befreien. Mit dem Rauswinden ist das perfekte Beispiel. Das ist so gemacht, das das Herauswinden eigentlich nicht mehr Funktioniert, da man davor sowiewso schon am Haken hängt. Der Abstand der Haken ist so dimensioniert das es ohne Zusatz Addons und ohne Hilfe von anderen Überlebenden via Paletten und Taschenlampe keine Chance haben sich zu befreien.\nWenn dann von anderen geholfen wird dann wir wieder rumgemeckert.\n\nVolle Chats mit Beleidigungen, Aufregung uns Stress macherei sind hier Tagesprogramm.\n\nCamping und alle anderen Spielmechaniken vom Killer werden ausgenutzt weil die wissen das Überlebenden sowieso an die Haken wollen um zu befreien bzw zu helfen, damit wenigstens etwas vom Spielbetrieb weiter gehen kann, was leider nach hinten losgeht.\nDie neuen Perks (barbecue und Chili) erlaubt es den Killern bei jedem Aufhängen alle Überlebende die weiter als 40m vom Haken entfernt sind einzusehen.\nAlso klar das der direkt zu einem kommt. Mit diesem Perk sollte wohl das Campen beseitigt werden was leider überhaupt nicht funktioniert. \n\nAls Überlebender ist es mittlerweile sehr schwer eine Runde zu gewinnen. Wenn man doch mal das Glück hat vom Haken befreit zu werden ist die einzige Option von den Killern tunneln, da man ja leichtes Opfer ist. Die haben halt Angst dann überhaupt keinen Kill zu bekommen.\n\nIch denke der Entwickler muss einiges noch an Arbeit in dieses Game mit geiler gedachter Spielmechanik reinstecken, damit es irgendwann nicht stirbt. \nEr sollte auf Gleichberechtigung achten, dass nicht zu viel für den Killer verbessert wird sondern auch an die Überlebenden denken und endlich eine Lösung für dieses ständige Camping finden.\nEine Möglichkeit wäre z.B. kein Entitus Fortschritt wenn der Killer x Meter beim Haken steht.\n\nIch hätte natürlich noch mehrere Ideen aber diese hier aufzuzählen bringt leider nichts, denn der Entwickler setzt sowieso nicht die Wünsche der Spieler um, geschweige denn Reagiert darauf.\n\nMan kann für die Zukunft hoffen, dass der Entwickler sich Gedanken macht und das Spiel richtig balanced.","timestamp_created":1487022680,"timestamp_updated":1606051979,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702239334583282471","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29909568","author":{"steamid":"76561198081185434","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":29687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12299,"last_played":1655663204},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego demuestra un buen juego supervivencia cooperativa con amigos.

Да, здесь есть лаги/баги и т.д., но надо помнить что, насколько я знаю, эта игра была придумана 4-мя людьми и денег у них едва хватало, вроде 10к долларов(опять таки, на сколько я знаю) потом в компанию пришли другие люди, но начали её делать 4 человека, и поэтому им можно простить баги/лаги игры, они же не гиганты как Activision, Sony Entertainment, DICE.\nЯ рекомендую эту игру, помните что вы можете вернуть за неё деньги(с определёнными условиями, но вернуть же!).\nКаждый человек имеет право выбора, я никого не заставляю её брать, это ваш выбор если вы её взяли, решение принимаете вы, и только вы!\nВсем удачи.","timestamp_created":1487019938,"timestamp_updated":1488583908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528487205505371094","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29909126","author":{"steamid":"76561198178421690","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":38702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10224,"last_played":1650796428},"language":"english","review":"I rly, rly, rly like this game.

я хочу сказать про эту игру проиграв в нее часов этак 400-450?По началу игра очень нравилась(все-таки игры подобной этой и довольно достойной не было).Игра по-настощему зацепила,даже в Дотан перестал играть,купил все DLC(со скидоном правда) и игра реально доставляла.НО,с каждым новым обновлением она становилась все хуже.\nВо-первых, черный экран при поиске игры(только играя за выживших,за маньяков такой темы не наблюдается).Вроде бы можно играть и за маньяков без бесконечных зависаний в главном меню,но по мне игра за выжившего приносит намного больше драйва.\nВо-вторых, количество читаков и прочих неприятных личностей.Разрабы, в свою очередь, норм системы античита не хотят подключить(в итоге даже у меня(играю без читов) пару раз игра не загружалась по причине того,что мой аккаунт не может пройти античит проверку.\nВ-третьих, ожидание катки составляет примерно минут 7-10 (с учетом черных экранов,вылета из лобби и т.д.),а сама игра длится (в зависимости от вашего скила конечн) минут 10 максимум. Так что время можно потратить довольно много. В-четвертых, очень часто игра вылетает прямо во время матча,со сбросом ранга игра и т.д.,что лично меня заставляет гореть довольно сильно. \nВ-пятых, манера игры многих игроков желает лучшего(кампинг и проч нелицеприятное поведение).Хотя данное являение встречается во многих играх...\nПодводя итоги, могу сказать,что даже несмотря на большое количество недостатков, игра все-равно остается довольно перспективной. Атмосфера на уровне. Советую к покупке,но в настоящий момент только по скидке,т.к. сейчас игра не стоит своих денег.Буду ждать новых обновлений в надежде на исправление всех багов и проч.\nПока количество минусов перевешывает.Думаю со мной многие согласятся.","timestamp_created":1487008024,"timestamp_updated":1487008024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29905309","author":{"steamid":"76561198168939781","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":44382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28738,"last_played":1655211745},"language":"english","review":"very bad game. dead by buglight to be exact , for sure you didnt do a pretty good job so far, fix the hitboxes, please, and also, make camping bannable","timestamp_created":1487007809,"timestamp_updated":1589478385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29905129","author":{"steamid":"76561198012557676","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1611577139},"language":"german","review":"der grösste Müll den ich je gespielt habe","timestamp_created":1487007277,"timestamp_updated":1487007277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29905076","author":{"steamid":"76561198083059480","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1223,"last_played":1642286256},"language":"german","review":"Von der Idee ist das Spiel echt toll, spiele es mit zwei Freunden, alleine eher selten.\nEs dauert eeeewig bis man als Gruppe mal irgendwann eine Runde gefunden hat.
