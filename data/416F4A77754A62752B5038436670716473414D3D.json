Speaking of which as survivors your goal is to escape from the killer normally by powering the exit gates by fixing 5 generators. However you'll need to get good at trying to loop and escape the killer or you'll wind up on the hook, you can be rescued but you can only get hooked twice before the 3rd one is death. Killer's add a ton of variety and is what makes this game shine. Each killer has unique mechanics that makes fighting them feel invigorating and playing as them fun.\n\nNow with that said there is a perk system for survivors and killers, where they have access to unique and common perks, which after you level your survivor sufficiently with enough bloodpoints you can make that survivors perks teachable to other survivors. The same system applies to killers. My biggest grievance with this system is the incredibly grindy nature of trying to get your desirable perks on your character as its literally a process of rng and elimination. You can luck out and max level your perk right away or have to continue leveling your blood web until it shows up. The power difference between level 1 versions of a perk and 3 is often night and day. There is also a serious perk balance issue, a good chunk of perks provide so little value in a game they are borderline useless for both killer's and survivors, while other perks are so blatantly powerful that virtually every survivor and killer is running at least one of them.\n\nAnother grievance I have is the incredible amount of time limited content in this game, every so often Behaviour releases time limited events that give away a ton of free blood points for signing in, inputting silly codes into the cash store or a new tome. Tomes are actually a really nice addition to the game, as it provides another source of highly desired bloodpoints and thankfully you can do older tomes for the bloodpoints you just can't get the cosmetics associated with them as they are time gated. It is nice these cosmetics are mostly available in the game store if you missed out. But if you are a completionist that hates missing out well you'll never be happy then. Honestly, if you are still interested in buying this game pick it up on sale. You'll inevitably want some of the dlc anyways as there is a lot of powerful perks locked away in them, and while technically there is a free to play way to get them from the shrine that is again purely rng that the ones you are looking for will even show up in there.\n\nI would recommend this game, but exercise caution as it can be quite rage inducing until you get established.\nPick it up on sale and ideally do some research and get familiar with some of the mechanics as well before getting thrown in to what is probably one of the few good asymmetric pvp horror games.\n\nBehaviour needs to do something about the bloodpoint grind as the requirements for new players is quite steep, you need about 1million bloodpoints on average to unlock all the teachable perks for a specific character to even just have a chance of showing up in another character's bloodweb. Where on average you are expecting 20~30k bloodpoints per game played. Established players play so much they already have everything maxed out anyways and are swimming in bloodpoints, but if new players can't even get some sort of bone to have a chance of competing they'll likely just quit before they even get to that stage. New players are also less likely to be aware of these silly codes that are often worth a ton of bloodpoints. They also need to do some serious reworks and buffs for the undesirable perks for killers/survivors. Almost a quarter of the perks are so situational they are effectively useless in most games. The gap between level 1 and 3 perks could also be shrunken a bit as well to help new players stand on their feet a bit better.","timestamp_created":1649040180,"timestamp_updated":1649040238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113312019","author":{"steamid":"76561198285763960","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":39784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":36641,"last_played":1659585473},"language":"english","review":"Shit game","timestamp_created":1649039377,"timestamp_updated":1649039399,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113311672","author":{"steamid":"76561198062347869","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":30,"playtime_at_review":9911,"last_played":1660409981},"language":"latam","review":"Tengo una relación amor-odio con el game jaja básicamente entro para llevar mi nivel de estrés al mango pero es que no hay con qué darle, es un vicio.
