Now, I wont say perfect because there are couple flaws that this game brings with it, one of the bigger ones being the matchmaking system. However, I do think these problems can be easily fixed. Anyways, this game can be played on your own, but if you want the best possible experience I recommend playing with friends. If you don't have anyone to play with though, that is totally fine I just recommend playing the killer playlist instead of survivor. This is simply because not being able to communicate with your teammates when playing survivor can make the game really stressful at times.

НЕТ. ДАЖЕ  НЕ ДУМАЙ ПОКУПАТЬ ЭТО Д Е Р Ь М О. Будешь играть за маньяка от тебя все будут убегать, не важно какие у тебя навыки, не важно какое у тебя подношение, не важно какой у тебя опыт. Все решает РАНДОМ. Да, да, именно он. Все решает точка спавна, или подношение. А ты если тебе не повезет с картой ты будешь слабаком который ничего не сможет сделать. А вот при игре за выжившего, ха-ха! Тебя будут пинать маньяки как угодно и чем угодно. Не важно с чем ты или какой твой опыт в игре. (Скажу проще если тебе лень читать все что выше) Если ты играешь за выжившего - тебя насилуют морально и физически все маньяки, ты беспомощен. Играешь за маньяка - пока повесишь одного первый раз, уже будет починено 4 генератора. И плевать что ты только начал игру. И да, есть кое что хуже задротов этой игры а именно ЧИТЕРЫ! Они будут тебе попадаться в каждой игре, даже если не в каждой то через игру они будут. Это как рандом этой игры что так все зависит от удачи, что и встретишь ты маньяка или нет тоже зависит от удачи. А читов на эту игру \"МАМА РОДИ МЕНЯ ОБРАТНО\". Вот их столько для этой игры, глаза выколоть можно, то на ВХ, то на АИМ то вообще могут поставить игру на паузу, что бы она у всех остановилась, выйти из катки и оставить всю игру в паузе. Приходиться тогда выходить из игры. Но тебе сразу за это дадут бан. Могу подметить один плюс этой игры. Здесь за выход из игры дают сначало 5 минут, потом 15 и лишь потом 30. Это плюс поскольку в игре под названием CS:GO тебе сразу дадут бан на 30 минут, просто я ознакомлен с этой игрой больше чем с Dead by Daylight. В целом под конец скажу что над игрой не работают уже как года 2, потому что у нее нет конкурентов, по этой причине разработчики ничего не делают что с багами игры, что с балансом, что с читерами. Если вы слишком вспыльчивый человек и у вас горит пердак от любой игры. Покупать не советую...Нет, ЗАПРЕЩАЮ! Ваша жопа сгорит вместе со всем что находиться под ним, хотя выбор за вами. Если же вас не спугнуло что все написано выше. \"Гоуст Фейс\" вам в помощь. Рекомендую ее лишь тем людям, которые не будут  играть на ранги этой игры, (хотя не понимаю зачем они вообще нужны) а будут играть в нее для веселья, сам или с друзьями. Но друзей тоже ищите не бомбящих.

I'd play for hours. Far too many really.  I have decided to step away from it now.  The community is toxic, the developer doesn't care to balance it, and it's just boring.  Getting tunneled or camped on hook isn't fun. Getting body blocked or having 4 people sabotage hooks constantly isn't fun. If you stream, even without \"TTV\" in your name, the killer can attempt to look you up and stream snipe you.  Survivors can't do this because they can't see the killers name until they die in the round .  If you play killer, you get body blocked or a SWF (surviving with friends) group that flashlight every pallet or run 4x unbreakable or DS (decisive strike).  I won't say one side is better than the other because i played both killer and surv.  Yes, there are perks to counteract killer perks.  When those things work right that is. \n  Let's be honest though, the game is horribly broken.  MMR is a joke, you can be on beginner rank  and go against a killer that is top tier red rank (highest you can get).  Instead of actually fixing it the developer continues to just push out content to rake in more money.  No real improvement to the existing content.  You can argue \"it's just a game\", that's true.  Games are supposed to be fun though.

lit trash. if you play survivor good luck because the devs just look out for killers. they can camp you. they can tunnel you. they can go for the weakest player and nothing for the killers, but as a survivor the obstacles are so much harder. i wouldn't recommend this game unless you are a killer main and you have no one to play with tbh. like it's fun when rank resets but the skill based matchmaking is horrible. you can be ash and go against a red rank. if they would make something where camping and tunneling wasn't a thing a would play more but it's honestly not that great. 5/10

107.8 hours recorded and ive already hit rank Iridescent III for killer can check screenshots for validation. So review will be center around killer gameplay.\n\nSo first out starting out. You do a pretty simple tutorial really don't teach you much more then basics rest you will have to learn as you go. If you want to play this game for fun tho im going to sadly let you know, people are very toxic. Survivors feel they always should win so as a killer if you breathe wrong your gonna have one being toxic to you.\n\nSo to avoid that ive made simple steps for you.\nStep 1 - Be ruthless.\nStep 2 - Show them their place\nStep 3 - Say gg and leave cause they probably gonna spam how you ruined their life for being better then them.\n\nNow lets talk about the rank climb experience and difficulty. Your going to run against suvivors who honestly will have better perks then you and even with 100 hours in i still go against suvivors who run the most meta perks. However again I have some simple steps to win your games.\n\nStep 1 - Destroy them\nStep 2 - show them why their best perks makes them look weak.\nStep 3 - feel no remorse and show no mercy.\n\nSee once you break their minds most suvivors will dc rage quit ect, Honestly tho real talk its a fun game but yeah expect to run against suvivors who run best perks and complain when you run even no perks. But if you can look past the noob rage well you can have fun. \n\nIts a great game for what it has, sadly the community is a toxic cess pool full of gate keepers which is funny every video I found is like you need 100's of hours or 1000's of hours to hit a rank i achieved in 100 hours :D so you can do it if you put in the practice and believe in yourself. \n\nAlso fyi if you want to main killer id highly recommend playing survivor as well cause both roles are fun and the best way to learn is play both roles. Survivors who never play killer stuck in ash and bronze. Killers who never play suvivors about at bronze level to. \n\nOh and one last thing have fun.
