好像注意到了克劳黛特的表情，德怀特没话找话“也不知道下一个屠夫是什么，到底逃走多少次才算完。我倒想看看这一切是谁——”\n\n“嘘！” 克劳黛特脸色有点不对“你不想活了？明知故问，是那个连名字都不能提的人！”\n\n德怀特无奈地撇了撇嘴“真的么，克劳德，我们已经逃这么多次了，你还是不敢直呼他的名字。 你就不能说出来么？Enti——”\n\n“闭嘴，当心下次他就给你安排了！”\n\n“Oh， entity， entity， entity！”\n\n“你怎么敢。。。。。。” 克劳黛特瞪大了眼睛。\n\n“亏你还是个植物学家，Entity只是个称呼罢了。”德怀特半认真半调侃。\n\n“可是我们见过它，一团没有形状的黑雾，时而出现，时而消失。 这一切你又怎么解释？”\n\n“ 如果他只是这个世界之外的一种存在呢？”\n\n短暂的沉默。篝火发出噼啪的相声，火光映在两个人的脸上。\n\n“什么意思？”\n\n德怀特挠了挠头，接着说“有没有一种可能， 我们眼前的世界并不是它的全部。 而在某个更高的维度，另一种人——或者entity，在监视着我们。”\n\n“说下去。” \n\n德怀特弯下腰，左右手捡起了两片树叶“ 我们就像在这片树叶上面，而每次从迷雾中醒来就像被从这片树叶放到这片上。”\n\n“而。。。。。。entity。。。。。。” 克劳黛特喃喃自语道“ entity 就是能打通两片叶子的人。这也能解释为什么每次出现都是没有形状的黑影。。。。。。可是这么多的叶子。。。。。。“\n\n一阵沉默。 \n\n火苗噼啪作响，尽力蹿升，又回到原来的高度，像是一次次无谓的抵抗。 在无边的黑夜的映衬下，这一点红色显得虚幻而渺小。孤独与疏离感弥漫开来，空气凝固了。\n\n“可即便是这样又能怎样呢。” 克劳黛特默默流下了眼泪。“我们迷失在这个鬼地方，每天都被追杀。谁知道我们明天会在哪？”\n\n又一阵沉默。\n\n德怀特仰头看着没有星星的天空说：“你知道吗，我一直坚信，只要我们不放弃，总有一天，我们能从迷雾里走出去，也许不是明天，但那一天一定会来。”\n\n“还记得我遇见你的那一天吗？”德怀特拍了拍克劳黛特的肩膀，接着说“那是我刚来到这里的第一天，我浑身发抖地躲在柜子里。当时柜子上已经落满乌鸦了，是你把医疗箱放在柜子边上，然后翻窗引开了屠夫。 从那时起，我就知道，你会成为我逃生的好伙伴。现在我们一起逃走这么多次了，总有一天，我们会彻底离开这个鬼地方。你放心，有我罩着你！”\n\n“其实。。。。。。”克劳黛特有点尴尬“ 那天我刚摸出来一个医疗箱，听到屠夫心跳，就想把刚摸出来的医疗箱藏起来，没想到被你拿走了。。。。。。”\n\n“呃。。。好吧。。。” 德怀特说“ 那，还有一次，你用地图标记大门让所有人成功逃走那回呢？屠夫都气炸了。”\n\n“那回我是想自己走地窖。。。” 克劳黛特笑着说。\n\n“呃。。。还有一次，你遛了好久屠夫，给大家争取了时间。”\n\n“那次我用手电晃了他， 狗日的一直追我，我也没办法，哈哈哈。”\n\n“好吧。。。至少你还算诚实。”\n\n“呐，我这么诚实，你还不把我的医疗箱还给我？”\n\n“那可不行，谁捡到就是谁的。”\n\n“那我用手电跟你换行吧？”\n\n“好吧，我只要双电池的紫手电。”\n\n“你耍臭无赖！”\n\n“嘿嘿，没错！”\n\n。。。。。。\n\nKid回过神，电脑右下角显示是3：53分，但窗外一片漆黑。\n\nKid从来没有仔细地观察过夜晚，尤其是这样没有星星的夜。黑暗从四面八方弥漫过来，这个房间好像是黑暗中温暖的避难所。 Kid再一次环视这个充满记忆的空间，又看了看窗外。\n\n“是时候了。” Kid自言自语道。\n\n他把烟熄了，穿上大衣，推开门，消失在黑暗里。\n\n房间里，48号桌上，烟头上红光挣扎着， 仿佛在说有一个人曾经来过，但最终离开了。\n\n黎明总要来的。 烟也总要灭。\n\n黎明光顾了冷风农场，克劳黛特和德怀特躲进了无边的玉米地，新的危险在等着他们，不过他们已经想好了对策。\n\n黎明将至，清冷的街道上出现了零零散散的早起的人。太阳要升起来了，新的一天要来了。。。。。。\n","timestamp_created":1605063752,"timestamp_updated":1605063752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79081673","author":{"steamid":"76561198179340082","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":18244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13369,"last_played":1631955288},"language":"tchinese","review":"玩鬼被溜破頭，玩人被一掛面守斬，真香","timestamp_created":1605063732,"timestamp_updated":1605063732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79081645","author":{"steamid":"76561198024810078","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1659485906},"language":"english","review":"great

The community isn't as great as it used to be unfortunately, which can effect gameplay, however all in all the game is amazing and well looked after even after almost 4 years. I would highly suggest purchasing this game to anyone I know .","timestamp_created":1605055792,"timestamp_updated":1605055792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79077262","author":{"steamid":"76561198994193892","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1363,"last_played":1658012461},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo bom com a comunidade menos toxica que eu já vi.\nS2\n","timestamp_created":1605055533,"timestamp_updated":1605055533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79077134","author":{"steamid":"76561199100264600","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1657242316},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS SOOOO  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","timestamp_created":1605055303,"timestamp_updated":1605055303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79077052","author":{"steamid":"76561198407497470","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":8900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8841,"last_played":1635166719},"language":"russian","review":"симулятор ждуна на режим за монстра\n\n10 куканов из 10","timestamp_created":1605055150,"timestamp_updated":1605055150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79077045","author":{"steamid":"76561198844015126","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":76722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1089,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1660539090},"language":"latam","review":"muy bueno la verdad !","timestamp_created":1605055135,"timestamp_updated":1605055135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79076973","author":{"steamid":"76561199066810387","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":57506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4845,"last_played":1658870477},"language":"spanish","review":"antes puse una buena reseña , el juego desde su ultima actualización tiene muchos bugs y hits falsos de los asesinos , tienen una comunidad toxica que si los reportas no les hacen nada y la verdad ya no es divertido y me tiene bastante cansado este juego que antes era genial y ahora es una verdadera mierda toxica y con bugs... un asco de juego los que vean esta reseña créanme no compren esta basura e inviertan su dinero en juegos que valgan la pena","timestamp_created":1605054999,"timestamp_updated":1617993893,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79076775","author":{"steamid":"76561198195217306","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1607813549},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom o jogo","timestamp_created":1605054615,"timestamp_updated":1605054615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79076753","author":{"steamid":"76561198328168045","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":45882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2267,"last_played":1646112502},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1605054585,"timestamp_updated":1605054585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79076727","author":{"steamid":"76561198374698482","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":8227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1657503947},"language":"english","review":"why do it keep saying my game files are modding?

Never have and never will be. I initially let the horror aspect of this game scare me off until my brother told me to give it a try, as it is just \"hide and seek with skill and mind games.\" That was back in september. Two months later I have 30 hours in the game and will have much more. The game is just very fun to play (minus the occasional toxic build) and will get you thinking about predicting movements from both the killer and survivor side. The asymmetrical gameplay keeps the game fresh by allowing players who are tired of playing killer swap over to survivor and have an entirely different objective.\nCombine that with the comical horror movie tropes of everything taking too long, the killer has an aura of terror and cheesy music when they approach that lets survivors know the approach long before the killer gets there, the killer moving faster than survivors, and the tasks being comically loud, and you have an amazingly fun game that struggles to have boring or tedious gameplay.","timestamp_created":1605042697,"timestamp_updated":1605042697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79069634","author":{"steamid":"76561199047118012","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":227,"playtime_at_review":13253,"last_played":1660283337},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego","timestamp_created":1605042461,"timestamp_updated":1605042461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79069619","author":{"steamid":"76561199099886737","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1641361961},"language":"english","review":"o think its a really good game and you can play it with friends\n","timestamp_created":1605042445,"timestamp_updated":1605042445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79069456","author":{"steamid":"76561198072324342","num_games_owned":735,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7969,"last_played":1656205513},"language":"brazilian","review":"--Para quem esse jogo foi desenvolvido?\n( ) Espermatozoides\n( ) Crianças\n( ) Tudo e todos\n( ) Adolescentes\n( ) Adultos\n(X) Pessoas que conhecem a morte\n\n--Texturas, Gráficos, Lindeza?\n( ) Parece com os gráficos dos jogos do Atari\n( ) 220 x 120p\n( ) Meia boca, tem piores\n(X) Dentro da média atual\n( ) Quase um The Witcher 3\n( ) The witcher 3\n( ) Isso veio de outra dimensão\n\n--Falhas\n( ) Isso é uma falha\n( ) Bug pra todo lado\n(X) Muita falha mas dá pra jogar\n( ) Bugs que são legais e não atrapalham\n( ) Sem falhas\n( ) Esse jogo saiu perfeito do forno\n\n--É difícil?\n( ) Basta assisitr o jogo\n( ) Zera com uma com um controle de atari\n( ) Pega logo as manha, mas sempre normal\n(X) Bem desafiador, as vezes difícil\n( )Parece Darksiders\n( ) Parece Dark Souls\n( ) Equiparável a Dark Souls\n( ) É Dark souls\n\n--Quanto tempo pra acabar\n( ) Você acaba antes de sair do menu\n( ) Tempo necessário pra cantar stairway to heaven\n( ) Tempo de jogo dos jogos exclusivos da Sony\n( ) Muito tempo, no minimo umas 40 horas\n(X) praticamente um MMORPG\n( ) É um MMORPG sá sopoha\n\n--Tem uma história?\n( ) Quase um Pubg da vida\n( ) tem história só pra não dizer que não tem\n(X) Dá pra gostar da história, se esforçando\n( ) Consegue te arrancar uma lágrima ou duas\n( ) Nível The Last Of Us\n( ) Dava pra fazer um livro nível Harry Potter\n( ) Deveria constar no currículo do Ensino médio\n\n--Áudio, músicas\n( ) Nível do Funk Brasileiro\n( ) Jogue mutado se não fica surdo\n( ) Dá pra escutar\n(X) Legalzinho\n( ) Os caras capricharam no áudio\n( ) Baixe a play list pra escutar no ônibus\n( ) Toque o tema no seu casamento\n\n--Trambolho necessário pra rodar\n( ) Nokia 1995\n( ) Um PC com uma placa de vídeo do tempo da avó\n(X) Um PC meia boca, com uma gt 1050\n( ) Um PC já considerado gamer\n( ) Invista no minimo 4k em hardware\n( ) SLI de 1080ti\n( ) Esqueça, a tecnologia atual não dá conta\n\n--Vale a pena o investimento?\n( )Pedi até refound\n( )Ainda bem que foi presente\n( ) Ganhei em um bundle, mas pagaria até 20 mangos\n( )Melhor ter comprado um pastel\n(X)Se pagou, ta valendo\n( )Pagaria o dobro\n( )Vale mais que o resto dos meus jogos juntos","timestamp_created":1605042188,"timestamp_updated":1605042188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79069350","author":{"steamid":"76561199071492086","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":211,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1660555483},"language":"english","review":"I have played this game on a little bit of pc but more on xbox.
