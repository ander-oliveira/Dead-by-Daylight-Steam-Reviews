things first, this is not a horror game. Yes, it is definitely supposed to look like one, but for me, that's where it ends as well. That's not to say it isn't nerve wrecking. And not just because of the gameplay either.\n\nAs you probably know, in this game you play as either a survivor, trying to escape together with three other people, from a horrific killer who is on the loose somewhere near you. The main twist here is of course that you can also play as the killer yourself, hunting down the survivors.\n\nWhat you might not know, is that in this game you are also trying to level up with points and speding those in procedurally generated skill trees. from these skill trees, you gather both items and special abilities for you to use during the main game. What's so fun about this is that you can mix and match any perk with any other perk in the game. This allows you to create custom loadouts for your survivors and discover all sorts of interesting and synergising combinations, especially on the killers side...\n\nWhat to me is the most interesting and exciting feature are the killer powers.\nThere are multiple special and unique killers in the game to choose from. What makes them so special is that each one has a unique power that only they can use. For example, there is the Trapper who comes with a few dozen bear traps for the survivors to step in.

If playing  survivor, highly suggested to play with friends for a more relaxing experience.\n\nThere's A bunch of factors to be taken into account about Dead by Daylight:\n\nAttitude/Mindset: If you are new, you are going to most likely die, A lot, if you are killer, you might make a few mistakes, and might not be able to kill all four survivors, but this is A part of the game; trial and error.If you choose to be survivor, you have to learn how chasing/looping works, you have to learn how the map layout works so you don't end up getting downed too fast (but even the most experienced person in this game can still make mistakes it's fine) you have to learn totem placements, you have to learn how perks work, how items work, how to heal others or save them, you have to learn when its possible to rescue, when it IS NOT. Sometimes, rescue won't be possible, and sacrifices have to be made, and you have to stay focused or you might just end up dying in the end, but of coarse, others won't always be thinking the same way, so do not always expect others to think the same. Sometimes, killers can be A nuisance by going after the same survivor all game or camping them to prevent them from being rescued. The developers call it a tactic ( load of BS) and this might happen to you, but don't let these type of people ruin it, keep positive and make smart choices, who knows, you might get lucky and the killer will show you mercy by letting you escape cause somebody in your game just did not want to stick around anymore. Killer is rather similar, and people complain about save with friends (SWF) being a problem since you can voice communicate with friends through say discord, which really, makes the game easier for survivors but honestly, if you learn over time how to be killer, and learn how loops work, you'll have a much better chance at going against SWF groups.\n\nFairness: Boy, this is a tough one. there's A lot of mix opinions on things, Hexes, nerfs, buffs, the killers kits, SWF, gen rushing, camping, tunneling (chasing one survivor all game and no one else.) Ideally, some of these are understandable, but others can be down right annoying. especially the type of killer you play against (I personally don't like A spirit who just vapes everywhere with stridor, but S*&t happens)  Hex Noed or No One Escapes Death, is most likely one of the big ones, IMO it isn't really a big deal, since during this time, once the gates are powered, you have to act fast to prevent something like this from happening, getting the gates ready by then is a good start, and also destroying totems around the map during the game can helps prevent Noed sooner. like i said, being positive along with knowledge over time through trial and error will make you a better Killer or Survivor. There's maybe a few killers in this game that are A bit abusive, but \"most\" of them you can survive against with practice.\n\nMatchmaking: Matchmaking has not been pretty for a long time. there are cases everyday where there are level 20 (lowest rank possible, with 1 being highest) survivors going against rank 3 and below. at this point, this is how the game is now, (or until they introduce something like over watch's system) they mentioned that they are doing a system where it pairs you with people of similar skill via lost/won games, but that just seems a bit problematic since you have to take into account other survivors as well, since you could have three other survivors throw the game instantly, and that penalizes you for said \"skill\" in some of these cases though, its more just intimidation rather than skill, since till this day there are red rank survivors playing like they are new to the game. some say rank does not matter, some say it does, personally to me it does if i'm playing solo, since It's a higher chance to be paired with people closer to rank 1-3 who \"at least\" know what they are doing... sometimes, but if i'm with friends, it does not matter, its just all about getting out alive all together, or even just giving myself up for them. the killer is the Host of the game, so the game runs through their connection, latency isn't much of an issue, but as of recent with the cross play feature, some of the games have been rather... spiky\n\nMusic: Games got nice chase music that feels the horror movie chase mood. The developers are starting to give the older killers their own theme which is nice, i personally like Demogorgon, Billy, and Deathslinger's theme, as well as nowhere to hide, and closing in.\n\nGraphics: game looks astonishingly good, but i personally play on lowest settings since it helps increase the brightness A bit so i can actually see whats going on around the map.\n\nBugs/Glitches/Exploits: Games full of them every now and then, there was A recent one (still think it's in game) where standing on a specific spot on the map caused you to be stuck as a survivor, rendering you useless until killer picks you up. There's been more wild ones in the past, but they really aren't that much of an issue once you become aware of it.\n\nGameplay: As a survivor, the goal is to turn on 5 generators scattered around the map and escape, as a killer, its your job to prevent it. Survivors have items they can bring in, or find in chests scattered around the map to aid them in their survival, while killers, bring add ons that alter their power to help make them stronger during the game. Playing as a survivor is fun, but there's a bunch of things that happens mostly during the game that can be rather stressful, like getting hit through a pallet once its already down (I have literally gotten hit through a pallet 3 times in 1 day at some point, and i mean pallet is literally down, passed the animation and sound effect) or getting hit through a vault when you are already on the other side and are about to take off, but you get hit regardless. killer and survivors have different moveboxes(?) which is important to know when chasing, (basically meaning survivors can \"glide\" along walls or corners when running during a chase, where killer it takes a bit more time to complete the turn) but don't let all of this intimidate you, Killers And survivors sometimes have a sense of humor mid match which can make the game interesting. (you'll see it for yourself over time, or watch a few videos on other people playing for a general idea)\n\nCommunity: I'm not in the DBD community on the main site or the reddit, but every now and then I see people being toxic or complaining about some things, and some of them they do have a point, but just ignore them. As one of the best ways to ruin a newcomers experience is through bad opinions right. some people who play survivor or killer will have big Egos and will try to make you think otherwise, or killers will be salty and try to give you a hard time, but just ignore them and move on to the next game in all honesty. and its played by the players and the community, but don't let that be what keeps you from playing. \n\nAll in all, do I recommend this game? if you are willing to learn, take your time, and can stay confident and positive throughout the entire learning experience, then yes give it a try it will most likely be rough in the beginning, but when you do learn, the chases are by far, one of the best euphoric feelings this games got to offer, or even being a killer and sparing survivors or showing A sense of humor can be quite rewarding in some cases as well, (im looking at you billy/bubba chasing me all game and nobody else with A chainsaw) make some friends, and play SWF and have fun surviving together, or screwing each other over on purpose.","timestamp_created":1598179237,"timestamp_updated":1598179329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74774455","author":{"steamid":"76561199042071515","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":43113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1654877688},"language":"russian","review":"Как

El sistema de recompensas esta bien y se va ajustando la dificultad a medida que subes de rango. está un poco desbalanceado pero se entiende, se nota que es díficil de balancear. Los mayores problemas que tiene este juego son los siguientes:\n1. Gen rush. Jugar como killer es un poco frustante en muchas ocasiones, he visto supervivientes hacer motores los 5 motores en 4 minutos, es increible lo poco que puede durar la partida y lo... carente de sentido que vuelve el juego. Por esta razón entiendo que los Killers usen NOED, no me parece una mala praxis, al fin al cabo es una habilidad del juego y se puede impedir rompiendo totems (hay 5 por partida). \n2. asesinos que tunelean y campean. está bien ser tryhard, querer matar a todos, jugar para matar a los survivors, lo entiendo, pero quedarse enfrente de un gancho viendo como alguien se muere por toda la partida o... ignorar a todos los supervivientes sin importar que tengan intención de tankear un golpe o proteger a su amigo desde el principio de la partida solo para matar a alguien rápido arruina tanto la experiencia de juego como el gen rush. No obstante, el comportamiento de tuneling o camping lo puedo llegar a entender en otros momentos de la partida como en el END GAME, o como cuando los supervivientes no se quieren ir de la zona donde esta la persona colgada, es decir, la idea es que el Killer en cierta parte de deje distraer o se ocupe colgando a otro superviviente y hacer intercambio de rehenes. \nPese a esto el juego es muy divertido, con amigos gana mucha mas diversión. \n\n\nPor ultimo quiero mencionar  que hace poco metieron en el matchmaking el multiplataformas, les advierto desde ya a los jugadores de PC, que las personas que juegan en consola son otro mundo, SON MALISIMOS. refieriendome exclusivamente a los supervivientes, \nSON MUY INDIVIDUALISTAS, te abandonaran muchas veces.\nHarán que el Killer te pegue de gratis haciéndote BODYBLOCK. \nTe rescatarán del gancho enfrente del Killer cuando este no está campeando, es decir, recién te cuelgan, haciendo que te vuelvan a tumbar o que los tumben a ellos, complicando inescesariamente la partida y muchas veces provocando la muerte de todos.\nDejan que entres en forcejeo o pugna o struggle recién iniciada la partida, me la he pasado 2 minutos desde el gancho viendo como NO REPARAN, NO ME RESCATAN, NO HACEN NADA, solo se esconden del Killer y caminan agachados cuando ni siquiera escuchan el radio de terror. \nAnécdota: en una partida 2 console players se metieron al sótano con el Killer a rescatar al que recién habían  colgado en la cara del KILLER, la partida iba bien, llevábamos 3 motores, el killer estaba colgando survivors. todo era idílico hasta que cometieron reverenda cagada. resultado de la partida, 3 personas colgadas en el sotano y el Killer (Michael Myers) con mal interior al 3 buscándome por todo el mapa.\nSé que son muchas cosas malas, pero creo que cuando te presentan algo siempre te deben decir lo malo que tiene. para que valores si vale la pena. y lo bueno lo vayas descubriendo tu mismo. \npor mi parte lo súper recomiendo, y lo seguiré jugando.","timestamp_created":1598172460,"timestamp_updated":1598172460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74770208","author":{"steamid":"76561198880611956","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":56135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":2063,"last_played":1660551112},"language":"english","review":"Gotta love the toxic survivors and Killers :)\n\n\nFun game, bugs here and there but overall enjoyable.
