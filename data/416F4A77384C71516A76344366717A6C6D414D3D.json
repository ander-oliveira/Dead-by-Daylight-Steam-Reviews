There are genuinely good times. You can remember them. They were great fun. But as time continues to tick on, you realize how unhappy playing this game makes not only you, but everyone else around you. It's some sort of weird purgatory where people knowingly hate the game, yet still play it. As if they can't shake DBD out of their system or something. These are people firmly in the loop that DBD provides. It gives you just enough to keep you in, but you're firmly aware of how much you hate it the entire time. Will that stop you? Probably not. Welcome to the abuse. \n\nReconsider your time before playing this, I promise you there's better expenditures of your time.\" [/i]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/SimplyWill/recommended/381210/] → Rezension dieses Autors anzeigen ← [/url] (lasst es euch gerne übersetzen).\n\n[b] Allgemeine Bewertung [/b]\n\nIch möchte nicht auf die ganzen Bugs eingehen - diese waren manchmal zwar echt lustig, während sie das andere Mal einem den Spaß genommen haben. Das ist ein Thema für sich. In den letzten Jahren hat sich Dbd echt verändert. Jeder Spieler kann sich für einen, oder auch mit mehreren Überlebenden identifizieren, dank den großartig geschriebenen Hintergrundgeschichten. Auch möchte ich ein großes Lob an die unterschiedlichen und vor allem detailreich und schön aufgebauten Welten aussprechen. Trotz der hohen Anzahl an Perks, ist jeder Perk anders, und eignet sich je nach Erfahrung mehr oder weniger für einen. Auch wenn jeder Killer seine \"eigene\" Fähigkeit hat, sind diese vergleichsweise sehr ähnlich. \n\nHier Beispiele:\n - Der Oni / Hillbilly / Blight: Haben alle in etwa die gleiche Fähigkeit mit dem schnellen Sprint, mit kleinen Unterschieden in der Technik. \n- Micheal Myers / Ghostface: Haben in etwa die selbe Mechanik und unterscheiden sich nicht wirklich stark.\n\nAuch ist es schade, dass Dbd immer dem gleichen Spielprinzip folgt. M1 gedrückt zu halten, und ab und zu Space zu drücken ist mit der Zeit sehr langweilig. Auch hier könnte man unterschiedliche Generatoren in das Spiel mit einbauen, welche bspw. unterschiedliche Skillchecks auslösen oder anderweitig einen Effekt haben. Oder mal einen neuen Spielmodus, sei es einfach nur ohne Perks, oder irgendwas. Das wäre an sich nicht mal wirklich viel, damit es zumindest etwas (!) spaßiger und abwechslungsreicher wirkt.\n\n[b] Mein Ingame - Ban, und warum alles verkorkst ist [/b]\n\nMeinen Ingame-Perma-Ban (nicht VAC) bekam ich, weil ich den Killer auf einen toxischen Spieler lotste, da dieser mich vorher in einer Jagd immer wieder den Weg versperrt hat (sandbagging). Schlussendlich starb er am Haken, genauso wie ich nachher. Und da er die Devs offenbar kannte, wie er mir im Endgame-Chat drohte, bekam ich auch Tage später den Ingame-Ban. Ob der Ingame-Ban nun richtig oder falsch war, kann ich, und werde ich meinerseits aus nicht bewerten. Jedoch alleine der Fakt, dass man eine offenbar \"persönliche Beziehung\" (also mit den Devs/Moderatoren befreundet zu sein) ausnutzt, NUR damit man eine fremde Person, welche einen berechtigterweise auch \"genervt\" hat während der Runde, sogar GANZ aus dem Spiel ausschließen kann mittels Perma-Ban, ist meiner Meinung nach absolut verantwortungslos (!), unfassbar traurig und meiner Meinung nach in jeder Hinsicht fragwürdig! Auch dass der Support einem über den Ban garantiert keine (!) genaueren Informationen geben kann, und nicht einmal gewillt ist, einem überhaupt zu antworten, beweist mir, dass das Spiel samt der sonst schon extrem-toxischen Community-Erfahrung, einfach nicht mehr wert ist, dafür Zeit zu investieren. Zu wissen, dass es viele Spieler gibt, welche Ähnliches wie ich erlebt haben, lässt mich dennoch hoffen, dass die Personen hinter dem Dbd-Support endlich humaner werden, was fälschlicherweise gebannte Personen angeht. \n\nNatürlich gibt es auch \"richtige\" Hacker, oder Spieler, die vielfach gegen die Regeln verstoßen haben. Dennoch gibt es die andere Seite, mit den Spielern, welche fälschlicherweise gebannt wurden. Da diese Zahl rein theoretisch aber so gering ist und von den Devs/Moderatoren offenbar kaum wahrgenommen wird, machen sich diese logischerweise auch keine Mühe, sich in den zu Unrecht gebannten Spieler einfühlen zu können, ihm zeitnah zu antworten, und das Problem oder eine Frage des Spielers ernst nehmen zu können. Wieso auch? Die Moderatoren gehen ja davon aus, dass man wirklich (!) gehackt hat / vielfach gegen die Spielregeln verstoßen hat! Die denken sich dann: \"Wieso sollten wir Zeit und Mühe in Spieler investieren, welche gehackt haben, oder vielfach gegen die Spielregeln verstoßen haben?\"\n\nDen Spielern, welche fälschlicherweise (!) gebannt wurden, wie ich und einige andere hier, keine oder nur unzureichende Informationen über seinen Ban zu geben, ist in Traurig- sowie Lächerlichkeit kaum zu überbieten. Der \"Dbd-Support\" ist in der Hinsicht von genau solchen \"Fällen\", von einer Unmenschlichkeit, sowie einer fast schon apathischen Gleichgültigkeit geprägt, wie ich es nie erwartet hätte bei einem Spiel wie Dbd. Man ist kein Mensch mehr, welcher vielleicht auch gewisse Emotionen mit dem Spiel verbunden hat, und Zeit in das Spiel investiert hat. Nein, man ist für die Moderatoren nur noch eine willkürliche Zahl, und weiter leider nichts. Es sagt einfach so viel über die ganzen Moderatoren, oder generell über das (offenbar nicht) \"qualifizierte Fachpersonal\" aus. Hier verlinke ich jemanden, der eine ähnliche, wenn nicht sogar fast schon die gleiche Erfahrung machen musste, wie ich (leider nur auf Englisch, lasst es euch gerne übersetzen): \n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061789865/recommended/381210/] → hier klicken ← [/url]\n\n[b] Mein persönliches Fazit [/b]\n\nAbschließend kann ich nur sagen: Wer sich Dead by Daylight kaufen möchte, soll das. Ich kann nicht für alle sprechen, einige lieben das Spiel so eintönig wie es halt eben ist. Ich schrieb diese Rezension, um den Spielern hier aufzuzeigen, dass eine Heuchlerei, Bevorzugung von Spielern und Verantwortungslosigkeit hier von den Devs/Moderatoren ausgelebt wird, wie ich es nie erwartet hätte. Momentan habe ich wieder angefangen zu spielen, und halte auch meinen Guide aktuell. Trotzdem werde ich mich klar von der Toxizität des Spiels distanzieren, so gut dies auch immer möglich ist.\n\nDie negativen Erfahrungen, welche mir Dbd mit auf den Weg von mittlerweile fast 6'000 Spielstunden gegeben hat, also...\n\n... Tunneling\n... Sandbagging\n... Der \"Dbd-Support\" \n... Diskriminierung, Beleidigungen, Drohungen\n... und schlussendlich auch der ausschlaggebende Fakt, dass wenn man mit den Moderatoren/Devs \"befreundet\" ist, einfach nach Lust und Laune die Leute bannen kann, welche nie wirklich/sehr selten negativ aufgefallen sind\n\n... gaben mir schlussendlich die Sicherheit und auch das Bewusstsein, Dbd hier auf Steam negativ zu bewerten und somit auch anderen NICHT weiterzuempfehlen.\n\nDie negativen Erfahrungen sind leider einfach stärker spürbar, als die positiven. Trotzdem kann ich mich auch an lustige Momente erinnern, welche mir in positiver Erinnerung bleiben werden. Zockt andere Spiele, oder unternimmt was mit Freunden, Dead by Daylight ist nicht euer Leben.","timestamp_created":1641175575,"timestamp_updated":1656511112,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":100,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.784276247024536133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107187057","author":{"steamid":"76561198314389785","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5641,"last_played":1641944201},"language":"brazilian","review":"AMEI","timestamp_created":1641175024,"timestamp_updated":1641175024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107187044","author":{"steamid":"76561198863516233","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15478,"last_played":1628865225},"language":"english","review":"Don't

As in if you make a very small miscalculation or have bad judgement on one small decision in the first 20 seconds of the game, it might cost you the entire round.\n\nYes, I am somewhat bitter about this game.  I used to have a lot of fun with it and in the past 6 months the multiplayer has gone downhill.  There would be a very very very simple way to fix multiplayer.  Create an unranked / casual matchmaking along side the ranked / try-hard matchmaking.  Sometimes I do want to try hard. But if you ever want to play as killer, you need to try extremely hard every second.  I don't recommend until they fix matchmaking.

Hide and seek formula is fine, but it has been around for centuries, so there is no deed in using it. Pretty fun to play with friends once a year for couple of hours. Nothing more.\n5/10\n\nPersonal opinion:\nThe game idea is totally incredible: to let players experience themselves as a characters of some horror movie they have watched, hiding under the blanket, or laughing though the entire film. The game has two modes, playing as a survivor and as a killer where you can play as one of the described types of characters. \nThe game actually resembles hide-and-seek, the game that everybody played in the childhood, but now in a little bit more harsh conditions. As a survivor you quietly crouch, frantically look around and wait for the heartbeat sound to start, which means that the killer is near and its time to run or hide. You can interact with your teammates, help them, taking attention from the killer and whatever else you can imagine to escape or die in the match. From the killer’s perspective you are to feed something called Entity with the survivors and do not let them escape. Each type of gameplay is pretty much unique and it shows the principle of hunter and prey where the hunter is to kill the players and thus needs not only to know the mechanics, but to feel the others, and vice versa the other players to fool the killer need to understand and predict what will he or she do. This provides a fascinating and somewhat frightening experience to try yourself in both roles. But these feelings last for a couple of matches, no more.\nThe main objective of the survivor is to escape the map. To do that you need to open the gates, that are controlled by the electronic switch, but there is no electricity. So you need to run 5 generators to power the gate, but first you need to repair them, as they are broken. SO, you have 5 generators to repair, which takes some time and sometimes it provides you with the QTE mechanics that checks your reaction and you need to press a space, or whatever button is configured, in time to continue repairing the generator. The thing is that miss press makes it explode, which doesn’t have an effect on generator, but it shows the killer your location. This makes you a bit nervous every time you repair the generator, knowing that any time you would need to press the space, and at the same time you have to observe the horizon for the incoming threat. Of course you can get a perk that it would not explode on failure, or you would know in advance when the killer goes to you, or a lot of other helpful skills, but it’s another story.\nThere are some problems with it of course. The game is pretty much based on team interaction and communication, there is no chat to talk in the match, and it is really good to play with friends. Playing alone is quickly gets boring and even though I know that there are other people around, I don’t feel their presence as I cannot tell them anything or ask for help. The killers are really strong, the only way to deal with them sometimes is a cooperation, but there is none, accept for a third party software like Discord or whatever. This makes dealing with tough enemy even more tough and unfair.\nSecondly, even though, there are several survivors that you can choose and more to buy, you have different perks on each of them, but the gameplay is pretty much the same. You have the same interaction, controls, playstyle, the objective and the way to achieve your goal. There is basically no real reason to buy and play any other character that you are playing, accept for the difference in look.\nConcerning the killers, there are even more of them that survivors in the base game and in the store. They are already pretty strong, but after some games you get used to the standard killers and the goal seems not that impossible, but from time to time you are being opposed by something strange that you have never seen before and it just annihilates the whole team. Not only you couldn’t have done anything, but you do not have a slightest idea of how to deal with it. And this all happened because of the large quantity of premium killers. They all have a unique playstyle and different active skills: some teleport, other, throw weapons, get invisible, enrage themselves, etc. Moreover the ones to buy have much stronger abilities and are much more tough to cope with, because of the reason described earlier: you have never seen it and probably won’t next 30 games. This only emphasises the need of communication between players.\nPersonally, I had a problem that I had 4-5 friends to play with simultaneously. I simply could not play as a 5 because there is no possibility to enter matchmaking with a full team, only the custom match. Ok, can get used to that. But if we are 3 or 4, or even 2 and someone want to have a little change and play as a killer? You just cannot. Either you play both as survivors, or you play separately. Pretty embarrassing.\nFinally I would like to mention the problem with the updates, that at least 3 of my friends had and there are a lot of forums regarding the issue: there is a major problem with downloading the updates and the game itself. The game that is twice as big gets downloaded through steam 5 times quicker. Even the update of 200 MB takes forever to get. The same was in Epic games, so I suppose it is a problem on a server side.\n\n","timestamp_created":1641167048,"timestamp_updated":1641167048,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107179577","author":{"steamid":"76561198381368613","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":50,"playtime_at_review":25082,"last_played":1660337156},"language":"spanish","review":"es divertido loopear killers","timestamp_created":1641166826,"timestamp_updated":1641166826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107179320","author":{"steamid":"76561198257885490","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":635,"playtime_at_review":4054,"last_played":1660482791},"language":"english","review":"Don't, just don't.
