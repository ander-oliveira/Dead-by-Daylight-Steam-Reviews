Je retiens peu ou prou 400 heures de bons moments, à jouer avec des collègues ou des adversaires [i]chill[/i] et fair play. Le reste n'a été qu'abus, bugs, toxicité à outrance, montagnes de sel, fric gâché dans des DLC inutiles, et insultes. Ce jeu m'a rendu accro, et prisonnier d'une relation abusive que j'ai mis un moment à quitter.\n\nJ'ai commencé à jouer fin 2017, et j'ai pu voir Dead by Daylight proprement massacré par des développeurs cupides, plus prompts à enchaîner les tueurs et perks randoms pour faire rentrer un billet qu'à corriger les problèmes de leur jeu. Infichus d'équilibrer correctement leur jeu (en même temps, les 3/4 de la team de développementsont [i]hard stuck[/i] rang 15 depuis 5 ans), incapables d'écouter la communauté sur des points essentiels, ni de corriger des bugs importants qui sont restés présents pendant très longtemps - et le sont encore pour certains. Des décisions incompréhensibles pour attirer des joueurs tout frais et rendre le jeu plus accessibles, au détriment d'un camp comme de l'autre : le nerf de Ruine, par exemple. Sans parler de l'attitude franchement limite d'ajouter à un DLC payant une perk complètement  OP (Mettle Of Man), attendre que les sous rentrent, pour finalement la nerfer une fois les poissons dans le filet. A l'image des développeurs, à l'image de Mathieu Coté, de son accent anglais hésitant, de son goitre de trésorier d'une boîte qui est passée de petit studio indépendant à grosse machine de guerre - qui n'a, d'ailleurs, sorti qu'un seul jeu commercialement viable.\n\nLa seule chose qui profite à DbD, c'est d'être le seul de sa niche, et de s'être accaparé le trône. Malgré tous ses problèmes, c'est le seul soft qui aligne tueurs de licences et ce genre de gameplay asymétrique, raison pour laquelle il est très fréquenté, et par des joueurs qui alignent les milliers d'heure - la plupart tiennent d'ailleurs le même discours que moi : quel gâchis. L'observateur objectif ne pourra que constater la brochette de problèmes que le jeu continue d'enfiler, au fil des patches.\n\nOui, le gameplay est simple et accrocheur. Oui, jouer avec Myers ou encore Krueger, c'est franchement chouette. Oui, il y a un véritable [i]challenge[/i] à jouer tueur - survivant est un peu plus tranquille, mais pas moins intéressant. Mais ça ne suffit pas à faire oublier l'équilibrage à la ramasse : rang élevé et vous tombez contre un SWF (une team) ? Vous avez perdu si vous n'êtes pas surpuissant. Vous êtes survivant et le tueur, probablement salé, vous campe ? Vous avez probablement perdu, amusez vous bien à ne pas jouer pendant deux minutes. Ajoutez à ça la communauté la plus toxique et méprisable que j'ai pu rencontrer en seize ans de jeu en ligne sur Steam (et j'ai poncé Counter Strike), des développeurs à qui on filerait bien d'énormes baffes, et vous obtenez Dead By Daylight. En fait, l'équation est simple. Sur une heure de jeu, vous passerez 45 minutes atroces face aux pires déchets humains, pour 15 minutes de gameplay plaisant - ces quinze mêmes minutes qui vous feront, inlassablement, revenir au jeu.\n\nA vous de voir, si le risque de perdre quelques centaines, voir millier d'heures, est une perspective qui vous enchante... Perso, j'aurais mieux fait de mettre ce temps à contribution pour apprendre une troisième langue ou à jouer d'un autre instrument de musique. La chose aurait été plus utile et surtout n'aurait pas raccourci mon espérance de vie de quelques années à cause d'un excès de sel.","timestamp_created":1511964582,"timestamp_updated":1610264951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540816307067871094","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37928914","author":{"steamid":"76561198250941980","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":33238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14097,"last_played":1657319061},"language":"german","review":"Wo soll ich anfangen?

Fun game, buy it if you're into the idea of the game. You will become aggitated but you won't be dissapointed.\n\nOne of the funnest games I've played in years. Yes, you'll have to deal with some stupid people. Yes, the game has some glitches, bugs, and eploitable situations but if you can get past that and you love killing/surviving, you'll love this game. Personally, unless I'm playing with friends, I'm always the killer. Something about the chase and hook that just gets my endorphins flowing. The kill is nice and all but its not what gets me going. Hell, I've dropped people off at the exits rather than kill them just for shits and giggles.\nSpeaking of which, sometimes you'll get survivors just chilling at the exit, don't kill them. Yes, they are there for you to earn some points but don't be a dick and drop then hook them. Unless there's 2, then hook the one and let the other unhook them. Seriously, if they're willing to give you free points, don't be an ass and kill them. If they had you, accept it and get yourself some points. Trust me, most won't stick around for such shenanigans.\nThere is a lot of fun to be had at this game. If you don't like playing one side, don't play it. Nothing worse than someone who hates being a survivor or killer (that's why I'm rarely a survivor, don't much care for that side). However, if you start to get bored, play the other side for a match or 2. It's usually a good reminder of why you're always the other side. Works for me, anyways.\nOne of the last things I'll add is the killer is overpowered. Honestly, he/she really is. There is a reason for that, though. Survivors are not meant to survive on the own, (some survivors are exceptions but even they benefit from being with a group) you need to work together. A good team of survivors will make a killers life hell. Some of my favorite matches have been with survivors that work together. I usually lose those matches but they are also the ones I learn the most from. Its amazing how a good group of survivors can use all the benefits a killer has against him/her. You'll either love it or hate it but you have to appreciate it. As a killer, read some of the tutorials put out by survivors, they can be very useful. I found the one about juking to be eye opening, literally and figuretively. Learn their tricks and how to spot them, it'll make you a better killer. Probably piss off a few survivors too.\nSo, if you have a few bucks to throw on a game, get this one. Just watch out for people who accuse you of cheating just because you're streaming.

I loved it but after almost 100 hours I thought I'd seen it all. Then all the updates, killers, survivers, maps, etc. came out. Coming back I have had so much fun, either from reliving the game again and relearning, to new experiences with all the additions and play styles. The Devs have a ton on their plate so I can expect things to have problems, but from how it used to be compared to now, it's improved a LOT, both for survivors and killers alike, so I have faith that if there are genuine problems, it'll be resolved in due time. Dead by Daylight is a fantastic game for anyone with a decent internet connection (maybe even a sub-par one like myself) and a drive to experience joy, anger, hope, despair, and several other emotions just on there own.

Dead By Daylight talk time.\n\nYes, I personally love this game. Keep in mind, this isn't for everyone. That's why you're greeted by two different styles of gameplay, whether you play as the hopeless survivors or the mencacing killer, it all depends on personal taste.\n(Yes, I'm a survivor main. And I ain't hopeless.)\n\nAnyways, lets move on to the review.\n\nPros:\nStunning graphics, believe it or not (max res)\nFast-paced AND slow-paced gameplay, there are a multitude of situations that could happen in the game.\nCan sometimes actually be frightening\nVery cheap but good DLC\nFunny glitches ;)\n\nCons:\nGlitches and bugs (players like to abuse them)\nCamping killers (hooks)\nSurvivors can't injure or kill the killer (irony strike: this would actually be a cool idea lol)\nMatchmaking can sometimes be... really bad.\nTrollers\nPlayers dont take the game seriously sometimes.\nRank 15s are matched with rank 20s against a rank 2 killer (this happened an hour before this review).\n\nSo... the question to answer is, is it good? Is it worth 20-30 dollars?\nYes, it is a good game.\nYes, it is worth the money.\nYes, it can be angering, but it's still worth it.\n\nThe fast paced gameplay when getting chased by a killer can actually be invigorating sometimes, believe it or not. Especially when you lose the killer. There's just that feeling of gratitude knowing that you could have possibly survived for literally another five minutes, or knowing that that escape bought your team enough time to finish generators and open the doors to escape the hell you were put through for about twenty minutes.\n\nThis game is fantastic sometimes, others, it's... not. At all.\n\nThe game isn't fun at all when you see a killer staring into the survivors eyes as he/she remained hooked for the next 2.5 minutes, and the survivors can do nothing to help them cus the killer would literally just redown them. This is where the killing and injuring of the killer would come in handy ;).\n\nBut anyways, when that doesn't happen and you're playing against a killer with actual skill, yes it is a great game and you will feel energy.\n\nFrom a killer's perspective, you just gotta hope you're good. It's a type of game where you can easily get good at pretty much every killer if you put enough time and bloodpoints into the web, but if you don't do that, you're not going to be a good killer and you're usually going to average mostly petty victories every time (1 sacrificed survivor). You need to learn the ropes of every map available and the environment to see which angles and strike areas are best for you to maneuver, as you do pretty much everything slower than a survivor: going through windows, dealing with palets, disrupting gens takes away precious time of murdering them, hell even hooking a survivor causes precious time to be lost, as it can be used by the survivors for anything: finding items, repearing generators, destroying hooks, destroying traps, opening doors, etc. etc.\n\nThe game is impossible to become boring, is what im saying, as there are many applications that need tending too, much more than 1 killer or 4 survivors can handle without feeling stressed at some point during the game.\n\nIt's a very good game. 8/10, definitely can be improved like any other game (Except a Hat in Time cus that games already perfect <3).","timestamp_created":1511925948,"timestamp_updated":1511925948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528795838356018066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37918017","author":{"steamid":"76561198208359792","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":157581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131870,"last_played":1651720524},"language":"schinese","review":"YYDS♥","timestamp_created":1511925271,"timestamp_updated":1621303738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37917930","author":{"steamid":"76561198110400020","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28351,"last_played":1639736961},"language":"schinese","review":"太难玩了 玩了四百多个小时一直在8到2段来回 （只玩人）更新之后算分机制变了更加难玩了 菜鸡人皇梦破碎 已经不知道怎么玩 一万四一万五加成功逃跑都不加豆  人皇是不可能人皇的了 一段是不可能一段的了 实在是太菜了  游戏是个好游戏  我要弃游了朋友们  爱你们 加油！！！","timestamp_created":1511924941,"timestamp_updated":1523852023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37917569","author":{"steamid":"76561198362397753","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7815,"last_played":1599560448},"language":"schinese","review":"创意好，但上手慢。","timestamp_created":1511923466,"timestamp_updated":1511923466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37917429","author":{"steamid":"76561198072957742","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":14710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5120,"last_played":1658620859},"language":"french","review":"toujours aussi marrant ^^ avec mon Docteur NNNIIIIAAAAAAAAAHHH","timestamp_created":1511922822,"timestamp_updated":1542858304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37917375","author":{"steamid":"76561198045962677","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":189436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125857,"last_played":1649095665},"language":"brazilian","review":"So, you either disable cross play and play with 160+ PING or you enable it and play with freakin horrible console players, nice one devs.","timestamp_created":1511922660,"timestamp_updated":1608311050,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37916923","author":{"steamid":"76561198130001782","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1511923564},"language":"english","review":"no in game chat?

This is an exceptionally exciting game (especially for new players).  The basic mechanics are about as simple as it gets so it makes for an easy learning curve.  At the same time, there is a nice complexity to the game that builds with your experience so what appears simple on the surface actually can be quite intricate.  The DLC is pretty nice in terms of nostalgic value, and the most recent patch introduced some new mechanics as well that help keep the game from getting stale.  The only downside I have experienced this far is that the adrenaline rush doesn't come so much any more when the killer comes near after many hours of gameplay.  \n\nAbsolutely love the assymetry - too many games are cookie cutter, and this actually presents a real challenge when playing as a survivor.  Backstories for the characters are interesting and I wish they were fleshed out a bit more so that you could connect with them more as favorites.

Wanna know why ? It fucking sucks :( If you play survivor is ok but if you play killer...God forbid ! Well let's start with the palets : if you find a looper he will go around the obstacles in the palet area for well , let's say forever , and it fucking sucks cause you have to catch the dude and you lose time by doing so ! Also if you let him go cause you don't wanna spend precious time by trying to catch him bad for you , cause guess what , he is still alive ! As for the windows , omfg , on the Institute and Hadon it's a fucking nightmare , and Springwood and Auto are super full of palets , yep , you're right , you are as good as dead on this map and wow , you play killer which cannot die ! If we are talking about generators , well , that's the most fucking OP part of the game for survivors , they can repair it , but not one , not two , all 4 of them ! 4 survivors on a generator ? Let's rush them all then , and holly sweet mother of cool games , they really do it , just to make you get angry ! About perks , hmmm , they cand disable your perks if you are using a hex for instance ! Now let me get this straight , it's 4 against one , you can do all this shit i just talked about and you can also disable my hex ? Jesus christ , so unbalanced ! You wanna know about items ? All are cool , really , but the flashlight ... isn't it too fucked up when i work so hard  to catch a survivor and when i finally do , one of you comes around and blinds me with the almighty flashlight that is so powerful than the fucking sun itself ? Let's not forget about body blocking , oh yeah , that part of the game when i catch someone and i try to take him to a hook , but guess what ? Survivors can rush your ass and block you so can't get to the hook ! Of course you will hit them to get away but that means only more time for the survivor to wiggle and get free from your grasp ! Also , if you didn't know if they down a palet on your ass you will drop the survivor , cool right ? And finally , after you worked you ass so much for almost nothing , they power the generators and they can escape but it's ok cause you say : ok , i'll guard the gate and they won't get out ! Sadly my friend , they have 2 gates they can use to escape ! Like it's not enough , they also have a hatch spawned somewhere on the map that leads to freedom ! I would be ok with all of that , cause when they release a DLC i pay for that motherfucking killer to have it as paid for it but no , a crybaby survivor can complain cause it's right to do so , and my dear killer that paid money for gets nurfed ( cause it's OP . you know ) to the point that he is no longer a killer , just a useless puppet that i can control and get shit done with it , cause it was OP once and needed to be nerfed ! Don't get me wrong , the idea of the game is awesome , but seriously it's too fucking unbalanced in the advantage of the survivors ! If you want to play survivor with your friends it's cool , yo will have lots of fun , but if you are buying the game for the killers you are giving your money for nothing ! With all that being said , fuck your game , untill you don't do something to balance this shit i'm out !
