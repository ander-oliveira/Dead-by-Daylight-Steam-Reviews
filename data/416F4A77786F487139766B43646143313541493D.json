game is really really really really fun when you have evenly matched survivors and killers. You run around like chickens trying to fix those generators but you have to find totems in case they have some devious plots in mind. I personally enjoy playing killer because I like to keep the game... even? A person being camped or tunneled isn't having fun, so always remember to hook and move on. \nThe only problem with the game is that (IMO) High ranking survive with friends teams using outside communication to gain huge advantages over killers is making it impossible for killers to play the game. If you can coordinate to have a lookout and yell at your teammates over discord when a stealth killer is headed your way, the game has lost its way. This would just be irritating if they didn't take it a step further and crouch repeatedly in front of the killer like in Halo days... SUPER TOXIC! Now top killers don't want to play so rank 14 killers are getting matched with teams of rank 1-5s... Killers don't want to play! The survivors are their own cause of having 20 min game queues and ditched lobbies. \nIf you are fortunate enough to have 4 friends that can play at the same time, its worth struggling through the grind to get perks and then play custom games for the time of your life! or death ;]","timestamp_created":1623204192,"timestamp_updated":1623204192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93439433","author":{"steamid":"76561198844404062","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1823,"last_played":1647398118},"language":"spanish","review":"La verdad es que es un juego muy recomendable.

Half of the killers are either never played or will experience strings of matches where winning is an uphill experience because they have powers that aren't properly implemented. Also more recently the devs have decided to waste everyone's time by focusing on a back-and forth totem boon/totem cleanse sub objective that forces everyone to screw around devoting effort and precious seconds in the match to something that doesn't actually win you the game and is in my opinion just annoying to deal with. I just want to do chases and mind games and the game is beginning to disincentivize that play style in a big way.\n\n - Matchmaking is a farce, I either get stomped or I stomp, there's really not much of an in between\n\n - Queue times are atrocious at times, especially on the survivor side\n\n - Because of meta, over half of all the perk abilities in the game are unusable if you want to win, and then 15% of the good ones are so OP that you will see them every match, making the gameplay much more stale and repetitive than it has to be 90% of the time\n\n - One of the most unstable and toxic communities I've ever seen, end game chat can quickly devolve in to threats and childish tantrums over something as simple as a perk that you decided to equip. The man baby is strong with this one. (It's not everyone but it is a huge part of the experience that you should expect to happen frequently.)\n\n - Despite having so many horror icons in the game, the horror aspect of this game has been continuously downplayed with brighter lit maps and just generally an atmosphere that doesn't really scream HORROR to me at all anymore \n\n - Speaking of maps, 2/3rds of them are poorly designed and are routinely released with major bugs that see them removed from play for long periods of time, but again, you will come to enjoy probably 3 or 4 of them and then groan every time you load in on the rest of them, especially as killer. RPD is straight up garbage for both sides though lol.\n\n - Lackluster events, not always enough incentive to come back to the game\n\n- NFT garbage means that things like Pinhead's voice lines from the movie can be launched and then instantly retconned from out of nowhere, also morally questionable obviously and poses a potential threat to the game on this platform due to Steam's policies on that sort of thing\n\nI love this game, but there's a lot you have to excuse in order to keep playing and if that sounds annoying to you, well it is. Best I can say is buy it on sale and give it a try for a bit and refund it back if it's not your thing, because it could go either way. I've already bought every DLC so I'm kinda stuck with it at this point, I don't exactly regret it, but I have many bones to pick and I hope that something changes soon to fix the problems or it might end up driving away its already niche player base relatively soon I think.","timestamp_created":1623197654,"timestamp_updated":1640898696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93435944","author":{"steamid":"76561198268801580","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":8003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":106,"playtime_at_review":2132,"last_played":1660098338},"language":"spanish","review":"Very funny game, there are a lot of d*ckheads and annoying people but you can make them suffer =D very nice after a day of work, very very recomended to play with friends","timestamp_created":1623196983,"timestamp_updated":1623196983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93435747","author":{"steamid":"76561199069746411","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":497,"playtime_at_review":5637,"last_played":1660598492},"language":"spanish","review":"mi reseña personal de este juego en LATAM? que si no te encontras con Killers campers o supervivientes que se desconectan jugando de Killer entonces no se que juego estas jugando, recomendado pero bajo riesgo de perder la compostura mental por el tilteo de terceros :3","timestamp_created":1623196689,"timestamp_updated":1623196689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93435744","author":{"steamid":"76561198807551462","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23061,"last_played":1624740896},"language":"russian","review":"В целом могу сказать, что игра очень неплохая, со своим очарованием.

Еще хуже сделали.\n\nВ игре отсутствует баланс и это при том, что при выходе игры он был частичный. В погоне за деньгами они испоганили идею игры - смертельные прятки. Из-за скилов и расходников - выживших видно и они не могут спрятаться, поэтому вся суть пряток теряется.\n\nВаншоты - их слишком много, они просто портят игру, особенно новичкам.\n\nУ выживших невидимый хитбокс как у красного слона, красный из-за подсветки скилов. \n\nОтсутствует подбор игроков совсем. Полный новичок, который только начал играть будет играть против топовых игроков часто с дискордом, у каждого из которых более 1000 часов наигранно и они будут абузить все и тем самым новичок получит негатив от игры. \n\nМеханика починки генераторов слишком надоедливая.\n\nБесполезные скилы, предметы и расходники.  Непонятно, что делают некоторые навыки. Зачем?\n\nПочему не добавили подсказки, что означает тот или иной символ, событие Сложно внизу добавить строчку с символом и кратким пояснением?  Особенно непонятно новичкам.\n\n\nСильный гринд. Чтобы прокачать с 1 до 29 уровня пришлось потратить более 700 тыс, а это часов 15 игры.\n\nЧитеры!!! Могут ваншотнуть те, у кого такой возможности нет или модель персонажа бежит, а его там нет или не дают повесить на крюк или скорость передвижения изменяют или могут летать. И разумеется вас будут видеть. Могут использовать скилы, которых нет у персонажа. Античита нет.\n\nСетевой код крайне плохой. Долгий поиск, частые вылеты, невозможность сыграть группой, потому что выдает ошибки, удары когда далеко убежал уже и тд.\n\nЗвук плохой.\n\nМеханика ослепления фонарем идиотическая. В ней отвратительно все. И освоить ее могут только задроты.\n\n\nУ игры на данный момент конкурентов адекватно сделанных не знаю и это одна из причин, по которой ей не занимаются.\n\nИз-за огромного количества негатива в минуту чаща терпения переполняется и возникает ненависть, поэтому люди говорят гадости под конец игры. На эмоциях и я говорил, прошу прощения у всех.\n\nЧто любопытно, многие проблемы разработчики могли решить очень быстро. Например сделав настраиваемый фильтр подбора по картам, маньякам, скилами, рангам и количеству часов в игре. Статистику онлайна, чтобы было видно кто за кого хочет играть. Убрать бесконечные патроны у доктора. Убрать скилы, которые позволяют видеть игроков. Это прятки, но нельзя спрятаться если тебя видно или если выжившего ударили и тебя стало видно. Убрать скилы и расходники с ваншотами и убийством после первого хита. Если и делать ваншоты, то трудно достижимыми. Но они этого за 5 лет не сделали.\n\nВ сумме дает игру, которая хорошо портит настроение. Не рекомендую. Стрессоустойчивость вряд ли улучшите с помощью игры.\n\nИ забавно то, что у данной компании только эта игра выстрелила и они ее продают за 4600 рублей с дополнениями, но при этом адекватно ей не занимаются. Так что у игры только две проблемы по сути: владельцы и разработчики.","timestamp_created":1623190809,"timestamp_updated":1624029050,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93432394","author":{"steamid":"76561198217201841","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4871,"last_played":1647812172},"language":"english","review":"Such a fun and entertaining game.","timestamp_created":1623190031,"timestamp_updated":1623190031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93432325","author":{"steamid":"76561198168874668","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":22152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17806,"last_played":1658442178},"language":"french","review":"Un bon gros jeu d'abrutit autant visuellement qu'au niveau de l'équilibrage (matchmaking comme compétences)\nle jeu est débile et plus vous jouez cancer(camper ou jouer les compétences complètements fumées) en tant que tueur plus vous gagner ce qui enlève absolument tout le fun du jeu et qui explique le fait que tout le monde ce barre du jeu vous laissant dans une file de matchmaking interminables et vous pouvez commencer le jeu rang 20 et vous prendre des votre première game un raclé par des rang 1 (rang max).\nSans évoquer les différents bugs toujours présents et les hitbox ravagées le jeu n'est plus du tout ce qu'il était il y a 5 ans.\nA oui et pour enlever la limite des 60 ips il faut aller dans les fichiers du jeu car en 5 ans c'est trop dur de pouvoir personnaliser ses paramètres.","timestamp_created":1623189884,"timestamp_updated":1623190579,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486111104488372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxoHq9vkCdaC15AI="}
