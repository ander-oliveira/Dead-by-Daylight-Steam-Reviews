Game matches Players with High-lvl-Perks against Low-lvl-perks, which is a disaster. Most items are useless. Running away from the killer is futile, and getting spotted by him is a death guarantee as long as he doesn't act idiotic. Killer can close lobbys if the survivors are to high-lvl for him.\nThe survivors should get a hint where the generators are to find. Hiding from the killer highly depends on the players personal skills at looking at his monitor, which can be helped by simply brighten up the screen. When you run, you leave a trail which the killer can simply follow, and because he runs faster then you, once he spotted you, you just serve as a mean to get the rest of your team more time.\n\nAs a survivor, you only level up if you manage to escape. Which is the reason why 99% of the survivor players still hang at lvl 20, the lowest level in the game. Higher perks can only be achieved to sheer luck, or by leveling up. Because the killer can level up by just killing only one of the survivor, but as a survivor, you have to escape, otherweise you lose levels, the game got unbalanced really quickly. Survivors can't catch up the perk-gap anymore, and the idea of matching up people with different, success-depending perks is a bad idea anyway.\n\nThe game needs to get rid of the perks completely or make them level-independent. Or better, remove levels completely.\n\nSo far, the game is not really enjoyable.\n\nEdit: the game also constanly crashes, or causes my graphics drivers to crash.

Hrál jsem i betu a od té doby se zase tak moc věcí nezměnilo, samozřejmě všichni čekáme na Survive with friends, ale to se k nám zatím nedostalo. Takže směrem k hodnocení a co si o hře myslím.\nHra jako taková má určitě super koncept na kterém je ještě co zlepšovat. Strom se zkušenostmi a itemy pro každou postavu jak u přeživších tak u vrahů je celkem dobře vyřešený, ale rozhodně to bude chtít fixnout všechny nefunkční věci a také některé vybalancovat. Gameplay jako takový je celkem plynulý, až na některé případy, kdy se server kompletně laguje a není to zapříčiněno vaším internetem.\n\nZápory:\n- Bugy na mapách\n- Lagující servery\n- Lobby problémy s připojením do hry\n- Žádná Možnost hrát s kamarády public matche\n- Neuplná funkčnost itemů/perků\n\nKlady:\n- Dosti zábavné\n- Super grafika a prostředí\n- Dokonalá atmosféra\n- Super nazvučení\n- Promyšlený herní systém vyrovnaný na obou stranách\n\nCelkové hodnocení je 8.5/10. Rozhodně bych doporučil zakoupit pokud vás tato hra táhne a rádi hrajete takovéto multiplayer hry, ale pokud to chcete hrát výhradně s kamarády a myslím si, že to bude o dost lepší tak bych doporučoval ještě se zakoupením počkat.

It also needs more variety in game modes like Dead Realm did and also a lot more killer and survivor types but that's just a minor complaint i'd rather they make a way to play in smaller groups without forcing it to be a private match. In the end it's a great game with an intresting type of gameplay which is rarely seen in games anymore just if you want to buy and you barely have any friends to play it with wait until they add a group mode but i still recommend it if your looking for a fun game on your own or with a group of 5. (Edit: Now they have added a feature that is a party mode the game is a lot more enjoyable with friends... IF you're patient enough to wait to get into a match which takes a while because you have multiple people but when you do get into a game it helps a bunch when wanting to play with friends this game still needs time to be updated, tweaked and improved but right now it's one of the most fun games on Steam that i've seen in a while so i say give it a try and if it's not your thing then fine just don't go trying to ruin the experience for others).","timestamp_created":1468075335,"timestamp_updated":1469732168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24208606","author":{"steamid":"76561198017542224","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1776,"last_played":1550555101},"language":"schinese","review":"我是打汉化补丁被封的，真尼玛无辜，游戏已经移除了，但是封禁信息一直在，我也没办法了，这个差评您收好，永远不可能改了，垃圾公司垃圾游戏，祝你们公司以后的所有游戏见光死","timestamp_created":1468075277,"timestamp_updated":1629392228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24208319","author":{"steamid":"76561198034494682","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":9078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1476,"last_played":1635953963},"language":"italian","review":"17/8/21:\n\nDopo il nuovo DLC inerente l'universo di Hellraiser mi sono imposto di riprovare a tornare.\nDevo dire che i miglioramenti ci sono stati anche se permangono i soliti fastidiosi bug che praticamente la community segnala da secoli.\nDetto questo, ora il titolo presente un matchmaking sufficientemente equilibrato (ma non troppo) che vi consente di giocare abbastanza bene.\nL'attesa per iniziare un game, sopratutto se dal lato SK, è molto rognosa ma solamente durante il giorno: si riscontra una velocità molto diversa e rapida dopo le 19.\nFiga e ora puoi interpretare pinhead, il mio sogno da maniaco.\n\nSi ok, ora è consigliato ma non è che per questo dovete farvi i bocchini a vicenda, il gioco ha fatto cagare per anni, i programmatori hanno molto da scontare...

For many, it might evoke memories of other four player co-op experiences, like Evolve or Left4dead. I see a familial heritage in, of all things, Starcraft and Warcraft. Their arcade mods have long since included Cat vs Mouse games with mechanics that mirror Dead by Daylight very closely, indeed.\n\nCat and Mouse has since gone a different direction with it's content and the same is true for Dead by Daylight. It is for this reason I'm upvoting it: though currently broken in myriad ways, as first of it's kind, it's quite good. There is a lot of subtlety in little jump scares and building tension. During a good match, you might actually feel yourself stuck in a slasher film with Jason Vorhees.\n\nThat said, Dead by daylight is an extremely unrefined experience. Sometimes you can't pick up survivors as killer. Sometimes artifacts fly randomly across the map. People disconnect to deny you points. Once the exit opens, the game basically turns into five player co-op as the survivors and the killer start squeezing the maximum amount of points out of eachother. And the matchmaking mechanics are serviceable at best.\nAnd while much of this may be patched out, this will inevitably invite new issues. Games like Killing Floor 2 or even the once applauded Darkest Dungeon suffer from this: every patch bolts on another layer of temporary fixes, stacking ever greater piles of bandaids while the wound underneath festers. I have no readily employable course of action in mind to fix this.\n\nPros:\n- Exciting new type of game\n- A good match with the right mix of killer and survivors is really, really intense\n- Good with the subtle details, audio and visual cues, \n\nCons\n- For a game that's not actually in early access, there are a lot of embarassing little mistakes you really only see in early access\n- Some issues result in considerable imbalance\n\nVerdict: I feel twenty euros is a fair price. As always, caveat emptor. Watch a few Twitch streams or Youtube vids before buying.","timestamp_created":1468065771,"timestamp_updated":1468065880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24205503","author":{"steamid":"76561198216757676","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1655040517},"language":"thai","review":"BuG","timestamp_created":1468065732,"timestamp_updated":1468065732,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24205484","author":{"steamid":"76561198110873794","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":21989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":366,"playtime_at_review":16107,"last_played":1660132261},"language":"russian","review":"Разрабам поXYi на игру ez","timestamp_created":1468065649,"timestamp_updated":1593195429,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24205361","author":{"steamid":"76561198027256073","num_games_owned":407,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1470085848},"language":"english","review":"I HAVENT HAD A SINGLE FUN GAME , AS KILLER I CANT FIND ANYONE AND AS SURVIOR I GET FOUND INSTANTLY","timestamp_created":1468065246,"timestamp_updated":1468065246,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24205327","author":{"steamid":"76561198138321017","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":23796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19150,"last_played":1656612901},"language":"english","review":"pretty good job so far","timestamp_created":1468065119,"timestamp_updated":1543002357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24205325","author":{"steamid":"76561198099140755","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1733,"last_played":1499703159},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好的游戏，以前有BUG删了，后来下回来玩着挺好的","timestamp_created":1468065097,"timestamp_updated":1489314780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24205265","author":{"steamid":"76561198216024139","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1174,"last_played":1626729361},"language":"english","review":"Game crash every time i turn on the game and I want to join a lobby.

Die Updates, sind mehr schlecht als das was sie bewirken sollen. Fehler werden ausgebessert, beim nächsten update wieder die selbe \"Scheiße\". Für mich ist das Them erledigt. Ein Spiel muss man spielen können, wenn ich jedesmal mehrere Minuten versuche, ein Spiel zu starten hat es für mich keinen Sinn.","timestamp_created":1468063709,"timestamp_updated":1473868032,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24204818","author":{"steamid":"76561198074021542","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1468062615},"language":"french","review":"De gros bugs qui font freezer mon PC (Windows 7,8 et 10 )","timestamp_created":1468063430,"timestamp_updated":1468063430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw18bZ59UCcuGqXA=="}
