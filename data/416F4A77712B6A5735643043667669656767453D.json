Ich finde das Spielprinzip an sich gut. 1 Killer soll 4 Survivor jagen und opfern während diese versuchen Generatoren zu reparieren um zu entkommen.\n\nDoch nun zum negativen. So gut die Idee auch ist, an der Umsetzung haperts (Ich kann jetzt nur für mich sprechen, aber vielleicht sehen es einige genauso). Killer Gameplay wird stets gebuffed. Campen wird als Strategie angesehen und Survivor werden bei der kleinsten Nörgelei der Killer generved. Noch dazu kommen die andauernden Bugs, von denen ich einfach schon zu viele hatte. Plötzlich aufploppende Survivorsymbole von Survivern, die gar nicht in der Runde sind. Schläge, die halbe Map gehen (leichte Übertreibung) und das schlimmste erst vor einer Woche: Reset sämtlicher Spielfortschritte. Und das haben sie nicht mal fixen können, obwohl sie mir schrieben, dass sie sich ransetzen werden (vor 3 Tagen). Stattdessen bringen sie lieber ein neues DLC raus. Klar, es ist ein Charity DLC. Aber hätten sie das nicht auch mit einem anderen gemacht? Ich finde es ist wichtiger, dass das Spiel an sich bei allen läuft (ich weiß ja, dass dieser letzte Bug nicht nur bei mir vorkam), anstatt noch mehr Geld mit ihrer DLC Politik zu erwirtschaften.\n\nIch für meinen Teil werde nichts weiter in dieses Spiel investieren...Für das was ich bezahlt habe, wurde ich herbe enttäuscht.","timestamp_created":1502462901,"timestamp_updated":1502462931,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519880175590515137","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34169570","author":{"steamid":"76561198357942364","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1655890840},"language":"schinese","review":"制作组诚意很足，每周两三更更是媲美隔壁更新日，也是逼死强迫症的节奏啊。","timestamp_created":1502461542,"timestamp_updated":1502461542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501811563968658447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34169409","author":{"steamid":"76561198366602174","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2776,"last_played":1659296432},"language":"italian","review":"consiglio molto questo gioco, il survaivol horror piu bello di semore ,(altro che friday 13th the game....), l unica pecca di questo gioco sono i bug, spero che li risolvino tutti,voto gioco 9/10","timestamp_created":1502460974,"timestamp_updated":1502460974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34169225","author":{"steamid":"76561198173937057","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2565,"last_played":1625074995},"language":"german","review":"Unglaublich spaßiges Game.

With the game becoming easier to play for killers it doesn't leave much to work to improve your skill. As a new player you will find yourself getting bullied as a survivor and as a killer. Since launch the trials have been dictated by survivors since holding M1 on a generator dictates where the game goes. The devs do nothing but place bandages on the games scars rather than fixing them entirely. Not only do they fix very little every few months but they also do not ban hackers which there are so many. Easy anti-cheat is a joke that has been bypassed every patch since launch allowing others to ruin the game and bypassing the entire progression system within an hour. Even if the \"progression\" is done correctly it doesn't take long before you have all the teachables. For survivor it doesn't matter who you play since they're all the same so 1 survivor with all perks is enough. Killers are different where as each has their own power but half of which are useless at higher ranks. The ranking system is a joke that seems as if it was designed by a toddler allowing anyone to reach max rank based on their monthly hours rather than their skill. I do have nearly 2100 hours at the time of writing this but I wish I never got past 500. The only thing that has kept me playing for this long is the people I've met and playing with friends is the only good thing to do just to fool around. All in all I do not recommend this game to anyone who wants to make this into a game they'd wish to play often.

I don't mean attempting escape, what I mean is that when another survivor unhooks a hooked survivor, the hooked survivor now has to evade the killer while injured, which is nearly impossible if the killer is half decent. The main reason this is true is that every single decent or above average killer will camp hooked survivors, they won't facecamp but they will stay within the vicinity. As soon as someone gets unhooked the killer will dart straight back to the crime scene and down the originally hooked survivor. Killers have no penalty whatsoever for camping, according to this new meta once a survivor is hooked they're dead for sure. Borrowed time was the only counter to this sickining meta but the developers obviously had to bury that perk into the ground because why make a balanced game? I understand survivors would pallet loop and troll killers for a crazy amount of time before this latest update, which needed fixing. But something needs to change for sure, hooked survivors don't have an actual chance of escape, which wasn't the intent of the developers in the first place. Getting hooked once and dying because of it is just not fair for survivors.

You run when you shouldn't, you stay put when you shouldn't, all out of fear of the hook. You try to fix generators but keep screwing it up and making noise which gets your heart racing. \n\nAfter this stage of personal progression you begin to learn better when to run and hide. You might even watch the killer roam around a bit nearby, waiting for them to leave so you can continue working on your generator.\n\nThen you experience a new killer, one you haven't played before. They can sneak up on you like the others can't, or you don't realize they're coming until you see their red glow on your back. \n\nYou'll eventually play in the insane asylum, which sucks, but has it's own reason for adding to your level of fear.\n\nMoral of the story is: get this game.

El juego está hecho totalmente para los asesinos, esto debido a que no hacen más que nerfear las habilidades de los supervivientes y dejar tal y como están las de los asesinos. De hecho, todos los asesinos llevarán el mismo kit de habilidades porque funcionan con cualquier asesino, ya puede el asesino no tener manos que igualmente te matará, creeme. \n\n2. Cambiando de tema respecto a lo anterior comentado de las habilidades nerfeadas de los supervivientes y las gloriosas e intocables habilidades de los asesinos, como te toque el maldito asesino que lleva el cuarteto de las 4 habilidades magistrales y encima te esté campeando, olvídate que se te acabó la partida guapetón/a. Y si por alguna casualidad tu equipo consigue sacarte, tranquilo... que el maldito asesino seguirá yendo detrás de ti para colgarte y enviarte al lobby de un hachazo en la espalda.\n\n3. Comentando lo anterior del campeo en el gancho, me parece increíble que desde el 2016 no se haya implementado un sistema que perjudique al asesino por esto, ya sea que no le de puntos por sacrificio o alguna otra cosa de ese estilo, puesto que al final los camperos son lo que empieza a hacer a todo el mundo toxico durante la partida, comenzar a tiltear y salirte de la partida para intentar buscar otra en la que no te lo hagan. Por ejemplo: En 2016 una de las habilidades más rotas era el saboteador de Jake Park que te permitía romperle los ganchos al asesino para que no pudiese colgar a nadie; y bien que pasó, lo normal, nerfearon la habilidad haciendo que ahora los ganchos tras estropearlos se reparasen automáticamente sin necesidad de que el asesino hiciese nada (ni si quiera que él tuviera que repararlos acercándose o algo), entonces respecto a esto, ¿no han podido implementar una sanción para estos camperos en todos estos años?\n\n4. Añadieron servidores dedicados para las partidas, y adivinad que... la volvieron a liar, ahora para buscar partida con un amigo o varios te puedes tirar facilmente 10 minutos para poder jugar, ya solo con esta espera y que cuando entres a una partida te pase lo que os comenté de los camperos... te coges un cabreo mayor que el de una mona en celo\n\n5. Damas y caballeros, en caso de querer ganar partidas como asesinos con más facilidad y tener habilidades más fuertes, existe la posibilidad de PAGAR PARA GANAR!!!! SIIIIIi!!!!!. \nQuieres mejores habilidades? Quieres ganar más facilmente como asesino? Quieres un jersey? Quieres una skin que esta chula y no puedes conseguir el dinero especial del juego por ningún metodo de forma gratuita (ni siquiera jugando horas y horas), PAGAAAAAAA\n\n6. Los asesinos en el servidor de pruebas revientan, los sacan a servidores oficiales la primera semana y revientan, pasan dos semanas del lanzamiento y una vez ya todo el mundo haya pagado el DLC para ganar facilmente lo nerfean a saco. Si señor, como hacer dinero facilmente.\n\nEn conclusión si crees que eres capaz de jugar durante años, sin enfadarte porque el juego sigue siendo injusto y ver que nada cambia para bien... Bienvenido al club del perder el tiempo y gastarte el dinero para ganar.
