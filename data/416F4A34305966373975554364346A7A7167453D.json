a decent amount of time spent in the game(closing in at 100 hours), experienced an event and a couple of updates/patches i can say that DBD is a great game overall. A unique genre of it's own, immersive with various elements describing the game as: Teamwork, Survival, Horror, Action, Mystery, Strategy, Stealth. \n\nYou can focus on any of the above or all of them all together because the base characteristic defining the game on the first sight is Stealth, but most of the time it ends up being intense chases, run for your life and evade the killer situations. You also can choose to play support to other players, be aggresive and make various moves to the killer(stun, distract etc), or defensive and hide so you can focus on the main goal of the game(fix Generators). You can be a team player and save others or play solo(not recommended).\n\nWhen this game was free for a few days and i tried i found it just enjoyable fun game, then i liked it more, then i decided to buy it on the next sales. So i did and didn't regret it all. (Only thing i may have regreted is not getting some DLC's for a couple of € cause i am against paybale DLC's but i got to see that most of the characters are worh it.)\n\nHalf the characters are farmable to get for free,  the rest of them(killers especially) are only buyable with money. At the start of the game experience it causes intensity, agony, and maybe fear. When you get used to it, it can be action packed, fun, and some times even funny.(Depends if you play with friends or not, Survivor or Killer).\n\nThe Community is typical Online-Gaming-like, starting with toxic players who blaim you for anything in chat, disconnecting too easily without penalties and same thing for Killers some times. But you can also come across a friendly Killer who may let someone live because others were unfair, and friendly teammates who actually help you.\n\n⇧ Nice Graphics\nGreat Concept\nCool Gameplay\nGood Content with Various Playstyles/Maps/Characters\nAffordable Price that's VfM\nRuns Smooth\nEasy to learn hard to master\n\n⇩ Toxicity/ Trolls\nAn in game chat for Survivors would be nice\nLicensed DLC's require Real Money\nIt could use diversity in Maps and Modes\nManages to have both sides complaining that it's Unbalanced but this probably isn't a \"real\" Con, but a Toxic one ㋡\n\n✍ Recommended 9/10","timestamp_created":1537328372,"timestamp_updated":1606503815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547619044780731201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44805260","author":{"steamid":"76561198331671589","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1582803750},"language":"thai","review":"เหวอ","timestamp_created":1537328327,"timestamp_updated":1537328327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44804946","author":{"steamid":"76561198364081655","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":17179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4625,"last_played":1639398979},"language":"russian","review":"Что можно сказать о этой игре, она годная всем советую но что меня бесит это кемперы кемпер-игрок который поймал вас и повесил на крюк  стоит рядом с вами иногда отходит но это очень редко есть более сложное заболивание это так называемый фэйс кемпер-игрок который повесил вас на крюк и стоит и смотрит на игрока и не отходит ни на шаг это больше бесит в игре что мне нравится в игре это графика для 2016 как мне кажется эта игра сделала прорыв это чисто моё мнение многие будут с ним не согласны","timestamp_created":1537325654,"timestamp_updated":1568526631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44804911","author":{"steamid":"76561198846055569","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":69118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":20,"playtime_at_review":18403,"last_played":1659627961},"language":"french","review":"* Je trouve sa super sympa qu'on puisse jouer en survivant ou tueur, qu'on puisse jouer des tueur de film d'horreur un exemple : Amanda (le cochon) ma prefere pour ma part. je vous le recommande !

Let me tell you that this game is not bad. The community makes it bad.\n\n1. When I first had Dead by daylight in my hands (Console back then) I fell in love with the game and I couldn't stop playing. There are a lot of survivors and killers. 4 survivors and 1 killer in a random map. You must complete all 5 generators to open the gate and escape from the killer. Of course, it won't be easy. It's entertaining, but people sometimes can be harsh for stupid reasons, and we are gonna talk about that in the next paragraph.\n\n2. People. YES there are salty people, like in ALL games out there. you will, with no doubt, encounter a salty premade or killer. The salty killer is not offensive, but survivors are mostly. They bodyblock you just because: ''They didn't have a good day''  or basically just because they are grumpy and want to bring misery to others. I don't understand the people that doesn't like to play for fun. One thing for sure, is that you can't complain about the community to the developers. It's not on their hands. Why?`because it's not that easy to wipe out these salty pimples. They are like mites stuck in a dogs furr. \n\n3. The game itself is REALLY entertaining and VERY funny. The people are just idiots (if you excuse my language) I dont hate the game, but I do dislike the specific ''I am so proud of myself''  kind of people. They blame you for every mistake they make and they get away with it. Ignore these pimples and enjoy playing with friends, trust me. Now this ''TUNNELER YOU F**** S***'' and this ''CAMPER PIECE OF GARBAGE'' and this '' HACKER MOTHEF*****'' is everywhere :D but ignore it.\n\n4. If you dislike repetitive games, then this is not your game. People argue about it being the same over and over, but the point is surviving from a killer and that's all. killers will be added every year, survivors as well with different mechanics. The game will evolve. Just be patient. Bugs show up and then vanish, it's normal for a game. All online games has it. \n\nGive the developers a moment to breath because they can't fix things that fast and easy. Find some cool friends in steam and play together if you think that other players are dumb, easy. Buy the game, It's very good and I recommend it.\n\n\n:)","timestamp_created":1537296801,"timestamp_updated":1537296801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44800502","author":{"steamid":"76561198396022054","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1554266720},"language":"spanish","review":"JUEGO DE MIERDA !! no se que es lo divertido.
