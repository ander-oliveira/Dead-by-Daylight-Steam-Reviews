I waited of course to buy it until recently with the Steam Grand Prix, giving 5 dollars discounts enough to the point where I got this game for free by doing that and being honest: I’m glad I did or I would’ve felt I was ripped off. \n\nThe core gameplay is good, the idea of the game is original and exciting but the years after that has been a downhill. Being a killer isn’t fun anymore, there are exploits that the survivors use that make a scary coldblodded murderer into an angry pup with a short Leash. Corse the new survivors have it bad as well since some killers have such overpowered perks that it’s like fighting someone with constant wallhacks. The community is toxic that it exceeds levels that even Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege couldn’t reach. At least they did something about it where as DbD Devs just leave us to simmer in the toxic fums. This isnt everyone in the game, I’ve met and played with some of the most fun and respectable players I’ve met in most games, here. But once you met someone toxic, oh boy it doesn’t matter what you do, they will be as toxic as they can. You will be called names and they will exploit everything they can to make your game a living hell, especially if you’re a killer. I've gotten more sacrfices by being a \"friendly\" killer than actully trying to be a killer cause people decide to give you a \"pitty kill\" by not leaving when the generators are done. If that doesnt spell unbalanced then i dont really know what does.  \n\nAll in all, the game is fun and I still do plan on playing it, but it’s an enter at your own risk type of game. Also if your new and want to play whatever new killer they released, Understand you will have to pay money to even play them. Wanna dress them up? You get a few eh looking cosmetics for free but you want a good one you gotta pay up.

A comunidade é tão tóxica e nojenta que parece a própria usina de chernobyl após explosão. A própria moderação de grupos é extremamente tóxica e apoia camper e tunnel tranquilamente, que é basicamente o assassino ficar parado que nem um idiota na sua frente no gancho e te bater assim que alguém te tirar. Mas pode ficar tranquilo, que tem perk pra amenizar isso tá? Tem o DS, que vai fazer você bater no assassino e sair correndo de novo pra ele te derrubar 3 segundos depois, isso se ele não esperar o tempo do DS passar, e tem o tempo previoso, que você tem 15 segundos pra correr dele sem poder cair se levar hit, mas fica tranquilo, que eles continuam te perseguindo e quando acabar esses 15 segundos você cai. Rank 1 são bons jogadores e quanto mais baixo seu rank melhor é o jogo certo? ERRADO. 95% dos jogadores red rank só chegou nesse rank tunelando e camperando todo mundo, quase não tem habilidade nenhuma e só querem fazer 10k de ponto antes de sair se achando o fodão. Diversão NÃO EXISTE nesse jogo, então se for comprar já se prepare pra passar MUITA RAIVA E ÓDIO. Ah, e os desenvolvedores não ligam tá? Eles só ligam pra lançar roupinha nova e quando consertam os 40 bugs do jogo, pioram mais 60 bugs que o jogo cria do nada nas atualizações. Ficou puto com um assassino e quer sair do jogo? SURPRESA, agora você tem penalidade de 5 minutos até VINTE E QUATRO FUCKING HORAS caso dê DC de uma partida, ah e isso não é só quando você sai não viu? É quando sua internet por qualquer motivo que seja cai por um minuto também, eles não querem saber por qual motivo você saiu da partida, se saiu, você que se dane e espere. A gente reclama de camp e tunnel? A gente é tudo bebê chorão que não sabe correr e dar loop no assassino e fica criando livro de regras (k) pra eles jogarem, mas os assassinos podem reclamar que a gente faz gerador muito rápido e usar isso de desculpa pra ficar parado na frente do gancho. Basicamente, quando você entrar, saiba que isso é um LOL de terror. 95% das pessoas são umas otárias que vão fazer de tudo pra te estressar e você não pode fazer NADA sobre isso, só passar raiva mesmo.

This game just isn't the same anymore. The game has gone so much downhill. It's changed so drastically from what it used to be. \nWith DBD in it's current form, it's just not even fun or enjoyable anymore. Now, it just causes me very extreme anxiety and stress. It also severely triggers my bipolar depression. I just feel so down and depressed playing this game now, especially knowing that it's not the same game I once loved anymore. It's just so disappointing, so depressing.\n\nBHVR, the developers have made so many changes, all that just seem so out-of-touch, so backwards, so poorly thought out - That I've lost all hope and confidence in their ability to create a fun and enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nBHVR rarely listens to community feedback. They very often consider any form of negative feedback as \"unconstructive\". This is a huge problem, especially if you're a game developer. Negative criticism is very important, especially if there's a huge majority against something specific.\n\nIt kinda feels like, when DBD Mobile came out - All the good devs shifted over to that project, leaving us with amateurs to work on the \"base version\" of the game.\nThe Mobile version seems so much more polished.  Meanwhile we're left with an extremely buggy game and a dev team that doesn't seem to have a clue how to fix even the most basic issues.\n\nBHVR has added a \"skillbased matchmaking\" (MMR) system that doesn't really work. You're frequently matched with either someone completely new or someone who's \"sweaty\" (trying WAY too hard). There's rarely an in-between or any true balance.  This system is extremely unpopular within the community, there's so much voice against it that BHVR still stubbornly decides it's good/working perfectly/let's keep it. \n\nBHVR and DBD currently has a huge problem with cheaters/hackers.  They clearly have no server-side anticheat or server-sided validation for movement & player actions. \nBHVR has delayed updating their anticheat for several months, and won't even support Proton and Linux users. \nThis often gets to a point where you just have to DC (disconnect) from the match, and then get punished for it because of a DC Penalty system.  Seems fair right?\n\nBHVR has added a ton of strong antiloop killers, some of which give survivors very little options.  This has caused a huge shift in the meta that makes the game feel so stale and boring for both sides.\n\nThe game is very often considered \"survivor sided\". Which I believe to be totally false.  Especially as a solo survivor player. Even while playing with 1 or 2 friends. The game in my very honest opinion only feels survivor sided if the 4 survivors are the literal definition of \"deathsquad competitive swf\", which isn't at all every swf you encounter. \nAnd with that being said - Another major problem is the DBD forums. The developers always say to provide your feedback on the forums. But in my experience, you really can't!! If you have an even SLIGHTLY unpopular opinion on something: YOU get completely shit on by the abhorrent amount of killer mains on the forums.\n\nShouldn't the whole point of a feedback forum literally be to provide feedback? I don't even feel safe using the forums anymore. Because I just can't with the harassment and unfair treatment by mods. THE ONLY PLACE I feel like I can actually give my opinion and not be shit on for it, are the Player Feedback Survey's. \n\nI've played a fair bit of both killer and survivor.  I main: Dwight, Trickster, Myers, Huntress.\n\nKiller to me feels incredibly relaxed and easy-going.  I ACTUALLY LIKE getting challenging survivors, and don't particularly care for what perks they run. \n\nSurvivor to me feels very frustrating and stressful.  It feels like, due to a lot of changes made to the game, that I don't have much of a chance and a lot of my skill is completely thrown out the window.  I HATE THE \"HOLD W + PREDROP\" META!! I miss the days of looping the same tile repeatedly and greeding pallets.  That's skillful.\n\nAs a mostly SOLO survivor player, it feels like skill is thrown out the window. You can't really do much to loop or \"run\" the killer, you can't greed for pallets anymore, you can't play aggressively anymore. You used to be able to, and your skill would definitely show. But now, with the amount of map and tile changes made, plus the addition of several antichase killers - You can't do anything except \"hold W\" and pre-drop pallets. Most games feel like it's completely handed to the killer, almost for free. \n\nThere's no point in even mindgaming killers anymore; Most loops are so short, pallets are incredibly unsafe, they add an open doorway directly next to window vaults (killer can just walk around), tiles are super short, or killers just simply have built-in power that gives them a natural advantage, they don't even have to really work for it. For the killer, they can almost always just turn their brains off and let the game mechanics do the rest for them.  As a survivor, you're punished for greeding and trying to preserve resources.  It's either waste resources, or die. \n\nThere's many new killers with such oppressive powers that gives survivors very little to no options at all.\n- Blight: Prevents survivors from gaining any form of distance, forces survivors to predrop, and allows to get incredibly nonsensical hits.\n- Wraith: Currently buffed to allow the killer to catch up to survivors super fast and even has quite a few addons that are borderline unfair.\n- Artist: Completely shutdown looping entirely with a powerful ranged attack that requires almost no effort whatsoever.\n- Twins: With a little bit of aiming, gives survivors NO OPTIONS AT ALL while in a chase against Victor. Has an unnecessary amount of tracking (built-in bloodhound), super fast movement, no terror radius, can jump over dropped pallets and through windows, can hold survivors hostage in lockers, has an extremely massive hitbox, and has a really unfair \"return\" cooldown that allows the killer to respawn him almost instantly. Victor has way too much going for him, and with no real counterplay. \"Group up\": Can't do that in solo, \"Use lockers\": Not valid counterplay when the killer can hold you hostage in it.\n \n--- \n\nAs I mentioned before, I miss the old \"loop meta\" of 2018/early 2019.\nBut now, you have many map and tile nerfs. \n- Open doorways added directly next to many window vaults. Literally just walk around it with no effort at all, even with the most weak killers. Easy. \n- MANY unsafe pallets.\n- Maps made much smaller, and added in more \"deadzones\". \n- Killers wanting all maps to be super small so they don't really have to move much at all to \"pressure\" gens.  Free pressure?  Especially with antichase or high mobility killers. \n- Killers not wanting survivors to have even ONE strong window or pallet.\n\nAlso let's add that killers don't want survivors to have anything even remotely strong for them.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I don't mind if killers have strong addons.  But it shouldn't be overly done to the point that even a good group of survivors all just die.  Everything should require some degree of skill and thought.\nI know you're probably thinking me hypocritical now with my last statement and my opinion on strong windows/pallets.\nBut hear me out: Properly chaining tiles without predropping/wasting every pallet.  Pathing, often requires map knowledge and tile layout on the survivors part.  Skill.  Infact, knowing how to work around tiles and prolong a chase for as long as possible actually does require a good amount of skill.  Especially if you can lead the killer on a good long chase or make them simply give up on you.  Instead of, again, predropping or wasting resources. \n\nIf you as a killer can easily remove survivors pressure, then survivors should be able to also remove your pressure.  Fair is fair. \n\n**Killers now HAVE NO IDEA just how easy they have it, compared to how DBD used to be.**","timestamp_created":1564536844,"timestamp_updated":1643906851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571359932422637939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54381368","author":{"steamid":"76561198168203939","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":48091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":169,"playtime_at_review":30997,"last_played":1660342915},"language":"english","review":"Ehe bloodpoints go brrrrrrrr","timestamp_created":1564534981,"timestamp_updated":1624489929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54380755","author":{"steamid":"76561198198999615","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":42040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3300,"last_played":1657925273},"language":"brazilian","review":"gostei muito, o jogo e incrivel :)\n","timestamp_created":1564531073,"timestamp_updated":1564531073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54380239","author":{"steamid":"76561198846778393","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":15747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1653249858},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy divertido, mucha variedad de habilidades, builds, mapas, personajes y asesinos, esta muy bien trabajado y pulido, con pocos errores y siempre están metiendo cosas nuevas, por lo que nunca te aburres","timestamp_created":1564527986,"timestamp_updated":1564527986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54380237","author":{"steamid":"76561198854281532","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":110144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":589,"playtime_at_review":6690,"last_played":1660551675},"language":"english","review":"For those who are interested, don't bother yourself installing this game. \n\nIt is fun.

Now with every buyable addon the developers released and overpowered perks one can choose it just has become a very poor experience. The hooks are 5 feet apart, struggling to set oneself free has become 100% impossible because of it. Killers have perks that let them see people through the walls and find them way too easy. Other perks allow the killer to instantly down a survivor even with full health. Now killers can even completely set back progress made on generators.There are similar perks for survivors as well yet as soon as there is a difference in play time between killer and survivors it becomees unplayable (because either side has way better perks). Absolutely unneccessarily overpowered BUYABLE add ons that clearly made this game become \"pay to win\".  Sad to see developers prefering money instead of creating a balanced game. Apart from that, the initial maps that were out after the release were very well made unlike the new ones which appear in boring and little unique settings. They are not enjoyable since the layouts make it very hard / almost impossible to escape killers. It feels like the new map designs were done way too quick without much thought and creativity.\n\nOverall it WAS a great game which I really enjoyed playing.

Die Überlebenden müssen Generatoren reparieren, um die Ausgangstore mit Energie zu versorgen und gelegentlich ihre Mit-Überlebenden retten. Das klingt im ersten Moment recht repetitiv, ist es aber durchaus nicht, da man sehr selten zweimal mit denselben Leuten spielt, außer man entscheidet sich, mit seinen Freunden zu spielen. Ich kann das Spiel jedem empfehlen, denn auch wenn es noch diverse Bugs enthält und auch vielleicht noch nicht perfekt ist, aber diese Idee und ihre Entwickler sollten unterstützt werden, um das Spiel weiter voranzutreiben. In letzter Zeit wurde viel über Dead by Daylight gemeckert, aber es sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass dieses Spiel noch nicht lange aus der Early-Access-Phase heraus ist und der Hype, besonders durch Let's Plays auf Youtube und auch auf Twitch, die Entwickler sicher ein wenig überrannt hat. Ja, die Ladezeiten sind bisweilen lang, es sei denn, man erwischt die richtige Uhrzeit und auch, dass man immer wieder bestätigen muss, dass man \"Bereit\" ist, kann einen sehr nerven. Aber das sind meiner Meinung nach alles Sachen, an denen die Entwickler noch arbeiten können und diese das möglicherweise sogar schon tun. Ein Beispiel dafür ist auch das Feature \"Überlebe mit Freunden\", welches ursprünglich nicht enthalten war. Doch die Community hat es sich so sehr gewünscht, dass sie es mit eingebaut haben. Woraufhin das Gemecker wieder losging. Mein Rat also: Kauft euch das Spiel, wenn es euch vom Trailer und vielleicht einem Let's Play hergefällt und \"Calm down\". ;)\n\nLieblingszitat: I think we did pretty good job","timestamp_created":1564465376,"timestamp_updated":1587033293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54367379","author":{"steamid":"76561198283648084","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1583,"last_played":1630746045},"language":"koreana","review":"군단(legion)너프 심한듯\n하라는 너스라 스피릿은 않하고","timestamp_created":1564465137,"timestamp_updated":1564465137,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54367079","author":{"steamid":"76561198868237884","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1638732959},"language":"russian","review":"Заебись игра только вот маньяки платные,а так заебись","timestamp_created":1564463126,"timestamp_updated":1564463126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54367065","author":{"steamid":"76561198264251123","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":57301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5473,"last_played":1659059745},"language":"brazilian","review":"acabei me viciando na primeira vez que joguei eu recomendo","timestamp_created":1564463034,"timestamp_updated":1564463034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6e3QoOwCebWyzwE="}
