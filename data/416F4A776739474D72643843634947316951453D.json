There is no other game modes.\n\nKiller objective:Hit a survivor twice, Hook them. wait for others to help that survivor that got hooked, hit those survivors that are trying to help him them then hook those survivors. Get as many survivors on hooks as you can..\nKiller hits a survivor once then he/she is slowed for like a second? How does that make any sense? When you use the blink ability on one of the killers you are slowed after you use it and theres no cooldown, A cooldown would be really good but instead why make it so your slowed and you cant hit anyone afterwards?\nWhen you hook someone, The hook goes straight through the upper left of the body were your heart is, DOESNT Make sense on how you can get hooked there afew times and don't die, Game logic. But ofc you die instantly after getting hooked afew times.\nThis game graphic wise looks stunning but it has issues, When you get hooked the hook moves through your body and it looks really unrealistic. Maybe it will get patched sooner or later? \nAlso, When you want to play as a killer it will take like 4 minutes to find people? When you play as survivors and find a lobby you instantly find people. Thats great. Don't know why matchmaking takes so long as a killer.\n3/10. I wanted to enjoy this game but, I hate how it's just one game mode and the killer matchmaking takes so long and that there's really nothing more to this game,\nTo me this game gets boring and it's annoying that you just repair generators then hear the killer then hide and repeat till you repaired all the generators. But, If you do like games like this then. I recommend it on sale.\nI wanted a horror survivor multiplayer game but this isn't the one, It's really not scary at all, Well. The only time that i did got scared was i looked behind me and i saw a killer appear from invisible.","timestamp_created":1509070263,"timestamp_updated":1581145580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509104490280151367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36029095","author":{"steamid":"76561198399117871","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":69189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":661,"playtime_at_review":8149,"last_played":1660555379},"language":"english","review":"very good game","timestamp_created":1509070200,"timestamp_updated":1509070200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36029011","author":{"steamid":"76561197980661265","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":12700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1386,"last_played":1613284659},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!

I dont even have to look anymore :) it's like the game plays itself for me now when I play the killer. When you can see the survivor its just a matter of time until you catch up to them since your faster and all. So happy I can just  skip the hide part of the hide-and-seek core aspect this game holds.
