The basics of the game is a lot of fun, but the game developer Behaviour has a bad habit to change gameplay mechanics and balance mechanics in favor of entitled survivor mains. Thus being someone that plays both sides, I find playing Killer especially at high level, very stressful and not fun if you are against a SWF “Survive with friends” which is a mode that allows you to play in a party with your friends, which in turn gives the survivors an unfair advantage against killers. Behaviour will have ALL my support once/if they start balancing the game mechanics for high level play for both killer and survivor. Meaning they need to either nerf survivors, or greatly buff killers overall. But even after all that, I still have a lot of fun playing this game, if long as I don’t let the entitled survivor mains get to me, I.E.

There's also the fact that they change stuff in the game quiet often for \"Balance purposes\" which is all well and good however they changed two killers straight away after releasing them, so everyone spent money to buy a killer then they made changes to said killer and in effect people didn't get what they paid for and this is allowed so be cautious when it comes to spending money on this game.

by Daylight est un jeu de survie où 4 survivants se font pourchasser par un tueur, tourmenté par un entité malfaisante. Les survivants se doivent de faire plusieurs objectifs sans se faire attraper ou se faire tuer. Ces objectifs sont des générateurs à réparer; puis 1 porte à ouvrir pour s'échapper. Une partie se finie lorsque le tueur a tué les 4 survivants ou que 1 2 3 ou 4 survivants se sont échappé(s) et que les autres sont morts. Une partie se joue environ vers les 15-20 minutes et le jeu comporte uniquement un mode de jeu compétitif en tant que survivant et tueur. Un mode permet de jouer entre amis et il existe des personnages venus de films d’horreurs.\n\nIl y a la possibilité de modifier votre personnage, chaque personnages à des compétences uniques que vous pouvez attribuer aux autres après un niveau passé et ont pour certains, un grand nombre de skins et pour d'autres presque 0 skins. Ils sont tous plutôt intéressants à jouer et vous avez aussi la possibilité d'attribuer des items pour vous aider dans la partie suivante. La plupart des compétences disponibles sont inutiles ou pas amusantes à jouer et seules une petite quantité seront utiles pour monter, que ce soit en tueur ou en survivant.\n\nQu'en est-il de l'aspect visuel, graphique et l'optimisation du jeu ? L'aspect visuel / graphique du jeu est correct, des graphismes plutôt réalistes malheureusement, l'aspect visuel des survivants est mauvaise, leur tête a un mauvais design et ressemblent pas tellement à des humains. Quant'aux tueurs, ils sont bien modélisés, rien à redire. Côté optimisation, c'est une débauche, le jeu est mal optimisé et les bugs / glitchs sont très présents; crashs en début de partie, hitbox des personnages, collisions des murs, etc... Le pire dans Dead By Daylight est la communauté, elle est digne de CS:GO, le facecamping, le camping, le tunnel et le cheat seront au rendez-vous. Dans l’état actuel, 1 game sur 2 sera un tueur qui camp et qui vous retirera le seul fun de jouer au jeu, et ne vous inquiétez pas, vous serez récompensé par vos adversaires de « noob » ou « ez » en fin de partie.\n\nLe jeu a beaucoup de failles, l’équilibre survivants / tueur est mal fait, il y a peu de nouvelles mises à jour pour modifier cet équilibre et les développeurs n’écoutent absolument pas la communauté et font donc des ajouts hasardeux concernant le gameplay. Le matchmaking est une hécatombe, les nouveaux joueurs se retrouvent contre des rangs très élevés ce qui rend des parties injouables et pas drôles pour ceux-ci. Ils sont avides d’argent et donc, sortent régulièrement des skins et le jeu a sorti depuis peu un Season Pass pourri. Le jeu est d’une frustration sans précédant et à pu, j’imagine, faire casser des claviers. Le concept du jeu est bien trouvé, mais on s’ennuie sur la longueur et le jeu fini de passer à amusant au début, à tryhard pour atteindre un rank sans récompense ou au ragequit à la seule partie qui ne vous plairera pas.\n\nJe ne recommande pas ce jeu.","timestamp_created":1580673044,"timestamp_updated":1610293839,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62877813","author":{"steamid":"76561198392741949","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1593439099},"language":"schinese","review":"对新人太不友好了","timestamp_created":1580672571,"timestamp_updated":1580672571,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470852047204971313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62877782","author":{"steamid":"76561198080973214","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":39955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15832,"last_played":1658011786},"language":"spanish","review":"Primero perdonen mis faltas de ortografia,pero vamos que simplemente quiero dejar una reseña para aquellos que no se decidan si comprarse-lo o no.\n\nEl juego es 100 por 100 recomendable y mas si juegas con amigos,nosotros somos un grupo de 12 y ya tenemos todos el juego ya que es muy adictivo.\n\nEl juego no esta totalmente optimizado y sufre a dia de hoy de algunos bugs,pero esto es 1 de cada 40 partidas por lo cual capaz hasta te eches unas risas!\n","timestamp_created":1580672534,"timestamp_updated":1580672534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62877730","author":{"steamid":"76561198110977004","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1047,"last_played":1641108428},"language":"russian","review":"Постоянно  не возможно зайти в матч вечно когото выкидывает , и если вы играли весь матч и потом вас выкинуло вы не получите награду и нельзя перезайти а это обидно","timestamp_created":1580672472,"timestamp_updated":1580672472,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62877446","author":{"steamid":"76561197961328258","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":80207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1934,"last_played":1655950107},"language":"spanish","review":"Un auténtico fenómeno en los cibercafés, un título legendario en partidas con 200 ms from somalia y uno de los juegos de supervivencia con mayor capacidad de ganchos de todos los tiempos.

The game is not scary and is more or less very toxic with survivors teabagging exit gates. The game is very fun and easy to learn but hard to master and trust me. with this growing community and more effort into creativity of killers this game will soon become quite a popular game.","timestamp_created":1580669523,"timestamp_updated":1620075036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62875183","author":{"steamid":"76561198830432234","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":486,"playtime_at_review":5474,"last_played":1659785005},"language":"schinese","review":"种是出一些奇怪的东西，一会是初始化错误，一会又是eac的问题，根本没法玩，差评","timestamp_created":1580669426,"timestamp_updated":1580669426,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62874941","author":{"steamid":"76561198985820392","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":21342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3410,"last_played":1653949878},"language":"russian","review":"Игра оооочень кайфовая,я конечно бы дальше в нее играл,если бы у меня запускались матчи в этой игре,а то после обновления игра стала вылетать,но думаю скоро исправят)","timestamp_created":1580669178,"timestamp_updated":1580669178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62874783","author":{"steamid":"76561198322581370","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":16387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1660368365},"language":"brazilian","review":"Fun","timestamp_created":1580668994,"timestamp_updated":1580668994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62874202","author":{"steamid":"76561198022283694","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1344,"last_played":1648321792},"language":"russian","review":"Я не могу понять одного, неужели нельзя за несколько лет придумать нормальный алгоритм подбора команды?
