I actively play games, but when I meet toxic players and there is nothing I can do, why I can't complain? Those players made me endure a pretty bad game experience that lasted nearly 30 minutes, and when the game was over I complained that you guys still gave me penalty? Someone may ask why I don't just leave the game. Why should I suffer a 5-minute penalty for leaving the game because someone is toxic? The casual matching gives me not only teammates with bad game skills, but also teammates with toxic attitude. Under this kind of circumstances the DBD don't let me complain after the game.","timestamp_created":1650028026,"timestamp_updated":1650028026,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568627476692199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113892102","author":{"steamid":"76561198335336140","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":19218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":10192,"last_played":1659481073},"language":"turkish","review":"gerilimi sevenler için güzel oyun","timestamp_created":1650027992,"timestamp_updated":1650027992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113892078","author":{"steamid":"76561197999463865","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":34794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3045,"last_played":1658320309},"language":"english","review":"Changed my review to not recommended: you get disconnected constantly, and when that happens you lose multiplayer rank progress, get locked out of the queue for a while, and lose the blood points (the free progression currency) you had earned. \n\nI basically only get disconnected from this one specific game, and sometimes it will happen 4 or 5 nights in a row.

game can be a ton of fun, it just has some hiccups on occasion. At the time of this review, I am getting close to having played 200 hours, so overall not a ton but don't take that as me not knowing the game.\nI don't have many problems, but I do have a few. The main thing I run into are killers/survivors who ruin the entire experience. Instead of playing the game, they find ways to \"win\" in a way that feels almost like cheating. Survivors will form a full team where they talk and coordinate on discord or something. That's fine! But when this team purposely offer things and bring items and perks designed to make it impossible for the killer to do anything, then it's not very cool anymore. Even though killers cant bring in a group of friends, they have their own tactics. Usually \"camping\" a hook making it to where a survivor dies right at the start and can't do anything about it, or \"tunneling\" which just fuels frustration. There is no way to easily fix that, but some of the devs just don't seem to care which sucks.\nThat's all of the negative, mostly just people being people. There are a ton of players who are great to play with/against and they can make the game even better. I heavily recommend the game to anyone who likes the multiplayer horror genre, even if it's not a ton of horror. Heck, I recommend the game to anyone who likes games!\nSome friendly advice though, if someone is toxic in a game towards you, just toss it off as nothing. If you take it to heart and act toxic in your next game because of it, that doesn't help.\n\nOtherwise, 9/10 won't stop playing anytime soon.","timestamp_created":1649946757,"timestamp_updated":1649946757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113842085","author":{"steamid":"76561198188633889","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3561,"last_played":1650241910},"language":"english","review":"kinda boring. a lot of killers let u just farm xp and farm xp themselves, no chance to play out the game.","timestamp_created":1649946384,"timestamp_updated":1649946384,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113841871","author":{"steamid":"76561199099444276","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":53284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39322,"last_played":1658005744},"language":"russian","review":"Well, let's start with parameters that will be matter for almost any player: Gameplay\nOverall, when you start playing this game you can have a lot of fun: you can experiment with different perks, open new survivors and killers, play with your friends. In your first game you'll be scared (100% sure). But after playing a while you will notice subtle [u]cheaters[/u] that ruin your game. Behaviour is not going to change this because they said they don't see a problem with that. Okay, moving to community.\n\n[b]Toxic survivors or killers[/b]. If you will play more, then you will have higher ranks and this is the point where you will see t-bags or facecamping in every 2-3 games. If you're unlucky, then be prepared for insults in post-game chat. At first, you might consider this offensive or annoying, but you have to remember that these people just angry. If you can deal with all this stuff, then i will talk about things that finally will make you exhausted.\n\n[i]Servers[/i]. As much as i know, your hits(or escapes) will go through validation from the server that decides whether your get hit or not. And most of the time, if the survivor use dead hard(David King's perk), then your hit is not going to be consider as down state for the survivor. In other words, survivors using dead hard can just escape your hit and continuing to run, even when you saw blood and heard their screams. You can think that this is not going to be a big problem, but at least 1 survivor in every match use it(mostly, it's minimum 2). \n\nHow i see this game over the time? For me it's getting boring. People use the same meta perks(both survivors and killers) and even if you will use some fun perks - you will lose because the other side don't think the same way you do. For some reason, Behaviour starting  to realize only [b]now[/b] that there's a perks that waaaay stronger than others. And this is the perks that you will see in every single game. \nRight now I have fun only playing in custom game because custom game with friends(who aren't tryhards) looks like what this game was supposed to be - entertaining, scary and unpredictable. Sadly, it's not. It's own community(with a little help of work team) that destroying any fun both sides can have in this game.","timestamp_created":1649946091,"timestamp_updated":1650021163,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518018901348114014","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113841395","author":{"steamid":"76561198117599849","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":26597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24015,"last_played":1659155680},"language":"tchinese","review":"檢舉系統基本沒用","timestamp_created":1649945415,"timestamp_updated":1649945415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612078487873077393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113841322","author":{"steamid":"76561198260229398","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6451,"last_played":1653560779},"language":"english","review":"fun game even though hitboxes can be weird. matchmaking is also strange, you can \"win\" a game against a completly new player and in the next one you are paired up with top tier players, it gets better the more you play, I'd say in about 5-10 matches it starts to find players that are actually close to your skill level.
