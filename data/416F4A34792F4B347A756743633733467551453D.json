The game play can be inconsistent and the game has a lot of issues currently. Mainly with survivor queue times and disconnects, the devs already enabled a dc penalty so this issue is solved for the most part. However the survivor queue times is what really makes this game a 9 instead of a 10 for me, it takes me about 5 minutes to get into a survivor game. This then shifts me into playing more of killer which is really fun, but it can get boring if you play too much. This stems from the matchmaking system matching high rank killers with survive with friends groups. for example, say you are playing with your friends who are ranks 10,15, and 19 (you are a rank 3). The matchmaking system will pick the highest rank and put it into a queue for killers that are around rank 3. The previous system was when the matchmaking system averaged the ranks and you would be matched with a killer with the average rankings.  \n\nThis game may seem like it is full of issues, but there is not too many other big issues other than queue times in my opinion. The variety in this game is what separates this game from other games. There are 15 different killers with the addition of the gunslinger, all with different and unique powers. This gives you a grand amount of options to choose from, some people may enjoy Trapper or Wraith game play while others enjoy billy. The game offers many killer perks as well which you can make certain builds with. Another positive in this game is that the game play is unique and interactive. Depending on the structure the killer is chasing the survivor around he will have to change his strategy if he wants to catch them. For example if the killer is chasing a survivor around a L wall T wall structure with two windows he will have to run it a specific way to catch the survivor. Also on the survivor side there is a lot of predicting and mind games at play when you are at a jungle gym and you have to predict what the killer will do to counter act it. \n\nSome people may also say that gen speeds are quick which I agree to an extent. I think that people relied too much on ruin instead of getting normal pressure by getting quick down. This artificial pressure with ruin is now gone so it seems that gens are getting done fast, but if you get enough pressure you should win a good deal of games as killer.\n\nHow Strong are the Killers?\nTrapper\nPros: traps are useful in removing strong tiles\nCons: lacks mobility and setting down traps takes a while \nOverall: 5/10\n\nWraith\nPros: cloaking is useful in sneaking up on oblivious survivors and cloaking has good mobility\nCons: His power doesn't help in chase so it can be difficult to catch experienced survivors\nOverall: 6/10\n\nBilly (favorite)\nPros: amazing mobility and he has one shot potential\nCons:good survivors can still loop billys for long periods. also can be hard to learn\nOverall: 9/10\n\nNurse\nPros: amazing mobility, can down survivors very quickly, and good survivors are as vulnerable to the nurse as decent survivors\nCons: can take some time to learn other than that none\nOverall: 10/10\n\nHuntress\nPros: fps players will love this killer, can down survivors very quickly with her hatchets, she can also make some structures impossible to loop, good snowball potential\nCons: slow, has to reload every time she throws five hatchets, \nOverall: 9/10\n\nThe Shape (aka shirtless boi)\npros: great stealth, very fun to play, he's michael fucking myers,also he has an insta down\nCons: slow at the beginning of the game which can leave you in a tough spot, insta down has to be charged up to be used, \nOverall: 7/10\n\nThe Hag \nPros: great camping potential, can neutralize certain areas, solid in chases\nCons: not fun to play (imo), slow and frustrating, no mobility, \nOverall: 7.5/10 (I would put her lower if it was rated by enjoyment)\n\n The Doctor\nPros: Great in chase, can also find survivors easily which can be useful if the survivors are stealthy, power can waste some of the survivors time\nCons: Not much mobility\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nThe Cannibal\nPros: ummm he can camp the basement with insidious, one shot down, can face camp \nCons: little mobility, terrible chase potential, \nOverall: 2/10\n\nThe Nightmare\nPros: good gen slow down, solid chase potential with fake pallets or dream snares, good mobility with gen teleport\ncons: even with the dream snares or fake pallets his chase potential can be hit or miss (especially fake pallets)\nOverall: 8/10\n\nThe Pig (one of my favorites)\nPros: crouching can help in chase along with sneaking up to people,her RBT's are hit or miss but a decent slow down\nCons: little mobility (even slower if you crouch), power can help in certain situations in chase  but some areas are tough to deal with\nOverall: 7.5/10\n\nThe Clown\npros: power is literally designed for limiting pallet looping\ncons: if survivors just pre throw pallets and do gens clown will lose a lot of the time, little mobility,\nOverall: 6.5/10\n\nThe Spirit\npros: second best down potential in the game, decent mobility, good survivors have trouble \ncons: slow(when not using her power), can be kinda hard to learn, but not as hard as billy or nurse\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nThe Legion\npros: his power can buy some time, easy first hit in chase\ncons:after the first hit it can be hard to catch survivors, also his power is rechargeable, little mobility if you're using his power in chase \nOverall: 3.5/10\n\nThe Plague\npros: if survivors don't cleanse they are injured for the entire game, if they do you can down them easily, can buy some time if survivors cleanse\ncons: if survivors don't cleanse it can be hard to keep pressure up, even with them being injured, if they do cleanse then you have to go where they cleansed to get your power which can take a lot of time\nOverall: 5.5/10\n\nThe Ghost Face (one of the more underrated killers)\npros: arguably best stealth in the game, can immediately one shot down if he stalks a survivor, also he can have good snowball if multiple people are stalked, he can tbag\ncons:no mobility, the power has to recharge \nOverall: 8/10\n\nThe Demogorgon (one of my favorites)\npros: great mobility with portals, his lunge can be used to end chases quickly, also has some tracking potential\ncons: The portals take time to put down and can be destroyed\nOverall:8/10\n\nThe Oni\npros: good mobility when he has his power, good snowball potential, decent in chase with his power, has one shots with his power\ncons: power has to be recharged by hitting survivors and collecting blood, this mean about half of the game he will be a m1 killer\nOverall:8/10\n\nIf you read all of this I love you","timestamp_created":1548897594,"timestamp_updated":1582339559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517490923404693604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48657046","author":{"steamid":"76561198099144531","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1469,"last_played":1546073607},"language":"schinese","review":"紧张刺激，难得的佳作，服务器中等吧还算稳定。最好玩还是五个朋友一起玩最欢乐，如果两三个人一起玩当人也很好玩。但是玩久了也会有些腻。总结：难得的休闲恐怖逃生游戏。个人评分：8.7","timestamp_created":1548896816,"timestamp_updated":1548896816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530026078224182129","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48656882","author":{"steamid":"76561198023266256","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":33016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6059,"last_played":1644374928},"language":"english","review":"Updated!-

У каждого есть светлая и темная сторона, какой будет твоя, когда опасность будет настигать тебя? Что ты выберешь? Смерть это не выход?\nТы можешь быть обычным маленьким и испуганным человеком, который старается выжить и прячется по краю территории, на которой ты оказался. Это твои первые часы, все кажется пугающим и сложным. Ты будто бы попал в параллельную реальность, где каждый шаг может приблизить тебя как к спасению, так и к смерти. Тут нет места жалости или же жадности. Ты должен быть максимально собран, тебе обязательно нужно многое понять и узнать. С каждыми 10 часами игры, ты начинаешь вникать во многие аспекты, если играешь с людьми по войсу, то тебя обучают чему-то новому. Каждый матч будто отдельная жизнь, ты проживаешь её по-разному. Иногда это обычный матч, где 2 выжили, 2 погибли. Иногда это матч, в котором не смог спастись никто, а иногда это фарм катка, где тебе кажется, что маньяки это хорошие и славные существа.   \nС каждым рангом борьба за выживание и blood points растет, всегда есть тот, кто лучше тебя что-то делает или знает, в таком случае ты становишься слабым звеном и погибаешь, а иногда возникают ситуации спасения и ты находишь спасительный выход через странный люк, которого ранее не видел.\nС какого-то момента у тебя появляются любимые перки, ты стараешься их прокачивать на всех персонажах, которыми играешь, а потом ты становишься знатоком и ищешь то, что ранее не пробовал, но видел на стримах. Тебе становится интересно. Игра порождает голод острых ощущений. И вот настает день, когда ты просто не можешь не сходить в катку, не повисеть на крюке, не захилить и не попытаться выбраться из этого адского места, наполненного жуткими memento mori и порчами никому не скрыться и погибель. Ты становишься одержимым, но не как жертва, которая может попытаться сбежать, а как человек, которому нужна доза. \nТы живешь этой игрой, ты стараешься получить все ачивки, прокачать всех персонажей и забрать весь шмот и все перки из храма тайн.  Именно ты начинаешь различать где тут туннелинг, а где живая и интересная игра, где кемперы, а где продвинутые игроки. Ты чувствуешь всю боль от потери подношения гирлянд, когда маньяк disconnect, или когда ты первым умираешь на крюке.\n\n[i] \tТы тот самый человек, который несмотря на баги будет сидеть в этой игре, и продолжать наслаждаться ей. Ты тот самый выживший, который будет открывать ворота, чинить генераторы и мансить. Ты игрок DBD. Ты маленькая легенда, если не для других, то для себя уж точно.

Já te respondo. Vou primeiro explicar o porquê de Dead by Daylight ser um desastre ou até uma afronta, por assim dizer, a nós, comunidade e consumidor.\n\nDesde o princípio fui coagido por amigos a comprar este jogo. A propaganda sempre girava em torno da mesma conversa: lugares assombrados, geradores quebrados e assassinos irritados (meus amigos me conhecem). Porém, o melhor de tudo, estava no fato do assassino ser um jogador, ou seja, controlado por um humano. E sim, isso ganhou minha curiosidade. Aguardei por uma promoção e comprei por 18 reais. Fiz um bom negócio? Sim. Acho que sim. Na verdade, não sei.\n\nAntes de seguir para a próxima pancada, vou resumir, em essência, como é este jogo. Quatro sobreviventes e um assassino são jogados em um mapa aleatório, que pode ser um hospital, fabrica de carne ou um quintal gigante que não faz o menor sentido. Todo mapa possui duas saídas. O problema é que as saídas estão fechadas e só abrem quando a energia é restaurada. Para restaurar a energia os sobreviventes precisam reativar cinco geradores que estão espalhados pelo mapa de forma aleatória. O papel do assassino é bem simples, tenho certeza que não preciso explicar. E é isso. Isso toda santa vez. A menos, é claro, que você seja o assassino. Os sobreviventes consertam geradores para escapar e o assassino persegue os sobreviventes. \n\nAgora que já explanamos o pobre roteiro de DBD, vamos para o que interessa. Faço o download logo após a compra. Abro o jogo enquanto meus olhos brilham de expectativa. Meus amigos, que me aguardavam, me convidam para a sala. E então, começam as decepções.\n\nDos 17 sobreviventes, apenas 8 são jogáveis.\nDos 14 assassinos, apenas 5 são jogáveis.\n\nNão sei se você entendeu direito, mas claramente comprei o jogo pela metade. Não é a toa que estava com um desconto de 50% (risos). Ignoro está falta de vergonha enorme e tento fazer a única coisa que importa: me divertir. E acreditem. É bem divertido. A diversão, como em qualquer jogo, tem seus altos e baixos. Aqui, mais do que nunca, a diversão sempre está mais para baixo. Até mesmo com os amigos este jogo consegue dar canseira vez por outra. A busca por salas ocorre de forma aleatória para prevenir a má fé da própria comunidade. Disso não reclamo. Reclamo de esperar 5 minutos por uma partida e depois ocorrer uma falha e ser desconectado da partida sem razão alguma. Reclamo de inúmeros erros de conexão, antes e durante a partida, que conseguem desanimar qualquer empolgação para jogar. Reclamo também da própria comunidade, que ao perceber uma partida perdida, desconectam sem ao menos tentar. A conectividade não é funcional e a comunidade, na grande maioria, decepciona.\n\nApós conseguir me conectar em uma partida com todos os meus amigos, o jogo, propriamente dito, começa. Toda a ambientação é maravilhosa e esse é o primeiro ponto positivo até o momento. É como entrar em um daqueles filmes de terror da década de 90, 80, etc. Por mais que o jogo não consiga me assustar, conheço algumas pessoas que gritam, sério, gritam de verdade. Até aí, tudo bem. Estou me esgueirando sorrateiramente por uma plantação de milho, quando o assassino subitamente olha na minha direção e vem correndo para cima de mim sem explicação alguma. Levo duas peixeradas no meio das tripas e vou ao chão em questão de segundos. O assassino me coloca para secar em um gancho e vai embora. O comportamento certeiro do assassino me deixa incomodado. Porque sempre após colocar alguém no gancho, ele segue diretamente para outro sobrevivente. É como se não houvesse probabilidade de sobrevivência. O assassino tem as estatísticas sempre ao seu favor. \n\nConversando com meus amigos, já veteranos no assunto, descubro que os assassinos possuem certas 'habilidades' que são desbloqueadas com muitas horas de jogo. O problema é que cada assassino possui uma habilidade muito boa em específico. E em determinado momento é possível desbloquear essa 'habilidade muito boa' para outros assassinos. Resumindo, com a combinação certa de habilidades, se torna quase impossível escapar. E quando digo impossível é porque é realmente impossível. A menos, é claro, que o assassino seja inexperiente (ou deixe), que pode acontecer. \n\nOs sobreviventes, por sua vez, também possuem 'habilidades'. Levando em consideração, claro, que todos são engenheiros mecânicos capazes de consertar um gerador, mas ao mesmo tempo são incapazes de fazer um curativo. Existe um desbalanceamento notável entre as vantagens do assassino e dos sobreviventes. Para tentar minimizar isso o próprio jogo tenta criar 'rank' por temporada. Todos os jogadores tem seu rank zerado no inicio de uma temporada, então é possível que um jogador totalmente inexperiente entre em uma sala com um assassino super experiente. Que legal, não? Resumindo. O assassino sempre terá uma boa vantagem. Existe também a comunidade. Jogando de forma aleatória é bem difícil cair com uma equipe que quer mesmo sobreviver, pois toda a jogabilidade foi corrompida pelos pontos de sangue. Muito do que você faz durante a partida gera pontos de sangue. Ligar um gerador. Curar ou salvar um amigo do gancho. Escapar do assassino. Esse tipo de coisa. Alguns jogadores não estão nem aí para a equipe. Eles só querem os pontos. Então prepare-se para se deparar com uma quantidade absurda de sobreviventes egoístas.\n\nO jogo não é muito pesado, mas também não é um exemplo de otimização. A configuração gráfica é limitada entre as opções predefinidas, então não tem muito o que fazer. É escolher entre uma das configurações e rezar para rodar acima de 60 fps. O sistema de localização de áudio também é um horror. Reze aos deuses para não cair em um mapa de arquitetura vertical, porque você vai passar todo o tempo ouvindo o raio de terror do assassino. A música do jogo também é obrigatória. Você é obrigado a ouvir aquela coisa toda santa vez. Eu mesmo já estou para lá de saturado. A única configuração de som disponível é a geral. Então se você baixar, vai baixar tudo, inclusive o barulho do gerador, assassino e outros sobreviventes. É pedir para morrer.\n\nE para finalizar, temos os fragmentos iridescentes e as células áureas (algo do tipo), que explicando de forma rápida, é o dinheirinho do jogo. Claro, precisava ter dinheirinho também. Porque existem centenas de 'skins', para sobreviventes e assassinos. Vez por outra o jogo vai te dar uma miséria de fragmentos. Então, com muita paciência e muitas horas de jogo, quem sabe você consiga comprar uma roupinha para seu personagem favorito. Já as células... aí meu filho, você vai precisar investir um bom bocado de reais.

This game is perfect for me to be honest playing survivor is fun it also gets repetitive if you have a good squad and they is only a couple broken survivors (im looking at you Claudette). And the survivor mode is alright with friends you will have a hearty laugh for the first hour but after that you will start taking the game so less seriously when you learn how to counter the killers whether it be by insidious looping around pallets, or whether it just be making the killer chase you for about seven minuets because the killer's are so slow and you use a system to unlock perks called the bloodweb which is randomly generated every level which means you and your friend can be playing the same survivor but you will both be getting different perks which is beneficial and also you will get offerings which most of the time give you extra bloodpoints which is cool but they also give add-ons and items and at increments of 5 levels you will be unlocking perk slots to allow greater survivability. But the reason survivors are fun is how unique every survivor is some specialize in healing others specialize in risky gameplay its about the style you wanna play.\n\nKILLER REVIEW:\n\nRemember what i said about unfair AI? Well in this game you can play as a killer and murder everyone while almost being unstoppable (Pallets and looping aside). The killer aspect of the game is the best part of the game in my humble opinion finding survivors and killing them is so damn fun watching them try to find a pallet to stop you and then hitting them just before they can press the action button is hilarious and then watching as their friends attempt to save their friends in the basement which has dire consequences upon any survivor using the basement. My favorite killer in the game currently is The Legion not because they are broken, Or not because of their backstory (The backstory is nice). But i like them because its not a cliche killer they are an average sized human and not possesed or covered in mud or throws hatchets because they have an uncanny need to snipe people. No The Legion is just a group of 19 year olds who preforms acts of violence and honestly i love this they are so fun to play and their perks are crazy.\n\nBuy The Game when it goes on sale.\nPlay with friends if you like them.\nKILL OR BE KILLED.\nIts a good game overall no matter if you like to play survivors or killer.","timestamp_created":1548823445,"timestamp_updated":1548823445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48639379","author":{"steamid":"76561198158916574","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":17614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4578,"last_played":1638531872},"language":"koreana","review":"똥겜이라 욕은 매일 하지만 갓겜인걸.....","timestamp_created":1548822757,"timestamp_updated":1628608300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48639273","author":{"steamid":"76561198295330725","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":61436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19616,"last_played":1658620224},"language":"brazilian","review":"EDITADA PRA CARALHO 2, EU QUEBREI MINHA CADEIRA COM UM SOCO SÓ DEPOIS DE JOGAR 8 HORAS SEGUIDAS DESSA MERDA DE JOGO PUTA QUE PARIU COMO EU \nODEIO MINHA VIDA TOMARA QUE EU MORRA, RECOMENDO O JOGO PURA DIVERSÃO\n\nEDITADA PRA CARALHO, QUE COMUNIDADE TÓXICA DE MERDA É A MERDA MAIS TÓXICA QUE EXISTE VAI TOMAR NO CU\n\n\nEsse jogo é muito bom, a única coisa que eu tenho odiado é essa comunidade tóxica pra caralho até eu to virando tóxico de tanto que eu jogo.

Combinations of which turn even the worst player into a god among men regarding killers.\n\nThe killers are some of the best fun you will have, and mostly due to the fact that after dying to them 100 times the occasional play of them makes you feel the rush of having killed those other players that screwed up the generator 50 times in one go. \n\nPlaying the survivors is like hoping the other 3 players are not braindead lunatics or those special \"Meta Monsters\" who want to farm bloodpoints by breaking generators to fix them and being chased for the entire game just to ditch the monster on you so you can die in their place. \n\nI won't even try to talk about the toxicity of the community....","timestamp_created":1548821820,"timestamp_updated":1548821820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48639001","author":{"steamid":"76561198800660744","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1577502212},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная но иногда попадаются нубики которые портят игру или уьийцы которые делают всякую хуйню\n","timestamp_created":1548820831,"timestamp_updated":1548820831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48638931","author":{"steamid":"76561198428844708","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":227498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112985,"last_played":1658334280},"language":"german","review":"Toxic and Salty Survivor and Tryhard Killers Love it","timestamp_created":1548820387,"timestamp_updated":1548820387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y/K4zugCc73FuQE="}
