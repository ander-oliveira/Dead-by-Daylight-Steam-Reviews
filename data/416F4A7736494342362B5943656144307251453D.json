It´s a blast to play with friends or Solo if you don´t have anything else to do. I do have some cons though that I will write out down below.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to start, Hard to master (which I really like)\n-Very well optimized in most cases\n-Really fun to play with friends or solo\n-A WIDE variety of fun perks both for killer and survivor/victim which all does pretty different stuff\n-Fun events during Halloween, Christmas, Summer etc\n\nCons:\n-The game´s hitbox on survivor/victim is VERY weird, the killer can literally hit you through walls and/or Pallets sometimes\n-Lack of \"advanced graphics settings\" (specified in \"Conclusion\")\n\n\nConclusion:\nDead by Daylight is a very fun game to play with friends when you don´t have too much to do since it´s very easy to just jump in and play a couple of matches.\n\nAlso I like to have the opportunity to change specific graphic settings which you can´t do what so ever at the moment apart from fullscreen/windowed and V-Sync. But other than that I really enjoy my time in Dead by Daylight and I can still really recommend it if you´re into 1v4 games :D\n\n\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1541218979,"timestamp_updated":1575390590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45594783","author":{"steamid":"76561198395397080","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1603602188},"language":"koreana","review":"ang \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc'ex\n","timestamp_created":1541218117,"timestamp_updated":1541218117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45594469","author":{"steamid":"76561198864519093","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":15052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":132,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1660324804},"language":"tchinese","review":"很好玩!!","timestamp_created":1541216345,"timestamp_updated":1541216345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45594433","author":{"steamid":"76561198259413249","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1563345257},"language":"koreana","review":"개꿀잼","timestamp_created":1541216212,"timestamp_updated":1541216212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45594249","author":{"steamid":"76561198382533430","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1825,"playtime_at_review":6749,"last_played":1660545092},"language":"english","review":"this game is a real shit fest if u are scared of spoopy stuff but if ur not this game is really good","timestamp_created":1541215203,"timestamp_updated":1541215203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511278212070465088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45594113","author":{"steamid":"76561198867124579","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2159,"last_played":1653808305},"language":"tchinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1541214578,"timestamp_updated":1541214578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45594061","author":{"steamid":"76561198208365645","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1400,"playtime_at_review":3408,"last_played":1660524777},"language":"brazilian","review":"TEM O MICO MIÈRS","timestamp_created":1541214260,"timestamp_updated":1541214260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45593882","author":{"steamid":"76561198090893669","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":22830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13988,"last_played":1637459747},"language":"english","review":"I fucking hate this game.\n\n[spoiler] Buff Freddy.

I picked it up anyway.\n\nI'm glad I did.\n\n[h1]Toxicity[/h1]\n\nIn terms of toxicity, yes, it can be toxic at times, though I don't normally see toxic players very often. Really, it IS a online game, so you will certainly see toxic players. That's just life. When I DO see toxic players, they're toxic in such bizarre ways it is almost entertaining. Most toxic players I've seen are toxic towards their teammates, oddly enough. Sure, some will hate on the killer, but most toxic players will do one of two things: If they survive, they'll insult those who died, no matter how they died. If they die, they'll get enraged and insult the team for leaving them to die, again regardless of if it was even possible to save them or not. If it's a toxic killer, then most people won't really care either way. If they killer is camping someone, then everyone else can basically win, or the person who is getting camped will normally just leave. No point in staying if the killer is like that, spend your time with better players. Toxic survivors also often leave the game instantly after they get caught, messing up the rest of the team.\n\nSlightly rarer than toxic players are the nice players. They'll actually have a civil conversation after the match, talking about risky escapes, nice plays, that sort of stuff with the killer. Players who are civil like this make the game go from good to great. If you're this type of player, I love you. Sometimes killers are nice too. For example, if a toxic player leaves, it sets everyone else back. If the killers nice, which happens sometimes, they'll let the survivors get caught up to a reasonable point before continuing the match.\n\nMost people, however, fall into a neutral category. They aren't toxic, but they aren't nice either. Most of them won't actually care to discuss the match after all is said and done and they'll display some mixture of toxic and nice behaviours.\n\nTL;DR - As far as I've played, it's not as toxic as most multiplayer games out there.\n\n[h1]Balance & Bugs[/h1]\n\nI have yet to notice anything too broken. Bugs exist, but I rarely encounter them. The only one that I notice somewhat frequently is the interaction button and combat buttons getting stuck. Makes it hard to kill or escape sometimes. There is also lag every so often, which most people seem to encounter at some point during game sessions.\n\nIn terms of balance, it is a bit unbalanced. I don't view this as a negative, however. It should be difficult to be a survivor. It should technically be easier to be the killer. It seems to me that it is.\n\nA really good killer is a brutal opponent. If they're toxic, it's terrible, but a nice, yet effective killer is a joy to play against. Killers seem to be, in my experience as both a killer and survivor, somewhat easy to learn, but hard to master.\n\nThat being said, some killers are VERY difficult to face. Whether due to skill or just the killer themselves, they're nightmares to face. Even in over fifty hours, there are some killers I still haven't won a match against, such as the Doctor and the Nightmare.\n\nAs a killer, it can be very difficult to start off. The killers perks are new, strategies are different and each has a different power. Expect to lose a lot when starting as a killer. Though, with time and practise, killers become MUCH easier.\n\nIn total, I think that killers have won maybe 80-90% of the matches I've played, not including when I was brand new. Killers have a large advantage, but it's not a unreasonable one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIn the end, I'm very pleased with this game. There are lots of different killers, such as classic killers, like the Shape, as well as more original killers like the Nurse. There's a killer to suit many different play styles, as well as survivors for however you want to try to survive. It's unbalanced, but both sides generally get a fair chance. The game isn't terribly toxic, nor broken and when it's good, it's [i]good[/i].","timestamp_created":1541211946,"timestamp_updated":1543172372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45593351","author":{"steamid":"76561198855065101","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1658626809},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito legal e bom","timestamp_created":1541210010,"timestamp_updated":1541210010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45593151","author":{"steamid":"76561198209758691","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2325,"last_played":1626562279},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo com uma proposta de um verdadeiro trabalho em equipe, que estimula a empatia e a amizade.

Sim. Balanceamento ideal? Não. Comunidade Tóxica? Sim. Mas quem liga se te trará momentos hilários e tensos? A ideia do jogo é genial, colocar 4 sobreviventes com vantagens diferentes de cada um e estratégias diferentes em uma floresta junto com um assassino que também utiliza de táticas diferentes, sendo que cada assassino tem uma habilidade que se diferencia dos outros. Se você realmente quer melhorar no jogo, deve jogar MUITO para conquistar as melhorias dos sobreviventes e assassinos.\nO jogo é bem tenso dependendo do que você for enfrentar, além de ter que saber o que fazer para enfrentar cada coisa, isso se aplica aos sobreviventes e assassinos. Sinceramente, o gráfico não importa, jogabilidade boa, mas tem seus erros de vez em quando, não seja um sobrevivente chorão que reclama de um assassino camper, é só uma das estratégias do jogo, afinal, ganhar com um sobrevivente não significa fugir do local, mas sim fazer uma boa partida, reparando geradores, ajudando outros jogadores, distrair o assassino para ganhar tempo, isso tudo conta.\nComo assassino, não fique triste se alguns escaparem ou TODOS, é só um aviso para você melhorar seu estilo de jogo ou mecânica. Não há bugs frequentes, em alguns dias não encontrei nada ainda.\nO jogo em si tem uma temática boa, não precisa gastar mais do que o jogo para ser melhor, mas uma crítica é de que os assassinos e sobreviventes de DLCs são pagos com uma quantia razoável se comparar com o preço do jogo, há como obter dentro do game, mas é MUITO demorado o processo, os Pontos Iridescentes são usados para comprar eles, para conseguir os pontos é necessário o UP de level, você ganha uns 164 por level, você precisa em média jogar 4 partidas até o final para upar, os personagens são 9000 cada.\nResumindo:\nJunte seus amigos porque não precisa de um PC DA NASA para rodar o game, o preço do jogo é barato e agradável, lhe garante muito tempo de jogo e de diversão!
