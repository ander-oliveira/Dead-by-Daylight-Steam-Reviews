I love watching youtubers and streamers play it, but i truly wonder how they can stand some of the absolate garbage nonsense involved, and often my only answer is that its because they go into Kill your friends, where they don't have to deal with an abhorent and toxic community alongside the continuously dissolving mechanics.","timestamp_created":1479779599,"timestamp_updated":1503451618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26740109","author":{"steamid":"76561198193488946","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1658088746},"language":"spanish","review":"Pay2Win.","timestamp_created":1479778458,"timestamp_updated":1479778458,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507275164127349854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26739986","author":{"steamid":"76561197984596618","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":158796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4708,"playtime_at_review":27635,"last_played":1660600443},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely love this game.

Erinnert mich ein bisschen an \"The Forest\".\nManche Killer/Survivor Perks sind absolut mächtig und andere unglaublich nutzlos. Sodass quasi jeder mit Sprintboost, Eiserner Griff, Niemand entrinnt dem Tod, Adrenalin, Saboteur etc. durch die Gegend läuft.\n\nFallensteller / Michael Jacks- äh Myers sind der absolute Top Trend aktuell. Einer ist sogar noch Pay2Play...meh. (1/3 des gesamten Spielpreises nochmal oben drauf für einen einzigen Killer+Survivor - läuft - zumindest in der Kasse!)\nDie kürzlichen Patches haben ebend dies nochmal verschlimmert. Früher konnte man einen Survivor vom Haken holen, und trat danach in die Falle konnte aber vom \"Enthakten\" direkt befreit werden. Das kostete zwar Zeit und Blut aber es war möglich. Nun cancelt die Falle aber die Enthak-Aktion. An sich wäre das ein schlichter Buff für den Fallensteller, aber das Problem ist: Viele Survivor die nun logischerweise erst versuchen die Falle zu entschärfen und denn zu enthaken, können dies ganz einfach nicht tun, da beides vom selben Bottun ausgelöst wird. Folglich darf man sekundenlang rumprobieren, bis die Falle sich anbietet als Aktion. Das ist in einem Spiel indem es bei sowas um Bruchteile von Sekunden geht äußerst....bescheuert.\n\nDa kommen wir gleich zum nächsten Punkt: Camper! Wir alle kennen und lieben sie NICHT!\nAls Killer beim aufgehakten Survivor zu campen ist Standard, und leider auch äußerst erfolgreich, obendrein ist es sehr kontraproduktiv für das Gameplay. Die Mitspieler versuchen meist garnicht erst andere zu retten, in der Annahme: Er wird sowieso dort Campen - Teamwork? Ade!\nWenn es doch jemand versucht, so gibt es einfach einen Survivor der für kurze Zeit keinen Generator bearbeitet. Vorteil für den Freund des Campings!\nDas geht inzwischen soweit, dass ich Survivor sehe, die nicht becampt werden, aber nicht gerettet werden, einfach weil die Annahme trotzdem besteht. Verdient, denn auf 9 /10 Killer trifft das zu. Dafür blamen kann man die Spieler nicht, es funktioniert ja. Das nichts dagegen getan wird, dass ist das eigentliche Problem.\n\nSelbiges Problem bestand vor einigen Wochen noch bei den Paletten und Fenstern über die die Survivor hüpfen können...immer und immer wieder! Und es funktionierte und die Killer waren entbrannt vor Wut, warum die Survivor solche billigen Tricks verwenden. Auch hier gilt: Was funktioniert ist erlaubt!\nAber um dieses Problem wurde sich ja immerhin gekümmert.\n\nNoch mehr? Ohja!\nKiller bekommen deutlich leichter Blutpunkte, und können dadurch wesentlich leichter ihren Rang verbessern.\nEs kann vorkommen, dass ein Killer von 4 Leuten nicht einen killt, und bekommt trotzdem 10.000 Punkte und damit einen Pip.\nEs lohnt sich also Killer zu spielen, um denn die verdienten Punkte bei Survivor XYZ zubenutzen.\nLeider ist das Killer-Gameplay sehr viel langweiliger als das Spielen des Überlebenden, darum besteht akuter Mangel von Killern. Beachtlich, wenn man überlegt, dass auf 4 Überlebende nur 1 Killer angesetzt wird.\nHierbei kommt es mit dem legendären Matchmaking sogar gelegentlich dazu, dass 4 Survivor auf Rang 20 mit einem Killer auf Rang 1 verkuppelt werden. Diese brauchen oft nicht mal Perks ausrüsten, und rasieren ihre Gegner trotzdem mühelos.\n\nNun mal zusammengefasst.\n\nPro:\n- sehr spaßiges Gameplay, vorallen mit Freunden\n- Grafik zwar nicht topaktuell, aber trotzdem bringt es Atmosphäre\n- Große Auswahl an verschiedenen Items, Add-Ons, Perks, Opfergaben\n- Charakter ist personalisierbar\n\nNeutral:\n- Auswahl von Überlebenden und Killern ist eher Mau\n- Kartenauswahl ist noch relativ gering\n\nContra:\n- ziemlich buggy\n- sehr unbalanced\n- Matchmaking ist nicht existent\n- Teile der Kleidung oder spielbare Charaktere sind nur als DLC erwerblich, obwohl es am Spiel selbst noch ungemein viel zu verbessern gibt\n- während sich Killer in ihrer Sekundärwaffe unterschieden, sind die Survivor identisch, bis auf 3 spezifische Perks\n- Gelegentliche Abstürze\n- Killermangel von Zeit zu Zeit\n- Unter Umständen enorm lange Wartezeiten bis eine Lobby gefunden wird\n\nWarum ich es dennoch empfehle?\nEin Spiel, welches es schafft mir manchmal Freude zu bereiten trotz sovieler Fehler, hat dennoch irgendwie eine Empfehlung verdient.\nAllerdings mit Vorsicht zu genießen!","timestamp_created":1479776442,"timestamp_updated":1479776442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579310297966003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26738502","author":{"steamid":"76561198041422467","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":7043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4528,"last_played":1624072076},"language":"french","review":"Fun à plusieurs, même si la hitbox pue un peu ^^","timestamp_created":1479767664,"timestamp_updated":1479767664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506578981876373291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26737975","author":{"steamid":"76561198294938179","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1493479737},"language":"italian","review":"Ragazzi ho appena scaricato il gioco ma mi da un problema , mi dice \n\n\nSEI STATO DISCONNESSO DAL SERVER PER UN PROBLEMA DI VALIDAZIONE DEL TUO ACCOUNT ATTRAVERSO EASYANTICHEAT ( CODICE D ERRORE 1) \n\nMa come è possibile una cosa del genere?

Deliver a good hunt as a killer or (don't) risk your life for your friends or strangers as a survivor. A skilled killer combined with good teamwork among the survivors can create a very tense game that makes you smash that spectate button immediately after dying, cheering for your mates.\n\nUnfortunately, the game experience can be ruined e.g. by camping killers which take away the challenge of getting out alive as a survivor - if you or a team mate get camped hard, there is not much you can do except for rushing through the game. This spoils the tension of sneaky hiding (that moment when the killer walks right past you...) as well as escaping the killer or rescuing your hooked / downed teammates.\n\nThe devs are more and more adressing greater issues like matchmaking. Unlike in the past, waiting times in order to find a game are not much of a problem by now as well as imbalances in the matched players' ranks. On the other hand, some bugs are merely replaced by new ones. I'm loving the new content but in some cases, I would also like previously released content to be extended before delivering new one. For example, further DLC-map variations: There is only one asylum and Haddonfield map whereas other locations offer more variations.\nOverall, the DBD-team is working on giving us a better game experience, so I recommend getting the game.","timestamp_created":1479731712,"timestamp_updated":1479731712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26729744","author":{"steamid":"76561198027298998","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":153230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":426,"playtime_at_review":61415,"last_played":1660574452},"language":"russian","review":"Кроче дело было так все сурвы кроме меня слились за секунду я как правило в соло починил 2 геника отсалься я с маном 1 на 1 возле люка я ему машу приседаю он ни в какую и тут мне резко захотело посрать я думаю пох пусть убивает крч сижу минут 20 в толче прихожу а ман стоит и кемпт люк я такой наверно он тоже нах всё послал и просто чилит в ютабе или ещё где пытаюсь прыгнуть в люк а он ЛОВИТ МЕНЯ ебать тут маны ненавидят сурвов что ждут их по 20 минут у люка это просто  10/10","timestamp_created":1479729897,"timestamp_updated":1543695412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491329461336135864","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26729253","author":{"steamid":"76561198015541190","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":23071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7806,"last_played":1635878564},"language":"russian","review":"Если вы любитель классических слешеров в духе пятницы 13,хеллоуин и тд,эта игра точно для вас.Отдельного внимания заслуживают убийцы,каждый из которых является своеобразной отсылкой к убийцам из слешеров,тут вам и кивок в сторону техаской резней бензопилой и майкл майерс добавленный кстати на хеллоуин и убийцы на сверхестественную тематику.\nКонцепция-популярный нынче ассимитричный мультиплеер 4 против одного,причем в отличии от того же Evolve реализован он интересно и опыт поистине уникальный за каждую сторону,реализован геймплей к слову по принципу травоядных и хищников,тоесть выжившие имеют лучший обзор и способны прятаться,а убийцы расчитаны на преследованиеи самое главное ощущения абсолютно разные,не малую роль в формировании которых играет роль саундтрек.Место в игре найдется как любителям поиграть вместе с друзьями в команде,так и одиночкам которые предпочитают полагаться только на себя.

The new map that came with the halloween dlc is small which is fine but they put the same amount of hooks from the other maps in the small map, this makes it very hard to not get caught by the hunter. (3). I've noticed that hunters ranging from rank 1 - rank 20 have been camping the runners when on the hooks, this is making the game not fun anymore. when the hunters are camping they should have a penalty to some degree. (4). The hunters that camp and hook the last person want to get rid of \"Survive with Friends\" .  If this happens then it will almost make the game impossible to play with friends.

But without getting way into details about that let me tell you that this game is REALLY fun when you're paired up with some friends. The lack of in-game communication while in game as a survivor has it's ups and downs, but that sometimes makes the games much more intense. The characters are also really lovable,  giving each character more of a role based gameplay at the EARLY GAME (such as healers, saboteurers and so on) with character speciffic perks is a good thing but in the late game you've probably unlocked all of the perks so that the other survivors can use them aswell. Making the characters role based early on gives the player a chance to easily learn the basics and what each character specifies itself as, and each character has their own individual progression so you could be max level on one survivior whilst being level 1 on another. Each character also has their own individual \"storage\" meaning that items are saved on the characters instead of the account (same as the levels) so that you may have different items on different survivors. Before the match you create a loadout of items and addons aswell as perks and offerings to bring into the fog, these all affect how the match is going to play out and where having different locations each having a connection with the killers. Items, perks and offerings can be obtained from the progression system but you could also find an item during the match and if you successfully escape with it adds it to that characters \"storage\".  And for the killers it's basically the same, with each killer having different abilities (aswell as perks) makes for some diverse gameplay. HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME. I fell in love with it during the beta phase and I have never lost any passion for it, this game is great for playing alone but even better when playing with friends!

The first aspect is said very lightly in terms of enjoying it  because that can easily be broken. The lagswitching, abuse and issues in this game especially hitreg turn this from being remotely fun to a complete disaster. I play the game as a killer main but also only really because I already bought it so might as well play it. It is enjoyable in short bursts but thinking this game is a good job or anything of a finished product is a far fetched dream. It has its moments of fun if you like playing your movie killers/ survivors then by all means get the game and DLC on sale but be prepared for the issues that will come alongside it and the long grind you will have to endure. I don't recommend this game for new people because it is not for casual players looking to \"win\" its just moreso you tried. There is no reward for high ranks or playing for a long time. Essentially its just putting out the next overpowered killer and squashing bugs at a snail's pace. Actually i think a snail can code and bug squash faster than they can.
