Игра на данный момент одна из самых лучших развивающихся игр в стиме: разработчики постоянно работают над введением нового контента, фиксом багов и т.п. Стоит только зайти, немного разобраться в игре, ознакомится со способностями, с прокачкой персонажа, с самими персонажами и тебя просто затянет в неё. Здесь настолько много вариаций, можно сделать сборку исключительно под себя, под свой стиль игры, что огромнейший плюс! \nГрафика для 2016 года вполне неплохая, на ультрах радует глаза. Да и на минимальных настройках очень даже хорошо.\nОнлайн постоянно растёт и за 3 года существования этой игры - не просел. \nКоличество маньяков и количество выживших тут увеличивается и увеличивается, хотя стоит отметить, что есть пару не особо играбельных персонажей, но опять же, на вкус и цвет. Кто-то за них может выдавать такое, что никому не снилось,  поэтому это индивидуально.\nКонечно же, как и во всех играх, в этой присутствуют свои минусы. Сервера не совсем уж идеальные. Хоть я не сталкивался ни разу с проблемой серверов, но многие игроки жалуются на это. Также есть токсичные игроки, которые, например, за маньяка будут только одного тебя щемить до конца игры, пока не помрёшь, будут стоять и не давать спасти с того же крюка, что очень сильно не нравится многим игрокам. Но опять же, из-за огромного количества вариаций, это можно вполне законтролить(способностями выживших). Ещё малюсенький такой минус, так это долгий поиск игры за маньяка(от 2 до 10 минут, в зависимости от рангов). Бывают и такие себе патчи, ну а где без них? и такое бывает. Но плюсы перевешивают минусы в несколько раз и желание играть не пропадает.\nЕсли возникает какая-либо проблема, можно обратится в поддержку прямо в игре и они обязательно помогут, не забьют.\nВходной порог в игру на высочайшем уровне. С самого начала доступны 3 выживших с отличными способностями, да и маньяки тоже. Донат не решает. Достаточно купить игру и уже будешь чувствовать себя комфортно! \"донатных\" персонажей можно покупать за внутриигровую валюту, которая копится не особо тяжко.\nВ общем, советую игру: очень классная, постоянно развивается, хороший онлайн, графика, геймплей и техническая поддержка!","timestamp_created":1574807745,"timestamp_updated":1574807745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.652405679225921631","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57994758","author":{"steamid":"76561198197926066","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":123792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":195,"playtime_at_review":66233,"last_played":1660123032},"language":"spanish","review":"buenardo","timestamp_created":1574807721,"timestamp_updated":1574807721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57994643","author":{"steamid":"76561198249790294","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":135974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":58,"playtime_at_review":74173,"last_played":1660401583},"language":"portuguese","review":"Pretty good job so far!","timestamp_created":1574807699,"timestamp_updated":1606407949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57993544","author":{"steamid":"76561198303416638","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":29029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":20812,"last_played":1659721089},"language":"english","review":"Fix Rank & internet problem . . give me another reward besides \"prestige\" after we finish level max survivor or killer","timestamp_created":1574807453,"timestamp_updated":1574807453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57993419","author":{"steamid":"76561198146915164","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":51667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32436,"last_played":1658148053},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna gra do wspólnego grania ze znajomymi :)","timestamp_created":1574807426,"timestamp_updated":1574807426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57993285","author":{"steamid":"76561198076811289","num_games_owned":833,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":14378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13532,"last_played":1637789008},"language":"russian","review":"Найс! 10 блинков Нюрсы из 10","timestamp_created":1574807396,"timestamp_updated":1637788772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462838798761367798","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57992982","author":{"steamid":"76561198084729694","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":379621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370512,"last_played":1658256975},"language":"german","review":"Macht immer noch Spaß nach all der Zeit, am meisten natürlich mit Freunden.","timestamp_created":1574807329,"timestamp_updated":1637950415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jpv11O4CdvGc3QE="}
