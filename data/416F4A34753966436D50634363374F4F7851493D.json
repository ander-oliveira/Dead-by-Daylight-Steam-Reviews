Killers have way more advantages than survivors which leads to game being unbalanced.\n2. Game has a lot of bugs that can cause unfair advantages for opponent team.\n3. Ranking system in this game is illogical. One game You will play with ranks that are way lower than Yours, the other game You will play with ranks that are way higher than Yours. As well ranking up is so easy, just farm and that's it- No skill no pain- just gain.\n4. The community is way more toxic than in other games. If You consider games like LOL and CS as toxic community games, You are wrong. This is on the next level- there is almost no games without flame players at the end. As well people playing without any respect for others.\n5. If You consider Yourself tryharding in this game, don't play survivor- play only killer. It will be a lot easier for You to learn and be good at it.\n\nPS. If you are a Killer main, don't even talk, because You don't know how hard is to be a survivor.","timestamp_created":1611481626,"timestamp_updated":1611481626,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449826985597610474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85256492","author":{"steamid":"76561197980576579","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":38993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1538,"playtime_at_review":7048,"last_played":1660589938},"language":"english","review":"Game is so ridiculously imbalanced it's a joke.

Absolutely wonderful game, although it could use some balancing in certain aspects that's for sure. For example; the hooks in my opinion are far too many in such close proximity. Being a killer main myself, i find this to be just a little too easy and would like further challenge through some well spaced hooks. Another being the balancing of certain killers, as their lunges are either far too long or not nearly enough. A prime example would be Freddy. I understand that in the movies he could stretch his arms to profound distances, but seeing as this is not in the game as a perk itself I believe his lunge could be shortened.

I play it almost every day, 10/10 recommend it.","timestamp_created":1611469148,"timestamp_updated":1629482321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248978","author":{"steamid":"76561199052762975","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1657357568},"language":"english","review":"This game is great if you want to die\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1611469113,"timestamp_updated":1626933909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248957","author":{"steamid":"76561198363305382","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2947,"last_played":1615127547},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩真的","timestamp_created":1611469080,"timestamp_updated":1611469080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248398","author":{"steamid":"76561198992349994","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1399,"last_played":1655774169},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito top as vezes vc leva um susto com o nada kkk","timestamp_created":1611468179,"timestamp_updated":1611468179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248367","author":{"steamid":"76561199019199245","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1611468404},"language":"turkish","review":",","timestamp_created":1611468131,"timestamp_updated":1611468131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248343","author":{"steamid":"76561198799303105","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15633,"last_played":1658380556},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and interactive game.","timestamp_created":1611468086,"timestamp_updated":1611468086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248270","author":{"steamid":"76561198813617989","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2368,"last_played":1647746057},"language":"english","review":"waiting time are crazy long! but besides that is a  great game to play with friends","timestamp_created":1611467958,"timestamp_updated":1611467958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248074","author":{"steamid":"76561198251207796","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1612069371},"language":"english","review":"lol","timestamp_created":1611467641,"timestamp_updated":1611467641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248073","author":{"steamid":"76561198350920241","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":44376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":18740,"last_played":1659667543},"language":"brazilian","review":"mto daora, mas tem que corrigir um monte de bugs que são muito chatos na hora de joga","timestamp_created":1611467637,"timestamp_updated":1611467637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85248048","author":{"steamid":"76561198219277139","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":10888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":55,"playtime_at_review":1994,"last_played":1660588091},"language":"english","review":"I've played this game for over 100 hours and have decided to update it based on my experience. I stand by my original statement that this game is best played in a custom lobby with 5 friends. The game itself is an interesting concept but the developers really don't know much about what they're doing. They haphazardly put things together and throw it at the player as new content.\n\nOn a surface level that sounds great. New content coming out regularly. However, these ideas mostly perks end up Meta or nerfed into a joke. Trickster just came out a month ago and it was just a mess and in a few weeks we get the Resident Evil DLC. So they release an underwhelming killer and now just abandoned it to work on something else.... Ok!\n\nMatchmaking is a joke as well. Apparently they're working on it. However at the recent rank reset (which in my opinion is a little too frequent) Experienced players got brought to the lowest rank. Other resets it put you in the highest rank level before reset. (Example: Finished in red, start the next \"season\" in 5 purple). Making the game disheartening to new players or casual players who don't fully understand the concept of the game.\n\nWhich brings me to the next problem. Learning how to play the game! The tutorial literally teaches you the bare minimum. Nothing on looping, scratch marks, did you know each survivor has different stats? I didn't until I saw a Youtube video about it. There's nothing in the manual about it. You're basically going to learn this game through trial and error. Hopefully you'll play against someone near your skill level so you won't just enjoy the game from spectate mode.\n\nOn the killer side they fixed decisive strike so it's not such a pain in the ass. As a killer to play somewhat competitively you're basically going to be running slow down perks a lot as the survivors only have one objective; which is to do generators. There is a side objective to do totems which as a killer these totems can be used by a perk called a hex. What's unfortunate about Hex's is that they're placed randomly sometimes they're placed so badly that you lose one of your perks in the first minute of the game. A nice solution would be to allow the killer to choose which totem becomes a hex by clicking on it or something. \n\nA bummer on the killers side is keys. If you're starting to win at mid game the survivors have an opportunity to win the game if less then 3 gens remain and they have a key to escape though hatch. In a way you can consider this a victory as a killer because you made them take the \"cowards\" way out but it's just disappointing tasting victory and seeing the survivors walk away with a get out of jail free card. However, regarding hatch, It's also ridiculous as a survivor who's at a disadvantage in a 1v1 to have a hatch shut on them and the only means of escape is a 50/50 shot at waiting by an exit gate and hoping the killer goes to the wrong one. You could technically find a key but it's not guaranteed.\n\nOn the survivors side, all you're predominately doing is generators and the odd hex/totem. That's it! that's you're objective. Running the killer to waste their time and saving teammates who fail to run the killer. Each character has their own set of perks and stats and their stats are basically how hard they breath when running or hurt. It's not explained to you anywhere so I'm telling you here.\n\nLast thing that people wonder is if this game is P2W the answer is No. It's pay for convenience. There's an area in the store section called Shrine of Secrets. Every Tuesday 2 killer perks and 2 survivor perks are posted which can be bought with a currency earned though game. Pretty much every perk has appeared once already. However, the one perk everyone wants called BBQ & Chilli rarely shows up but some something like borrowed time will show up 5 times in 7 weeks. They're aware of this as it's the main selling point for the Texas Chainsaw DLC.\n\nGame play wise: The rules are very loose. Personally I'm cool with most mechanics aside from what's known as Tunnelling. Which is when a killer just targets you to get you out of the game as fast as possible. There is a time and place for it. It's a great way to apply pressure. However it just understandably aggravates people. This game is suppose to be like a horror movie. Where you confront a villain, they mess you up and you get away to regroup and they come after you again. There's a perk called, \"Play with your food\" for Michael Myers. Which I would say is how the game should be played so that everyone can get the most enjoyment out of their time.\n\nSo, essentially I just bad mouthed this game for a few paragraphs and still recommend it. Why? I've had the most fun playing this game in a private lobby with 4 other friends. In that regard the game is fun. Since the developers have a very hands-off approach to the rules of the game. Playing with friends in a private lobby where everyone wants to have fun creates a lot of good times. When there's guidelines that are respected this game can be amazing.\n\nIf you're going to play by yourself. I recommend playing as a killer. In general, just show etiquette and don't Camp or Tunnel survivors. As survivors make an effort to unhook your teammates at endgame, don't wait for the killer to find you at the exit or hatch and sit there t-bagging. Just leave! If you're going to hide in the far corner of a map or in a locker waiting for your team to die to escape hatch find a different game to play.","timestamp_created":1611467594,"timestamp_updated":1622017618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85247586","author":{"steamid":"76561198196838082","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6336,"last_played":1644701841},"language":"english","review":"Great game to play with friends.
