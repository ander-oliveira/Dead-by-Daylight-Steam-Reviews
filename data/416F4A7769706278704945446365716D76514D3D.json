I am the kind of person who can barely play FNAF Security Breach because being chased terrifies me.\n\nHowever, this game is not... truly \"horror\".\n\nYes, the killers CAN be scary (I'm sorry my beloved Trickster but you're hot, not scary), but remember they are just people. Players, just like you. There are definitely builds that can make you get \"jumpscared\" (there are no jumpscares, EXCEPT Sadako's jumpscare in the menu lobby, where she jumps at the player, so turn her around and keep an eye on her if you're looking at her stuff), but usually you get some idea of when danger's around. Heartbeat means the big baddie of the match is coming to wreck you, and a few killers are either stealthy boys or invis boys, so keep a good eye out. The jumpscares really are just. \"oh sweet heck there's the killer\", so it's up to you if you can handle that. I really cannot, at least not currently.\n\nSo no, I don't play survivor. But I don't think this means the game was a bad purchase.\n\nIt does have glitches (I've encountered laggy players who've teleported around a little, throug no fault of their own, as well as just. bad hitboxes around select items like cars), but nothing that fundamentally makes the game unplayable.\n\nI am a \"killer main\", as the community calls it, and I've learned that the key to this game is just,, having a positive attitude. I haven't run into people who've been mean in chats, but I've had a couple of players who'll tease and taunt me in matches. And sure, it's a little annoying, but there will always be more matches. And if you need a break, take a break. Don't let other people ruin this game for you. There's always gonna be good players, and honestly sometimes it's really nice to just... let surviviors go when they've fought a good fight. I've done it plenty of times and it's honestly enjoyable to see how survivors react when they catch on that you're not trying to decimate them.\n\nIt's fun, and there's lots of opportunities to play what you want to play.\n\nHOWEVER, DLC. And online shops. No lootboxes, which is good, but if you're someone who struggles witht he temptation of purchasing all DLC, think about it. Buy what you will USE, and only that. Don't buy every killer if you only want to play one or two, don't buy every survivor if you only want a couple. Maybe it helps a lot with getting perks, and if that's worth it, then go for it. But don't feel you HAVE to buy everything.\n\nSo not a perfect game, but it's fun, and REMEMBER to try and stay positive and spread some joy to your fellow players, even if sometimes they're meanies.","timestamp_created":1654818091,"timestamp_updated":1654818091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116743133","author":{"steamid":"76561199058784433","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":30885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30882,"last_played":1657563639},"language":"english","review":"mhmmm","timestamp_created":1654816535,"timestamp_updated":1654816535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116742888","author":{"steamid":"76561199093473063","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":172,"playtime_at_review":1900,"last_played":1660092301},"language":"spanish","review":"ta weno","timestamp_created":1654816093,"timestamp_updated":1654816093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116742789","author":{"steamid":"76561199248861592","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":12023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":942,"playtime_at_review":1313,"last_played":1660519044},"language":"french","review":"Bon jeu !!","timestamp_created":1654815866,"timestamp_updated":1654815866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537622034549713135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116742290","author":{"steamid":"76561199135617356","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21441,"last_played":1656694878},"language":"brazilian","review":"GOSTEI DE TUDO !","timestamp_created":1654814747,"timestamp_updated":1654814747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116741822","author":{"steamid":"76561198806192248","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1658934773},"language":"english","review":"really good game lots of details","timestamp_created":1654813791,"timestamp_updated":1654813791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116741464","author":{"steamid":"76561199213758611","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":810,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1660581278},"language":"german","review":"am anfang ein bisschen verwirrend aber umso mehr man spielt und yt videos anguckt wird es besser","timestamp_created":1654813057,"timestamp_updated":1654813057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116741325","author":{"steamid":"76561198059756323","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":21457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21422,"last_played":1655065821},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1654812765,"timestamp_updated":1654812765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116741152","author":{"steamid":"76561198039572763","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":2034,"last_played":1659876439},"language":"english","review":"\"An unknown error has occurred.\" This entire game is an error.

De sobrevivente é sempre a mesma coisa: ficar 1 min parado fazendo gerador e quando finalmente entra em chase com o killer tem chance de você cair em 2 segundos por estar em uma deadzone sem nada pra se defender ou durar bastante na perseguição e ainda assim morrer no primeiro gancho, não daria pra saber oq vai rolar normalmente, mas é só observar o jeito que a partida tá indo que automaticamente todas as próximas partidas ficam previsíveis, as mesmas perks, as mesmas formas de jogar e conforme seu MMR sobe, os mesmos killers. De killer as coisas parecem mais dinâmicas e melhores, mas é aí que fui pego de surpresa pelo MMR e por variações absurdamente fortes de alguns mapas que só dependem de RNG. Imagina que divertido demorar cerca de 50% de um gerador só pra ir de um lado ao outro do mapa, isso acontece muito em MMR alto, com players mais experientes e que sabem fazer uma chase durar o máximo que conseguirem com os recursos que têm. Por isso, muita gente se vê obrigada a jogar de forma suja e completamente chata só pra conseguir o objetivo principal do killer: matar; camperar alguém no hook é comum em certas partidas e dependendo da situação, e às vezes até necessário contra um time de sobreviventes que estão bem organizados. Killer é definitavamente mais divertido que survivor, mas com o tempo e com mais tempo de jogo o jogador de assassino se vê obrigado a usar perks específicas pra evitar que uma partida dure 5min, em MMR mais alto grande parte dos jogadores joga com 4 perks de anti-gen que são sempre as mesmas e com um killer igualmente forte como blight, nurse e spirit, a atual forma de jogar de killer é basicamente um ctrl+c ctrl+v, o matchmaking atual não permite variações pra parte que joga há mais tempo e pra quem é mais novo no jogo isso vai ficando cada vez mais perceptível a cada partida.\n\nNo geral, é um bom jogo, mas o sistema de matchmaking em conjunto com a imutável forma de jogar, o meta de perks e de killers e o destino de uma partida ser determinada pelo RNG é completamente frustrante. Acontece poucas vezes, mas quando acontece de killer e survivor jogarem casualmente e tiverem espírito desportivo a partida provavelmente vai ser muito divertida. Eu daria uma nota 6/10, acho q o jogo exige demais dos players pra tentar consertar a quantidade de erros de design de gameplay que o próprio jogo deixa à mostra. Ah é, tem bugs ridículos também, mas da pra rir com eles.","timestamp_created":1654804567,"timestamp_updated":1654804567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116736254","author":{"steamid":"76561198321144882","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":89889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86000,"last_played":1658306446},"language":"english","review":"...","timestamp_created":1654804118,"timestamp_updated":1654804118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116736126","author":{"steamid":"76561199121989517","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1359,"playtime_at_review":809,"last_played":1659574639},"language":"german","review":"Dieses Spiel ist einfach toll:)","timestamp_created":1654803923,"timestamp_updated":1654803923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116736097","author":{"steamid":"76561198001417227","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":27359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1680,"playtime_at_review":12104,"last_played":1660368387},"language":"english","review":"first played back in 2016 - still playing when i get the urge\nglad to see improvements are still being made and new content is always being added\nprime example of fun and relatively balanced asymmetrical gameplay","timestamp_created":1654803869,"timestamp_updated":1654803869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116735493","author":{"steamid":"76561198960089239","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1060,"playtime_at_review":40126,"last_played":1660349210},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.
