Pendant très longtemps, il y avait des problèmes à ce niveau qui étaient évident, mais ce n'était clairement pas la priorité du studio de s'en occuper.\nAujourd'hui, ils écoutent leur communauté et ça fais super plaisir.\nAutre point positif, on a très souvent des ajouts de contenu, qui est souvent de qualité.\n\nNéanmoins, il y a des défauts dont il faut parler.\nPremièrement, la communauté est toxique, mais genre, vraiment toxique. League of Legends à côté c'est tranquille. Si jamais vous avez le malheur de tuer les survivants en jouant tueur (oui, c'est votre but), vous allez systématiquement (ou presque) vous faire insulter par ces derniers dans le chat après la game, voir même sur votre profil Steam (je vous invite à aller voir mon profil j'ai gardé les meilleurs commentaires c'est hilarant). Les rage quit sont fréquent des deux côtés, survivant comme tueur.\nDeuxièmement, vous aurez beau avoir une bonne connexion internet, c'est le tueur qui est l'hôte de la partie, et si sa connexion est instable, alors la partie sera le festival du bullsh*t (hitbox plus que douteuses, téléportation de votre personnage, actions qui ne se déclenches pas...). Le studio a annoncer qu'il va y avoir des serveurs dédiés, mais on ne sait pas quand. On attend ça avec impatience.\nEt enfin, il faut souligner une politique commerciale à vomir. Des skins à 10 euros ? Sérieusement ? C'est plus cher qu'un DLC de deux personnages, et c'est la moitié du prix du jeu, c'est du gros foutage de gueule, personne n'en parle et vu qu'on croise sans arrêt des joueurs avec des skins, c'est que ça se vend bien mais moi je trouve ça scandaleux. J'espère au moins qu'ils investissent tout cet argent dans les serveurs.\n\nPour conclure, je vous recommande tout de même ce jeu, qui est très fun, encore plus si vous y joué avec des potes, et dont la communauté s'agrandit de jour en jour.","timestamp_created":1520302035,"timestamp_updated":1554332122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495412856340408325","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40598042","author":{"steamid":"76561197963934321","num_games_owned":801,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":825714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19507,"last_played":1574949982},"language":"english","review":":)))))))))))))))))))))","timestamp_created":1520301670,"timestamp_updated":1520301670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40597374","author":{"steamid":"76561198790308863","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":230,"playtime_at_review":584,"last_played":1660397435},"language":"thai","review":" - สนุกกับการได้หนี \n- มีการอัพเดสที่ดี\n- ช่วยกุด้วยยยยย\n- xD","timestamp_created":1520298423,"timestamp_updated":1520298423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40596536","author":{"steamid":"76561198212116504","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":8919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6316,"last_played":1647143192},"language":"latam","review":"Este es un Juego de \"Terror\" en el que 4 supervivientes se las apañan para reparar 5 generadores y escapar por las puertas de salida, por otro lado, cada partida cuenta con el asesino (fundamental, obviamente) el cual los persigue para incapacitarlos, y luego colgarlos de un gancho como ropa.\n\n La Idea es bastante buena en sí, y es bastante entretenido ya que es desafiante, ya que si eres superviviente no puedes andar a \"saco\" (ya que te encontraran fácilmente), y si eres asesino, tienes una visión reducida por lo que te puede costar encontrar a los supervivientes.\n\nIntentaré ser lo más objetivo posible:\n---------------PROS:\n-Innovador\n-Buena jugabilidad, ya que es fácil de jugar\n-Entretenido, ya que perseguir survivors, o escapar del asesino lo es\n-Mapas variados\n-Supervivientes variados\n-Asesinos variados\n-Y un largo etc\n\n-----------------CONTRAS\n-LOS DESARROLLADORES\n\n¿Por qué los desarrolladores?\n-La gente se queja de los camperos, y van los señores desarrolladores y añaden asesinos CAMPEROS (bruja, el cerdo).

Qué pasa, no balancean.\n-LOS BUGS; se cierra el juego, se pega en la pantalla de carga, etc, AÚN NO LOS SOLUCIONAN.\n-EL MATCHMAKING; no está pulido;  por ejemplo, el juego toma a 4 jugadores latinoamericanos y los exparce en 4 hosts; 2 de cada 4 host es europeo o de un país MUY lejano, por lo cual hay un ping muy alto: aquí es cuando quedan 4 jugadores exparcidos; en vez de llenar 1 host latinoamericano y comenzar a jugar, hay 4 jugadores distribuidos, los cuales tienen que esperar 12 jugadores más para empezar.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nMe dió x entrar a jugar nuevamente, y la verdad sigue siendo lo mismo; a la vez que te topas con partidas MUY BUENAS te encuentras con un montón de partidas malas a causa de lo desbalanceado que está el juego, y no, no es x que sea manco, siempre saco sobre 16000 puntos, y tengo buen rango\n PD: Mantengo mi opinión, cuando lo balanceen la cambiaré.","timestamp_created":1520294410,"timestamp_updated":1546740642,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622856378555297852","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40596402","author":{"steamid":"76561198136864447","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1645937832},"language":"english","review":"Neat And Fun Game To Play!","timestamp_created":1520293827,"timestamp_updated":1520293827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516728579998016357","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40595628","author":{"steamid":"76561198043605103","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":65746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27241,"last_played":1643438123},"language":"english","review":"fav","timestamp_created":1520290057,"timestamp_updated":1520290057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40595129","author":{"steamid":"76561198258318760","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2788,"last_played":1588623417},"language":"romanian","review":"Futuvan gat de ofensati astia care ati dat recenzii negative)))","timestamp_created":1520287944,"timestamp_updated":1520287944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40594837","author":{"steamid":"76561198071133760","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17007,"last_played":1655044533},"language":"russian","review":"Супер Игра !","timestamp_created":1520286723,"timestamp_updated":1520286723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40594468","author":{"steamid":"76561198380670564","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":25038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16929,"last_played":1642270083},"language":"danish","review":"As long as you don't get camped or tunneled is fun","timestamp_created":1520285360,"timestamp_updated":1520285360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40594329","author":{"steamid":"76561198067561022","num_games_owned":721,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":182176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":39,"playtime_at_review":69822,"last_played":1659465076},"language":"english","review":"The Devs have finally taken steps toward balancing the game properly.

I enjoyed it (mostly as survivor), but for some reason it didn’t stick with me. I tried it again out of boredom in November of 2017 and I don’t know what’s changed, but it somehow has its hooks in me (no pun intended).\n\nAs such, this review is based on the current version of the game, and I can’t speak to how it was in the past, especially before the legacy cosmetics from the old, grindy bloodweb. It’s also primarily from the survivor viewpoint, as I’d say 70 of my (currently) 83 hours are from survivor gameplay.\n\n[b]If you want to check out some gameplay, watch some of my highlights here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Fk2rNSqcc[/b]\n\nOverall, I’m impressed and quite like [i]Dead By Daylight[/i]. It is equal parts tense, frightening, frustrating, and what-the-hell inducing.\n\nAs the survivor, your job is to repair enough generators with your team to power doors, which you then need to open to escape and survive the match. As the killer, your job is to stop them from repairing those generators and therefore stop them from escaping.\n \nSurvivors and killers can both equip themselves with various perks and offerings, which make your job easier. For example, survivors can equip a sprint burst that gives them a big burst of speed to try to lose the killer, and killers can equip a perk that lets them see survivors whenever they injure one. There are a ton of various combinations.\n\nLeveling up is accomplished by filling out a blood web. Bloodpoints are earned to your account regardless of who you play as, so you could use your highest level character with the best perks to grind points and then level up your other characters.\n\nGraphically, the game looks good. The environments are both dark and creepy, and there’s lot of little details in pretty much every aspect of the world. Sound plays a huge role, as you’ll be able to figure out where the killer is and which side they’re coming from, potentially giving you that extra few seconds you need to escape. The core gameplay loop doesn’t ever change (repair gens > rescue friends > escape or kill people), but it somehow remains fun.\n\nAssuming you own all the DLC, there is a large amount of survivors and killers to level. The max level is 50, but you can prestige three times, making the unofficial level cap 200. The game will keep you playing for a long time if you choose to.\n\nOn the flip side, bugs. There are countless bugs that BHVR (the developer) seem to not give a damn about. You’ll join a lobby and despite only three of four people being ready, the game somehow starts, and the scoreboard at the end will only show you. Or there are a ton of visual bugs, such as your rank never changing despite you earning enough points to warrant it.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the game uses peer-to-peer matchmaking, and it’s always the killer that acts as host, so you’re at the mercy of a killer who may be in the middle of nowhere, or stuck on 20 year old dialup and refuses to update. This also leads to many types of disconnection issues, to which there is no recourse. You use an expensive offering and the killer disconnects before the match even starts? Oh well, screw you.\n\nBHVR has stated that it’s a “complex” and “involved” issue to figure out how to punish disconnections, but if they had used dedicated servers, it wouldn’t be an issue. Unfortunately, they chose not to spend the money so now they’re in a “oh well, we’re too lazy to figure it out kthx” position. Sadly this does not seem to ever be something that will change, and therefore will always be the biggest issue with the game.\n\nMy second biggest issue is, as survivors, you cannot see who the killer is, but the killer can see your name. So, BHVR basically protects the killer against survivors who may recognize them as someone who camps or plays in a way they disagree with, forcing them into a game and either dealing with it, or leaving the match and incurring a penalty.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list][*]Super fun gameplay loop that keeps you on your toes\n[*]Tense gameplay\n[*]Surprising amount of variety for what the game is\n[*]Lots of survivors and killers to fully level\n[*]Enough map selection and random placement of items to keep the game fresh\n[*]Great licensed DLC (Nightmare On Elm Street, SAW, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween)\n[*]Tons of various loadout and perk combinations to keep the game fresh\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*]Ridiculous amount of bugs\n[*]Fairly inattentive developer who focuses more on DLC and streams than actually fixing any issues, especially those that have been around since launch\n[*]Peer-to-peer matchmaking\n[/list]\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nIf you like horror and tense multiplayer gaming, you’ll love [i]Dead By Daylight[/i].
