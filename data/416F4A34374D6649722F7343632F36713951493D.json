The game offers 24 Killers to choose from with each Killer having their own unique abilities to master, there 27 survivors in Dead By Daylight to choose from with their own unique abilities as well. Now the Addons, the Perks, the game offers a \"Bloodweb\" skill tree mechanic that allows you use \"Bloodpoints\" for the Bloodweb. Bloodpoints are earned by completing \"Trials\" whether you're a Killer or a Survivor. You can buy Perks and Addons for your Killers and Survivors. Also I have 12 hours of playtime and my personal opinion of Dead By Daylight is that the game is fun, the game itself is repetitive but it's also fun for a horror game. Finally the graphics are very nice as well and I would rate them by 8/10, besides there are DLC to this game which obviously...includes micro-transactions....and Dead By Daylight has it's own Battle Pass as well but it's just called \"Archives\" and it only goes up to Tier 70. But that just my opinion of this game and I HIGHLY recommend this game to those who like a Scary Cat & Mouse game.","timestamp_created":1629415898,"timestamp_updated":1629415898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97887097","author":{"steamid":"76561199126349159","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":163,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1660031488},"language":"english","review":"I love this game best horror game on the market.","timestamp_created":1629414942,"timestamp_updated":1629414942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97887090","author":{"steamid":"76561198131477523","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":324,"playtime_at_review":2485,"last_played":1660340967},"language":"english","review":"this game sucks","timestamp_created":1629414929,"timestamp_updated":1639980864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97887038","author":{"steamid":"76561198950883020","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4623,"last_played":1657243910},"language":"english","review":"Somehow this game keeps me interested even though it's the same game format every time.

Es sieht ganz nett aus und bietet viel spaß mit Freunden, sobald man Solo etwas versucht kann man gleich den nächsten Firedhof besuchen und ins Grab einer vor 100 Jahren gestorbenen person ein PC legen und die würde besser spielen als der andere Haufen an Affen die man als \"Teammates\" bekommt. \n\nEs gibt einen Killer, dessen Aufgabe es ist die 4 Survivor davon abzuhalten 5 Generatoren die auf der Map verstreut sind zu reparieren...indem er sie Tötet. Und wie das Geschieht ist Teils echt lächerlich. Man brauch mir nichts von Skill erzählen, wenn man eindeutig merkt das das Spiel nach 5 Jahren soooooo schlecht gebalanced ist. Das einzige was die Survivor gegen One Hit maschierenden und mit Speedboost versehenden Killer haben sind paar paletten die den Killer wenn er nicht ganz hirnverbrand ist für 20 Sekunden aufhalten. Zudem gibt es eine Taschenlampe die man auch gekonnt ausweichen kann und paar Fenster die...naja unnötiger sind wie die Paletten. Im groben und ganzen würde ich sagen, es ist nur ein Spiel was man mit freunden mal so spielen kann. Es ist mir persönlich zu unbalanced und schlicht weg zu unfair. \n\nMatchmaking ist auch eine größere Vollversagung als in R6 und einfach zu hart desynced.\n\nJedoch kann ich sagen, wenn man mit Freunden auf der suche nach einer Abwechslung ist, ist man hier bestimmt richtig. \nAber müsst ihr wissen","timestamp_created":1629400250,"timestamp_updated":1629400250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97876840","author":{"steamid":"76561199049722603","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17466,"last_played":1656873123},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bueno , muchos bugs\n","timestamp_created":1629400140,"timestamp_updated":1629400140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97876452","author":{"steamid":"76561198871261650","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1796,"last_played":1657147183},"language":"spanish","review":"esta piola","timestamp_created":1629399660,"timestamp_updated":1629399660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97876352","author":{"steamid":"76561198820199444","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":13243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":105,"playtime_at_review":5489,"last_played":1660498231},"language":"english","review":"Game is really fun as long as you treat losses as learning experiences rather than failure.

маньяков и перков\n-Убийцы и выжившие из популярных фильмов и игр\n-Возможность играть с друзьями до 4 человек\n-Уникальность каждой игры в зависимости от сочетания карты, убийцы и перков у него\nМинусы:\n-Огромное количество багов (От провала под карту до застревания в крюке)\n-Много криво работающих механик (К примеру, иногда не срабатывает взгляд на ГФ)\n-Однообразие геймплея за сурвов, которое осталось таковым с релиза\n-Сломанный баланс, который ломают еще больше раз за разом (Последний бафф трюкача, Майерс с бесконечной третьей стадией)\n-Никакого поощрения за игру на сурвах (Заработать все 4 радужки ультрасложно, если выполнять цель игры и дают очень мало очков крови)\n-Самое токсичное коммьюнити, которое я только видел в играх\n-Никакого поощрения за игру против пати с голосовым чатом (Ведь играть против таких намного сложнее, да и им не нужна огромная часть перков для инфы)\n-Плохие сервера (То и дело выкидывает из лобби, долго ищет катки на маньяке и т.д.)\n-Скучные ивенты\n-Раккун Сити\n-Зависимость убийц от выпавшей/поставленной карты\nUPD:\nК плохим серверам я еще добавлю то, то большинство действий происходит с клиентской части, а из-за этого выходят следующие проблемы:\n-Прерывающиеся анимации захвата чела с крюка/генератора/тотема\n-Преимущество для маньяка с большим пингом (Он в прямом смысле может бить за полкарты (на ютубе полно видео, сами убедитесь), а какой-нибудь трюкач или Аня могут попасть в вас через стену ножом/топором).\n-После обновлённых пробитий в палеты можно часто наблюдать ситуацию, когда при ударе летит кровь и есть крики, но нет дамага\n-Если ударить по челу моментально после его захила, может случится секундный визуальный баг, когда он ляжет на землю, встанет и побежит дальше\n-Вас могут в прямом смысле ударить спиной (хотя тут я не уверен насчет серверов или клиента, это может быть просто кривая анимация)\n-Всеми любимый телепорт убийцы на другую сторону палеты после оглушения\n-Возможно, из этой проблемы выросли некоторые читы, типа лагсвитча\n\n\nИтог: Эта игра будет жить до тех пор, пока не появится более сильный конкурент и продлить ей жизнь можно будет только исправив баланс, баги и добавив хотя бы один новый режим игры, потому что 4 года дрочить генераторы уже перебор.","timestamp_created":1629388685,"timestamp_updated":1631802421,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492307692766189575","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47MfIr/sCc/6q9QI="}
