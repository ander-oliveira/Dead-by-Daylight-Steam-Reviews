Я сейчас буду говорить исключительно о маньяках, так как они являются украшением игры. Все как на подбор, жуткие твари, проработанные до мельчайших подробностей, а это дыхание в меню при выборе персонажа (особенно у \"медсестры\"). Все они жуткие, и если они гонятся за вами, это вызывает непередаваемые эмоции.\n\n\n3. Техническая составляющая игры. Игра не привередлива в машине на которой вы ее запустите, даже интернет не так сильно влияет на ваш успех.\n4. Геймплей за выживших. Да, здесь я пожалуй начну говорить более конкретно. Игра за выжившего, как я написал выше, дарит вам непередаваемые эмоции, первые часы игры, вам даже страшно, вы просто начинаете прятаться, боясь всего окружающего.

Some people love it, some people can take the pineapple off or tolerate it, and some morbidly hate it enough to scream about it on internet forums. \n\nA strange combo of pvp rage and strange coincidental shenanigans that  blend together into a weird mess of bugs, sweat, and pure luck. This is not for everyone. For every fun game you have, you will have probably 1 extremely bad one and 5 that are just frustrating. If you're not playing with friends, it's going to raise the frustration number through the roof.\n\nI feel a lot of people forget it's not a win or lose game; it's a points play. You can die in a match and still progress, if and only if, you did enough. It's like tic tac toe, no one should really \"win\" in an optimal game. Two should die, two should live.  There's no way to communicate with survivors or killers, so your means of interaction is pointing, waving, and rapidly vibrating t-bags. If all goes well, everyone walks out happy, even if they die or not. If not? Well, expect the same amount of salt from a sweaty teenager playing COD. \n\nExamples of good: \n-a demogorgon who did rapid spins holding his power, letting us boop the snoot \n- a giant yellow bunny legion who let the last man go through the hatch\n- a trickster who followed practiced their aim on the exit game lights\n- a fair huntress who killed everyone fair and square and was friendly at the end\n- a clown that body blocked to make one survivor sit in the corner \n- A higher rank player recognizing someone is a newbie, and letting them learn\n\nExamples of bad:\n- a salty Michael who called us dumb b*tches, even with the best add ons only killed 1 person\n- face camping and excessive tunneling \n- being called racial slurs or entitled for wanting to do to a glyph challenge\n- stunlocking and flashlight spamming to prevent gameplay\n- bugs preventing the correct actions from happening\n\nOverall, I enjoy it. I get my money's worth out of it. It's a good game for short bursts between phonecalls as the matches are typically short.
