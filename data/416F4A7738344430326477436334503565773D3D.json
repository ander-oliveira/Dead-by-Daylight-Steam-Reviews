It’s one of those games which I really like and has some fun gameplay, but there are issues which you’re going to have to ignore if you want to really get into it. To be fair to the developers, there’s not much they can do about the worst of these issues, but more on that later.\nThe ‘story’ of the game is simple. There’s an interplanar thing called The Entity which feeds off hope which drags beings into its world (known as The Fog) in order to harvest their hope. Survivors are offered hope in the form of being able to escape, yet every time they manage to outrun the killer, they end up at the same campfire, before being forced into the next trial. You can play either survivor or killer, the hunted or the hunter. As a survivor, your objective is to work with the other three people on your team to complete generators and then power the exit gates, which allows you to escape the trial. As a killer, you want to kill all the survivors. You get points for actions you perform in the trial, typically somewhere between 10-20k, and this score translates directly into bloodpoints, the de-facto currency of the game. You can use these points to upgrade your survivors and killers by buying different perks (which last forever), offerings (which last one match), and items (which last until you lose them, usually by dying).\nFirst off, the game is really grindy. Really. Grindy. Each character comes with perks, usually focused on a theme. Take Claudette, who is meant to be a healer, but usually just sits in bushes: you a perk which allows you to heal yourself instead of relying on teammates, a perk which makes your healing faster, and another which allows you to see injured teammates. When you hit level 40, you unlock these perks for other survivors. In order to hit level 40 it’s going to take a little over million bloodpoints, probably a million and a quarter. Considering that you get about 20k bloodpoints per game… yeah. It takes a while. You get point modifiers which modify points in a specific category, or points in general, but it takes a while. The way the level up mechanic works, while interesting, can also make this number a bit bigger. Way back when, the double point modifier was relatively easy to obtain, but they increased the rarity of it to make it harder to get, so you can’t rely on them as much anymore. \nSecond off, the game is a bit of a mouse-click simulator. This is easily the biggest flaw of the game, and one which desperately needs a look at. Let’s compare killer and survivor: as a killer, you run around the map, see a survivor, hit them twice, and then they go down. Once they’re down, you can hook them on randomly spawned hooks around the map, and then they die if they’re hooked for too long or too many times. Assuming that you like it, it’s fun, engaging, and there’s a variety of powers and abilities which modify how this works, although some killers are notably worse than others (Clown). Now survivors. When playing a survivor, your main objective is generators. To complete a generator, you sit next to it, hold the mouse button for 80 seconds, and hit spacebar every now and then. For 80 seconds. This is not fun. This is not engaging. There is no variety of powers and abilities which modify how this works. The fun from playing survivor stems from the killer being around, when you’re forced to hide behind corners, or have to run away from them by vaulting over windows and throwing pallets down on them. It is not fun to repair generators. A lot of ideas have been suggested, and it wouldn’t take an amazing one to improve the experience. \nThere’s also the issue of balancing. Not between killers and survivors per-se (although some killers and survivors and notably better than others), but between perks. There are about 100 perks for each side, and yet it feels that there’s only 20 which I see in most games. I feel like the developers should hold off on content for a cycle and instead just do a pass on the perks and mechanics within the game.\nAnd the last issue, and definitely the most egregious one, is toxicity. This game is incredibly toxic, and it’s not even something confined to the upper brackets of play. The amount of negative comments I’ve got on my profile from this game alone is pretty whack, and the things which people feel are worthy of a comment are equally bizarre. If you use a certain killer, you’ll be deemed trash, stupid, and should uninstall. If you use a certain perk then you’ll be deemed trash, stupid, and should uninstall. If you don’t prioritise saving that one guy on your team who has more X’s in his name then other letters, you’ll be deemed trash, stupid, and should uninstall. I’ve had people get onto me in the post-game chat for doing something they didn’t like, even though we all escaped and were fine. A lot of the toxicity usually comes from the survivors, who’ll play in a toxic manner, yet hate it when any of this toxicity is reflected on them. I had a game where a survivor was T-bagging me the whole game, and he decided to go for one last T-bag at the exit of the map. I downed him and killed him because you shouldn’t T-bag if you can’t actually play the game, and then I got an essay about how I should have let him go because he ‘earned’ it, and that I was a bad killer anyway, and I’m (you guessed it) trash, stupid, and should uninstall.\nAll that being said, the game is fun. Provided you can put up with the toxicity then I recommend it, although you might want to bring a friend along as well: nothing is funnier than when you hear your mate scream down his microphone as some pig-headed thing sprints out a bush as him. I realise I’ve just listed the games flaws for 1000 words, but the core loop of the game is pretty good and leads to some suspenseful moments, although I’d be reticent to call them horror.\n","timestamp_created":1497717679,"timestamp_updated":1590743574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32510513","author":{"steamid":"76561198068523613","num_games_owned":841,"num_reviews":175,"playtime_forever":132246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":13,"playtime_at_review":120923,"last_played":1659641549},"language":"english","review":"I can only advise everyone to get it on sale or to just not buy it.\nThis game was not created to bring fun, it was created to milk you of your money.\n\nLike 40% of the cosmetics are only available for real money, the 60% which are for free are extremely hard to get and share the same currency which allows you to unlock perks without buying all their released (bad) DLCs which are fundamental to win in this game.\n\n80% of the game is behind a pay/grind wall.\nThis would be ok, if the game was fun to play, but unfortunately it's not.\nIt encourages bad manners, unsportsmanlike play and is extremely unbalanced.\n\nUsually survivors are favoured, regarding balancing, but they have done some incredibly stupid design decisions regarding survivors also, so I would say, they balance for money gain.\n\nSince 2016 onwards, the devs did never actually communicate properly with the player base.\nThey rather silence people via banning them off their forums or steam discussions, if they criticize the game too much.\n\nAlso the main developers are streaming rarely and play like actual rank 20 garbage.\n\nJust don't buy it, you will get angry over this and will regret your choice of buying this for a 100%.\nLike I did.\n\nSolid 2,000 hours, I catch myself so often starting this game, just to leave before the game even starts, because it just brings up bad memories.\nPlaying this game feels like actual molestation.\nIf it is getting t-bagged at the exit gates, clicky flashlights, the endgame chat or getting camped, tunneled or left to bleed on the ground for atleast 3 minutes.\n\nOh btw, if you live in europe, you will get matched up with russians 80% of the time.\nThey absolutely have no manners in most of the case and are trying way too hard to win, knowing no limits.\nI don't play this unbalanced shit to win or rub my victory in the faces of others, I just wanna have fun, but this is fucking impossible with this hot pile of garbage.\nSo please reader, don't support this.\n\nAnd if you wanna support it, buy a key, so this greedy ass company doesn't get a dime.\n\nSteam asked me to update this review after 162 hours of more games.\nI still strongly disapprove of this game.\nKill it with fire.","timestamp_created":1497717575,"timestamp_updated":1642170911,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32510130","author":{"steamid":"76561198116989662","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1799,"last_played":1627820304},"language":"thai","review":"ดีสนุกมาก","timestamp_created":1497716829,"timestamp_updated":1497716829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490000009536743164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32509946","author":{"steamid":"76561198138280922","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":17211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15887,"last_played":1510245492},"language":"english","review":"The game isn't bad but the community is ugh...\nCons :\n\n-terrible matchmaking\n-bugs \n-glitches\n-campers\n-face campers\n\nPros :\n\n-fun to play with friends\n-fun to play as killer\n-if u don't care about rank and that u will be camped almost every game its fun as a survivor too :D","timestamp_created":1497716464,"timestamp_updated":1506256436,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32509937","author":{"steamid":"76561198103274497","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":7984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1636320416},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing game, only problem is that the community is dead and it takes forever to find a match.

The kids who complain about \"campers\" I see are quite ignorant. Do you post the same review on a game like Call of Duty? Or perhaps you just want to hate on a game because you got that one unlucky game. Oh boo hoo. Get over it.\n\nAside from the people who complain about camping, I want to also adress the people complaining about the \"removed\" DLC items. Yes, they were removed... but that was within reason. \"I only downloaded this head pack for the hoodie I saw.\" Well... if you haven't noticed... it says \"Head.\" You know... for head customization? Or does head mean body or leg in your world? Yes, I am giving you this attitude because your reviews actually make me angry. However... yes, they should not have released things and then removed them. But they told us why. It is for a later DLC.\n\nAnyway, I love this game because a 4 vs 1 killer scenario is a game I have been waiting for, for a while. It was done quite well, the way I see it. There are a few bugs, I will agree. They need to be fixed. But besides that, the game is amazing. The only other game I can say is done like this and done well is Friday The 13th, the game. I highly recommend both of these games.\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this review.

The game is very biased toward survivors, and the gameplay loop boils down to survivors rushing the objective down in two minutes while the killer is only able to do anything about it if the survivor makes a mistake. The survivor \"meta\" is extremely stale and revolves around abusing a variety of second chance perks which give survivors multiple get out of jail free cards.

have 47 hours invested in this game so far and I've only had it for a couple of weeks. It's a bit glitchy every now and then, but I absolutely love the concept and it is a blast to play with friends!\n\n*** Re-review: \nWell, apparently tomorrow already marks a year since I reviewed DBD and I now realize that 47 hours is practically no time at all when it comes to this game. I was also a noob at the time... xD\nThat being said, now that I have a decent amount of playtime racked up, allow me to expand on my previous Dead by Daylight review.\n\nI just broke 1,400 hours and I still love this game just as much as I did a year ago, probably even more. I play it on a nightly basis for hours on end. I've had some real adrenaline rush moments, and I love the thrill of it. \nIt seems the devs are finally starting to get their act together. Slowly... Very slowly. But I do see progress happening. I have hope for this game yet, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. \nI also love that they've recently added a store to buy cosmetics. Yeah, they're a bit pricey, but that's if you want to buy the cosmetics that require auric cells. Most of the cosmetics can be bought with iridescent shards, which can be earned through playtime. Despite what people say, it's really not that bad. People are just salty. The devs have to make money to improve their game somehow. I personally don't have an issue with it.\n\nI play both killer and survivor, and surprisingly, I actually enjoy both sides. It does still have it's frustrating moments, but you can't deny that this game is addictive. One thing I do hate is how toxic this community can get.. But you'll see that in almost any game, not just this one. I tend to just ignore the toxicity anyway. It is just a game after all, I'm just here to have fun.\n\nI highly recommend at least giving the game a chance. A real, decent chance. I'm talking at least 500+ hours. Because there is a lot to learn. I also have a lot of patience, which IS required for this game! \nHard truth: You're not going to be good at this game when you first start out, I'm gonna tell you that right now. You WILL get destroyed at first, and you WILL get matched up with people that are WAY out of your league.\nIf you get frustrated easily, and aren't willing to take the time to learn, and practice, and understand that you're NOT ALWAYS GOING TO WIN, then this game probably won't be for you. \nBoth killers AND survivors do toxic things in game, just take the loss and move on to the next game, better luck next time. It's all you can do. \nTry not to let someone's playstyle discourage you. It sucks, yes, but you can't control the way some people play. Just move on. \n\nAs a side note, Michael Myers is easily my favorite killer, both to play as and to play against. He's just a ton of fun to me, and I love the jumpscares that can be pulled off with him :)","timestamp_created":1497671505,"timestamp_updated":1529092671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32493089","author":{"steamid":"76561198354075766","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1523084214},"language":"schinese","review":"半天都进不了游戏，人都没有！","timestamp_created":1497671013,"timestamp_updated":1497671013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485094845294952393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32493083","author":{"steamid":"76561198029149759","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":49999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5407,"last_played":1656246872},"language":"koreana","review":"진짜 사지 마라 존나 병신 게임이다 버그 천지에 서버는 병신이고 퍽 물가는 존나 높은데 블포 주는 건 대한민국 최저 시급 정도 준다 게임을 제대로 즐기려면 필수 퍽이 필요한대 그 모으는 과정이 존나 씹 조선이다 빠르게 죽고 빠르게 못 잡고 이 ㅈ같은 뫼비우스의 띠를 못 버서 나면 게임존나게 접는 거다\n병신겜 진짜 왜삼???? 어이가없네 이래도 사?\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2273848678\n","timestamp_created":1497670992,"timestamp_updated":1604209845,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32492913","author":{"steamid":"76561198079794603","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":44051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2943,"last_played":1658934447},"language":"koreana","review":"Very Funny!!!","timestamp_created":1497670343,"timestamp_updated":1497670343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32492749","author":{"steamid":"76561198385076891","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":661,"last_played":1611887316},"language":"thai","review":"หนุกกกกกกกกมากๆๆเเล้วเเต่\nไครจะชอบ\nอะไรนะครับ\nผมว่ามัะนก็หนุกดีนะ\n","timestamp_created":1497669741,"timestamp_updated":1497669741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32492706","author":{"steamid":"76561198238002806","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1639057619},"language":"english","review":"take to long time match making :(","timestamp_created":1497669580,"timestamp_updated":1497669580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32492589","author":{"steamid":"76561198117435641","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":33416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1622,"last_played":1636985143},"language":"schinese","review":"在这个游戏里，我们还能修电机，走地窖逃生。队友之间互帮互助。\n\n但是那些在临沂网戒中心的人，身边没有一个能信任的人，没有逃生条件，永远只能被困在暗无天日的铁笼中。\n\nPS：这游戏是真的好刺激。","timestamp_created":1497669114,"timestamp_updated":1497669114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":245,"votes_funny":60,"weighted_vote_score":"0.924972653388977051","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32492476","author":{"steamid":"76561198390206997","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2457,"last_played":1626809111},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игра если бы не баги балобы 5 ,а так твердая 4.","timestamp_created":1497668735,"timestamp_updated":1497668735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32492210","author":{"steamid":"76561198108416987","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1569100676},"language":"english","review":"Not even worth purchasing.
