Solo queue survivor is probably the worst experience you can ever get in a teamplay based multiplayer game, so many n00bs and trolls. You need a SWF (survive with friends) team to actually have fun in DBD as a survivor, otherwise it's just obnoxiously unfun. Basically if i play solo queue survivor, i'm just there to get tunnel visioned and face camped to death by the killer, die/lose. Solo queue survivor escape ratio is like 1 escape per 50 games. Killer is extremely overpowered versus a group of solo queue survivors. I have like 99,99% win ratio on killer, not saying this to brag but to tell you how broken the killer is versus solo Q survivors, even the weakest killer. It actually gives me nausea to play (solo queue) survivor.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1846744418\nThe Nurse also has absolutely 0 counter-play, but thankfully there isn't so much Nurse players left since the nerf.\n\nUnplayable as a killer; Devs nerfed Hex: Ruin perk and in the current meta there is like 2 or 3 killers (spirit, hillbilly, nurse -though nurse is now INSANELY bugged and unplayable with the dedicated servers-) that can play (still hopeless versus sweaty SWF teams) without Hex: Ruin if the survivor team against you is not completely brain damaged and/or just trolling/f*cking around. All the rest of the killers are sh*t now.\nEdit: The Spirit, The Hillbilly and The Nurse are all also nerfed now :D Spirit is pretty much 100% useless versus Iron Will perk and unplayable LMAO\n\nDedicated servers are pure garbage, makes the game even more unplayable. Behaviour introduced dedicated servers because some killers were lagswitching (i have seen only 1 lagswitching killer in my whole played time btw), but now it's like EVERY F*CKING GAME is lagswitch as a survivor, around 83% of your deaths are because of the lag of dedicated servers, Dead Hard (the most overused survivor meta crutch perk) DOES NOT work 83% of the time because of the damn servers and i say this as a killer main.\n\nYui is f*cking crossed eyed. WTF Behaviour you racist pr*cks. Fix Yui's eyes. I'm very offended and triggered as a proud Japanese person.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1974175687\n\nI have lost all of my grinded limited time event cosmetics (including Huntress' hound mask, Hillbilly's pro-pain hammer, David's untamed donkey jacket etc.) randomly because of a bug (pre-alpha stage game forever) and have been waiting for them to be given back to me since forever. Starting to lose hope on them tbh, Behaviour seems like they do not give a f*ck anymore. \nEdit: I have got my items back. \nEdit 2: They gave these limited time grind items to everyone that plays the game now. What was the point of getting these then? WTF?\nThere was also this \"lose of progress\" bug where you could lose all of your progress in a blink of an eye, i'm not sure if that bug still exists.\n\nRanking & matchmaking system in this game is pure sh*t. Rank almost means nothing and matchmaking matches rank 1 players with rank 20 players. It's especially rough for a solo queue survivor because you'll be getting a lot of clueless brand new players in your team meanwhile the killer you'll be getting as enemy will be a red rank turbo nerd player with 6k hours, so it'll be really boring for you.\n\nThe game is still bugged so hard after 4 years, still feels pre-alpha stage. Honestly at this point it makes me feel like their poorly coded game is beyond saving, they just can't fix the game even if they want to, they need to abort the whole project or something.\nThe developers do not fix these bugs and they prefer adding cosmetics in the game nonstop with that effort instead.\nThe sounds (pretty important for a killer player, as much important as the visuals) get bugged/broken almost every single patch they release, and sometimes sounds stay bugged for straight 6 months.\n\nDevelopers do not care for cheaters/hackers at all, i've reported a person who's been using noclip hack as a survivor in my game with a video proof and postgame chat proof of him being super cocky about his cheats and he did not get banned even tho it's been around 1 month now, and he was cheating since 2018. Cheaters are allowed in this game and they get no punishment for it. \n1) https://i.imgur.com/Lj5pEeX.jpg\n2) https://i.imgur.com/pChVaaW.jpg\n3) https://i.imgur.com/X78S4s6.jpg\n4) https://i.imgur.com/KczaIhF.jpg\n5) https://i.imgur.com/GPooHPK.jpg\n6) https://i.imgur.com/hez0Qmr.jpg\n7) https://i.imgur.com/ZYJokgm.jpg\n8) https://i.imgur.com/xnmyOCH.jpg\nThe hacker guy was right in the postgame chat.

отзыв скорее нейтральный, чем негативный, так как игра не надоедает, и геймплей в целом очень интересный. Атмосфера (особенно в первое время) на высоте! Долгое время я играл за выживших (сурвов), но для разнообразия пересел на убийц. Расскажу подробней про игру за обе стороны.\n\n[h1]Сурвы:[/h1]\n\n    1) Первое время вы будете бояться каждого шороха, сидеть в шкафу и молиться, чтобы киллер вас не нашел.\n    2) Когда вы научитесь убегать, мансить и прятаться, уровень сложности в игре внезапно изменится для вас на TOO EZ. \n    3) Добравшись до высоких рангов, вам станет слишком скучно просто заводить генераторы и сбегать. Вот тогда и начинается аутизм, который поражает большинство скилловых игроков (если у вас есть склонность к токсик поведению, то это определенно ваш случай). В чем это заключается: \n[list]\n    [*]Теперь ваша задача - выбесить киллера настолько, насколько это возможно. Генераторы уходят на второй план.\n    [*]В руке на выбор: тулбокс на почти мгновенную починку генератора, топовый фонарик (почти мгновенное ослепление маньяка) либо аптечка на мгновенный прохил.\n    [*]Из перков: обязательно Borrowed Time (чтобы успеть спасти другого БМящего сурва, которого наконец-то поймали), Decisive Strike (чтобы спрыгнуть с плеча маньяка, когда поймают вас), Self-care (чтобы стопить маньяка, мешая ему ударить других сурвов/донести до крюка, показывая, насколько вам не страшно), ну и Sprint Burst/Dead Hard (чтобы дольше мансить).\n    [*]Кнопка Ctrl теперь вам нужна не для того, чтобы присесть и скрыться от киллера. Ее надо использовать, чтобы показать свое превосходство. Застанили маньяка доской? Поприседайте, покажите ему, какой он неудачник. Смогли добежать до ворот? Стойте там и ждите пока маньяк придет, чтобы показать, как плохо он сыграл. Киллер не может вас поймать? Ну вы просто обязаны показать ему, насколько вы круты.\n    [*]Для почти 100% вероятности сбежать всем, играйте вчетвером с друзьями с голосовой связью, идеальным сочетанием перков и предметов.\n    [*]После игры не забудьте написать в чат, насколько плох маньяк, что он нуб и должен умереть. Не сдерживайтесь в оскорблениях.\n[/list]\n\n    [i]В целом игру за сурвов на высоких можно описать как \"детский\" режим сложности, в котором вы с одноклассниками издеваетесь над несчастными пенсионерами, которые тщетно пытаются вас прогнать.[/i]\n\n[h1]Киллеры:[/h1]\n\nИгра за убийц - хард мод, в котором вы проходите серьезную проверку навыков.\n1) В начале игры вам будут попадаться новички, которые не умеют толком убегать, сидят за кустом и смотрят на вас (как будто вы их не видите -_-) и совершают кучу ошибок. В этот момент вы будете думать, что играть за киллеров слишком просто (типичная ошибка мейн сурвов, которые отыграют 1 катку на маньяке, а потом пишут, как все легко).\n2) Со временем вы опять же подниметесь до высоких рангов. Если к этому моменту вы не научились идеально играть за маньяка, то начнется АД. Как это выглядит:\n[list]\n    [*]Вы появились, пошли в сторону какого-то генератора, видите Дуайта в розовых штанах с фонариком в руке, который машет вам рукой и приседает. Он даже не пытается прятаться. 3 минуты пытаетесь его поймать. Опишу погоню: вы бегаете как идиот кругами вокруг пачки коробок раз 10, после чего он скидывает на вас доску, приседает и слепит фонариком в лицо. После этого он ведет вас к другой такой пачке коробок и все повторяется (игроки называют это pallet looping). За это время заводят 3 генератора, остается 2, и вы понимаете, что находитесь в полной жопе. \"Ну и ладно\", - думаете вы. - \"Пойду ловить кого-то еще.\" Как бы не так. Дуайт не пытается от вас убежать, а ходит за вами и продолжает отвлекать фонариком, прыгать в окна и приседать. При любой попытке наказать наглеца он возвращается к своим любимым доскам. Вы находите Клодеттку, которая мирно чинит генератор. Довольно легко ловите ее и предвкушаете, как наконец-то повесите хоть кого на крюк. Но в момент поднятия перед вами появляется Дуайт, слепит вас, вы роняете Клодеттку, она убегает. А вы остаетесь смотреть на Дуайта, который продолжает приседать. Заводят 4-ый генератор. Вы решаете дальше гоняться за Дуайтом, каким-то магическим образом его ловите и готовитесь нести на крюк. Но даже не надейтесь! У него есть перк Decisive Strike, с помощью которого он спрыгивает с плеча и продолжает заниматься аутизмом. Заводят 5-ый генератор, питание на ворота подано. Вы решаете во что бы то ни стало поймать мерзкого Дуайта, который испортил вам игру, и не упускаете его из вида. Ловите. Несете на крюк и вешаете. За это время другие сурвы успели открыть ворота, но убегать они не спешат. \"Дуайт бесил меня всю игру и должен умереть\" - думаете вы и стоите рядом с крюком. Но у вас нет шансов. Прибегает та самая Клодеттка, полностью игнорируя вас, и снимает Дуайта с крюка. Вы ударяете его, но он не падает! Он продолжает бежать прямо к воротам, а пока вы бежите за ним, Клодеттка бегает перед глазами и замедляет вас. Дуайт добегает до ворот. Все четверо приседают перед выходом и убегают. После этого в чате вам напишут \"нуб\", \"кемпер\", \"убей себя\" и т. д. Если у вас открыт профиль, то туда вам напишут \"-rep даун, кемпер, нуб, не умеет играть\" и так далее, после чего играть \"честно\" (по мнению сурвов) у вас уже нет ни малейшего желания.\n    [*]Через несколько игр у вас уже не будет настроения играть за маньяков, так как это очень изматывает и разочаровывает в людях. Поэтому несколько раз подумайте, игра за киллеров не для слабонервных.\n[/list]\n[i]\"И в чем плюс игры за маньяков, зачем ты за них играешь?\"[/i] - спросите вы. А я отвечу:\n    1) Вы учитесь думать наперед. Прикидываете, что стоит делать и куда идти, продумываете стратегию, и это научит вас учиться на своих ошибках.\n    2) Вы учитесь экономить время. В условиях недостатка времени нет смысла тратить его на подобных Дуайтов, цель которых - ваше время отнять. Вы учитесь делать именно то, что будет для вас полезно.\n    3) Вы тренируете [b]стрессоустойчивость[/b]. Действительно, эта игра - наверное лучшее место, чтобы тренировать свои нервы и терпение, а также внимание. И вы ничем не рискуете, ведь последствий на вашу реальную жизнь игра не окажет.\n\n    [i]Таким образом, в то время как для сурвов это \"детская игра\", для киллеров DBD является своеобразной \"школой жизни\", после которой вы научитесь не обращать внимание на злых людей, которые только и пытаются вас спровоцировать.[/i]\n\n    Именно поэтому я продолжаю страдать за убийц и проводить время с пользой.\n\n    Надеюсь, что мой отзыв хоть как-то помог вам сделать свой выбор. Крепких нервов вам!","timestamp_created":1508324870,"timestamp_updated":1508325369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2098,"votes_funny":446,"weighted_vote_score":"0.952169418334960938","comment_count":163,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35815004","author":{"steamid":"76561198352971848","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":62368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49686,"last_played":1607015848},"language":"italian","review":"gioco meraviglioso mi sto veramente divertendo tanto","timestamp_created":1508322422,"timestamp_updated":1508322422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513888895511627197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35814861","author":{"steamid":"76561198148724420","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1537881847},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩！第一次玩很害怕，僵尸一来我直接把游戏关了，不过现在还是很怕，几乎没有逃走过","timestamp_created":1508321849,"timestamp_updated":1508321849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35814855","author":{"steamid":"76561198192125631","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":128277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54754,"last_played":1645869592},"language":"schinese","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1508321802,"timestamp_updated":1508321802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35814663","author":{"steamid":"76561198292162216","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":19,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1508311398},"language":"english","review":"Its realy realy good game...yes there are some bad points....but its realy fun and scary...but when you play with your friends its realy good and you can have fun with it \nbuy it if you have friends in game 😉❤️","timestamp_created":1508321031,"timestamp_updated":1508321031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542035400867462158","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35814522","author":{"steamid":"76561198154028216","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":66090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1275,"playtime_at_review":54597,"last_played":1660603661},"language":"russian","review":"Полное отсутствие баланса , игра создана для сурвов , киллеры существуют для виду .","timestamp_created":1508320377,"timestamp_updated":1556419266,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536423861980438232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35814520","author":{"steamid":"76561198359121292","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3378,"last_played":1601612745},"language":"schinese","review":"刚开始玩这个游戏很紧张，后来慢慢熟悉了就不紧张了。这个游戏开黑玩很刺激","timestamp_created":1508320371,"timestamp_updated":1508320371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35813679","author":{"steamid":"76561198373532502","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11372,"last_played":1641042443},"language":"english","review":"i canT OPEN THE GAME\n","timestamp_created":1508316588,"timestamp_updated":1508316588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475999981164932251","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35813599","author":{"steamid":"76561198058689365","num_games_owned":547,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":165921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10010,"last_played":1635347970},"language":"english","review":"Fun to play on your own or with friends, as long as the killer isn't a camper or the survivors aren't in a 4 man VC group.\nThe whole 'cashgrab' mentality isn't really something I get, since the base game is 20 bucks? that's pretty cheap.

(and most the freddys ive come across arnt the nicest either). but if you do play.... good luck","timestamp_created":1508313570,"timestamp_updated":1509352122,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35811931","author":{"steamid":"76561198118802897","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8430,"last_played":1646376872},"language":"koreana","review":"아주 재밌고","timestamp_created":1508307519,"timestamp_updated":1508307519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35811290","author":{"steamid":"76561198257652990","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":18804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2709,"last_played":1604247729},"language":"russian","review":"рекомендую","timestamp_created":1508304383,"timestamp_updated":1512057090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35810790","author":{"steamid":"76561198300492865","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":66151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5092,"playtime_at_review":47875,"last_played":1660579325},"language":"schinese","review":"我tm再碰这垃圾我是狗","timestamp_created":1508301959,"timestamp_updated":1508301959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35810323","author":{"steamid":"76561198419672844","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6339,"last_played":1639483078},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏百多小时，只想说，现在的鬼是不是强的有点过分，就算是人皇在被鬼追的时候一点失误都是一刀，贴模型三圈转不到，转点没板直接趴，遇到护士长直接gg，最近几次躲柜躲护士刀不知道是改了还是卡了，护士在柜子外一刀我直接趴着出柜子\n一个人打野队上分有多难？防这防那，被鬼追转点的点不行或者点远，被人用过就是趴，最近一年对鬼的增强是针对人皇的，现在人皇遇到会玩一些的鬼带了技能都会忌惮，遇到护士长直接顶恶咒开电机走地道，我们呢？只能说游戏体验极差\n而且我现在已经看到不少一千五百小时以上的人皇的双轮车都翻烂了","timestamp_created":1508299601,"timestamp_updated":1508301081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35810200","author":{"steamid":"76561198340133355","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12020,"last_played":1636829417},"language":"english","review":"Before I start I'd like preface what I say by stating I have a had a LOT of fun with this game, it is truly unique as a gameplay experience, and when it plays like it should (key part of that statement) it's incredibly fun. I'd even go so far as to say I've never played anything like it and I mean that in a good way. I've logged 192 hours so far, and I would love nothing more than to see this game flourish, HOWEVER I highly doubt that will ever happen. We'll get to that later. \n\nSo let's start with positives.\n\n- Great cat and mouse type gameplay. Killers are a legitimate threat, and a surivor must play smart to ever see the exit gates open.\n\n-Music and sound effects are pretty good for what they are. They definately do their job at setting the mood, and many gameplay elements are based around audio cues that dictate play.\n\n-Art style is great, with many killers that are both interesting to look at, and terrifying to run from. Many of the survivors will capture your attention and your heart as well.\n\n-Teamwork means something, and a great team of survivors can make for incredibly interesting and challenging gameplay. A single horrific teammate can cause a world of uncertainty for everyone else. A single great teammate can be a ray of hope for the entire team.\n\nNow here comes the bad...brace yourself.\n\n-Bugs. Lots of em. This game is plagued with technical issues, both in game and out. Survivors and killers getting stuck in walls, walking through walls, the map spawning with no walls at all. Hard earned ranks being inexplicably removed or downgraded (making the trek to playing with better players all the more arduous). Button prompts refusing to pop up (which is made all the more egregious of a sin for the precious commodity that time is in this game. In many pressure cooker situations this can spell death for a survivor). All kinds of weird visual glitches, and issues with textures. Straight up game crashes are not an infrequant rarity, often times happening deep into a match. Inconsistant tallying of points to increase rank at times as well.\n\n-Visuals are definately not the best in this game. It's forgiveable enough, but for the visual bugs, and sparse lack of content, it really does drag how muddy this game can look at times. \n\n-Lobby system is a mess, and has been since day one. Surviving with friends requires you to resubmit invites after every game, or even after your group is booted from a hosting killers lobby. This is made all the more horrific considering how slow and poorly implemented the matchmaking system is. It has gotten better, simply because waiting 10-20 mins for a game is relatively a thing of the past. Make no mistake though this will happen at times, and you WILL SPEND upwards of 10 mins to find a lobby at one point or another, and you would be lucky to get away with that. You would not find yourself alone to experience waiting half an hour for a game OR MORE. And considering how often killers duck lobbies for varying reasons, this can be outright infuriating. \n\n-The community. Remember when I said it's amazing when it plays like it was designed? That will not be your experience in much of your time spent with this game. Trolling, camping, and \"unsportsmanlike\" nonsense is a core part of the DBD community and you must learn to live with and accept that if you ever want to have a decent time with this game. You will have many fun times with players in this game, both killer and survivor and oftentimes you will have fun just watching and figuring out how people play. But more often than not you will find yourself cursing the game for being punished for either the stupidity of a teammate, or the lackluster behavior of a killer, or survivor.\n\n-Balancing, rebalancing, purposeful UNbalancing. People have been frustrated with crumby perks, terrible upgrade RNG paths, camping, pallet looping, tunneling, and other gameplay elements which people have asserted makes the game boring, straighforward, annoying, and predictable have been a significant community gripe since day one. Make no mistake the developers have made it abundantly clear that they are committed to never fixing any of these glaring issues. Not only have absolutely none of these issues been addressed, several have actually been purposefully worsened by the evolution of the games meta, and reworking of the games mechanics. Particularly camping, tunneling, pallet looping, and trolling have all been further incentivised and encouraged as not only being a legitimate form of gameplay, but increasingly becoming the only ways of playing the game. \n\n(Cont'd) Don't like camping and tunneling? Now the only way for a killer to earn ranks is to secure kills, not to draw out a long interesting match. Don't like pallet looping? tough luck, killers can vault obstacles almost as fast as survivors, and stealth is made all but invalid by a host of killer perks and even an entire killer based around \"breaking\" that part of gameplay according to the devs. Don't like 360 juking, and trolling, then you better like pallet chases, cause there's little to no other way for a survivor to truly lose a killer. The \"rebalanicing\" issue has become so bad that the game actually become far less interesting, competitive, and accepting of different playstyles over time. Now less dependant on player skill and competitiveness, and more dependant on luck of the draw, and tedious gameplay mechanics that require no skill to execute. Also this game is quite arguably much buggier than when it initially launched. How does that happen?\n\n-The devs. Aw, here we go. For all the whining that players often direct at developers of competitive online games, there are few legitimate reasons to take umbridge with a hardworking developer just doing their best to make a game better for the player base. This is not the case here. For a game to continue to get WORSE for a developers involvement, both technically, and mechanically a year after it's launch, is an astounding thing all it's own. But for a developer to take an actively dismissive stance of their own veteran community, oftentimes stepping all over already established problem areas and issues, simply to sucker in and appeal to new players to secure new purchases, is a sin reserved for the ninth circle of hell. You see the game is divied into those who play the killer, and those who play the survivor. Most new players are drawn to the killer aspect of the game. It's unique, it draws the most views on streams, videos, and the most purchases on DLC. \n\n(Cont'd) The devs continue to throw in new killers, all the while adjusting the gameplay to be more immediately gratifying and less frustrating to new killer players with every new DLC and update. The devs have made it clear they have no intention of maintaining a happy balance between the two parts of the community, by addressing grievances and making sure both experiences are mutually rewarding. The community has become increasingly bitter and filled with unrest at this leaving little but the committed and those in it for the \"LULZ\". Tune into the dev podcast to see them wave away lobby issues, and balancing complaints if you don't believe me. \n\n\nSix months ago I would've said \"for all it's issues, it's a blast and is sure to get better\". But that is no longer the case. The changes this game has seen have made it more a consistantly frustrating mess, and what once was a game that was fun to play for hours at a time has become a dip in dip out excercise in patience. I HIGHLY recomend that you DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Not only for the problems it has, and the lack of content for the price, but because the behavior of the developers of this game in the long run has been utterly deplorable, and any future purchases of this game will only serve to validate that behavior until they turn their ship around.\n\nThis review has been planned, and thought out for months, and I hope my insight can help you from using your money unwisely.

In order to escape, the 4 survivors have to repair 5 generators and then open the gates. During all the time, the killer will try to catch the survivors.\nThere are a lot of different maps which are chosen randomly at the beginning of the game. The spawn points of the killer and the survivors are random, too, which keeps a certain tension as you never know if the killer spawned close to you or at the other end of the map.\n\nI play as survivor and killer, each approximately same amount of matches.\nMost of the matches I play are exciting and I still enjoy playing it (even after more than 500 hours already spend in this game),\nHowever, I have to critize that this game is poorly balanced. The survivors are much too strong compared to the killer. Instead of being scared of the killer, I often see survivors running towards him and then being chased for up to 50% of the full time of the match before the killer can even catch the survivor. In my opinion, this should be adressed by the developers asap.\n\nFurthermore, I have to say that I see a lot of toxic players in the community of this game. Insults and taunting in the after-game chat is unfortunately very common for survivors and killers.\n\nSummary: The game itself is a lot of fun (especially playing it with friends) when you play as survivor. Playing killer is also fun, but you need a high tolerance towards frustration.\n\nEdit: During the last weeks it seems that the developers start to listen to the killer community and we can hope that they will balance the game more in the future.\n\nEdit (November 2018): Game is now much better balanced. Still not yet there, but the developers are really improving their work a lot.\n\nEdit (December 2021): I decided to not recommend this game anymore. The status of the game balance has never been worse and there is no fun in playing anymore. As killer you can be happy if you get a few hooks, and you dont even need to think about sacrificing a survivor... no chance. As survivor, you only get camping killers (which I totally understand from killers point of view) which is also not fun at all. Haven't had a match in month that was close to being interesting or funny.
