have played this game for a very long time. I can safely say that this game is an addiction rather than a good game. The developers DO NOT CARE about their playerbase. They do not take into account any feedback, they release BARELY working dlcs at full price, they rarely fix bugs and there are still issues with the game that have persisted for YEARS. \n\nKiller has improved from what it was in 2016 (which is not saying much, it was beyond terrible back then), though the game is EXTRAORDINARILY survivor sided. The most recent killers released ALL have some way that survivors can abuse them or control the game. With the newest addition: Pinhead being one of my most hyped chapters of all time, came a VERY underwhelming power where half his strength is literally given to the survivors (they can see his lament configuration AND HE CANT...). \n\nThe developers DESTROY the game every time they release an update, they change one thing and all of a sudden a killer TOTALLY UNRELATED to what they changed can no longer use their power properly. The game is poorly coded, has devs that do not care about feedback, are incapable of fixing bugs, and purely care about profit rather than the game they tried to make. \n\nThe developers are so disconnected from their game and have no clue what's going on that they believe releasing BOON TOTEMS to survivors is a good idea. Giving the killer MORE to worry about when they already have so much on their plate. Not to mention that killers have been asking to place their own hexes for years and survivors get it day 1 of their new perk. \n\nMy point of this rant is that the game is very addicting. When it feels good it feels great. BUT, the game feels HORRIBLE 9 times out of 10. It was balanced for the lowest ranks in the game and has no real scaling for when people get better at the game. \n\nThe ONLY reason this game is allowed to exist in this state is because there is literally NO competition in the market. They have no reason to be better, so they won't. This game continues to suck the joy out of gaming for me because I believe \"this game will be a good one\" every time. Only to be disconnected from their horrific servers, have powers not work, hit validation issues, or the other myriad problems that happen in this mess of a game. \n\nBuy at your own risk, unless you are playing survivor everything you expect to feel from this game will NOT be what you feel.","timestamp_created":1561948198,"timestamp_updated":1631228162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52701089","author":{"steamid":"76561198384843251","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11688,"last_played":1644784191},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo Bom","timestamp_created":1561948153,"timestamp_updated":1561948153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52701055","author":{"steamid":"76561197994503644","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3791,"last_played":1567174178},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1561948141,"timestamp_updated":1561948141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52700949","author":{"steamid":"76561198205738371","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":95613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1139,"playtime_at_review":17399,"last_played":1660366877},"language":"english","review":"this game is a mess but a fun one, if only the devs actually patched out most of the bugs it has and added more in game currency dlc/ items it would be nice instead of just money grab methods.\nstill i think this is a fun game to give it a go.","timestamp_created":1561948114,"timestamp_updated":1561948114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52700533","author":{"steamid":"76561198039841476","num_games_owned":433,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10951,"last_played":1657591752},"language":"english","review":"Very Fun and Addicting game although it can be stressful at times it is still a very good game.

Survivors tend to have incredibly quick lobbies while it takes me a good 5 min to get into a game as a killer.  \n\nThe ranking system is odd and resets often which makes me wonder how creators actually keep the games even via skill levels since ranks reset.

is a better stealth game than metal gear.\n\nIn this game, you play as Evan the high school knife expert or the rest of the buddies. Despite being buff and hunky, they are all but fragile beta nerds as the true alpha gamers harrass the killers to death with flashlights that burn the killers so much that it blinds them temporarily and causes them to be circumsized due to the extreme exposure to heat. \n\nThe story is that the killers are trying to make sure they save their power bill so that they don't get evicted by some boozoo named \"The Entity\", but some knockoff scooby doo gang comes in and tries to power high voltage generators anyways so you, the beta anime knife wielding samurai you are, have to try to punish the survivors and send them to the entity using fish hooks or flashy wrestling moves (which can only be unlocked by an item that is called: \"the mori\". \n\nThe killer due to being in debt cause of killer college at least retains some kool killa tricks from kool killa kollege, also known as perks. Unfortunately, like high school, they are neigh extremely useless perks and are barely able to help you against the alpha survivor, whom can out best anything you pull up and more since they also have perks due to them being in rich kid alpha survivor preschool. Seriously, survivors can probably survive heroshima and have 5 more second chance pros. They are essentially jesus (reviewer note: The actual character name is Jeff Johansen and not Jesus). \n\nAs survivor, you are also able to steal beta killers things like medical insurance and lunch boxes, burritos, and keys because lol. You can also break their fish hook statues because \"nerds only like fishing anyways\" as quoted by alpha pack leader Claudette Prestige 19\n\nOf course, if you are killer, you might get lucky, as most alpha survivors got big dumb and so you can deport them back to entity realm fire place area. Otherwise, they are big smart so you never catch those damn kids anyways.\n\nThere is a variety of killers to choose, but only hillbilly and nurse gets played since they are the only ones that can at least fight back well enough due to their sonic speed.\n\nThere are some friendly survivors though out there, so it ain't all that bad. Dwight is a cool guy but he has yet to come out of the closet, so you never really see him in game until he leaves through your hatch. Claudette though is scary af though. Can literally blend in with anything, play immersed, and can dissapear on whim. She will flashlight you till circumsized, and will have 400 OP perks equipped that will make you insta big cry on contact. She will gen rush and be god like almost.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite high school (college) drama/cranky old man simulator that I've been played and to be put as either Alpha survivor or beta ki11a. Reminds me of my high school days when I was a beta boy and got bullied hard. Game is inbalanced just like my high school social life, but it's \"fun\" nontheless.
