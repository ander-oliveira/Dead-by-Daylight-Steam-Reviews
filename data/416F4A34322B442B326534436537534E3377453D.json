It provides an incredibly built horror challenge that captures the feel very well without feeling hopeless. But know what you sign up for. On both sides, this game is tough. This is not for people with a rage-quit attitude. This game requires dedicated teamwork, sacrifice, and not giving up till the very end. As someone who has been a horror junkie for years, I absolutely love this game. Know going in that sometimes you get matched up with someone not as good, or with someone much better. It is going to happen. Do your best, learn, and don't give up. Know there will be rage-quit pansies who don't know how to handle the slightest bit of challenge. Don't be discouraged. You're in a horror game. FIGHT TO SURVIVE. As the killer, enjoy the hunt. This game is not about the most efficient kills. This game is about the terror. Accomplish your objectives, but make it frightening. Enjoy spreading fear and worry. Savor it and let it last. I really hope this game keeps up and that someday, there is a sequel. I look forward to buying more DLC, and I thank the devs for the amazing game they've brought us.

It includes common things that people may know from other platforms, such as the Stranger Things bundle from Netflix. Dead By Daylight is very fun to play, whether it is with friends or by yourself. Though, while playing solo, there are many issues. The communication is obviously whack because there are little ways you can communicate, such as using the \"point\" option and the \"follow me\" option. This can affect how the game play is a little bit, but there shouldn't be any reason to dislike it. Sometimes the matchmaking system is pretty messed up as well, such as a rank 10 player playing with a rank 1. Asides that, it is pretty smooth and a very great game.","timestamp_created":1574994399,"timestamp_updated":1591478700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58509105","author":{"steamid":"76561198843793965","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":664,"last_played":1635691095},"language":"russian","review":"Топчг","timestamp_created":1574994346,"timestamp_updated":1574994346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58508916","author":{"steamid":"76561198193862890","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1594125841},"language":"russian","review":"Смерть — это не выход","timestamp_created":1574994205,"timestamp_updated":1574994205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58508763","author":{"steamid":"76561198159684646","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":24384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19623,"last_played":1626286000},"language":"english","review":"?","timestamp_created":1574994089,"timestamp_updated":1574994089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58508753","author":{"steamid":"76561198252312834","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":20800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4887,"last_played":1658422510},"language":"brazilian","review":"pica 👍","timestamp_created":1574994079,"timestamp_updated":1574994079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58508535","author":{"steamid":"76561198151289154","num_games_owned":538,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":22183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12901,"last_played":1656743206},"language":"english","review":"People are toxic and I love it","timestamp_created":1574993911,"timestamp_updated":1574993911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58508296","author":{"steamid":"76561198835301375","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2442,"last_played":1630297019},"language":"latam","review":"Es un juegardo","timestamp_created":1574993732,"timestamp_updated":1574993732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58506748","author":{"steamid":"76561198177306307","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":49985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41775,"last_played":1657287940},"language":"english","review":"wow cant imagine ever being camped for 'looping'. nah, never would happen :)","timestamp_created":1574992581,"timestamp_updated":1574992581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58506663","author":{"steamid":"76561198052377409","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10048,"last_played":1627168668},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1574992513,"timestamp_updated":1574992513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58506287","author":{"steamid":"76561198278435295","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":48192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":193,"playtime_at_review":10306,"last_played":1660447686},"language":"english","review":"Bad game.

As a killer main i understand that you need to do that against a sweaty 4man swf on comms with the 4 mambo jambo and that is not fun, they literally join the server, do 5 gens in 4 min and they don't even interact with the killer and that basically are the \"Top MMR games\" so it's a lot of fun for sure.\n\n\nBOONS - Legit the worst mechanic BHVR came with. We already had ranger medickits, bottany and will make it and BHVR decide to put the game even more survivor sided by creating self-care in a toten. Even after the nerfs, it's still an OP perk in every scenario, if someone heals you, it's still faster than using self-care. To not mention the shadow-step one that in some maps combined with Iron Will, well good luck tracking people if your tracking as killer is not that good.\n\n\nTOXICITY - After playing basically 3 years of DBD and i'm gonna say this by my experience of course, most of my end-game chat experiences were very toxic! I don't think people know how to win/lose on videogames and they take DBD 2 seriously that so they say random toxic stuff to people that they just faced for the first time for 15 minutes. Rare were the cases that i had people showing sportmanship and saying gg even me playing as killer and tunneling or camping because i had to, not because i enjoy that playstyle i really don't, but sometimes you gotta do it. Because of the previous i disabled my end-game chat from now on.\n\n\nUltimately the game is still fun, but i don't really recommend it for new players, especially if you're thinking playing killer, you gonna have a hard time when you get to \"High MMR\" and it's not worth it, there's so many more options on the table.\n\nCheers!","timestamp_created":1574990107,"timestamp_updated":1651928552,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508130073547363281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58503265","author":{"steamid":"76561198977452910","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1624372538},"language":"turkish","review":"çok zevkli bir oyun","timestamp_created":1574989868,"timestamp_updated":1574989868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58503021","author":{"steamid":"76561198068356544","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1650993567},"language":"russian","review":"Если Вы любитель хоррора, и всегда хотели обыграть ситуацию в фильме Крик, Улица Вязов или Ночь на Хеллуин, эта игра определённо для Вас!
