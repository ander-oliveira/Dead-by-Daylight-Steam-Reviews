wouldn't recommend this game if you get upset easily. Fanbase is full of toxic players, devs refuse to address any major issues with the game and instead completely change things that don't need to be changed. They reward players for bad/toxic behavior and the played base is slowly dying.\n\nThe community likes to tear each other apart blaming the other party (killer/survivor). I've played both and can easily say each is extremely toxic. No matter how fair you play people are going to find a way to sh!t on you. Killers will facecamp, tunnel, and occasionally target certain people/survivors for petty/malicious reasons. Survivors will sabotage their teammates and be extremely toxic towards killers/other survivors.\n\nHere are a few incidents I've had with people:\nSFW (organized group of friends) who will hold the game hostage and their only purpose is to bully the killer and try to make them rage quit/bully them\nTrolls will sometimes target TTV's (streamers) to try and get a \"reaction\" out of them or ruin their game\nSurvivors will sandbag/sabotage their teammates and often teabag/bm killers to try and make them rage quit/DC because they think it's funny\n\nOne of the worst parts is end game chat, people will often insult or ridicule each other after a match. If you're on the same platform as someone else they will sometimes send you hateful messages through the platform itself. As a TTV (Twitch Streamer) I've even had people come into my stream and insult me and my viewers.\n\nThis next one only really applies to TTV's but I've had a few incidents of stream sniping or being targeted in game because I had TTV in my name. Yes I've actually come a cross a few killers named things like \"Twitch Camper\" or \"TTV Tunneler\" who only targeted me and tried to get a reaction out of me on stream.\n\nLastly is the bugs/hackers. A while ago their was a HUGE hacking issue on both ends. Killers would hack to get guaranteed kills and survivors would hack to get guaranteed escapes or hold a game hostage to troll/bully a killer. Also there have been people who will use minor/small unnoticeable hacks (I've caught people on stream using them) and if you catch them they will accuse you of being petty and imagining things.\n\nThe hacker issue seems to have been fixed as of lately but since then there have been a rise in bugs. It seems they create 5 bugs for every 1 they fix. And sometimes if people find a bug they will exploit it for their own benefit and often post it on social media so that others can also abuse it.\n\nOverall it is a good game and I do enjoy playing it (sometimes) but they need to start listening to their community. The game has been slowly losing players and it seems all that's left is toxic players with devs who make new cosmetics every 10 seconds instead of balancing and making their game more enjoyable again.","timestamp_created":1655528456,"timestamp_updated":1655528456,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117162667","author":{"steamid":"76561199096815584","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2321,"last_played":1658817433},"language":"english","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1655527979,"timestamp_updated":1655527979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117162514","author":{"steamid":"76561198316201942","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":456,"playtime_at_review":5658,"last_played":1660377603},"language":"schinese","review":"很刺激哟~","timestamp_created":1655527670,"timestamp_updated":1655527670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117162397","author":{"steamid":"76561199120443163","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1655528802},"language":"english","review":"w

There is such a huge difference and divide between good and bad perks in this game, which just encourages players to perform and play in the most scummy way possible. BHVR seems to have a horrible time in balancing anything because they ONLY listen to survivors opinions. Why do maps like cowshed and mothers dwelling exist? Why do they balancing every perk around the top 3 killers? Why do all the killer mains leave the game? It's because they ONLY listen to survivors opinions. Most maps are ridiculously survivor friendly and when you finally outplay a survivor, they will just use DH. Oh? The game is going south so the killer makes a strategic decision to kill someone quickly? BT into DH into DS into pallet stun. Don't wanna eat the DS? Oh, don't worry. Just slug them and they will use UNB. \n\nAnytime the killer wins, it's just a hurl of insults towards the killer, from slurs to death threats. Survivors always cry about how they didn't have a fun time if/when they lose, while saying some of the most obscene and stupid things through a very poorly made censorship system. They will never consider a killers fun and feelings, so why should a killer consider survivors fun? Survivors will 4 man stack SWF, while all bring BNP (Nothing wrong with this play style) and get annoyed when the killer rushes their objective to kill them? It's constant irony. Honestly, maybe if the toxicity wasn't so high the game would be much more TOLERABLE. Not fun. TOLERABLE. \n\nDue to the fact, that killers are leaving, the survivor solo queues are overwhelmingly long. Once you've finally entered a match, to then be immediately tunnelled, camped and killed, it ruins the entire experience and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. There's nothing wrong with this play style, but when the games are shorter than the queues, survivors never get a chance to learn/play and as a result become toxic and short tempered. I can't imagine the experience of a poor 40 year old father that comes home and finally has 40 minutes to spare, and decides to boot up DBD to be welcomed with 20 minute queue times, 5 minute matches, same 3 killers, and stagnant meta builds on everyone.","timestamp_created":1655519635,"timestamp_updated":1655546968,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":172,"votes_funny":34,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663033366203308105","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157926","author":{"steamid":"76561198814747846","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6958,"last_played":1656264071},"language":"schinese","review":"第五人皇遛爆杀鸡屠屠","timestamp_created":1655519540,"timestamp_updated":1655519540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157762","author":{"steamid":"76561198964553746","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":72,"playtime_at_review":6620,"last_played":1659906466},"language":"english","review":"It's aight.","timestamp_created":1655519296,"timestamp_updated":1655519296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157423","author":{"steamid":"76561198451836025","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":72690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":71788,"last_played":1660435840},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1655518725,"timestamp_updated":1655518725,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157372","author":{"steamid":"76561198876908929","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":54063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":370,"playtime_at_review":51302,"last_played":1660409898},"language":"brazilian","review":"se dibrar fosse um jogo, dbd seria o ronaldinho.","timestamp_created":1655518640,"timestamp_updated":1655518640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157299","author":{"steamid":"76561199086494649","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":616,"playtime_at_review":8272,"last_played":1660009135},"language":"english","review":"its so addicting and fun!","timestamp_created":1655518512,"timestamp_updated":1655518512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157216","author":{"steamid":"76561198267869420","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9547,"last_played":1656699808},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo tem susto, trabalho em equipe e diversão. 10/10","timestamp_created":1655518353,"timestamp_updated":1655518353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157123","author":{"steamid":"76561198076716592","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1656317542},"language":"english","review":"sh1t game tbh","timestamp_created":1655518189,"timestamp_updated":1656125644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517302572727203369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117157066","author":{"steamid":"76561198121406324","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":39896,"last_played":1659548096},"language":"english","review":"I hate this game so much but I've spent too much money on it to stop playing.
