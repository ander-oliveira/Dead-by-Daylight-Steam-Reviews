from good review to bad) the game has become hot garbage, bs hitbox, bs internet problems that the game tries to tie on us, random CTD's that will for whatever reason still ban you from matchmaking, I've had well...... 5 crashes that whenever I come back the game has prohibited me from playing for a longer period of time consecutively each time.\n\nNew killers that aren't licensed are aither recycled ideas or just forgotten trash killers, had plenty of matches where I somehow get dunked on by the lamest player just because their killer was not properly implemented, want some examples? okay.\n\nThe artist: maybe I'm just unlucky as shit but half the artists I come across are crow spammers, campers, whiny babies post chat cause their start didn't work, or just get a bs hit from a corner angle because their weird swing animation, which looks like she swing her arm as a blade, but there is some dark goo shit that counts as part of her hitbox which makes unclear if she hit you or not, also also not to mention the bs few inches of distance, this seems like a major general issue more than nothing.\n\nThe dredge is more of the same, except it is a better Onryo, semi-nurse cause of his limitless teleportation, also same bs hitbox mechanism, some of these derranged players are pretty damn good which by far I believe makes him the best killer at the moment.\n\nthe Onryo: I've seen many instances where I get tagged by a killer from yards away after; vaulting a window, vaulting a fence from a second floor, or vaulting a pallet with just about every killer, even if my ping is 24ms but none of them compare to the onry, besides her stupid \"hit\" animation, she is literally a invisible ghost, can't turn invisible for a long period of time, shorter than the spirit, sneakier, shittier hitbox, which makes her a dumb killer to go against.\n\nNow it seems I'm ranting as a survivor, but in reality I got nothing to say whenever I play as killer, maybe cause of the issue I've stated, I mostly just play Oni cause he is the only killer I play very well. Any other killer requires you to become a sweat lord unless you were already proficient with them here I'll type down my personal experience with the four base ones for new players.\n\nThe Trapper feels like the type of killer that whenever you're looking for traps and places to trap, the moment you initiate your first chase, three gens get popped for some reason, like what do you want me to do BHVR not trap loops? it is astonishing how quick you'll lose a match for a few wasted seconds. so I'd suggest using perks such as corrupt intervention, look it up.\n\nthe hillbilly feels a bit off, you can play him very good, except some maps are not his forte at all, and you'll be basically hitting every damn invisible hitbox from left over crates, also he is horrible around loops with 2 windows and a pallet nearby.\n\nthe nurse is a rough one, she is hard to learn.... very, but once mastered it is plenty of satisfying, but should you ever stop playing her, you'll forget how to use her and will have to learn her again, I'm not taking in consideration all the countless hours you have to play as her to even learn a bit.\n\nthe wraith isn't bad, NO, it just he really needs some sweat poured on your keyboard, mostly because against good loopers you will always lose a neuron, they will always find a way to ruin your day as he has got not looping capabilities besides his bing bong that gives him a speed boost, but there's certain loops where you're just going to have to accept a defeat.\n\nand the last one would be the Huntress, now by all means she is dangerous af in the right hand, her hatchet hitbox is bs I reckon that, but this is BHVR we're talking about here, they would rather release an infinite number of dumb cosmetics, argue whether a fictional character is gay or not, than to fix their own damn game, anyways if you're going to play the huntress, always try to hatchet even if you encounter someone and you've got them right in front of your face, trust me they'll love it,\n\nAlso personal rant, all perks that are being \"reworked\" I want to say 🖕🖕 you BHVR, I've seen this before in rainbow six siege where a company kills a game over a chart, this would've never happened if all perks where balanced in the first place... as in pros and cons.\n","timestamp_created":1594082693,"timestamp_updated":1657154788,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72197273","author":{"steamid":"76561198846746406","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1603312629},"language":"russian","review":"Мне все говорят туннелер, кемпер, убил всех урод, а когда выжившие приседают, кликают фонариками, ливают, генрашад им никто ничего не говорит.","timestamp_created":1594082364,"timestamp_updated":1594082364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72197228","author":{"steamid":"76561198240653756","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":20673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":54,"playtime_at_review":4788,"last_played":1660240308},"language":"english","review":"This gmae is defnitly one of the scarest games ive ever played. almsot shit myslef when playing alone at 9:30 (past my bedtime!!)","timestamp_created":1594082302,"timestamp_updated":1594082302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72196945","author":{"steamid":"76561199033300423","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":77916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51821,"last_played":1628476576},"language":"brazilian","review":"no começo da para  perceber que o jogo é ruim mas quando vc joga mais um pouco vc tem certeza.\nass: exausto no chão ;)","timestamp_created":1594081912,"timestamp_updated":1594081912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72196688","author":{"steamid":"76561198175068917","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1644788204},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo bom, da susto.

They would rather not admit that their hitboxes fucking suck and the killers in general are too unfair. Not only that, but you have killers that can easily use abilities to 1-hit down survivors and other killers that prove a survivors skills worthless. For example, you could play against the doctor and Lose him, 360 him and whatever other in game slang you want to use. You could completely bamboozle the fuck and then wait.. HE CROSS MAP SHOCKS YOU and then he knows where you are again. I come back to this game time and time again simply to play 1 match, and want to kill myself.

Mas los otros asesinos intrínsecos del juego, sí.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1594072739,"timestamp_updated":1594072739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72190380","author":{"steamid":"76561199064198262","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1646966088},"language":"spanish","review":"BUERNAAAARDOO","timestamp_created":1594072689,"timestamp_updated":1594072689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72190162","author":{"steamid":"76561198018719873","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5221,"last_played":1630980050},"language":"french","review":"Pretty good competitive asymmetrical multiplayer game. The horror feel doesn't last for long, but the simple yet effective gameplay keeps it entertaining. The game doesn't feel stale even after 80+ hours poured into it.
