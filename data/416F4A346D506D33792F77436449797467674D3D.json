It is in the best state it has ever been, however, this game is still wonky due to horrible PR decisions and spaghetti code. The game is now unplayable on console and the anti-cheat makes sbmm riddled with (in my experience) subtle/obvious speedhacks on survivors and teleportation/noclip with killers. I remember back when there were infinites on every single map and now there is a cheating prick every 10-15 matches. I would recommend this game if it wasn't for BHVR's recent actions. Now everytime there is a game breaking bug or a string of code that fucks up a model we are treated to bloodpoint codes on twitter and a hotfix that breaks more shit. BHVR since the release of Pinhead has decided to participate in NFT's and crypto, which is shady business that is horrible for the environment and climate change due to the sheer processing power required to copy and paste NFT's, a single internet trading card is equal to that of more than a month's worth of electricity. This is genuinely the first time I have felt obligated to stop supporting a company and I am disgusted that my fucking money is being used to support crypto. I have bought dlc's TWICE and little did I know my money was eventually going to be apart of underground dealings and climate change. I just wish the devs would stop riding the money and start hiring competent programmers and testers.

been following Dead by Daylight for a good amount of time, and recently only began to play it myself. The game play loop is satisfying, character unlocks/progression is a massive grind but manageable if you are willing to put in some time and the perks you can unlock feel powerful and change the game significantly (whether that's a good or bad thing, to be determined IMO.) \n\nPlaying Survivor is enjoyable with friends but manageable (if not sometimes frustrating) to play as a solo player. You are expected to hold your weight in getting objectives complete and are allowed a wide range of options in how you wish to play to achieve these objectives. Bring strong items to rush through generators? Heal through the damage dealt by the killer? Hide and stalk around the corners of the map? All can be done to varying degrees of success and provide different avenues to find your own brand of fun in the game. Playing Killer is an entirely different experience, with a large learning curve on necessary skills/abilities in order to not get bullied by the survivors.\n\nI understand a lot of people are worried and upset by the recent news that the Hellraiser DLC was brought to the game in part to do with an agreement with the License Holders to allow their model to be sold off as an NFT.\nWhile you can shun BHVR for signing into this type of contract in the first place, the worst thing they have done in this instance is the fact that people were not informed prior to the release of the DLC that its release would be contingent on this agreement with the license holder. I hope that they provide the opportunity for people to receive refunds based on that knowledge. \nOtherwise, BHVR are upholding an agreement that allowed them to get the character into the game before his licensing becomes very muddy and unclear as to when/if they would have the chance to obtain the right to use his license in the future. In my own opinion, NFTs and similar schemes are a slippery slope that can be abused/used for profits and are not wholly consumer/environmentally friendly under the worst/sketchiest of circumstances and were it publicly known that this was the method used to obtain the license, I personally would have preferred we not receive the character at all.\n\nHowever, this in itself does not tarnish the game itself. Dead by Daylight is a majorly enjoyable experience to watch, play, and invest time into mastering.","timestamp_created":1634633625,"timestamp_updated":1634633625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495033115148544312","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101285870","author":{"steamid":"76561198935354480","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1012,"playtime_at_review":8927,"last_played":1660558785},"language":"koreana","review":"너.무.나.도.재.밌.어.요. 갓.겜 !!!!!!","timestamp_created":1634633522,"timestamp_updated":1634633522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101285813","author":{"steamid":"76561198886279002","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3489,"last_played":1654178834},"language":"russian","review":"норм","timestamp_created":1634633372,"timestamp_updated":1634633372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101285700","author":{"steamid":"76561199058882441","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19964,"last_played":1652371883},"language":"english","review":"This game has always had its fair share of struggles when I started playing back in january 2019 (at the time I had a different account). I am now at a combined 2k hours of play and am at a point where I can't stay silent anymore. \nFrom gamebreaking bugs to insane balance disrepancies, DBD has never been *good*. But it used to be *fun*. This is no longer the case and I highly recommend you look elsewhere (possibly VHS and/or Identity V) for a fun asymmetrical horror experience.\n\nSo, what has changed?:\n- After the latest patch, all you'll run into is hackers. Especially at high MMR. They're not subtle about it either, literally blinding you for the entire game or escaping once you spawn into the map. Sending in footage of these hackers doesnt do anything. Reporting doesnt do anything. BHVR refuses to respond.\n\n- The MMR system judges you based on your escape rating which killers can deny for you specifically without you being able to do anything about it. For killers, MMR judges you based on kills. Not on gen pressure, not on how fast you end chases, but just kills. Which, once again, is not an accurate rating of skill.\n\n- Money pumped into the game was then put towards a lincensing deal with Boss Protocol for the Pinhead DLC.... and its resulting NFTs. Which was then endorsed and supported on their public Twitter. Dead by Daylight is knowingly promoting a money laundering and environmentally damaging scam that Steam has openly denounced, and therefore should not even be on the platform.\n\nAlongside this, the community itself is such a toxic cesspool that even in the forums or discord servers, without so much as touching the game, you'll find yourself angry, annoyed and frustrated at those around you and the developers themselves. We have been screaming for changes for years but it falls on deaf ears.\n\nDo not buy this game. \n- The devs dont care about a fun gameplay experience, \n- The community would dance on your grave for simply playing the game\n- You're supporting NFTs which are a scam\n- The game itself is a never-ending grind of misery.\n\nIf you love yourself and want to be happy, please run as far away from this horrid thing as possible. The biggest horror experience in DBD is DBD itself.","timestamp_created":1634633124,"timestamp_updated":1634633124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645434677600860596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101285541","author":{"steamid":"76561199101884889","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":143,"playtime_at_review":938,"last_played":1660491530},"language":"tchinese","review":"NFTs？\n最智障的決定之一！","timestamp_created":1634632753,"timestamp_updated":1634632753,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532538950443267822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101285434","author":{"steamid":"76561197996741762","num_games_owned":567,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":12665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":7818,"last_played":1659398274},"language":"english","review":"VHS waiting room.","timestamp_created":1634632477,"timestamp_updated":1634632477,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555352866649627686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101285291","author":{"steamid":"76561198147016354","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":35086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1295,"playtime_at_review":15702,"last_played":1660542186},"language":"english","review":"Add the vampire and werewolf killer BHVR","timestamp_created":1634632160,"timestamp_updated":1634632160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101284899","author":{"steamid":"76561198216834013","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":134603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120359,"last_played":1658756361},"language":"danish","review":"The American govourment cares more for their homeless population, than BHVR cares for the quality and balance of their game","timestamp_created":1634631236,"timestamp_updated":1634631291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534117639064788818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101284838","author":{"steamid":"76561199094430548","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3809,"playtime_at_review":9742,"last_played":1660602004},"language":"english","review":"np","timestamp_created":1634631083,"timestamp_updated":1634631083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101284656","author":{"steamid":"76561198069355880","num_games_owned":906,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1705,"last_played":1656240564},"language":"russian","review":"Обычно, сессии в этой игре заканчиваются вот так:\n[i] \"Тётенька, что вы делаете?

I was never really into multiplayer games because I've played so many bad ones and I've felt the same about this one too. Never really clicked with me the first time. I was bad as a survivor and horrible rather than horrifying playing as a killer. Then I started playing with a couple of friends as survivors showing me the ropes of the offerings, blood-points, perks, and objectives of the game. After that the rest as they say is history. I've had some great moments playing this game including one where we've manged to get all the generators up'n running and one of my friends were trapped within a cage by The Executioner I looked at the open escape gate and looked back at the other side of the map where my friend was being held and what seemed like an eternity of thinking whether if I should save them or escape I decided to risk it and go save them. We manged to escape and that is a memorable moment that you could only experience within a game like Dead by Daylight and it makes crave more games like this after putting twenty hours into it which is still not as much as some hardcore try-hards out there with hundreds of hours but considering I usually jump from game to game it is a lot. So far I've only bought a couple of killers one of them came with one survivor at least you don't really need to own characters as long as you learn to play one efficiently but if you want more perks I can see how that might sway you to buy more and switch things up a bit and keep it fresh by learning a new survivor or killer. Playing as a killer can bring you joy or rage depending on who you play as and if you are good at playing as them or the survivors are just try-hards I use to be horrible playing as the killer but after acquiring the doctor as my main and getting a decent perk set up no one is safe cause no one can escape I don't know if I just gotten better as a killer or the survivors I'm matched with are usually bad or just don't know how to counter the doctor at all.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall this game has been a great experience for me especially since there really isn't a multiplayer experience out there for me. This game provides an experience that you don't normally get nowadays I never knew that I needed to become a survivor suffering from anxiety because Michael Myers wants to sacrifice me to the entity or becoming the new face of fear and enjoying the thrill of the hunt as a killer and for me that is what makes a game great an experience that can only be done within interactive media such as games and it is an experience that I haven't witnessed in any other game nor will it be an experience I'll forget anytime soon.\n\n","timestamp_created":1634626425,"timestamp_updated":1634626425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282810","author":{"steamid":"76561198355402615","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":77617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1542,"playtime_at_review":36942,"last_played":1660463234},"language":"english","review":"don't do it to yourself, especially right now there are a lot of hackers in the game. the higher you climb in rank the worse it gets, devs seem to not give a shit even though this game makes them big bank. only reason i play this shit is because i have no life and silent hill will never see the light of day again.","timestamp_created":1634626026,"timestamp_updated":1634626026,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502534747123718262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282748","author":{"steamid":"76561199007220823","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":110529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":309,"playtime_at_review":60196,"last_played":1659994861},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo MUITO bom, excelente para passar o tempo.

В ней можно попробовать себя в самых разных ролях, как за убийцу, так и за выжившего. Сама по себе игра да, циклична, цели постоянно одни и те же, но вот пути их достижения все-таки разные. Количество играющих пока стабильно, катки конечно приходится ждать, но не критично. Игра не супер-пупер-ня-кавай, графика глаза не режет.  Лаги бывают, вылеты, оооочень долго ставятся обновы и увы и ах, но читеры тоже крайне редко, но попадаются. Однако если брать, допустим, за основу мою 1000 часов, то 900 из них, это точно положительные эмоции, веселье и смех. Конечно, многое зависит от того, с кем ты играешь и как.  Рандомы бывают реально бесячие, но найдя свою компанию, удовольствие от игры гарантировано.  \nПоговорим о двух направлениях игры: выживших и убийц.\n А именно, начнем с выживших. Начиная от роли а-ля «Я-Аптечка, я-я-аптечка», до разных « Я бегун 100 лвл-а», « Ген-техник хоть куда!», « Ща слепану-мало не покажется» и прочее, можно и коллективным игроком быть и в общем-то, не очень.  Первоначальная задача конечно- коллективная и сплочённая игра ( что достигается при игре с друзьями, с рандомами в разы тяжелее), но ни кто не отменял того, что как и в реале, кто-то получает удовольствие будучи той еще сцукой и твариночкой. Последнее подразумевает под собой, бегать в одну моську, сидеть по шкафам и ждать люк, подставлять других и намеренно водить маньяка к выжившим, стопить свою команду, никого не снимать с крюков и намеренно сливать других в надежде, что маньяк оценит и отпустит, что кстати не факт (будучи маньяком, таких лично я, напротив сливаю первыми). А можно быть пусечкой и лапочкой, чинить геники, спасать с крюков, лечить, подставляться, ачивки за это получать и всеобщую любовь.  Не слишком токсича и раздражая маньяка, примерно в 25% можно обзавестись его благосклонностью и он под конец игры отпустит свалить в люк или через ворота. Собственно, если получать удовольствие от самого процесса игры, а не только исключительно побега, то игра заходит на ура. Персонажи разные, скинчики бывают прекрасные, можно комбинировать, навыков достаточно много, так что есть из чего выбрать. Даже не обязательно весь доп. контент покупать для этого. \n Если говорить о маньяках, то тут малость по сложнее и психологически, поводов подгореть больше. Во-первых, признай- ты гад, который хочет всех убить и тебя заведомо никто не любит, хочешь ты того или нет.  Даже если отпускать выживших, они все равно будут не довольны. Убил- «Сволочь! Ты читер, кемпер,тунеллер! А вообще! Это не ты хорошо играешь, это палета лаганула, инет провис и т.д.» Отпустил- «Гад, ты слабак и меня не уважаешь чтолеее??? Ну прям ииизиииии» и все в этом духе. Во-вторых, у маньяков разный стиль игры и здесь одними навыками не обойдешься. Для определенной техники, нужен определенный персонаж. Так допустим, Деревенщина с бензопилой, никогда не станет метать топорики и т.д ( если не читерить конечно). Придется покупать дополнения и не все они покупаются за внутриигровую валюту. Плюс, как я уже сказала выше, тебя покроют самыми разными словами за не соблюдение выдуманными самими игроками правил по типу « не бегать за одним, не стоять у крюка» и.т.д. Можно конечно и тут словить милоты, особенно если убил троих и отпустил последнего, но милота случается реже, чем негатив. Так что стоит хорошо подумать, достаточно ли ты сегодня стрессоустойчивый. Компенсацией негативу выступает собственное поглаженное ЭГО « Я смог! Вы все мертвы, глупцы!». \nСобственно если снова обобщать, то лично мне, игра зашла и очень даже.  Можно приноровиться ко всему, научиться многому и найти хорошую компанию бегая по фану и получая удовольствие. А можно зайти, подгореть пару раз и забить, исходя ядом. Выбор у каждого свой! \nПриятной игры! :3\n","timestamp_created":1634625798,"timestamp_updated":1634625798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516379833221435547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282693","author":{"steamid":"76561198035861325","num_games_owned":1409,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1493,"last_played":1642187427},"language":"english","review":"The only NFTs I deal in are Nerds in the Fucking Trash.","timestamp_created":1634625765,"timestamp_updated":1634625765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536069512367248535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282621","author":{"steamid":"76561197997548581","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":113527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113527,"last_played":1634625237},"language":"english","review":"HOLY MICRO-TRANSACTIONS BLANK MAN!\n\n\n\ndo not give these devs your money\n\nthey are more focused on maintaining a constant stream of cosmetics to sell than fixing long time issues with the game","timestamp_created":1634625572,"timestamp_updated":1634627394,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532974302768707275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282530","author":{"steamid":"76561199207385054","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1638775666},"language":"english","review":"nemisis is goated","timestamp_created":1634625306,"timestamp_updated":1634625306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282432","author":{"steamid":"76561198011354215","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":91,"playtime_at_review":23946,"last_played":1660459589},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1634625014,"timestamp_updated":1634625014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101282376","author":{"steamid":"76561198219989757","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":44496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3114,"playtime_at_review":22423,"last_played":1660597211},"language":"english","review":"Beware BHVR is partnering to sell NFTs -

The game is nigh unplayable without a specific set of perks, the community is toxic, the devs seemingly have no interest in fixing issues that have been around for years. This game is not a positive experience overall.\n\nI have personally dumped this game as the devs seem more interested in actively antagonizing their community members rather than cooperating to fix the game. That isn't to mention that they refuse to implement any way to stop hackers. A twitch streamer who criticizes them gets their twitch cosmetics removed instantly, but hackers are allowed to terrorize servers and ruin high mmr play. Sorry BHVR, a bloodhunt isn't going to make everyone forget how you neglect the game.

I've always thought they know what they're doing, things are hard, and I wanted to see the game continue to succeed with cool licenses and amazing original creations. \n\nYet, I can't support them anymore. The news of BHVR endorsing NFTs is not only morally reprehensible but it's downright tone-deaf. I'm hoping and PRAYING that this was a very not-thought out thing and it was pushed by some fuckboy in the office who reached out to an NFT branch and the producers just went \"What? Sure yeah whatever sounds okay\" without digging into it. \n\nI'm not gonna get into the many reasons why NFTs are scummy, you can go research that rabbit hole by yourselves, but what I will say is that it's the most greed-minded practice since lootboxes. It fucking sucks. \n\nNo surprise to see former devs and large community members come out to express disapproval of this. It's a crying shame.
