Yes, not only because it is engaging, provides a few tense moments, and has a sound design that is extremely well implemented, but frankly we need more people to play it. For it's good points, of which it has numerous, it really does need some work in a few areas, here are a few suggestions:\n\n* Work out your rank system. There's really no point to it at the moment other than it being a sort of \"badge of honour.\" When being paired up, new survivors who've never played get put together with Rank 1 Killers who have over 300 hours logged on the game. Same with new killers and survivors.\n\n* Remove the Map Offerings, they're practically useless.\n\n* Fix hook-camping. This is such a common complaint and it is so obvious why after you play a few \"trials.\" What I mean by fix is, when the killer is within a certain distance of a hooked survivor for an extended time, they should move slower or be blinded by the \"entity,\" \"dark mist,\" or whatever. Perks in the Killer's set can be used to lessen it, but by the time that kind of perk shows up the person playing as a killer will have no reason to use it. Similar to when survivors make lots of noise after they've been hit or leave a scratch trail when running that can be lessened with certain perks.\n\n* Make the disconnection penalty much worse. If I leave a lobby, I have to wait 5 seconds before rejoining (and most of the time I leave because I have a bad connection to the host or have to go, so this penalty is reasonable to me), however, if I disconnect in the middle of the game, there is NO penalty. Also, when you get into a game and 3/4 survivors have already disconnected and it's just me and 5 generators, the difficulty is near impossible.\n\n* Before bringing out new DLC, fix what you have.\n\n* Allow players to join from all different countries. Once we're in game, we can't communicate anyway (unless it's in weird dance code like bumblebees) so the language barrier isn't a problem. I only say this because most afternoons I can't get a single lobby, despite there being 13,000 players online.\n\nIn saying that, this is a good game. It's fun to play, and each trial is unique in that every killer and survivor plays differently, and offers something different.","timestamp_created":1473336538,"timestamp_updated":1473336538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25409516","author":{"steamid":"76561198323155523","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2605,"last_played":1491318460},"language":"schinese","review":"我 游戏异地登陆 好像前几天 然后 就被 封号了   怎么 解决啊    我没开外挂    卸载重装也不行   我也没开加血之类的软件 8月4号买的  9号我玩LOL没关杀机后退LOL切回杀机就显示被封禁？禁了说是VAC或游戏什么的 我没开插件外挂之类禁我号 不能玩 只能登陆看不懂 也没客服也是醉了 5天40个小时82块  平均2.1元 1小时是不是我在冲钱点在给我玩 ？ 真是一杆子打翻一船人 我辛辛苦苦玩了5天用屠夫把人类冲到21级 禁了  厉害！我绝对没开插件和外挂！ 就人类垃圾19段21级3技能被举报的把 真瞎!","timestamp_created":1473335734,"timestamp_updated":1473357730,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25409379","author":{"steamid":"76561198177498979","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":371735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2389,"playtime_at_review":187184,"last_played":1660602561},"language":"polish","review":"Dead By Daylight jest jedyną grą, która mnie aż tak wciągnęła, że gram już od 2016 roku do teraz i nadal mi się nie znudziła.

Let me tell you my story in a couple of rows or more.\n\nI bought this game for the first time about half a month after it first came out because I was hyped and it looked pretty good. (It still does) I played 2 hours where I did experienced quite some fun, but the countless crashes while in-game or in lobby left a bad taste in my mouth and I refunded the game, knowing that I will buy it again some time soon after they fix the problems.\n\nI bought the game again about a month and a half after I refunded it for the first time because I kept reading the update news and articles and I was really into what the developers were doing with the game, what happened? I never even played the game again because the developers fucked the lobby system so hard that I can't even join or create a lobby, I've been trying for a week and no results whatsoever. This game is simply still in alpha mode, either though the developers don't tell you that. Basically my advice to everyone who happened to read my review, stay away from games with Starbreeze's name on them, either though they look good and have a good concept and gameplay, they will either be filled with unlimited amounts of glitches and crashes and anything, or they will be filled with microtransactions and be turned into another cash-grab shithole. Just look at what happened to PAYDAY 2, you'll get my point. Do I like the game? Sure. Do I recommend it? No, not until they REALLY fix the problems with it.","timestamp_created":1473328379,"timestamp_updated":1473328379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25408228","author":{"steamid":"76561198316568228","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1631,"last_played":1486095670},"language":"schinese","review":"一进游戏 就说有外挂 然后退出 这怎么搞--","timestamp_created":1473327064,"timestamp_updated":1473327064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25407434","author":{"steamid":"76561198297161186","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1498885625},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, не всем подойдёт.\n","timestamp_created":1473320469,"timestamp_updated":1473320469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512064814567565918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25407141","author":{"steamid":"76561198151447050","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":33069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1326,"last_played":1654187145},"language":"english","review":"its awesome!!!","timestamp_created":1473317629,"timestamp_updated":1473317629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421661168336868286","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25407039","author":{"steamid":"76561198055136190","num_games_owned":480,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":7121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6564,"last_played":1614651793},"language":"english","review":"I'm updating my review...

I will say that I am a bit dissapointed the developers are making more killers from Copyrighted work.  Although it can be cool to see a killer from a movie you like, I think the game should just focus more on original killers, make something cool.

Whether playing as killer or survivor, the game doesn't feel one-sided. While the survivors have the advantage early due to numbers, as the match goes on, surviving becomes much more difficult as you become a target. The only problems I found with the game are perks and skill-based match-making. Perks are either obtained by leveling your charecter, or drops, starting the game with none, a new player is possibly at a disadvantage based on luck, though I feel perks don't usually determine a match. As with skill-based match-making, there is none. A new player can be easily intimidated by a level-20 hunter, as players are thrown in a first come first served basis.

Просто получай езды, виси на крюках и туши свой зад от бомбежки. \n\n3 бага из 10.","timestamp_created":1473278967,"timestamp_updated":1473279514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576079785823822021","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25401774","author":{"steamid":"76561198302174950","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1450,"last_played":1638708193},"language":"schinese","review":"很 不错的游戏好多人在线，我很喜欢。","timestamp_created":1473278914,"timestamp_updated":1473278914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25401713","author":{"steamid":"76561198079370316","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":102939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1116,"playtime_at_review":78381,"last_played":1660481004},"language":"english","review":"murder is okay","timestamp_created":1473278702,"timestamp_updated":1631119448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25401442","author":{"steamid":"76561198299382626","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1814,"last_played":1629823298},"language":"thai","review":"-0-","timestamp_created":1473277380,"timestamp_updated":1473277380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25401352","author":{"steamid":"76561198166594373","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1643234772},"language":"english","review":"The game is fucking amazing unless you have the killers friends giving your location away to the killer and them both gaining points by raping you","timestamp_created":1473277003,"timestamp_updated":1473277003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25401341","author":{"steamid":"76561198053836015","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1508700855},"language":"english","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS\n\nYou see, i have 1 hour on my account of this game, and only 20 minutes of that consisted of playing the game.
