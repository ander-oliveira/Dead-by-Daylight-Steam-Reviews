Still, it would be unfair to keep my previous review. Release was more stable and new content was actually balanced and enjoyable. Looks like a decent step towards better experience. \n\n----\nI've waited some time before sharing this opinion. I didn't want it to be skewed by first impressions or unfortunate accidents. Sadly it appears \"unfortunate accidents\" are just new chapters.\n\nAnyway, this is probably the best asymmetrical horror game available as for now, since no other game survived and VHS is still in closed alpha. It can be enjoyable and interesting at times. You can play it for few hours and be happy and entertained in the end. It's possible. What's wrong then?\n\n1. Balance and first steps. \nThis genre proves to be difficult to balance. For new players being a survivor is usually very difficult and they might be convinced that this game extremely favors killers, but as they progress they notice it's not true. Still, the entry skill level might be discouraging for some people. There is no COOP vs AI mode, so as soon as you finish tutorial, you are on your own and you must play PVP games, which are usually not the best place for first steps. You can play custom games with friends, assuming you have at least 4 of them. Balance itself is heavily changed by perks - band aids introduced to counter certain playstyles and behaviors which stem from faulty design. \n\n2. Perks and progress. \nEach killer and survivor comes with 3 unique perks - passive or active abilities that enhance or change gameplay in some way, or force opponent to adopt certain strategies. You can't see your opponents' perks before and during the match, so you can't adapt your build before the game starts. Each perk has 3 tiers, increasing their efficiency. Perks can be leveled by spending bloodpoints (a currency gained from pvp matches) in the blood web - character's progression tree. Blood web is one of the most malicious grind systems I've ever seen. There is a limited amount of nodes on each level of it. You need to unlock nodes in order to progress to next level. Nodes are perks and consumables available for given character. All of them appear randomly, so you can't control what you get. This means that if you are unlucky, you need to spend a lot of points to get the perks you need to tier 3. Each perk can be unlocked as a teachable - available in the pool of perks randomly selected to be available in a blood web. This means If you have a killer with a nice perk unlocked at level 40, you need to level this killer to 40, and level all killers you want this perk on until you are lucky enough to get it. There is a blood point cap - limit on blood points you can keep at the same time, which means you can't prepare for leveling another character. There are workarounds like not redeeming daily rewards or challenges, but that just shouldn't take place.\n\n3. New content.\nRoughly every few months a new chapter is released. New content is created quite often compared to other games, but the problem with it makes everything above completely irrelevant. Game is in a horrible state after each chapter. There are crashes, game breaking bugs, issues that can make you lose your game or disconnect you and reward with DC penalty for matchmaking. Your game becomes unusable for quite some time, and the worst thing about it is that those issues were already known on PTB, and absolutely nothing was done about them. PTB serves only to show new cosmetics, bugs and issues go live. At first I thought it was just a single unlucky chapter, blunders like that happen even to the best, but it's the same pattern each time. Sometimes problematic maps get disabled and then weeks go by until they return, there is a kill switch introduced, which allows to disable problematic content without a patch, but I doubt it will help much, because it's not just specific content, it's tons of seemingly unrelated details that stop working, preventing killers from using their powers, survivors from getting unhooked, allowing stuns through the walls, crashing game and so on.  There's also a recurring problem with broken facial rigs, so your favourite survivor might get turned into gremlin for few patches. There must always be one. \n\n4. Communication with devs.\nThere were issues that took years to be acknowledged and fixed, communication is poor at best. Surveys are being conducted quite often, but it's just normal that devs either ignore issues brought up by a huge part of playerbase, or introduce something no one asked for. \n\n5. NFT controversy.\nWith Hellraiser chapter an NFT controversy emerged - developers cooperated with a company responsible for non-fungible tokens. They were supposed to be a proof of ownership of Cenobite models and voicelines. It was also suspected that unique in-game content would be available for token buyers, but it wasn't confirmed. Apart from being ridiculousy expensive, a lot of energy is consumed to create them, so it's like a receipt produced by a Soviet steel mill. Not very environment friendly to say the least. Fact that it is supported wasn't received warmly by the community, and the issue is still there to be addressed. \n\nTo sum everything up, balance is questionable, game feels unfair pretty often, progress system is outdated and not player friendly, game needs operation health, but new, untested content is pushed instead, issues are barely addressed, communication on the line devs-community is poor and now there is some shady stuff emerging as if we didn't have enough.\n\nDisclaimer: Despite that, I hope I will be able to change my mind about this game. It has a great potential, but I can't recommend it in its current state.\n\nUpdate: It's getting worse with every patch. Fair playstyles are getting harder and harder to pull off and mean strategies are the easiest way to get results. Survivor queue times are considerably longer than they used to be, which is just strange, since for balanced queue times only 1-4 killer survivor ratio is needed. This means active killers are way less than 25% of playerbase. I'm genuinely surprised it could go that bad in a matter of few months.","timestamp_created":1634747406,"timestamp_updated":1656182860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550758421421051025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101349582","author":{"steamid":"76561199013382707","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7948,"last_played":1658246327},"language":"german","review":"Good

game can be a lot of fun in the first few hours, even more fun with friends, but when you start to see the disgusting and repetitive usage of perks and items(meta), this game start to slowly fade away from fun to torture, even more if you are playing with Killer.\n\nWe basically have a really fun game with really, reaaaally bad balancing, devs are pratically blind with their own game besides their memes and DLC/cosmetic shop, even some of their cosmetics are bugged/bad(I'm lookin at you Grandma Jill taking months to fix it and last patch bugged her face again AND cosmetics so bright that people refuse to use because killer can see you from far away, this applies to killer cosmetics too), you can't equip more than 3 pieces of cosmetics because BHVR won't update this system since they still earn $$ from playerbase. \n\nEach update BHVR keep bringing old bugs back, game breaking bugs like unreachable totem in some maps(there's even reachable totem's out there but when you start cleasing it you'll get kicked from the animation because you are stuck in a invisible wall or box), devs don't know their own game.\n\nDBD had/has a lot of potential but BHVR are digging their own grave within these 5 years of same meta perks, old/new bugs, bad at balancing perks/killers and maps(indoors maps are a real pain for a lot of the killers), devs DON'T KNOW HOW THEIR OWN MMR SYSTEM WORKS and yes there is an MMR system. \n\nIf you want some proof of all of this I wrote, check their last Q&A and look how blind and delusional they are with their own community, game and system, this is the last Q&A they did as I wrote this review: https://www.youtube.com/watchv=Pz7f_WPutq8\n\nI'll edit this review if I remember more stuff like hacks growing exponentially since 2020, people usually don't see it since some of them only make survivors run 5-10% faster, they hack in a way casual players won't see and know they are using it or reports doing nothing against toxicity since there is like mini ban waves from BHVR staff each year.\n\nHere is the most impactful one if you are f2p, garbage RNG perk system they refuse to update, so now you have 1 million perks and if you don't put perks like We're gonna live \nforever(survivor) or BBC & Chilli(Killer) to farm bloodpoints you will have a really bad time.\n\nDo you want any perk from movie DLC character and not pay for it? Good luck in Shrine of Secrets rotating 4 perks(2 for survivor and 2 killer) each week, paying 2k for each perk with the only in-game currency(take ages to get 2k if you compare with bloodpoints)that you can buy skins  without $ and getting lucky or just pay $$ for the DLC and torture yourself farming bloodpoints so you can spend them in that bloated RNG perk system.","timestamp_created":1634745116,"timestamp_updated":1634750431,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488667517900466919","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101348795","author":{"steamid":"76561198128737576","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":19092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":120,"playtime_at_review":18136,"last_played":1660496263},"language":"english","review":"*this review has been sold as an NFT and is no longer available!*","timestamp_created":1634745105,"timestamp_updated":1634745105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497722417116165161","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101348694","author":{"steamid":"76561198819922585","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2115,"last_played":1635353629},"language":"polish","review":"naprawcie grę, bo się rozjebiecie jak liga legend😎","timestamp_created":1634744959,"timestamp_updated":1634744959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516908168792724609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101348562","author":{"steamid":"76561198971852504","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1643640024},"language":"schinese","review":"yyds","timestamp_created":1634744755,"timestamp_updated":1634744755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101348476","author":{"steamid":"76561198323707994","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21519,"last_played":1632882981},"language":"english","review":"The game has become a toxic mess from all standpoints now.

I start, I'll preface this by saying I like playing Killer. I also had a bit of experience through watching Youtube videos, which whenever you purchase a game, I would suggest watching before you do (unless the game is story based, of course.) While I'm not clueless on survivor and I can loop fairly well, the meat of my experience comes from killer, so take that as you will.\n\nGame has a curve to it. The better you get, the worse it becomes. I played games at the beginning as killer, then as the game continued, I felt pressured to spend money to unlock perks that would allow me to even compete against higher ranked survivors. This is a vital point that you need to consider before entering this game: how much money are you willing to spend? While you can still technically play the game without spending money, leveling up gives you points, known as shards, you can spend on non-licensed killers or random perks available for purchase every week, there are a certain number of perks that are almost required.\n\nLook, let's be realistic here. We aren't all epic gamers that dominate the competition without a sweat, if you're lacking meta perks, you're gonna struggle at higher end play. And even if you don't, you usually have to employ a tactic that generally ruins the fun of the other players in your match. I don't personally like doing that, so I suffer for it. The basic point here is the game is semi-P2W. If you count licensed characters into the deal, you're spending a good chunk of change to experience the full package here. This game loves it's DLC.\n\nSpeaking of perks, let me actually explain the leveling system, since that's a fairly important part of this game. Every match, for doing specific things, you will obtain bloodpoints. Bloodpoints can be spent buying random stuff for your character from their specific bloodweb, which is a web of addons and offerings that you can use once per game usually. (there are exceptions). Once you complete a bloodweb, you'll level up that character. Every character can level up to level 50, then the bloodweb becomes infinite. Every character has three perks allotted to them, that you can use along with simple perks that every character has, but when a character reaches levels 35, 40, and 45, you unlock those perks for all characters, that you can then randomly buy in their bloodwebs whenever the game feels like letting you buy them.\n\nAs I said earlier, the game gets harder as your overall level increases. You're going to start seeing the same perks, over and over again, and your games are going to go from a jolly stabbing spree to a game of micromanagement, as every second counts towards your inevitable doom as the survivors get ever closer to escaping you. There is something... fascinating about how the game goes from being low level survivors fearing you as they run about like chickens with their heads chopped off, to a bunch of guys teabagging the serial killer as they utilize pieces of wood and flashlights to make him regret his psychopathic tendencies. Don't be deceived into thinking this is a horror game, it's an action game with a horror paint job.\n\nFor the base price of the game, you're going to at least get your moneys worth, the game at a fundamental level is entertaining, but if your looking at this game as something to put serious time into, I would look elsewhere. The developers legitimately make me sad watching what they've decided to do to their game, with their shoddy handling of the Stranger Things DLC (after November 17th, you can no longer buy any Stranger Things DLC; seriously though, how the fuck do you lose the rights to paid DLC, is this a joke?) as well as the more recent news that Dead by Daylight is participating in the destructive practices of NFTs (an entire story on it's own.) makes me fear for the games future.\n\nThe game has ups and downs, and I would say the time it gave me has been mostly fun, thus the playtime, I just wish it was able to keep up the momentum.","timestamp_created":1634742192,"timestamp_updated":1634742192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101346546","author":{"steamid":"76561199205024632","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1012,"last_played":1657037766},"language":"schinese","review":"我是傻逼","timestamp_created":1634741815,"timestamp_updated":1634741815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101346474","author":{"steamid":"76561198129507179","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":11034,"last_played":1660563850},"language":"thai","review":"หัดเล่น
