é um ótimo jogo, ainda mais quando está na promoção, sério vale a pena comprar. Vou listar os prós e contras do mesmo: \n\nPrós: \n- Dá pra jogar sozinho.\n- Tem várias atualizações.\n- Tem bastante DLC legal, por exemplo Stranger Things (mas tem outras).\n- Tem uma variação enorme de personagens tanto como sobreviventes e assassinos. \n- Skins maneiras.\n- Falando em personagem ele explica bem o que cada um pode fazer, ou é melhor, o nível de dificuldade.\n\nContras: \n- Apesar dele ser um bom jogo não há comunicação dentro, por exemplo por voz, caso você esteja na partida com 3 pessoas random, então as vezes é difícil focar o objetivo e ganhar a partida. Isso não se encaixa em assassino, pois ele só depende dele mesmo pra ganhar. \n- Em qualquer jogo sempre terá pessoas trollando, o que é chato. Por isso é sempre bom jogar com time fechado. Partidas solos às vezes decepcionam, ou não depende das pessoas né. \n\nNão tenho muito que dizer sobre, deram uma boa melhorada nos gráficos, o rank agora tá dividido em elos, bom é um bom jogo. Caso pense em comprar, ainda sugiro que compre quando entrar em promoção.","timestamp_created":1632021757,"timestamp_updated":1632021757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99597727","author":{"steamid":"76561198847498784","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":18556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":46,"playtime_at_review":2002,"last_played":1660197572},"language":"english","review":"nerf boon totem","timestamp_created":1632021754,"timestamp_updated":1634700994,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99597537","author":{"steamid":"76561198093352434","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10893,"last_played":1657614852},"language":"english","review":"Desde que incluyeron el DLC de Resident Evil valió la pena comprarlo","timestamp_created":1632021446,"timestamp_updated":1632021446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99596938","author":{"steamid":"76561198888152479","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":426,"playtime_at_review":4266,"last_played":1659645939},"language":"english","review":"I like it alot \n","timestamp_created":1632020486,"timestamp_updated":1632020486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99596915","author":{"steamid":"76561198854005023","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":42981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3362,"playtime_at_review":12260,"last_played":1660571279},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏很好玩，连胜之后被钢铁车队军训已经是常态了，建议低血压患者来玩，打着打着就上头了，顺便说一下，三角头屁股是真滴翘","timestamp_created":1632020459,"timestamp_updated":1632020459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527435004711151123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99596896","author":{"steamid":"76561198083669418","num_games_owned":425,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":5341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1242,"last_played":1642137608},"language":"english","review":"Gripping you right by the throat no chance to run -

Autant, le jeu est super fun en partie personnalisée avec des potes, autant en ligne... ça varie bcp selon les circonstances. \n\nPour faire simple, quand tu es survivant, tu peux rencontrer des tueurs toxiques qui campent/tunnel et jouent des tueurs OP et/ou ennuyant, et également des alliés de merde qui se laissent tuer au premier crochet quand ils se sont fait avoir ou ne t'aident absolument pas et joue solo. Et à l'inverse en tant que tueur, tu tombes souvent sur des survivants en groupe arrangé qui ont parfois 2x ton level, jouent cancer à la flashlight et tu te fais T-bag à la fin.  \n\nNe parlons pas des très NOMBREUX bugs au niveau des hitboxs encore plus douteuse que sur un jeu FPS ou des serveurs parfois en carton. Sérieux, les développeurs semblent ne pas en branler une pour régler ces problèmes majeurs qui datent encore et encore... \n\nLe système commercial du jeu est aussi plus que grossier. Tout doit s'acheter dans ce jeu. Si tu veux jouer d'autres tueurs ou survivants avec leurs compétences respectifs et pouvoir faire des mélanges de builds, tu dois acheter. Pas avec l'argent du jeu, non... Mais avec du VRAI cash. Faut voir tout les DLC... ça fait presque un peu Pay-to-win d'un certains points de vue... \n\nPourtant, le jeu a de bons points à développer et y jouer en ligne avec des potes est fort amusant et jouissif (selon si tu tombes sur un tueur correct ou un connard). On peut parfois faire des rencontres et des games amusantes (toujours selon le tueur ou les survivants). \n\nBref ! Jouez y en groupe, avec des amis, sinon go solo en tant que tueur. Mais, préparez vous à un peu de dose de sel. On survivra ensemble qui sait... Ou bien je survivrai face à vous.

Playing late at night is a joke to because of the queue times trying to find a match.","timestamp_created":1632018934,"timestamp_updated":1640896109,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555375993251800537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99595915","author":{"steamid":"76561198971282689","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":8895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1861,"last_played":1657570767},"language":"english","review":"very epic game","timestamp_created":1632018923,"timestamp_updated":1632018923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50992882251739502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99595777","author":{"steamid":"76561198386237218","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":41671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4746,"playtime_at_review":498,"last_played":1660530310},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1632018725,"timestamp_updated":1632018725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50992882251739502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99595620","author":{"steamid":"76561198838520065","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1445,"last_played":1651000694},"language":"brazilian","review":"É divertido 'u'","timestamp_created":1632018480,"timestamp_updated":1632018480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99595506","author":{"steamid":"76561198365026196","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":140369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1613,"playtime_at_review":25201,"last_played":1660529277},"language":"english","review":"HOT 🔥 Claudettes 👩🏾‍🦱 in YOUR AREA 🗺 are playing ⏯ DEAD BY DAYLIGHT! ☠️ Are YOU 👨🏻 hung 😏 like a HOOKED SURVIVOR 🎣 or is your ♥♥♥♥ 🍆 exhausted 🥵 from being DEAD HARD???

enjoy the game but it's unbalanced and full of campers and it can be entirely too enraging sometimes I had it on PlayStation and played for a good amount of time after getting it free about a year ago but stopped playing cause the campers were becoming too much and came back to it on PC to see if it's gotten any better and it has NOT. \nThis most recent update with Pinhead especially tells me that the devs don't care about balancing the game at all every action you make as a survivor takes entirely too long even with the perk the speeds actions up and now you have Pinheads stupid ability hooking you every minute or so to stop you from doing anything at all unless you solve the puzzle box across the map from you and of course not every killer feels that bad to play against like the base game killer is fine and the one with the axes is fine to give a couple examples but you basically always get a game against one of the more OP characters or against someone who camps a hook or a set of generators. \nIt can be fun for a couple rounds but after dealing with too many campers or a few OP characters and it becomes unfun to the point of wanting to quit for the day or longer. \nI suggest only play with at least one or more friends and avoid playing alone at all cost cause playing with randoms only makes it even worse otherwise just don't play this at

It does have a bit of a learning curb and can cause quite the frustration whilst your getting the fundamentals down pact however practice makes perfect.\nNo match is ever the same and it is far easier playing with friends but not a necessity, just expect a lot of variety between the types of players your paired with and their abilities. \nThe community has quite a large toxic component which typically tends to be towards the better ranked players however there is a lot of great people. Overall the game is great for just about all ages in terms of playability. My kids enjoy and do quite well.\n\nIf your new try find a discord community to play with some folks in swf, or party chat on console as it does make it easier. It is also a highly streamed game with plenty of opportunity to watch and meet people that way to play with aswell. Lastly its a game that keeps on giving and your always

Shouldn't be looked at as a hardcore competitive game, so you're time spent wont be taxing.  Aside from that the game is always in dire need of polish and bug fixing.  The devs care but not enough and sometimes I question their ability to design the game.  But I do enjoy it even with the horrendous new mmr system everyone hates.  Haven't really had a problem but I don't mind sweating to win lol.  It's a love/hate game,  base your decision to buy on being able to tolerate let downs but getting that high when your focus aligns and you wipe either the killer or survivors.","timestamp_created":1632003684,"timestamp_updated":1632003684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6v6//fsCdqny+wI="}
