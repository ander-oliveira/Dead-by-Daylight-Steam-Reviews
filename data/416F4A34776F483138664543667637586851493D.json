The fact that this game costs $20 to play, with over $125 of DLC, and an in-game cosmetic shop that also requires fake in-game currency to purchase anything is absolutely absurd. Especially when a huge amount of top-tier perks (primarily for the Killers) are locked behind a DLC paywall. And that's without mentioning the actual grind of character progression via Bloodpoints, which is painfully slow for those who don't want to commit themselves to hundreds of hours of playtime. For example, anyone who's played this game for any length of time knows just how good most people consider the Killer perk \"BBQ and Chili\" to be, especially for beginners. But 9 times out of 10, you don't even see people recommending it for the information/in-game use you get out of it. Everyone is more obsessed with the fact that it's one of the only perks that will dramatically increase your Bloodpoints post-game, allowing you to level up faster and get access to better perks/add-ons. Combined with the fact that higher level players have access to objectively stronger items/perks and you've pretty much created an insurmountable wall for newer players, at least those that want to play as Killer (which is why your Survivor queue times are so long).\n\nI don't want it to sound like there's nothing enjoyable about this game though, because clearly there's a lot of fun to be had in the moment-to-moment gameplay. Matches don't take too long to finish, and can have tons of really cool moments as both Survivor and Killer. The asymmetrical core mechanics are solid, even if I think they're weighted far too heavily in the Survivor's favor due to the lack of agency low-mobility killers have. I just think that for a $20 entry fee, with paid DLC packs that contain nearly-essential perks, and an in-game cosmetics store that requires the player to purchase DbD Disneybucks, the price is just way too high for most people, especially newcomers. I should also mention that this game's community is pretty toxic once you get past beginner ranks, which is funny for something that's essentially competitive hide-and-seek, but that's neither here nor there. If you can pick it up on a deep discount, then I'd say it's worth playing because you'll definitely get a fair few hours of enjoyment out of it. But for full price? Way too much with way too many paywalls to jump afterwards.","timestamp_created":1588692682,"timestamp_updated":1608782430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621499","author":{"steamid":"76561198971814251","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14380,"last_played":1625862566},"language":"french","review":"bon jeu","timestamp_created":1588692669,"timestamp_updated":1588692669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621464","author":{"steamid":"76561198867908906","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34279,"last_played":1651327217},"language":"russian","review":"лампова и класная помоечка рекомендую ))","timestamp_created":1588692640,"timestamp_updated":1588692640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621323","author":{"steamid":"76561198152037621","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":260935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":282,"playtime_at_review":160845,"last_played":1660423094},"language":"english","review":"нет","timestamp_created":1588692487,"timestamp_updated":1606433881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512295067310333252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621286","author":{"steamid":"76561198445618990","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":4566,"last_played":1660459487},"language":"russian","review":"топ игра","timestamp_created":1588692446,"timestamp_updated":1588692446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621196","author":{"steamid":"76561198819774395","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":199587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2457,"playtime_at_review":4603,"last_played":1660390443},"language":"japanese","review":"めちゃくちゃおもしろいです！ハマってます","timestamp_created":1588692350,"timestamp_updated":1588692350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496212571859359741","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621113","author":{"steamid":"76561198941704974","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1624,"last_played":1638912943},"language":"english","review":"game good Wraith op plz buff Doc is bs plz delete","timestamp_created":1588692235,"timestamp_updated":1588692235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621035","author":{"steamid":"76561198965325010","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":166,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1660590607},"language":"russian","review":"Очень интересно и может пощекотать нервишки :)","timestamp_created":1588692141,"timestamp_updated":1588692141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68621024","author":{"steamid":"76561199010605033","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1597172551},"language":"swedish","review":"everything","timestamp_created":1588692131,"timestamp_updated":1588692131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68620965","author":{"steamid":"76561198079462343","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":93814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72096,"last_played":1658845654},"language":"english","review":"Its a great game if u can deal with a toxic environment.

Dead by Daylight há alguns anos e já tenho quase 1k de horas, apos isso tudo tenho alguns pontos sobre o jogo que talvez possam ajudar vocês na decisão de comprar ou não.\n\n- No jogo há duas opções, você pode ser um Assassino jogando sozinho contra 4 sobreviventes, onde seu objetivo é matar todos eles ou você pode ser um Sobrevivente que ira ajudar sua equipe a escapar da partida. Tendo isso como base podemos ver que o jogo pode agradar dois tipos de jogadores, aqueles que gostam de jogar sozinhos e também os que gostam de jogar em call com os amigos ou ate mesmo quem gosta de ambos os lados.\n\n- O jogo possui bastante coisas pagas dentro dele, possui dlcs de roupas (que ao meu ver são todas feias) , possui dlcs de personagens (que com o passar do tempo se torna necessário) e também roupas que podem ser compradas dentro do jogo. Então ao todo caso você queira os personagens e afins você vai gastar muito dinheiro pra conquistar todos que o jogo possuem. (Dica: Eles sempre fazem boas promoções onde as DLC's saem pela metade do preço, então caso queira algo eu aconselho vocês esperarem ela, pois podem comprar 2 pelo valor de 1.\n\n- A comunidade apesar de ter uma parte de pessoas incríveis também possui (em uma parte bem grande) pessoas que sempre estão prontos para serem tóxicos ao final da partida, já vi muita mensagem bem ruim, então jogar sem o chat é uma opção inteligente para evitar ficar mal por comentários desnecessários e xingamentos.\n\n-Apesar de ser um jogo que jogo por muitas horas o que mais se diverge nas partidas são como os sobreviventes agem. O jogo em si é bem repetitivo, o que muda um pouco o fluxo do jogo é como as pessoas encaram a partida.\n\nEntão a minha opinião é que é um jogo que vale a pena ser comprado. Eu sou uma jogadora casual e mesmo assim me divirto muito nas partidas e tenho certeza que vocês também iram.","timestamp_created":1588689109,"timestamp_updated":1626376830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568345308303833008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68618091","author":{"steamid":"76561199004105048","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1612681089},"language":"spanish","review":"Tarda mucho en emparejarte con alguien y los servidores a veces te sacan sin razón alguna, aparte de ponerte una penalización de tiempo por \"abandonar la partida\" (A pesar de tener una buena conexión de internet).\n\nNo tengo ni idea de que le añade tanta carga gráfica al juego pero no logra subir más de 60fps (Ni quitando el limite en los archivos del juego).

split this review into a short and a long version. Obviously I'd still recommend you to read the long version, but the short one contains everything you need to know.\n\n[h1] Short version [/h1]\n\nDon't bother getting into this game. Nothing but frustration and stress await you. Crashes, tons of hackers, and a toxic community make it very hard to have fun with this game right now. Add to that a developer with a thoroughly incompetent balance team who does nothing against scummy or overpowered gameplay tactics, only ever applies bandaid fixes to the massive and widely kown balance issues instead of adressing the problems themselves, and do very little to close the sometimes extreme power gaps between certain killers and you've got yourself a game that'll leave you unsatisfied and frustrated more often than you'll have fun with it. From my experience, a lot of people who still play it regularly only do so because of friends or because they're chasing the high of that one good match in twenty. Its a shame because this game CAN be very fun at times, but the sheer amount of factors that have do be in your favor for that to be the case just make it incredibly inconsistent.\nI'd say wait till the balance team gets their stuff together and finally makes the changes required to make this game better, but after playing this game for 5 years I can safely say that will never happen.\nSo better just keep your hands off of this game altogether.\n\n\n[h1] Long Version. [/h1]\n\nLet me preface this by saying that when I say \"the developers\", I'm talking strictly about the balance team. The composers, The Texture- and 3D Artists, etc and generally the rest of Behaviour Interactive are doing a great job. Its only the balance team I have a gripe with. With that in mind, lets continue.\n\n[b] [u] Power gaps between killers [/u] [/b]\n\nOne of the biggest problems with Dead by Daylight is the sheer difference in power between certain killers. There are killers who are widely considered to be very strong or at times even somewhat overpowered/unfair, while others are so weak that they have a significantly lower win rate on average. This is a problem, because a lot of the changes the devs make to \"balance\" the game are usually general changes, meaning they apply to every killer. So while a survivor nerf may make weaker killers stronger, that also goes for the already strong killers. On the other hand, a survivor buff may mean that the weaker killers suffer even more than they already do. From a balance standpoint, you can see why this might be a problem. Sadly, its a problem the devs do little to nothing about. Meaningfull buffs to weak killers and nerfs to strong killers rarely ever happen, even if the entire community collectively agrees that they are needed. The devs often try to justify this with some questionable statistics, but in the end most of these statistics ignore a huge variety of important factors and often go directly against the experience of the entire community. Yet the devs remain stubborn, insist that they know better, even when its painfully obvious to even the most inexperienced players that they don't.\n\n[b] [u] Solo Queue vs \"Survive with Friends\" [/u] [/b]\n\nThe balance problems don't end here though. There's also the difference between Solo Queue (SQ) and \"Survive With Friends\" (SWF). (For those of you who don't play the game, SQ is when you play alone with random people, SWF is when you play together with people from your fried list.) SWF is widely considered to be much stronger than SQ because it is possible to properly communicate with and coordinate between one another via Discord or TS, and you can pick reliably good players to play with. With Solo Queue, this isn't possible. You're at the mercy of your teammates who often make very questionable decisions, your communication is limited to only 2 emotes and (thanks to the horrible matchmaking) you'll often get matched with teammates far below your or the killer's skill level. As you can guess, this can make for some very frustrating matches and is the reason why SQ is usually considered the weakest role in the game. Its also a problem because similar to killers, every survivor nerf that makes SWF weaker also affects SQ, and vice versa. The community has made a plethora of suggestions to change this (mainly more ways to communicate) and bring SQ and SFW closer together, but the devs once again continue to ignore them. This an ongoing trend as you'll soon realize.\n\n[b] [u] Horrible Map Design [/u] [/b]\n\nThere's also the problem of the map design. What I mean by that isn't that the maps don't look pretty, but that they're horrible from a gameplay standpoint. Certain randomly generated map tiles (often referred to as \"loops\") are stronger than others. Some are so strong that the killer will have a very hard time catching a good survivor there, others are so weak that they're nothing but a mild annoyance to the killer. The problem is that the maps are randomly generated, and very often you'll find multiple very strong tiles strung together in one part of the map while another sometimes lacks any tiles at all. As you can probably guess, this makes for some very frustrating moments as you're basically at RNGesus's mercy. As a killer you're often forced to leave survivors in one part of the map because you have no chance of catching them without throwing the game, and as a survivor you'll often find yourself in so called deadzones where you can't do anything. There's also maps with an objectively horrible layout from a gameplay standpoint, some of which are either extremely confusing to traverse or can offer massive advantages/disadvantages to one side. Your performance as a killer is often linked directly to the map you get.\n\n[b] [u] Scummy Tactics [/u] [/b]\n\nThen there's the scummy tactics. There's a whole onslaught of scummy or overpowered tactics players of both sides can use to turn a match into living hell for the opponent, some of which can completely suck any fun out of a match for one side entirely. These tactics are known to the devs and some of them have been around since the launch of the game back in 2016. Yet the vast majority of them still lack any real base-game counters, and the only way to have a reliable chance against them is by bringing certain perks. \n\n[b] [u] The neverending Bandaid Fixes [/u] [/b]\n\nThis brings me to my next point: The Bandaid Fixes. What do I mean by that? The developers rarely ever adress the problems themselves and instead release perks that are counters to that very specific problem. The thing is, there's only four perks slots, but countless situations that require specific perks.\nLet me visualize this for you.\nImagine you've got a hole in the wall of your apartment and the developers are your landlord. Naturally, you tell them about the problem. Now what the developers of this game do is instead of stuffing the hole, they put a painting over it. That in and of itself is already questionable, but fine. Better than nothing, right? Now imagine you have 15 holes in your apartment, but the landlord only gives you 4 paintings and tells you to deal with it. Then you've got yourself Dead by Daylight. Except said paintings are usually locked behind paywalls. No, I'm not kidding. This has become a big problem, and the devs have been continually ignoring said problem since the launch of the game 6 years ago. \n\n[b] [u] Conclusion [/u] [/b]\n\nI could go on like this for a while, talk about the ever-increasing amount of hackers and game crashes, or the horrible grind, but I'm running out of characters so I'll keep it brief. Dead by Daylight is a horrible unbalanced mess that I wouldn't recommend anyone getting into anymore.

friend recommended me this game and here I am, having spent more than 1k hours on DBD.\nI can say this game is worth the price, but there's still a lot of problems. The dev team seems to be listening to the playerbase, but it seems they have a hard time fixing existing issues and balancing the game.\n\nThe current state of the game is at a point where everything is too balanced for new perks to even have a real effect. The game has not really changed that much in years, to the point where weaker perks are made stronger by nerfing the stronger perks...\nEven though I am mainly playing survivor, there are some things that drastically need changing on both sides: an allround buff would be quite welcome. \nAfter nerfing the Ruin perk, the weaker killers who already had a hard time are not able to keep the SWF players to rush generators\n\nNow keep in mind that all this is in fact my opinion, but they are changes I want to see because it actually makes the game a bit more terrifying to play and gives a ton more creative options in gameplay styles, other than to be forced to run the same perk set.\n\nStill this game is loads of fun and if there is a free weekend campaign, you should absolutely give a try to this game.","timestamp_created":1588673942,"timestamp_updated":1588673942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68605587","author":{"steamid":"76561198099207184","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6143,"last_played":1633246418},"language":"schinese","review":"但愿以后还能玩","timestamp_created":1588673714,"timestamp_updated":1588673714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68605315","author":{"steamid":"76561198970169041","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":121444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2024,"playtime_at_review":37235,"last_played":1660585820},"language":"english","review":"Yes
