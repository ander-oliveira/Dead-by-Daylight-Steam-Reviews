O sistema de MMR simplesmente só entende se você, como sobrevivente fugiu e se como assassino conseguiu matar os sobreviventes. Ao contrário do antigo sistema de rank no qual continha 4 categorias de emblemas onde seu desempenho na partida era mostrado e assim era decidido se você subia de rank, caia ou continuava no mesmo. Por mais que esse sistema de emblemas não fosse perfeito, ele era um indicativo das suas “habilidades” nessas 4 categorias. (Esse sistema de emblemas ainda existe, mas ele não interfere no matchmaking, apenas no seu rank que vai de cinza à iridescente que é apenas um “cosmético” pessoal e não afeta o balanceamento das partidas) \n\n \nTa mas qual o problema de medir sua habilidade se baseando em [i]escapes/kills[/i] se esses são os objetivos principais do jogo? \n \nImagine desta forma, eu entro em perseguição com o [i]killer[/i] e fico com ele a partida toda, possibilitando que os outros sobreviventes consigam terminar todos os geradores e fugir, porém eventualmente ele consegue me pegar, não sai de perto do gancho e por conta disso eu acabo morrendo. Neste caso o MMR entende que eu joguei “mal” e eu acabo caindo de rank. O que não é justo visto que a parte mais difícil da gameplay de sobrevivente é [i]loopar[/i] o [i]killer[/i] e ganhar tempo para seu time.  \nDa mesma forma acontece quando você joga de assassino, se eu jogar de forma “justa”, isto é, permitindo que todos os sobreviventes consigam jogar, mudando de alvo e colocando todo mundo no gancho pelo menos duas vezes mas no fim todos escaparem meu MMR vai cair. Ao contrário da pessoa que joga de assassino, pega o primeiro sobrevivente e fica na frente do gancho, impedindo aquele jogador de ser salvo e de fazer qualquer coisa até acabar o tempo e finalmente morrer. O assassino já consegue uma kill, e de acordo com o MMR esse assassino tem mais “habilidade” do que eu, que não matei ninguém. \n\nIsso fomentou um estilo de gameplay extremamente cansativo na qual a primeira pessoa que o assassino pegar provavelmente não vai conseguir jogar o resto da partida. Enquanto os outros tem zero interação com o assassino.\nDo lado sobrevivente, começaram a trazer as perks e itens mais fortes para jogar contra esse tipo de gameplay, e isso criou um ciclo sem fim, onde o lado que trouxer as coisas mais fortes ganha (que é basicamente o resumo do balanceamento desse jogo).  \n\n \n\nPessoas que jogam como se a vida delas dependesse disso sempre existiram, mas o sistema MMR simplesmente enfiou um estilo de jogo competitivo goela abaixo na comunidade inteira. O que era pra ser um party game onde você toma susto e se diverte com os amigos agora é extremamente competitivo.","timestamp_created":1648156879,"timestamp_updated":1648156879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":72,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.834303021430969238","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112767452","author":{"steamid":"76561198074362892","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1648162861},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo tenso que faz você pensar duas vezes antes de tomar uma ação.","timestamp_created":1648156518,"timestamp_updated":1648156518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112767091","author":{"steamid":"76561198140369087","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":48,"playtime_at_review":1793,"last_played":1660524009},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo bom","timestamp_created":1648155971,"timestamp_updated":1648155971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112766206","author":{"steamid":"76561198216728853","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1600,"last_played":1648157928},"language":"spanish","review":"hasta que no nerfeen a Sadako no pondré pulgar arriba","timestamp_created":1648154734,"timestamp_updated":1648154734,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518324613571166992","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112766191","author":{"steamid":"76561199246496082","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":17579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3114,"last_played":1658260886},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego para crearte tensión en el cuerpo.","timestamp_created":1648154710,"timestamp_updated":1648154710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112766170","author":{"steamid":"76561199082518320","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":3433,"last_played":1660582274},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1648154672,"timestamp_updated":1648154672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495839118957519531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112765928","author":{"steamid":"76561199257292158","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1654661616},"language":"russian","review":"I like playing as a killer","timestamp_created":1648154313,"timestamp_updated":1648154313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112765875","author":{"steamid":"76561199125396341","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17047,"last_played":1657176059},"language":"english","review":"This game should be dead....so dead that they have to match you up with 4 rank 1 when you're literally just started ... cant do anything.

Unbalanced and unfair at times, but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nHowever, there have been 3 major changes to the game which have completely ruined it. Go check the Steam charts, the player base has been dwindling at an alarming rate ever since these issues came to light, and Behavior does little to nothing to stop it.\n\n1) Skill based match-making has made high-level matches unbearable. Every match is against a sweaty 4-man swf all running the same 4 meta survivor perks: DS, BT, Unbreakable, and Dead Hard. Oh, and they all have purple flashlights and brand new parts. Playing killer has never been as frustrating as it is today, so more and more killer mains continue to quit the game. This results in horribly long queue times for survivors. You would think the devs would do something to retain their killer players, but instead their \"fix\" is going to be offering bloodpoints to entice players to play killer. Typical bandaid fix to avoid the real issue.\n\n2) Boon totems never should have been added to the game. They are extremely annoying to deal with as a killer, having to waste your precious time snuffing out a boon that the survivors can just reset without any limits. Might as well make self-care basekit. Its impossible to play hit-and-run anymore because survivors are just going to heal with circle of healing, so you have to commit to chases, but by the time you catch the first survivor, the survivors have already popped 3 gens. So what are you supposed to do? Pressure gens and let survivors heal themselves for free, or commit to chases and give up easy gens? This forces so many killer players to camp and tunnel, because quite honestly its the most reliable strategy at this point.\n\n3) Hacking has become a major issue in this game over the past year. It started off with blatant ghostface's flying around and throwing hatchets, but recently there's been a new \"subtle hacking\" meta. This form of hacking lets players  see through walls, know exactly where to find hex totems, and increase their action and movement speeds for a slight advantage which at times can be impossible to detect since half the time it could just the game acting like the buggy mess that it is. It's gotten so bad, I feel like I encounter a hacker every day, and you always see content creators on Youtube or Reddit playing games with hackers. And unless they get reported a ton, they suffer no consequences. What's the point of continuing to play this game if the other side is consistently cheating?\n\n\nBehavior needs to fix their mess of a game and listen to their fanbase for once. This game is dying due to their negligence to do anything about the problems their game faces today.
