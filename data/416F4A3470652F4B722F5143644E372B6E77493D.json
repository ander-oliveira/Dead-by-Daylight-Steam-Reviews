I would absolutely recommend this game, but you should be aware of some things...\n\n1. The playerbase can be very toxic. You will see \"L\", \"EZ\", \"You suck\", and many more. Many, many more.\n2. Some perks feel broken when first starting out. On the killer side, many survivors feel NOED is OP. On the survivor side, many killers feel Decisive Strike is OP.\n3. Some strategies may make a game not fun for you, especially starting out. Killers can do strategies such as camping (staying in one area so no one else can do anything there, this usually happens around a hook to ensure a specific survivor dies. It can be countered with BT), slugging (downing all alive survivors so they cant pick each other up. Then the killer either hooks them all or let them bleed out. This can be countered with Unbreakable), or Snowballing (similar to slugging except they do it from the very beginning, hoping to end the game in a few minutes. Can be countered with unbreakable and gen-rushing).\nSurvivors can do things such as looping (this will happen every game. A good killer is harder to loop, but starting out this is frustrating), gen-rushing (trying to get done all the gens in a very fast time period, this can be countered using anti-gen perks like ruin), and can just be toxic (t-bagging, flashlight spamming, etc.)\n4. There is a matchmaking system in DBD. Well, if you don't play for awhile, you will be put with newbies when you return. So for new players, this can make it difficult if you are stomped by good players. This happens more often to killer but does happen to survivors.\n5. On each side, there is 1 thing that is annoying to deal with. For killers, it is moris. For survivors, it is keys. A mori allows the killer to kill someone after first hook. Usually you have to hook someone 3 times. This results in many people tunneling someone off first hook and just killing them. Killers rarely lose while using an ebony mori. Keys allow the survivors to open the hatch before it opens. This means that if the survivors do enough gens and find the hatch, they can just all leave without you knowing. It also means that if you close the hatch when there is one survivor left, they can just open it back up.\n\nThe game is very fun once you get good but it is also sweaty and a bit unbalanced, so be aware. Have a great day.","timestamp_created":1599350809,"timestamp_updated":1599350809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75512632","author":{"steamid":"76561198371834627","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":89598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6650,"playtime_at_review":42681,"last_played":1660604721},"language":"russian","review":"Свинка

Highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1599334806,"timestamp_updated":1599334806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502586","author":{"steamid":"76561198983033137","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1120,"playtime_at_review":4791,"last_played":1660604134},"language":"english","review":"I already recommended it to all my friends and they are addicted to this game and so am i ! its awesome.","timestamp_created":1599334425,"timestamp_updated":1599334425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502581","author":{"steamid":"76561198966388487","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4116,"last_played":1656921313},"language":"russian","review":"ш","timestamp_created":1599334419,"timestamp_updated":1640377699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502492","author":{"steamid":"76561198202351459","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3536,"last_played":1613725500},"language":"koreana","review":"버그만 쳐없으면 갓겜임 버그가 너무 많아서 그렇지 님들도 꼭 해보세요 제발^&^","timestamp_created":1599334289,"timestamp_updated":1599334289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502427","author":{"steamid":"76561198876266299","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1809,"last_played":1641119792},"language":"english","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1599334211,"timestamp_updated":1599334211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502383","author":{"steamid":"76561198363796422","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":54156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":662,"playtime_at_review":16755,"last_played":1660342453},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩，新兵屠夫游戏体验相当不错。个人平时主玩人类，但是偶尔闲下来也会享受一下屠夫视角的乐趣。17段做每日任务，技能槽都没开全，可以排一车队的3转血衣克隆人让你分不清谁是谁。抱一个人起来，三个绝地武士在钩子下等你。这种畅快淋漓的真剑对决可以说是《克隆战争》《西斯的复仇》级别的快感和游戏体验。此外游戏的交流系统设计丰富多彩。其中12两个表情的设计尤为精妙，不论对方是人类还是屠夫。即使不把想法组织成语言，文字。只要使用恰当，仅凭2个表情便便可把所有的心情想法传达给对方。更有些鬼灵精怪的玩家们，发挥出他们天马行空的想象力，通过将其排列组合成了1212，1122，1112，甚而是和下蹲，手电开关的滴答声等交错融合，编织成了一首轻松欢快有节奏感的交响曲， 直 击 屠 夫 的 心 肺。此外游戏还设有赛后友谊交流小窗口，可以让玩家们把对局中的懊悔，痛苦，愤怒，鄙夷，怨恨，诅咒这些美好的情感互相宣泄出来，并向彼此倾诉多么期望成为对方的血亲，成为相互生命中最重要的存在。缩小了玩家之间隔阂，拉近了人心之间的距离。","timestamp_created":1599334145,"timestamp_updated":1599334145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":131,"weighted_vote_score":"0.743944227695465088","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502353","author":{"steamid":"76561198247983870","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":65,"playtime_at_review":13697,"last_played":1660179218},"language":"english","review":"Fun","timestamp_created":1599334112,"timestamp_updated":1599334112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502309","author":{"steamid":"76561198808644876","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1103,"last_played":1644455914},"language":"english","review":"B_alls","timestamp_created":1599334031,"timestamp_updated":1599334031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75502168","author":{"steamid":"76561198086144966","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":14026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11310,"last_played":1648949658},"language":"english","review":"This game has a steep learning curve, but once you get it, my god is this game fun.\n\nI have my own personal gripes about this game, I think a killer or two are over powered, but this has got to be one of my favorite games.

Overall a good game.\n","timestamp_created":1599325364,"timestamp_updated":1599325364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75495207","author":{"steamid":"76561197988695428","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":34202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":5356,"last_played":1659703853},"language":"english","review":"Cool game if the killers wouldn't camp that much just to get one kill because they suck... It's rare to get a killer that acutally feels strong because he knows how to play, mostly just camping or strong perks^^\n\nSurvivors, if they aren't russian it's fun. Well, kinda like CSGO.","timestamp_created":1599324898,"timestamp_updated":1599324898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75494937","author":{"steamid":"76561198122042726","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2834,"last_played":1619804491},"language":"thai","review":"++","timestamp_created":1599324580,"timestamp_updated":1599324580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75494884","author":{"steamid":"76561198341793958","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1531731025},"language":"russian","review":"Мне не зашло но всем нравится","timestamp_created":1599324519,"timestamp_updated":1599324519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pe/Kr/QCdN7+nwI="}
