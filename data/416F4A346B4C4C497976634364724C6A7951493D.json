Jedoch darf man desswegen nicht den offensichtlichen Fehlern des Spiels aus dem Weg gehen.\nDie Entwickler legen einen starken Fokus auf die Survivor-Spielerschaft und lassen somit die Killer-Spieler komplett außen vor. Seit Januar letzten Jahres wurde der mit Abstand wichtigste Killer-Perk um das Highrank-Play erträglich zu machen, dermaßen genurfed das es teilweise wenn man Rang 5 oder Höher ist, als Killer zu spielen einfach nur frustriert. Das Spiel muss sich verändern und kann so nicht bleiben. Jedoch geht für jeden Casual-Horror Fan von meiner Seite eine Empfehlung raus.

As survivor your main goal is to work on generators while the killer tries to hook you and sacrifice you to the entity..You can get hooked 3 times before you are dead for good. The other survivors can try and help you off of the hook. Every survivor has 3 specialized perks that you can work to unlock fully to incorporate with other survivors that you play as. The same goes for the killer. In general, you have 4 perks you can equip and bring into the game that best coincide with one another to give you the best advantage. This is why it is important to level each of the characters up so that you may put together the best setup. The survivors also have items they can bring with them into the trial to help you make it through alive. Some help you save other teammates, work on gens, sabatoge hooks, heal, and more.. \n\nThe killers job is to sacrifice you to the entity. Again they have to hook you 3 times to accomplish their mission. Each killer is built different. For example:throw hatchets, use traps, go invisible, teleport, shoot a harpoon gun..and many more.. They have OG lore characters, as well those from tv and movies. Again the killers have 3 specialized perks as stated above and they also have 4 to bring in with them to the trial to help win the trial. Then they have addons to put onto their specialty to make it better. For example: Traps: addons would be something to make them less visable, stronger hold on survivors etc..\n\nOn top of all of that both the survivor and killer can add an offering before the trial begins that can help gain extra BP (Bloodpoints), spawn you farthest from the killer, or all together. A couple of the killer ones make the hooks spawn closer together, and to spawn the survivors seperately. There are TONS of different offerings.\n\nThere are totems on the map that survivors can cleanse to gain BP also. Totems start out dull. If a killer has a hex perk equipped, the totem lights up and becomes a Hex totem. Sometimes it is necessary to get rid of the totem instead of working on the generators. You just have to make that choice when you are in the game.\n\nBP(Bloodpoints) are what you gain during each trial for different things that you do such as working on a generator, unhooking and healing teammates, dropping a pallet on a killer as they are chasing you, and more. Killers get BP for breaking doors, gens, and pallets. For hooking and chasing survivors and much more. You use BP to level up your characters within the game to gain new items, level up and get new perks, and getting offerings.\n\nThere are also different looks that you can purchase for each killer and survivor. There are charms you can get to where on your belt as a survivor, charms you can add on your hook as a killer to add a little flair. \n\nOne thing I like about DBD is you dont always have to use Auric Cells to purchase things (which is what you purchase with real money to buy certain characters and outfits.) You can use Blood Shards (you get these as you level up within the game) Now some of the characters and outfits will only cost Auric Cells but there is quite a good selection that you can purchase with the Shards. If you play the game a lot and save up your Shards it is fantastic. \n\nDBD also has a battle pass of sorts called \"The Rift\" which costs $10 and it comes with outfits and charms that you would not otherwise be able to get outside of the pass. You do challenges from \"The Archives\" to gain XP and level up, gain BP, and unlock items in your Rift. Note: The Archive challenges can be completed for BP no matter if you have The Rift or not. You just unlock the free items of the Rift rather than the entirety of it.\n\nI am trying to make sure that I cover everything and I'm thinking that I have.. DBD is a game with real players there are never any AI. It is crossplay with Xbox but you can turn it off if you'd rather just stick with what you have. Surviving alone can be tough only because there is NO in game communication. You have to rely on instincts and pay attention to what is going on around you. Survivors only have 2 emotes. Pointing and the \"come here\" motion. One thing I wish is that they would add more of those. PC players have the ability to type in a chatbox before and after game. I also believe that is another thing they should add for console to be able to communicate also. Even a proximity chat during the trial would be interesting I think. It would definitely add a twist to things. \n\nSometimes when running from the killer hitboxes are a bit broken. Say you vault over a pallet or through a window, the killer swings before you jump but sometimes when you are on the other side you will get hit still. Even the killer shouldnt have been able to reach. \n\nI honestly dont have alot of things to complain about with this game because I truly enjoy it. \n\nOne thing though if you do get this game be prepare because there are a lot of people on this game that are toxic, on both the killer and survivor side. For instance killers will sometimes camp your body while you are on the hook.. If you have a good survivor team this is a situation that you can get out of. Otherwise your kinda screwed. Then you also get the killers that tunnel you which means right after you get unhooked they will go after you again instead of the person that unhooked you. Why they do these things? I have no idea. Then you get toxic survivors that throw pallets for no reason, teabag when you miss hits, when you get pallet stunned, and even when they are at the exit gate about to cross over to finish the game. You also get survivors that carry a flashlight around and will use it when they shouldnt such as clicking it in your face while you are chasing them. Or to get your attention while you are chasing another survivor, then they teabag you because you dont do what they want... So toxicity goes both ways.\n\nThere is a report system though. If someone is not playing the game probably, griefing, harrassing, hateful. You can report them and block them. \n\nWith all that said you will also run into great people. There are plenty out there that do funny things within the game, or are funny within the out of game chat (if you are on pc). You can report them as great players also, which is one thing that I like. However, I wish there was some way to be able to check those stats for myself as a survivor or killer to see what people have been saying about me. \n\nYou might get this game and be naturally great at it. Do not get discouraged if you aren't. It takes time to learn the different perks and what goes together. Also to be able to efficiently run from the killer or  \"loop\" them takes time also. You may get hooked over and over at first. The survivors may escape every time. Eventually though you will find a character you like, you'll level them up and it'll just click. \n\nIf you have read this entire review I thank you and I hope that this gives you the insight that you needed to figure out whether or not you want to purchase this game. Have fun, and good luck next game!\n","timestamp_created":1613125468,"timestamp_updated":1613125468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86457454","author":{"steamid":"76561198076415124","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":19239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15869,"last_played":1654432279},"language":"russian","review":"Вот что я могу сказать на счёт новой очень полезной и крутой обновы:\n1. после обновы когда мана палетой станишь, независимо от его местоположения, хоть он в другом конце карты, он автоматически телепортируется на твою сторону, откуда ты скинул палетку. и это происходит не только у меня.\nКонечно, к багам я привык, особенно к ультра крутым выпадам фредии, но этот баг это что-то с чем-то\n2. наверное все видели новый баг с текстурой автобуса, куда могут попасть только сурвы, ну че сказать, бхвр в какой раз конкретно облажались.\n3. кто вообще придумал такой интерфейс? я конечно понимаю, что это дело вкуса, но раньше почти все было в одном углу, а теперь всё разбросано по всему экрану, максимально неприятно смотреть на всю эту красоту. но спасибо, что хотя бы добавили масштабирование интерфейса, этого я реально ждал.\n4. кому как, но эти анимации намного хуже старых, особенно когда лежачий сурв прыгает в люк, посмотрите как стримеры угарали над этим.\n\nКороче, до обновы все было более или менее удовлетворительно, но сейчас в эту помойку вообще невозможно играть.

Like a real whole lot of issues.\n\nYou will probably know what this game is, but I will still very briefly explain it: It's an asymmetrical co-op game with two factions. Four survivors versus one killer.\n\nProblems in the core game play stem from uninteractive elements to the game itself like \"tunnelling\" and \"camping\" where horror icons like Michael Myers and Leatherface would rather just down the first survivor they find and try to bully them to death and letting the other three survivors escape. This doesn't happen every game of course, but the inherent game mechancis don't punish you for this.\n\nThese inherent unfun game mechanics are one of the reasons that encourage toxic behaviour among the player base. \n\nThese could be fixed, but the developers also call this kind of uninteractive gameplay a valid strategy. This is just the tip of the ice berg of how uncaring the developers are towards their own game. They built a solid foundation... in 2016 but ever since they never really tried to fix its inherent issues after now almost 5 years.\n\nOver the recent months as of this review they have actively disciminated against and admonished colourblind people and have shown disdain and hate towards their playerbase at every opportunity. The company is displaying this behaviour all the while delivering really bad and unpolished updates, introducing game breaking issues, changing elements of the game arbitrarily for the worse (Like the UI) all the while expecting players to never critize any of this but also buy all of their overpriced DLC and cosmetics as if this was a freemium game.\n\nPlayers get told by the community manager or main balance designer \"that they get heard loud and clear\" while making snarky remarks in the same sentence.\n\nWhile this might all seem obscure, overall the company behind this game is atrocious and displays gross mismanagent, to an even bigger degree somehow during this and last year. Even with iconic horror giants in this game I can not recommend it to anyone.\n\nIf you are really curious about this game, I would rather recommend watching people play past versions of it it on youtube rather than getting it yourself. That way you won't have to put up with the horrid state the game is in right now.","timestamp_created":1613124467,"timestamp_updated":1613126428,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86456479","author":{"steamid":"76561199005068098","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":205,"playtime_at_review":7661,"last_played":1660334081},"language":"english","review":"Since last patch, character movement is very weird and there is other unnecessary changes.

P.S. players, DO NOT keep putting in ur reviews that u r \"addicted\" to this game and u will play no mater what, bc then u give the devs the upper hand, and a big mess of a game happens.","timestamp_created":1613124050,"timestamp_updated":1613189481,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530075192451477051","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86456417","author":{"steamid":"76561198032867646","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":45356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23671,"last_played":1658319125},"language":"tchinese","review":"這次板子的改動真的很不OK，歐美人類到底有多爛讓廠商一直幫人類BUFF","timestamp_created":1613123973,"timestamp_updated":1627799277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539748966693878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86456415","author":{"steamid":"76561198958908584","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14781,"last_played":1658216990},"language":"english","review":"got -1 on a match that NEVER FUCKING HAPPENED. the killer DC'd and everyone got fucking -1 rank progress. all i'm saying is this never happened before the update. if this is some kind of bug it needs to be fixed bc wtf dude.
