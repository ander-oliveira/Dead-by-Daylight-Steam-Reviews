Has always been buggy. There are bugs that are still in the game from its first year. Every update introduces new bugs.\n\nNew Player Accessible: No. Matchmaking is a joke, new killers will end up getting high rank survivors, and new survivors will get high rank killers. Community also too toxic for the game to be enjoyable for new players.\n\nCommunity: Both sides whine constantly about certain aspects of the game, some complaints are warranted, most are not. Killer complaints seem to be listened to more seriously, which is why the game has gradually been changed over time to cater to killers, making it easier for new killers to get good results and experienced killers to just make the game unenjoyable for everyone else involved in the match.\n\nBalance: In short its awful. As a blank slate, with no perks and add ons, you could argue it has the right balance. However, with perks and add ons the balance is grossly swayed in favour of killers. Killers have an arsenal of perks that can make matches an unbearable grind for survivors, with these perks, the only chance survivors have is if the killer is a complete potato. There's also the fact that some killer have add ons that just break the game, such as the Huntress' iridescent heads. Furthermore, the devs still seem to think that mori's and keys are fair mechanics; the former being a cheap way for killers to end a match quickly and the keys being cheap and undeserved escape for survivors before all gens are complete.\n\nIn Summary: The devs are out of touch with the community and the stuff that really matters to us. Instead of squashing bugs and addressing major issues with the game, they prefer to pump out new killers/survivors, produce cosmetics and implement a season pass system that is unimaginative, grindy and promotes toxic playstyles. \n\nIf you don't own this game yet, keep it that way. You may have some fun with it but the negative experiences you'll have will far outweigh the positives.\n\nUpdate 9th Feb 2021:\n\nThey just made the game 10x worse with new survivor animations that ruin the previously tight running mechanics and a new HUD which is horrendous and requires effort to look at for information.\n\nThe devs do not care about the players. This latest update was met with unanimous disapproval in the PTB, yet they stuck to their guns and went live with it. All they care about is pumping out new content and making money. Years of bugs and poorly balanced perks/mechanics that they have said repeatedly is on their list of things to address, yet they instead make changes that no one asked for and makes the experience less fun.","timestamp_created":1475675893,"timestamp_updated":1612910767,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25869325","author":{"steamid":"76561198157897498","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":99609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56711,"last_played":1525205078},"language":"english","review":"very

22 Oct @ 9:15pm\n\nThe game is broken. Don't believe in the recent and overall review (Mostly Positive) at the store page.\n\nAttempting to get a refund. Will update if I do.\n\n======================================================================\n\nUpdated: 22 Oct @ 8:07pm\n\nEDIT UPDATE: Now that I put in a lot of hours into the game I can give readers a much more accurate information.\n\nUnfortunately this game is still infested with cheaters. The only way to fix this is to remove the option \"invite a friend\" when lobbying as a killer. This would reduce the cheaters tremedously from inviting their friend as a survivor to kill the rest and farm points together.\n\nI don't know why the developers did not do an immeadiate update to fix this problem as it has been 3-4 months since its release. \n\nPlayers are now changing their steam profile to private or offline to hide their friends list to continue to cheat new players with their premade friend/s.\n\nMy guess is that the developers don't care about this problem (there is no way to report ingame or on the developers website) as long as they get their $20. \n\nFor you guys that want to buy this $20 game, don't. The developers don't have a general service to report cheating. This game has a small community to report cheating but it is not 100% reliable. \n\nThere is no use in naming and shaming cheaters and will get you banned by moderators.\n\nJust wait for when the Behaviour / Starbreeze developers finally take responsibility that removes this \"invite a friend\" option in the game. \n\n\nBut until then, this game encourages players to cheat.\n\n\n======================================================================\n\nPosted: 5 Oct @ 2:00pm\t\n\nThe Good - This game is great. Very fun and simple mechanics. Love it!\n\nThe Bad - P2P connection causes lag, long waits in the lobby.\n\nThe Ugly - Ruined by INCREDIBLE amount of cheaters (example: survivor/s is premade with the killer) where the killer downs his friend so that the downed survivor can locate the rest of the survivor for the killer. Once the rest is dead, they farm maximum points possible together, robbing other players of leveling. (I have video content of my gameplay with the cheaters)\n\nTL;DR: Go on YouTube and type \"Dead by Daylight cheating\". This is the game you will play 50% of the time with either a hacker or premade farmers.

War ich anfangs noch skeptisch im Hinblick auf die Langzeitmotivation und ob wirkliches Teamplay zustande kommt, oder doch wieder jeder nur sein eigenes Ding macht, hat mich Dead by Daylight zumindest für den Moment komplett überzeugt und in seinen Bann gezogen.\n\nHinsichtlich der Langzeitmotivation kann ich nur orakeln, ob meiner gerade mal 12h Spielzeit, aber das wird sich weisen.\nDead by Daylight überzeugt aber schon in den ersten Minuten im laufenden Spiel, denn es fesselt durch seine Atmosphäre und die überragend aufgebaute Spannung. Startet man sein erstes Spiel als Überlebender und erfährt direkt das Glück eines rasenden Herzschlags, zeigt das Spiel direkt was es kann. Derart mitgefiebert habe ich bisher in sonst keinem Spiel.\n\nMeine Bedenken im Hinblick auf das Teamplay unter den Spielern haben sich auch recht schnell zerschlagen. Natürlich gibt es wie in jedem Spiele Leute, die nur auf den eigenen Vorteil Bedacht sind - und das durchaus direkt im Chat ankündigen ala \"if an exit is open, I won't help you\". Aber, großes [b]ABER[b], die meisten meiner Mitspieler waren immer auf Teamplay aus, und sind nicht direkt geflüchtet, sondern haben auf die anderen Überlebenden gewartet oder versucht ihnen zu Helfen wenn diese in der Klemme waren. Da Teamplay in diesem Spiel immer ein Risiko darstellt, bin ich ob der gemachten Erfahrungen sehr positiv überrascht.\nSoweit ich das bisher beurteilen kann, ist das Spiel ganz gut balanced, bisher ist mir zumindest nichts persönlich aufgefallen und auch die Perks etc. bieten eine ausreichende Vielfalt. Alles in allem muss ich sagen, macht das Spiel wirklich was her und rechtfertigt seinen Preis definitiv. Jeder der Lust auf Teamplay und Nervenkitzel hat, sollte sich die Anschaffung von Dead by Daylight mal durch den Kopf gehen lassen.\nDas einzige was mir bisher, negativ aufgefallen ist, dass es manchmal etwas länger dauert bis man in eine Lobby kommt.

Like, the 5-14 mins of stress was simply not worth the win.\n\nI feel kinda stupid with some of these loops, and with every patch the game just gets worse. I thought 2016 was bad but if only I had known how bad boil over would be after the update. Several maps have infinite loops and are not being kill switched. Many bugs exist that give survivors the ability to have perma aura reading. Every 3rd game I play has a fucking hacker in it. Like man, I used to have fun but now its just too much stress. I like DBD but I hate what its become. I hope in future it will get better but for now 2k hours of my life have been flushed down the toilet. \n\nI bought every dlc from the doctor to pin head.
