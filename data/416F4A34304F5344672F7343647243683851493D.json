É engraçado parar pra pensar que tudo que é frustrante e desbalanceado em outros jogos onlines, continuam sendo frustrantes e desbalanceados em DbD, porém isso também faz o jogo ser ridículo de divertido se estiver jogando com amigos. Se estiver jogando sozinho o jogo também é legal (das minhas 174 horas umas 100 foram sozinho), porém ele perde um pouco daquela magica, e seus problemas começam a ficar mais aparentes, principalmente quando se joga o jogo bem (o que não é meu caso então ta ótimo).\nAlém dos problemas de balanceamento, o jogo é infestado de bugs, mas a maioria deles são pequenos e visuais, o que não afeta muito a experiência, mas ainda é chateante.\nEu não entendo o porque de tudo nesse jogo ser tão complicado, cada atualização nova vem com outras três correções de bug, todo personagem novo vem com uma lista enorme de reclamações dos players ou até mesmo dos fans da IP da qual o personagem veio. Tudo que eles melhoram de um lado eles completamente destroem do outro e eu não sei como eles conseguem mandar tão mal nas atualizações recentes sendo que os fãs estão pedindo atualizações menores para ter menos complicações na hora do desenvolvimento. É uma confusão de bugs e desbalanceamentos que podem te deixar tão frustrado.\nMas pra quem não entendeu eu vou resumir aqui, Dead by Daylight é ótimo!","timestamp_created":1627919738,"timestamp_updated":1627919738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96818281","author":{"steamid":"76561198262302009","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":53155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":90,"playtime_at_review":52383,"last_played":1659973524},"language":"english","review":"They keep making dumb decisions, they also \"fixed\" the new RE map... they changed literally nothing and it still has the same problems, some killers arent balanced after months from release and survs key still needs a nerf.

Work as a independent or as a team to avoid being slaughtered or help one and another escape this gruesome horrifying game.\n\nYou have player levels, ranking and even character levels to process through the blood web as you unlock perks as well as items to take in the game with you. You can chose to be a killer or a survivor and bring your mates/friends along for some amusement fun. Every character also had customisation like charms, clothing, hair style, and of course weapons so you can basically knock those opponents down with. \n\nThis game adds characters all the time survivors and killers. There is also a rift that plays like a season pass for the tomes which you progress to gain more blood points which you also earn in matches by doing a lot of work and effort to either escape or kill everyone within the match. \n\nI hope you enjoy this game as much as i do, just avoid haters as they always hate. It is not a bad game, developers do a lot of work and putting as much effort into this game as possible as they work and progress for things to be added or changed. This community is rocking the daylight out of us and will continue to do so, because we sure love seeing some new wacky characters that get made by them too as well as the license ones, they even updated the maps, dark areas, patches and hit boxes (Some are ridiculous still but its still an alright thing). \n\nHope you continue to run this game and i appreciate all the hard work and effort you do as well as the community and players.

That is full equivalent of your friends telling you to go to a brothel and ask for \"Golden Shower\" without you being aware of what it means.\nI got baited into spending my hard-earned money on this game and all I got out of it was getting shat on by killers.\nThis game is not about cooperative action against someone stronger. This game is full-on made for killers enjoyment.  One man queues in, waits 15 minutes to find a match and then destroys 4 clueless and helpless surviviours in under 2 minutes.\nIf you're into BDSM and self-harm you will definitely enjoy this experience, however I am very angry at this state of art of this game. The balance is heavily skewed towards killers, when they already have an unfair advantage. Killers have infinite health, while they can hit and, pardon me, [b]KILL[/b] surviviours. However surviviours can't do anything to the killer.\nHowever if you ever wanted to kill squealing helpless little hamsters you can chose to play as a killer. You will greatly enjoy it. \nGame is made for psychopathic homicidal maniacs so they don't have to execute their powertrips over someoenes life in real world. \nI generally do not recommend this game, unless you like being bullied by someone 20 times stronger than you, or you're a literal homicidal maniac that needs his bloodlust satiated. \nHowever, come to think of it, if you're playing as a surviviour and endure this virtual torture this likely saves some poor soul from experiencing the psychopathic tendencied of the killer player in real life.\n\nEdit: Tried playing some more of this game with my firends. The point still stands, this game is made for killers enjoyment, every feature helps the killer. I even really enjoyed 2 games out of 20 that I played. But at the end in all other games it matches me, a 12-hour newb against 200-500-1000 hour killers that know all the shit and I get downed in first 40 seconds and I just leave.\nHowever, when the killer is as inexperienced as me, a 12-15 hour newbie I have room to actually run, escape, drop pallets. But as I said that only happens 1 in every 10 games. All the other time you just suffer and leave the game.\n\"So, maybe it's the friends who have some hours into this game\", - I thought. And I matched 3 games in solo queue. And I got 250-300 hours played killers all three times. I stood no chance and got downed in first thirty seconds again. No point in playing this dead game at all...\nEdit 2: 8 months later I decided to check in this game with friends, Nothing has changed, still same 2600-5000 hours greasy fat redditors playing killers on the lowest rank (ASH IV) and typing: \"get better at game\". By the way, I found out that the term \"Redditor\" is a censored slur in this game, so it's actually hilarious.

По этому часто люди сгорают с этой игры.\n2) Здесь каждая запущенная игра разная. Всё зависит от действий каждого отдельного игрока. Постоянная мозговая борьба кто кого переиграет.\n3) Нормально сбалансирована\n4) Разработчики постоянно следят за игрой, развивают её исправляют ошибки, спрашивают мнение у игроков. Также можно высказать своё мнение.\n5) Постоянно появляются новые скины, новые персонажи, новые события, новые задания, новые карты. Что очень разнообразит игру и делает её привлекательной, что хочется заходить снова и снова.\n6) Нет ни одного конкурента в этом жанре, который бы даже рядом стоял.\n\nМинусы:\n1) Парой некоторые баги не исправляются очень долго. Но как правило исправляют через какое-то время.\n2) Разработчики зря идут на поводу даже у малого количества людей, которые на что-то жалуются. Зря уничтожили навыки осколок, объект одержимости, не смерть, часы зря сделали 13сек, но спасибо за постоянное срабатывание и т.п.\n3) Пробития! Это отдельная история. Как говориться \"кто знает тот поймёт\". Когда я прыгнул в окно, успел сделать два шага и удар проходит. Когда я прыгул в окно и уже лечу, меня пробивает в середине полёта. Септик использовался но он пробивает, я падаю и вижу значок справа о неуязвимости. Тут должно быть либо я использовал и не пробили или не использовал. Одновременно это не может быть чисто логически.\n4) Не вводят новые режимы игры, смыл игры довольно однообразен. Выжившим нужно починить 5 генераторов и открыть ворота или люк, а ману не дать это сделать. Могли бы ввести другие режимы, например, с несколькими маньяками, или где можно при выполнении определённых действий выжившим убить мана. Вызвать полицию, Или бой между манами, игра на таймер, или где можно брать 8-10 навыков и т.п. \nЯ бы даже сделал режим типа вычислить мана среди выживших, а он ночью превращается в Рин,медсестру и т.п. и выносит всех.\nМожно много чего придумать, чтобы разнообразить игру. \n5) Однообразные скины в разрыве. Очень редко можно что-то нормальное найти. И заносили бы в магазин вещи из разрыва, когда он кончался. Если пропустил, то можешь хоть купить.\n6) Очень долго копить на осколки, сделали бы чтобы можно было менять очки крови на осколки, например 1000000 крови можно поменять на 10000 осколков. Надо годами сидеть в игре чтобы все скины купить. Это перебор.\n\nПорой слышал от очень молодой аудитории, что игра \"помойка\", но сами играют в неё без остановки. Если играют, значит всё-таки нравиться. Так говорят люди, которые бросают слова на ветер, не обдумав. Соответственно и вес таких слов теряется, также как и уважение к говорящему. Повторяю это всё субъективное мнение одного человека.\n\nИтог: Игра точно стоит своих денег. Пожалуй нет ни одной онлайн игры, которая меня так сильно затянула бы. Постоянно можно получить кучу эмоций от игры, в т.ч. адреналин. Но так как здесь постоянная борьба, игра часто выводит на эмоции. По этому не подходит слишком нервным и слишком эмоциональным людям.","timestamp_created":1627901147,"timestamp_updated":1627901147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660319864749908447","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96803541","author":{"steamid":"76561198084404265","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":85877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2436,"playtime_at_review":22718,"last_played":1660575840},"language":"japanese","review":"鬼ごっこが好きな人におススメです\nサバイバーは基本的にマッチングが長く、キラーは短いです","timestamp_created":1627900662,"timestamp_updated":1627900662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498031467199325562","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96803201","author":{"steamid":"76561198234166920","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6601,"last_played":1650712367},"language":"russian","review":"ИГРА
