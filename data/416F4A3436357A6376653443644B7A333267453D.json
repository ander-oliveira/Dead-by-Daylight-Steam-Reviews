recommend this game highly. It features a overall great roster of both killers and survivors to choose from, though of course some are better than others when it comes to killers. Honestly some killers feel somewhat pointless to play while others, with the right combination of ability addons, are basically a guaranteed win. But as this game grows Behaviour has done a good job at balancing and adjusting killers and perks. Apart from that, this game is definitely worth its pricetage. Starting off it will be pretty darn scary as you wont know all the mechanics yet, and that will lead to some frightening encounters. As you get to know the individual killers, the scary aspect will fall off. But the competitive grind that is this game will always remain. Yes,this game can be a grind. Especially if you want to unlock DLC killers/perks without paying money. But it never felt impossible or unfair in my opinion. There are great cosmetics for those who love to show of their style, and plenty of good players to give a challenge to those who seek it. I'm no game reviewer admittedly. But i simply had to recommend this game. Not perfect. But nothing is. As i finish this review id like to give a word of advice for both new killer and survivor players.           Killers, please remember that you are just that, a killer. And as that title suggests you are in no way,shape, or form a person of honor if you choose not to be. There are no made up rules. Many survivors, for whatever reason,are entitled to believe that a killer shouldn't do this or cant do that. if you have to camp, or tunnel to win then do so. And embrace the salt that WILL follow. Its what makes being a killer so fun.           Survivors, never feel bad if a sweaty killer main accuses you of \"Gen -Rushing\". All that means is you did the objective, and just like the killer, there are no made up rules or regulations. Your job is to make it out alive, not to please the person trying to kill you. Remember that working as a team is key to winning, but its a fine balance. You have to know when to save someone or even when to let them die so you and the others can keep living. With time you will learn to know when to be a hero.But remember your objective is to make sure YOU live. Help other IF you can/want.                                     \n  I hope to see you all in the fog,and goodluck!","timestamp_created":1574056106,"timestamp_updated":1574056106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57406028","author":{"steamid":"76561198077494951","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":23473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21250,"last_played":1639626481},"language":"english","review":"Balance Issues","timestamp_created":1574055840,"timestamp_updated":1574055840,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57405637","author":{"steamid":"76561198876223048","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1645478231},"language":"russian","review":"njg","timestamp_created":1574054994,"timestamp_updated":1574054994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57405630","author":{"steamid":"76561198965919027","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22448,"last_played":1659037025},"language":"english","review":"Hide-and-seek forever!

Then proceed to crouch relentlessly =) When you do finally give up and chase someone else, I will be there waiting to insta blind you and laugh as you attempt to chase me again. Only to waste more TIME. the only time you'll hit me is when I need a speed boost. ONCE the gens pop, unless you have NOED, you are not going to catch me. Please you think legion is one of many, I have SWF (survive with FRIENDS!) all with the same build XD, there is almost no winning against a SWF, the odds will always be stacked against you, do you think i'm going to play with RANDO's? NAHHHH!!! Now after this patch, you'll never know if its a SWF. which is great for ME<3\n\nIf your new to this game its not going to be fun for you, people like me will ruin this game for new killers because its not forgiving at all. I've been playing this game since the beta. Survivors barely got hit and killers are so easy to take advantage of. You can press A,S,W,D in that order during a chase and right as the killer swings its forces the killers camera to look left as you go right. Its not hard, the devs made the auto aim for killers super exploitable. Which is great because instead of fixing it, they just add more content to the game and nothing gets fixed. SOOOOo I can continue doing what I do with no actual worry, because the devs do not care. \n\nThe only killers now worth playing is essentially hillbilly and spirit and MAYBE nurse and freddy. other than than have fun eating pallets and flashlights. \n\nAm I a SKILLED player? absolutely not, all i have to do is press space and you get stunned for nearly 3 seconds and if you choose to break said pallet thats another like 2-3 sec. now multiply that by 15-20 and all 5 gens are done ;)\n\nWhich by the way is not including time WASTERS, or standard loops or GOD SHACK XD\n\nI can face roll this game because of the unfair advantages in it, if you are struggling as survivor, copy my build and learn how to loop. if you cant flashlight who cares. grab a medkit with a needle and you'll be fine, or a toolbox and you'll be FINE. \n\nin a day I went from rank 15 to 3, then played killer and waited for my survivor to DE RANK so i wont have to wait in insufferable lobbies. \n\nThis is not a casual game, this is strictly a competitive game. There is no hand holding, no training, no NADA. If you are a killer you will be shown no mercy. as there is no perk to stop 4 people with 3rd person cameras to finish 5 out of 7 generators. HA you brought RUIN? kool man I'll take it out within the first 2 minutes. Have fun wasting a perk. SINCE TOTEMS SPAWN IN THE OPEN! Might as well run Corrupt INTERVENTION AND GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH. If you play survivor and lose its because you haven't learned the game yet. Get good and for the love of god STFU about noed, literally just cleanse totems and once again the killer would have wasted another perk slot. Literally Noed was made to play against survivors with NOBRAIN. Ebony mori is my only issue but who cares since i have an arsenal of unfair perks as a survivor.\n\nI used to be a killer main but being a survivor is much easier and I don't have to work as hard. who was my killer main? hillbilly of course! Insta chainsaw is SO yummy! why even put any thought into playing when you can sprint across a map, unless you cant. but who cares you find someone rev up the chainsaw and BLOOP, free HOOK.","timestamp_created":1574054345,"timestamp_updated":1574054345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505395710468292236","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57405136","author":{"steamid":"76561198121922166","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6980,"last_played":1653105630},"language":"schinese","review":"就是屠夫匹配的慢","timestamp_created":1574053921,"timestamp_updated":1574053921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57404362","author":{"steamid":"76561198865314454","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":15691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1654779061},"language":"russian","review":"Идеальная игра советую всем!\n","timestamp_created":1574052187,"timestamp_updated":1574052187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57404344","author":{"steamid":"76561198369448631","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":38923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38281,"last_played":1622557266},"language":"schinese","review":"不错的游戏  要是可以发消息就好了 哪怕是快切消息\n","timestamp_created":1574052146,"timestamp_updated":1574052146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57404162","author":{"steamid":"76561198321493392","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":45628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":21,"playtime_at_review":14798,"last_played":1659715149},"language":"schinese","review":"喜欢","timestamp_created":1574051726,"timestamp_updated":1574051726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57404144","author":{"steamid":"76561198355024793","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13631,"last_played":1635769972},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกแนะนำ","timestamp_created":1574051688,"timestamp_updated":1620132937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57403719","author":{"steamid":"76561198386656494","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":50793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45453,"last_played":1595542021},"language":"russian","review":"хоть и разрабы дауны и не могут сделать лучше а тольео хуже.и серваки пиздец как лагают.мне она почему-то нравиться)))\n","timestamp_created":1574050734,"timestamp_updated":1574050734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57403539","author":{"steamid":"76561198045314874","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":23125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14857,"last_played":1628399958},"language":"english","review":"Nearly perfect multiplayer horror game! Fun matches, competitive spirit mixed with memey behavior from players.\n\nALMOST worth it...but the grind is real. You can't diversify your gameplay, because each character levels independently. This means you can't unlock perks and items for all characters to use. You won't be able to main multiple killers, until after about a hundred+ hours into the game.\n\nIf this were the only thing, I'd say it's still worth it. Not as fun to the casual player, but leveling up is part of the fun! EXCEPT the base game only offers a small fraction of the game content available...there are 18 DLCs, and the base game starts you off with four characters/killers + a couple chapter/DLCs depending on which platform you're playing on. To play the entire game, with access to all survivors/killers/perks you'd have to spend over $200...\n\nBut that's not all! Behaviour Interactive made the brilliant decision that a price of $20-40 for the base game, and $7-8 per DLC was not enough. You can spend even MORE money on their battle pass system (typically designed for free games) and expensive cosmetics!\n\nI used to willingly buy cosmetics to support the devs, but the company has poor leadership. All they care about is slapping a price on everything possible, and milking players for what they're worth.

This game is super fun to play with and without friends. Learning to play both sides has been a blast, and I only plan on quitting this game when my friends do. With that being said, although I love this game I could not recommend it to anyone in its current state. This game is a mess and is only fun to play with a lot of experience under your belt. I have almost 300 hours in this game and I am still very far from being considered a good player. Alongside the huge learning curve for a lot of the killers, the matchmaking system is absolutely brutal, and will make any new players experience dreadful. Even besides the matchmaking, this game is a buggy mess. Things will hit you when you would normally be completely safe, lagspikes will put you in an entirely different spot and everything seems to just be random on if you survive or not. Speaking of random, this game has a lot of RNG, which is not fun. Totem spawns will either be godly, or they will get cleansed within a second, making you a 3 perk killer. Even though all of these are big problems with this game, my biggest problem with this game is Balance. This game is the least balanced game I think I have ever seen. In red ranks, some killers are just not viable without addons. Killers like the nurse and spirit could win games with no perks whatsoever, and killers like legion and Bubba couldn't win games on their best days against a survive with friends team. Survivor perks are super unbalanced as well, making only about 6 of them useful to run. All the other perks on both sides are completely neglected because they just aren't good. Perks like adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Balanced landing, and unbreakable just make killer not fun to play. Sometimes it is fun to try a new perk build, but chances are once you step outside of the survivor meta perks, you are going to get steamrolled by a spirit w/ prayerbeads. This game is fun if you are wiling to push through the bullshit but in its current state I could not recommend anyone buy this game.","timestamp_created":1574043501,"timestamp_updated":1574043501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57400070","author":{"steamid":"76561198040149412","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":9739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":544,"last_played":1601248911},"language":"english","review":"ITS REALLY FUN AND SPOOKY PLAY WITH ME","timestamp_created":1574043410,"timestamp_updated":1574043410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57400038","author":{"steamid":"76561198909908344","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1960,"last_played":1620196347},"language":"koreana","review":"재미있음요","timestamp_created":1574043354,"timestamp_updated":1574043354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57399902","author":{"steamid":"76561198244001698","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3020,"last_played":1574203096},"language":"english","review":"Very boring not sure how anyone can put more than 2 hours into it.","timestamp_created":1574043088,"timestamp_updated":1574043088,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57399662","author":{"steamid":"76561197985199753","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":190330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1606,"playtime_at_review":69809,"last_played":1660590645},"language":"english","review":"fun and addictive !","timestamp_created":1574042693,"timestamp_updated":1574042693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57399386","author":{"steamid":"76561198183496117","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":36687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23652,"last_played":1658125454},"language":"russian","review":"Радует набор разных убийц на разный вкус, геймплей всегда захватывает.","timestamp_created":1574042160,"timestamp_updated":1574042160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57399228","author":{"steamid":"76561198893579456","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":63329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13401,"last_played":1648954824},"language":"russian","review":"В общем игра не чего только частые проблемы с серверами и конечно багов не меньше.Пинг всегда 190-200.Когда с другом играю, то вообще 300-350 жду пока починят сервера, а так если вы купили сервер дбд, то тогда можете смело покупать и игру денег вам точно должно хватить).Насчет оптимизации она в этой игре не какая, у меня 8 ядер 4 гц, 1050ti, 16 гб оперативки 75 фпс еле выдает, так что если пк старый, то конечно лучше не покупать игру.","timestamp_created":1574041851,"timestamp_updated":1597918333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57398673","author":{"steamid":"76561198148061920","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":23597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6691,"last_played":1658189787},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo recomendo muito, divertido e demais, pretendo passar horas jogando ainda, porém tem muitos problemas ainda.\n\nUm dos principais problemas:\n\n-Tempo para achar partida mesmo com vários jogadores procurando\n-Otimização eu diria podre para um jogo desse, que roda pior que GTA V sendo que GTA V tem um mapa absurdo de grande, milhares de veículos, texturas NPCs e etc...\n-Hitbox costuma ser bugada\n-Jogo crashar do nada\n\nInfelizmente nem toda empresa é que nem a epic games que sempre busca corrigir esse tipos de erro dando seu parecer para os usuários.
