leva um pouco de tempo, já que precisa upar diversos personagens pra liberar os perks nos outros, mas nada impossível, já que você pode farmar pontos com um personagem e gastar em outro, é um ótimo jogo, principalmente se jogado em call com outros 3 amigos, fora isso, vai precisar de um pouco de paciência com os jogadores que ficam escondidos em armários durante a partida inteira ou esperando morrer pra pegar a escotilha (isso acontece mais do que deveria) fora isso, é bom, principalmente por ter um certo tempo que não caio contra hacker's, que estava sendo bem frequente e isso é

Enjoying playing with a friend, getting scared, running away. Or on the flip side, playing the Killer. Instilling the fear and having fun with their unique abilities. \n\nBut if you plan to play this game any more than a couple matches a day I would highly recommend you TURN AWAY.\n\nInitially it wont seem like it, and in fact will seem almost the complete inverse. But dead by daylight is extremely survivor sided. So if you want to play Killer, forget it. Having gotten to rank 1 as a killer myself multiple times(and rank 2 survivor), once you go up against survivors with all of the meta perks, that know what they're doing. You will not be having fun anymore. This game babies survivors to no end and it ruins the fun for an essential piece of the game, Killers. \n\nI don't wan't to waste your time with long, redundant statements and explanations. But if you like enjoying playing a game for more than a couple matches a day, or even enjoying playing it at all at a certain point. I'd suggest you unfortunately look elsewhere. \nIf they fix the glaring issues, which they absolutely won't. Then i will adjust my recommendation.\n\nEdit: 6/7/2021 Much later coming back to this review. There has been no change and unfortunately no change in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately i love the concept and hate that Dead by Daylight is the only successful game within this Genre. It is an absolute waste of money unless youre fine just completely dropping the game once the initial novelty has worn off. \nAs a side note as well the community does not help one bit. Toxic, and biased. So many arguments but because of the inherent 4:1 ratio survivors to Killers. When looking more closely its more like 5:1 or more. There are always more people whining and complaining about X killer is too strong (none are). X perk is broken. They need to punish you for camping. When the game already does that inherently. Etc. The survivor bias of the devs and the very apparent nature that they do not play their own game or at the very least do not understand it. Is extremely disheartening.\n\n6/5/2022: after taking a long break. coming back it seems it has only gotten worse. Though there is the potential for positive change with a supposed upcoming rework of the 40 most used perks and apparently the core objectives as well. We'll see but im not holding my breath.\n\nTLDR: Blind/Deaf Devs. Toxic Community. Imbalanced game. Not worth your money unless you are ok with uninstalling after novelty wears off quickly.","timestamp_created":1609712737,"timestamp_updated":1654473816,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83942478","author":{"steamid":"76561198106308364","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1710,"last_played":1612918521},"language":"english","review":"gud gaem\n5/10","timestamp_created":1609712603,"timestamp_updated":1609712603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513513505458831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83942003","author":{"steamid":"76561198884142337","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":14822,"last_played":1659524052},"language":"schinese","review":"我是傻逼","timestamp_created":1609712164,"timestamp_updated":1609712164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83941784","author":{"steamid":"76561198242162840","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":813,"last_played":1642294075},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uau, muito bom, morro sempre e quase nunca venço, recomendo para crianças com problemas no coração, muito calmo, pra família toda jogar num domingo de churrasco.

Wykonanie niestety jest bardzo przeciętne a obecnie gra ma więcej minusów niż plusów. Gra jako zabójca jest w większości przypadków niesatysfakcjonująca i ma się wrażenie że wszystko działa przeciwko tobie. Twoja wygrana często zależy od szczęścia, lub znacznej niekompetencji ocalałych ale nawet jeżeli starasz się jak możesz, pocisz się i trzęsiesz, czterech toksycznych śmieszków pewnie rozwali cię z palcem w dupie i jeszcze znajdzie czas na wykonanie swojego natywnego tańca przy wyjściu. Z drugiej strony jednak, zwłaszcza grając jako początkujący ocalały, jeżeli nie spędzisz całego meczu w szafce, lub zrespisz się za blisko zabójcy, twoim losem najprawdopodobniej będzie tunneling lub camping. Jeżeli natomiast wspiąłeś się na wyższe rangi, możesz spodziewać się w najlepszym wypadku Ruin, Undying, Discordance, NOED, BBQ&Chili, Pop Goes The Weasel itp. bo gra nie karze niehonorowych zachowań (wręcz je nagradza), ani nie nagradza wybierania żadnych perków które nie są meta. Gra oferuje 26 zabójców, z czego darmowych jest 5. Jest to prawdziwe osiągnięcie, za które należy pogratulować BHVR. Nie przychodzi mi na myśl ani jedna inna gra, której 4/5 zawartości jest dodatkowo płatne. Technicznie rzecz biorąc, nie za wszystkich zabójców trzeba płacić. Wydać pieniądze trzeba za postacie licencjonowane, w przeciwieństwie do nielicencjonowanych (których jest 17, z czego na start posiada się 5, więc istnieje 12 oryginalnych postaci niedostępnych na początku gry), które można zakupić za pomocą \"Błyszczących Odłamków\". Jednakże, za jeden poziom można dostać 300 Odłamków, a zabójcę, który który kosztuje 9000 można odblokować dopiero po około 35 levelach, co (szacuję), przenosi się na 100 godzin rozgrywki. Żeby odblokować wszystkie oryginalne postaci bez wydawania jednego grosza, trzeba spędzić ok. 10.000 godzin, biorąc pod uwagę okazjonalne prezenty w postaci Odłamków rozdawane podczas różnych świąt i eventów. Przypomina to kontrowersję związaną z Battlefrontem II. Niestety, w przeciwieństwie do EA, BHVR nie ma zamiaru pozbyć się tego problemu, ani nawet go zaadresować. Bez zbędnego rozpisywania się, jeżeli na G2A pojawi się jakaś zniżka -80% polecam grę wypróbować, ale PROSZĘ - nie wydawaj żadnych pieniędzy na DLC, nie wspieraj chciwych developerów tej gry. Albo, jeżeli już się uzależniłeś, rób co chcesz.

The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.\n\nThe Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.\n\nMore information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com\nKey Features\n• Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?\n\n• Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.\n\n• A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.\n\n\n\n• Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.\n\n• Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.\nREAD MORE\nMATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION\nThe developers describe the content like this:\n\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content","timestamp_created":1609708537,"timestamp_updated":1609708537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83937653","author":{"steamid":"76561198079030253","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1658637456},"language":"brazilian","review":"LOVELY hitbox (Patch 4.5.0) :)","timestamp_created":1609708371,"timestamp_updated":1613351729,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83937000","author":{"steamid":"76561198272021969","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":118025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2188,"playtime_at_review":110070,"last_played":1660552836},"language":"english","review":"pretty good job so far 👍","timestamp_created":1609707834,"timestamp_updated":1609707834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83936977","author":{"steamid":"76561198249832770","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1655061437},"language":"english","review":"all the killers have so much cake \ni lost","timestamp_created":1609707817,"timestamp_updated":1609707817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83936712","author":{"steamid":"76561199087555126","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1648676878},"language":"russian","review":"дададададададада","timestamp_created":1609707590,"timestamp_updated":1609707590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83936457","author":{"steamid":"76561198863986750","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1609121315},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo é ótimo, porém a Steam não te dá suporte caso sua conta seja hackeada e te culpa dizendo que o bloqueio é culpa sua, sendo que vc não tinha acesso a conta e nem sabia de nada do que estava acontecendo .

update: Let's play DBD, haven't in a while.

Trash can.\n\n3/21 update: this game is a dumpster fire. Avoid.\n\nWhen Obama told everyone that they should learn to code, the developers of DBD whispered back: No.\n\nFor a game with an incredibly satisfying gameplay loop, awesome licensed characters and tons of ways to customize your playstyle - the whole experience is a buggy shit-fest with horrendous \"dedicated\" servers, a broken matchmaking system and gameplay imbalances that leave a sour taste in your mouth.\n\nAdditionally, the barrier to entry for new players is insane at this point. The sheer number of perks (especially ass-tier filler ones) that you have to grind through to get a decent build going is lunacy. The bloodpoint grind in this game should've been addressed years ago, but why do that? To top it off, new players get tossed into the meat grinder with rank 1-10 players all the time (cue blackguy???meme.jpg) Seriously, has the collective IQ of the game dev industry tanked that sharply?\n\nIn the hands of a competent developer, this game would be a multiplayer masterpiece. Instead, bh-EA-vior keeps pumping out mediocre chapters to keep the DLC cash flowing. And it's not like they couldn't make a fortune on things like paid emotes if they just put a little effort in. \n\nThey need to take a page out of R6 Siege's history. For god sake, if Ubisoft can do that, then this troupe of morons should be able to, as well.\n\nPatch 4.5 Update: the collective IQ of the entire dev team is lower than room temperature. A failure from top to bottom. And I really hate streamers who think they have clout, but this game will honestly die when more and more streamers abandon this pile of shit.
