After some more playing I have now run into numerious bugs, however the game is still fun and enjoyable and heres some quick tips I found worked for myself when I encountered a bug...\n\n1.Loosing the space bar..\nI've played a few matches where all I could do was walk around and normally attack couldnt hold mouse 2 for my special and the space bar wouldnt allow me to break pallets or vault after survivors\n--Fix--\nUpon loading into my second match (with still no space or mouse 2), I alt+tab (minimized) the game and the second it closed my computer had opened windows media player?.. (i never used that program before.. Not sure if it was just random or an actual bug) once I resumed the game all keys seemed to be fixed.\n\n2.lobby simulator... self explainitory hopefully lol \n--fix--\nclosing and re-launching the game seemed to fix... that being said when I attempted to back out to research for a match my game actually ended up freezing, lobby background but no charater and all options except esc to go back which played a sound but did nothing..\n\n3.Broken Equiped item survivors carry in\nI havent personally run into this bug yet as I do not have alot of items to use in game however i've seem many people run into this bug. making the item un-usable and kind of turns the item into a watch on the survivors hand (LOL must be medic o-clock!)\n--Fix--\nFind a box in game open it and swap out the items dropping the broken one for an actual item, then you can pick up the original.\n\nHUGE ONE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH\n4.Opening the game and it does nothing...\nI've noticed multiple times now (every 2-3 times I go to open the game) I note it doesnt actually start.. so being a little tech friendly I opened task manager and tracked the running process, which looks like its doing something (but not opening the game..)\n--fix-- \nend the process through task manager and close out of steam completely and relaunch (100% works for me when I do this.. if you do not have access to task manager or the processes close out of steam completely and restart the computer should work fine after)\n\nI honestly hope this bugs get addressed, I know personally a few are being looked into however with the game being free this weekend I cant help but see the reviews turning negative because people cant even load into the game. I will state again I find the game to be really entertaining and fun as I have never played a game quite like this one.

But what failed was endless and endless unneeded nerfs that jsut make the solo experience even more unfun.\n\nYou'd think this' encourage you to play SWF and play with your friends... but loe and behold, killer mains also have an issue with this, out of a paranoia that if you do luckily manage to outplay them, you're obviously a coordinated SAS NAVY seals team with advananced knowledge of coordination training and coordinates on every variation of a map possible. Thus they're trying to get this mode removed too.\n\nPut simply, killer is the power role. There is no disagreeing with this, this is simply how the curren balance is. Should they be the power role? of course. But not to this level, it simply makes every level a 4 man stomp if the killer puts in a little effort. It's ridiclous. and way too overbearing. Survivors have had needed mechanics nerfed, perks nerfed and their meta nerfed while nothing new has been added to aide them. Animations and latency favour the killer when they shouldnt. Hitboxes are still broken and bugs and exploits still exist in the game to favour the killer for months now.

Je compare ce jeu à un MOBA, toujours les mêmes cartes et le même type de partie, alors au bout d'un moment on s'en lasse et tous les nouveaux tueurs qui proposent un nouveau gameplay sont payant. Alors certes, le jeu n'est pas bien chère mais à force, 10 euros par-ci par-là, ça monte vite et ce jeu ne mérite pas d'être à plus de 40 euros. Au final pour 20 euros le contenu est bien vide et on a vite fait le tour. Dead By Daylight devient une pompe à fric qui n'a peut-être encore que deux années devant lui avant de finir dans les oubliettes si les tueurs restent payants.

Не новая, но вполне интересная концепция игры с ассиметричным геймплеем.\n В игре есть 2 стороны:\n \"Выжившие\" - Люди, цель которых починить расположенные на карте генераторы, открыть ворота и сбежать к костру, при этом помогая другим таким же выжить. Усложняет всё это дело \"Убийца\", который должен ловить и предавать жертвоприношению людей. К сожалению, выжившие отличаются лишь внешне и озвучкой, никаких геймплейных различий нет.\n \"Убийца\" - Служитель коварной Сущности, который должен убивать людей, принося их в жертву, и не дать им сбежать. Убийцы разные, каждый со своей уникальной способностью, из-за чего каждый играется по своему.\n \n На самом деле, первые несколько часов игры могут действительно напугать - то резко вылетит убийца, то ошибка Easy Anti-Cheat... Но за 30-50 часов привыкаешь. В игре присутствует система как визуальной, так и геймплейной кастомизации, что способствует подстроить игру под себя. НО! Множество \"Подношений\", \"Перков\" и \"Улучшений\" просто малоиграбельны из-за их бесполезности и наличия более полезных вещей. Игра подойдёт любителям совместного выживания, так как играть с друзьями может быть очень весело и даже над многочисленными багами тоже можно посмеяться. Очень сильно игру портят, как это ни странно, сами игроки, которые засрут тебя за любую мелочь - играешь так, как кто-то не хочет - п*ор; используешь перк, который кому-то не нравится - у*ок; случайно ошибся - е*ан. Особенно распространено оскорблять игроков-киллеров, которые не отходят от крюка после повешения жертвы на крюк, хотя очень часто выжившие сами виноваты в этом. Игровой баланс, в целом, на стороне выживших и это одна из основных проблем игры, так как очень часто случайные игроки унижают далеко не новичков, а игроки со связью вообще могут втоптать в грязь большинство маньяков. Сами подумайте, во враждебном мире таинственной Сущности, где царят мрак и туман, где находятся безжалостные убийцы, которых вертят как детей, которым щёлкают фонариками и приседают за сброшенной доской. Вспоминаются слова \"Роршаха\" из фильма \"Хранители\": \"Это не меня заперли с вами - это вас заперли со мной.\"\n Для тупых: Зачастую, не людей тут пугают и ловят, а наоборот, киллер вынужден страдать.\n Так же стоит отметить тот факт, что за 6 лет игра игра на стороне \"Выживших\" практически никак не изменилась, всё тоже самое.\n\nПлюсы игры:\n1) Интересная концепция.\n2) Разнообразие. Игра может завянуть не на одну сотню часов.\n3) Асимметричный геймплей.\n4) Лор игры. Лор очень интересен, жаль что в игре он никак не раскрывается, имеется только в текстовом варианте.\n\nМинусы игры:\n1) Плохая графика.\n2) Плохая оптимизация.\n3) Большое количество багов и недоработок.\n4) Отвратительное и очень \"токсичное\" комьюнити.\n5) Ужасная система защиты, взломать игру может каждый, а скрытый профиль - гарант того, что вас не забанят.\n\nИгра однозначно стоит внимания, НО не излишнего.","timestamp_created":1481807408,"timestamp_updated":1648992588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59647834300994873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28386702","author":{"steamid":"76561198027810188","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":265419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51414,"last_played":1637154888},"language":"spanish","review":"Decidí cambiar el puntaje del juego ya que los útimos cambios arreglaron mucho pero mucho.
