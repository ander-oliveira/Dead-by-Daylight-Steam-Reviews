Survive with friends.\n\nSurvive with friends is a lot of fun, it adds a new element to playing survivor as you can communicate with your fellow stragglers (albeit you need to use a third party VOIP like teamspeak or discord). The problem is it's incredibly tedious and honestly near impossible to get a game via survive with friends. You have to re-ready up every time the group fails to find you a game, I think in a 1 hour period me and my friends pressed the ready button around about 70-80 times before we got a game, the worst part is if the lobby you find then crashes or the killer leaves, you have to start the process all over again. I've spent more time in queue spamming the ready button like a maniac than actually playing the game with a 2 hours session being 1.75 hours in queue and like 15 mins in game.\n\n2. Glitches and bugs\n\nThere's a crazy amount of game breaking bugs in the game, I'm fine with the occasional graphical bug but when playing killer and I get glitched into and then permanently stuck in a pallet, it gets pretty damn annoying, also a few of the offerings don't work, I used the one that's meant to spawn as far from the killer as possible and I ended up spawning only a few meters away from him while my friends were on the other side of the map. There's also many other game breaking and just plain iritating bugs in the game but if I were to list all of them this already lengthy review would become a multi-volume novel.\n\n3. Game stability\n\nThis game crashes. All the time. You also lose any offerings, add ons and items you were using in the match when the game crashed and you also lose pip (the means by which you rank up in game). I thought at first my game was just unstable and only me, after playing with friends and watching streamers, turns out the game is just generally unstable to the point of insanity. Frankly I'd call my schizophrenic grandmother more consistently stable than this game.\n\n4. Hackers\n\nI expected some sort of hackers to be in this game, almost all online games have them. However I thought the anti-cheat would at least prevent mindlessly blatant hacks, like speed hacks and noclip hacks. I recently played with a hacker who was playing wraith, and on that day I learned that the wraith could fly. Hacking is a serious problem in this game and the anti-cheat is pretty much useless, reporting should do the trick but that doesn't get me back the pip and items I lost, which hurts since I already lose enough as is to game crashes and other glitches.\n\n\nConclusion.\n\nIf the developers fix these 4 things than I'd absolutely love to give the game a thumbs up, I really do enjoy the gameplay in spite of these things but I would never recommend this game to someone else in its current form, there's just more negatives than positives right now, which is dissapointing since the game is cool in concept and is incredibly enjoyable when you get the rare match that isn't bugged or hacked. I could complain about game balancing as well on that note, but that's not the focus of this review, I see no point in even touching on game balance when the game is barely even stable. I hope the devs fix these issues in the near future so I can change this to a thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1472557056,"timestamp_updated":1472557056,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25246928","author":{"steamid":"76561198106234147","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":26199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4357,"last_played":1573917139},"language":"russian","review":"Зашибись","timestamp_created":1472554921,"timestamp_updated":1472554921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519685029983520508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25246841","author":{"steamid":"76561198148095892","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":41,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1472370475},"language":"english","review":"Fvckin fps drops when you  play","timestamp_created":1472554409,"timestamp_updated":1472554409,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25246315","author":{"steamid":"76561198115016946","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1488076876},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Daylight: Gute Spiele Idee, Mittelmäßige Umsetzung, und dass Schlimmste Lobby System seit der Erfindung des Internets. \n\nIn Dead by Daylight Spielen im Normal Fall entweder 3-4 komplett neue Egoistische Spieler gegen einen High Level Killer mit OP Perks.

Da ist der Loose von vornherein klar. Da die Gegner nicht nur erfahrener sind sondern auch mehr perks und bessere perks haben. Solche Spieler haben fast immer einen Sprint boost von 150% für 3 Sekunden... Das ist ein fast schon unverschämter vor teil gegen einen low level Killer. Und wenn ich als survivor gespielt habe hat mich in 5 games erst einmal jemand vom hacken geholt. Es wird fast immer, nicht mal versucht. Das Team play ist quasi nicht vorhanden. Wenn die Entwickler sich auf das konzentrieren würden was die Spieler Stört wäre es ein tolle Spiel aber so wie es jetzt ist muss ich sagen das ich den 6 Jahren in dehnen ich gemobbt wurde mehr Spaß hatte. \n\n\n!!!DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!","timestamp_created":1472552257,"timestamp_updated":1472552257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521551728248596191","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25246119","author":{"steamid":"76561198215814735","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1515673250},"language":"russian","review":"Игра топ просто,топ хорор,рекомендую!","timestamp_created":1472551292,"timestamp_updated":1472551292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25246032","author":{"steamid":"76561198156349319","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2322,"last_played":1524077787},"language":"english","review":"FAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nFAILED TO JOIN THE GAME\nJOINS GAME\nKILLER LEAVES\nRESTART","timestamp_created":1472550891,"timestamp_updated":1472550891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516985118389129639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25246004","author":{"steamid":"76561198327029149","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1422,"last_played":1481511752},"language":"schinese","review":"我一直都不知道为什么我一个20段萌新会一直碰到1 2段的人皇什么时候官方才能改一改","timestamp_created":1472550723,"timestamp_updated":1472550723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494652420282363892","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25245740","author":{"steamid":"76561198007936454","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1427,"last_played":1480701249},"language":"russian","review":"Радует, что над игрой постоянно работают разработчики.

Although addicting, it seems to be attracting more negative feedback rather than positive. I for one, approve of this game and would recommed or buy it for a friend. \n\n[h1]The Killer?[/h1]\nI'm not a good killer, and I've ran into a few games (where not all games are like this, mind you) where survivors boast 'surviving' when they successfully escape. I know the point of the game is to kill all the survivors, but I also enjoy the entertainment and thrill the game brings. Reaching 10k for a pip is a win to me regardless if all 4 survivors escape. I'm also not one to \"patrol\" or \"camp\" unless it's blatantly obvious that survivors are around me (i.e.; seeing scratch marks or just finding one behind a tree). I enjoy the rush of preventing the generators being popped and if I see someone using infinites, I just move on to the next guy, or, ultimately let them escape. No point in boosting someones ego for using a spot a killer can't counter (unless you're the trapper).\n\n[h1]The survivor?[/h1]\nI'm a rank one survivor and although I've put in 200+ hours into this game, I have to say that the thrill of hiding from killers is amazing especially if they don't see you in plain sight. I admit that camping killers are a massive downside to this game, however, I also firmly believe that the developers are working to counter any patrol or camping that is done to prevent altruism. I hate infinites although necessary to avoid getting captured by the killer, I also understand why they're put into the game (i.e.; random map spawns with blimp window blocked but now tractor has pile of hay which could ultimately be used as an infinite (although I have seen killers counter this fairly easily)). \n\n[h1]...surviving?[/h1]\nIt boils down to how well you know to keep yourself hidden from a first person camera. The killer has a lot of advantages when it comes to spotting a survivor such as scratch marks or even breathing. However, the survivor has great advantages as well to counter that such as premonition, spine chill, and iron will, which are amazing indicators and techniques to quiet your character. \n\nIs this fair to a Level 50 killer who somehow stays Rank 20 and plays with new Rank 20 survivors? Of course not because the killer would have unfair advantages and perks at his grasp but it is also likewise. I know survive with friends is an amazing feature but does bring some disadvantages but again, boils down to how good you are at finding a survivor or hiding from a killer (I would know as I have had rank 20 killers, fresh with no perks, take me down).\n\n[h1]Tl;dr[/h1]\nI approve of the game and what the developers are accomplishing. It seems equally balanced unless you get players who play 24x7 and know how to operate a killer such as the Nurse.  \n\n[h1]Other tid bits...[/h1]\nThe matchmaking seems fixed to an extent. I have had to press 'Ready' several times just to be returned to the lobby which is really annoying [08/29/2016]. I've seen more than 4 survivors join an already started game a lot more recently now than I have in the past. The anti-cheat system needs to develop and learn quicker (my personal rant). And finally, the lag problem needs to be fixed. There's too many Koreans playing on U.S. download regions (or that's what it feels like). I do agree that they need to get a beefy server and host it that way (my opinion: have survivors join and would wait for a killer, or vice versa, so the matchmaking process isn't so borked).","timestamp_created":1472522064,"timestamp_updated":1472522135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25240480","author":{"steamid":"76561198125666080","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":33931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2571,"last_played":1635704517},"language":"english","review":"first of all the online matchmaking needs to be fixed asap its been broken since it came out. the gameplay is fun but very repetitive maybe some new game modes and content would be great. dont get me wrong its a fun game overall but after about 1-2 hours i close it because of repitition.","timestamp_created":1472520764,"timestamp_updated":1472520764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491803258657455444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25240338","author":{"steamid":"76561198072670850","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":46385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":63,"playtime_at_review":3618,"last_played":1660131472},"language":"english","review":"This game just isn't fun anymore.
