Its only once you get to the top floors that you start to realize the building is swaying.\n\n[i]my anger:[/i]\nCutting to the chase. First, the core survivor goals of the game need to be COMPLETELY overhauled. At high ranks killers are gen-rushed with little to nothing they can do about it because each survivor on their own is so strong due to loops, SWF, and the 5 million second chances they are given via perks. Holding M1 for 80 seconds straight isn't fun at all for survivors so increasing gen time any more then it already is would be ludicrous. But in its current state, gen speed is completely unfair, forcing killers to use perks they might not want to use just to give them a chance. From what I can tell a rework for the games foundation is NEVER going to happen because the survivor community has become so entitled to being able to almost 1 v 1 a killer that nerfing survivors into well, SURVIVORS would be met with catastrophic backlash. So if the game is going to keep the survivors as strong as they are the killer NEEDS more time/ways to hinder survivor progress. 80 seconds for 1 survivor on a gen (less if there's multiple which there usually is) is way too quick. I recommend adding other required objectives for survivors. Second, the devs have absolutely no idea how to balance a multiplayer video game. They seem to balance the game based on low-mid ranks? Causing high ranks to be absolutely broken like I mentioned above. Killers they deem \"balanced\" are completely useless at high ranks and perks they introduce as \"balanced\" are completely useless or brokenly good at high ranks. You balance a multiplayer video game based on the HIGHEST skill level, this creates a trickle-down effect that ensures the game at all ranks is fair. But Behavior doesn't grasp this concept. Third, the devs care more about pushing the next big bi-monthly cash grab rather then to fix the game. Each DLC release takes 1 step forwards and 10 steps back. Usually breaking things in the game that will stay broken for months to years. The most recent DLC, \"A binding of kin\" was admittedly by the devs NOT. FINISHED. And they released it anyways because they know this lovely, toxic, nearly brainwashed community will accept anything in the end. It doesn't matter how many people complain about the DLC, months after the release, the DLC will have nearly tens of thousands of downloads and Behavior will have made bank. I could go into all of the gameplay mechanics like looping, keys, moris, perks etc. but I wont because those topics have already been discussed to death.","timestamp_created":1607849225,"timestamp_updated":1648096274,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82251331","author":{"steamid":"76561198120261372","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":265814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":83,"playtime_at_review":132468,"last_played":1660602105},"language":"english","review":"Poggers!","timestamp_created":1607849171,"timestamp_updated":1619238737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82251231","author":{"steamid":"76561198153983186","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1607852846},"language":"english","review":"What in the ...","timestamp_created":1607849048,"timestamp_updated":1607849048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82249870","author":{"steamid":"76561199089786890","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12185,"last_played":1622615745},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩可观","timestamp_created":1607847516,"timestamp_updated":1607847516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82249742","author":{"steamid":"76561198879234810","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1645769335},"language":"schinese","review":"zbc","timestamp_created":1607847355,"timestamp_updated":1607847355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82249627","author":{"steamid":"76561199020507473","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":68937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1057,"playtime_at_review":20941,"last_played":1659608180},"language":"english","review":"Actually nearly killed myself, not recommended.\n\nEdit: New bugs crash every application on your computer.

The game isn't scary, situations that would normally be scary, like being chased by the killer, turn into annoying games of ring around the rosy. The game ditches its cool concept as it poorly supports a more serious competitive tone.

The hitboxes are like 6 feet from the survivor and I've gotten the \"Internet\" error several times now. Listen to your community and stop breaking whats fine and actually fix whats broken. I guess we got the hatch animation out of this mess lol\n\n\nGame can be a lot of fun when you get down under rank 15. Best played with survive with friends. downsides are that the community can be really toxic and killers will camp you on the hook or tunnel you to get the kill over and over and new survivors will fall for it and pull you off the hook  just so you can get downed again. Best to just do generators to put pressure on the killer. \n\nOverall fun if you put time into it. Ives played it off and on for 3 years on consoles and PC. Just try to get to rank 4 or better and life will get (somewhat) better for you in the game.","timestamp_created":1607811943,"timestamp_updated":1613165049,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82217549","author":{"steamid":"76561198336891471","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1656159701},"language":"spanish","review":"los asesinos se la comen\n","timestamp_created":1607811701,"timestamp_updated":1607811701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82217497","author":{"steamid":"76561198028742269","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":22093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17217,"last_played":1657928843},"language":"russian","review":"Вы только думаете покупать или нет? \nСерьёзно?)\nОднозначно, да к покупке!\nУвлекательная и разнообразная система прокачки. \nБольшое разнообразие совмещаться билды, перки, вещи и т.д\nСам геймплей увлекательно захватывающий. \nНифига не надоедает. \nСистема поиска тимейтов огонь.","timestamp_created":1607811655,"timestamp_updated":1607811655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82217022","author":{"steamid":"76561199084767201","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4257,"last_played":1652918149},"language":"brazilian","review":"ESSE JOGO É MT BOM UM POUQUINHO ERRADO EM QUESTÃO DE HITS E TALS AMS E MT BOM O JOGO EM SI\n","timestamp_created":1607811188,"timestamp_updated":1607811188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0vjArPYCfoPRuQI="}
