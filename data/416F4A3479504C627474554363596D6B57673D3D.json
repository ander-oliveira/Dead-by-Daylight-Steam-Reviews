No, none of that private mode bs. Yes, private mode partying works, but it's not really fun unless you have 5 friends playing all at once, the odds of that are really slim. I understand they are trying to keep the integrity of the game by having people going in solo and queuing with strangers online (the whole idea of surviving without knowing the other survivors), but I do think they should make a casual play system where you can queue with your friends against other online players. They can keep ranked as solo queue and that's fine. Or even make a system where you can have a 1v1, 2v1, 3v1, 4v1, or 5v1 ranked queue... they got to see that people are spamming join lobby online to just try to get to the same lobby as their friends, pretty sure that's an issue :)","timestamp_created":1466444516,"timestamp_updated":1466444516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23672146","author":{"steamid":"76561198038593047","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1571164731},"language":"german","review":"Es macht Spaß das.

Imagine Left 4 Dead but you can only play with randoms. This issue IS one of their top priorities though.\n\n-Lackluster Tutorial (Just watch some tips and tricks online and youll get the jist)\n\nPros:\n- Playing a Survivor is equally terrifying and rewarding whenever you out manuever or outwit the Monster. Use your guile and wit to manuever the map and complete the objectives while always being aware of your surroundings.\n\n-Playing the Monster is both satisfiyng when you catch someone and is not as brainless as you may think. By playing to each of the monster's strengths you need to be devious and think like a hunter. Running around in circles revving your chainsaw is not gonna get you anywhere. Predict what your victim's next moves are and catch them in the act for the satisfying sacrifice.\n\n-The Perk and upgrade system surprised me (as I went into this game blind) and is icing on the cake and the key to it's replayability. You unlock random items and perks in which you can equip via your loadout. Perks are the most prized and give you slight to moderate buffs for your character and are also different based on your...class? The Monsters each get different ones which is obvious, but then I looked up and discovered each of the four surviviors had different perks and strengths and werent just carbon copies. \n\n-In Summary: The Game is buggy, and honestly should still be in Early Acsess but that doesnt mean the developers have given up.

Fun gameplay, games can be stressful like they should. And there is a few jumps when the killer is suddenly right behind you\n\n2. Progression system is done pretty well, you can mix and match perks and items to build your survivor how you like.\n\n3. Each survivor and killer has a purpose, they all get different perks and you need to level ALL of them to unlock everything.\n\nCONS\n\n1. They still have not fully fixed killers and players rage quitting the match, which causes the other side to gain no points and lose rank.\n\n2. There still isnt any queue with friends system, they implemented private match mode first instead (Whose idea was that seriously? Should have been play with friends first and THEN private match later). They said they are working on it but we are still waiting.\n\n3. The balance of the game needs a bit of work, infinite vaulting through windows and self healing for survivors, while killers like the wraith are very underpowered compared to the other choices. \n\n4. Camping killers, the killer can hook  you and then just sit right infront of you staring at you until you die so there is no way to save yourself or have others help you. YES this is a bad strategy for the killer in general, however it is extremely anti fun for the survivors. \n\n5. No SLI support? I know this complaint doesnt apply to many people, but seriously, I'm running two 980 Ti in SLI and get 60-70 fps in this game. I'm used to 144Hz and today in 2016 not supporting SLI is unacceptable\n\n6. Hackers, Not talking about aimbots and wallhacks, I'm talking about the level 50 prestige 3 people with 2 hours in the game. They arent THAT common, but something needs to be done to track and ban these people. Its a similar problem like PayDay 2 had where people hack their profiles to be maxed out\n\n7. No custom keybinds. Also no ability to toggle crouch\n\n8. Some maps feel to similar, while there is 3 different zones the big corn field map is the only one that really feels different, maps need MUCH more variety to keep people from getting bored.","timestamp_created":1466440133,"timestamp_updated":1466440432,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":89,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.679941654205322266","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23671031","author":{"steamid":"76561198016644212","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1466381137},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun kesinlikle kolay değil. hem insan olmak hem killer olmak zor. leveli yüksek olanlar çok avantajlı oluyor. ayrıca arkadaşınız yoksa tek başına insan olmak cidden zor çünkü oyunda beraber hareket etmek çok önemli o yüzden iade ettim ben.","timestamp_created":1466439895,"timestamp_updated":1466439895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23670982","author":{"steamid":"76561198068396263","num_games_owned":1841,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":43,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1466439246},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了一局，卡在墙里出不来，延迟有点高，游戏模式有点无聊，另外xboxone手柄完全不能用啊~~","timestamp_created":1466439655,"timestamp_updated":1466439739,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23670959","author":{"steamid":"76561198043840880","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":1284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1112,"last_played":1468891383},"language":"english","review":"Okay my first review of this game was to recommend it. Nevermind that. This game is fucking stupid and poorly built.\n\nLots and lots of technical errors and animations/interactions from the stoneage of gaming. No idea why they put them in. \n\nThe real thing that's bothering me is how ridiculously stupid the gameplay is. As a killer you're basically a retarded half dead man with a terrible arm and mostly useless abilities. \n\nThe trapper, for instance, has bear traps that everyone can just escape from immediately. No shit, I've been in multiple games now where I have someone almost sacrificed and then another person steps on a trap I laid near the sacrifice, and they both just immediately get free. Nope. Nope. Nope. \n\nOn top of that survivors aren't afraid of the killer. They don't need to be because it's so fucking easy to rescue your friends. You get like 5 fucking minutes to rescue them from being sacrificed. What the hell is that? If the survivors have any form of communication, you will lose almost immediately. \n\nThere is no skill based matchmaking  system and that's equally annoying as I've played people who have probably around 50 hours in the game. \n\nThe other killer with a chainsaw is utterly worthless because there are no open spaces in this game. His ability literally just hurtles you into the nearest piece of cover. I've never played the Wraith but he seems like the only viable option. All the consumables and perks do NOTHING for the killer. They are completely worthless, whereas the perks for the survivors basically negate any advantage you may have had (you probably have none). This game is frustrating at best and boring at worst...

Music, details, dark mist, crows, surroundings made of damaged and abandoned things and buildings - everything works perfectly to create an immense and scary atmosphere, in which you are supposed to survive / hunt others. The goals are quite simple, yet are difficult to achieve. \n\nOverall gameplay is pretty good, but it is true that the survivors have more chances to escape the killer, who is faster then them, but cannot jump through windows or other obstacles and if the survivors are cooperating enough, it can be very frustrating game for the hunter. However, whichever role you play, it depends on your SKILLS, not on some flashlights, traps, bells, medkits and other things mentioned in many reviews. This game was made for mature audience, not for children, who, and it is understandable, sometimes cannot understand the true potential of this excellent game and are angry, because they cannot win. \n\nIt is true that there are some bugs and lags here or there, but it occurs in around 1 in 10 games, so it is not so bad. \n\nMany people complain about the matchmaking - meaning you can play with 5 friends or with none of them (no duo, trio is accepted in this game). But it has its point - the game stands on the idea that four people find themselves on some place and only their fear and feeling for survival connects them. Would it be fun if 3 of these survivors were sky.pe - friends and tell each other, where is the killer, where are the traps and whether or not repair this generator? I think not, the game would lose all of its magic.

It will stop the lobby hoppers. They are saying they are working on some tweaks and bug fixes. I am switching my review from Do Not Recommened, to Recommend. Now that making playing with your friends a lot easier, other bugs are easy to look past as long as they get fixed soon. I still stand by a way to communicate with randoms would be great, even if the killer can hear. Not everyone has 4 friends or what if you are playing by yourself one day. \n\n**End Edit**\n\nSo after 4 hours of playing the release version of this game. I will say, do not buy it! There are multiple things that need to be fixed and addressed. \n\nKinda simple things really, add the ability to talk to other players. It doesn't matter if the killer can hear or not. Why is this not a thing. \n\nWhich leads into the next point. 4v1, more like 1v1v1v1v1. Everyone plays this as it's every man for himself, Not 4v1 LIKE INTENDED! Now is this due to the fact we can't talk to one another? Killer catches you, other players leave you there. Sure the killer can be camping you, which is dumb on his part as the others can fix generators and possibly escape. Also you're giving up more points for hitting and downing others. \n\nWraith is slightly broken, while you can't attack if you're cloacked, you can body block and still move while uncloacking. You don't hear the heartbeat while he's cloaked and if you're playing on low/medium settings, you can barely see him while he's cloacked. But if you're playing on High/Ultra, you can see him no problem! Also there are no \"advanced graphic settings\" only presets. \n\nThe sound is awesome and gameplay is solid, but playing with friends? Better have 4 so you can play a private match cause you can't party up (right now anyways). So you have lobby hoppers, Also there is really no penalty for quitters, you lose a rank? Big deal, it's messed up right now anyways. \n\nI'd agree with most and say this is more \"early access\" than full release. There is also a lack of communication from the developers, could this be due to e3? Last we heard, they are working on getting the deluxe edition stuff fixed, which should have been fixed on release date. But behind honest, I bought Deluxe Edition to get the beta keys for me and friends. I don't care about the artbook or soundtrack. I'd rather them focus on fixing and tweaking the game than that stuff I'll look at once or could go search youtube for. \n\nIf you're interested in the game, i'd say wait and look at the forums to see if anything wrong has been fixed yet, but until then. I'd wait. Youtubers and twitchers make the game look fun, but remember they are playing private matches, there isn't a party system yet.","timestamp_created":1466436674,"timestamp_updated":1467024930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23670013","author":{"steamid":"76561198103529781","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":13859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1591969272},"language":"russian","review":"Обзорчик от #Dauxdu по Dead by Daylight\n---------------------------------\n+ Хорошая графика\n+ Отличный мультиплеер\n+ Отличная реализация\n+ Отличные звуки в игре\n+ Хорошая система прокачки персонажа\n---------------------------------\n- Частые баги\\Глюки игры\n- Играть с друзьями можно только в приватном матче\n- На данный момент всего 3-и карты\n- Странная система рангов\n---------------------------------\nСпасибо за внимание! :3","timestamp_created":1466435512,"timestamp_updated":1466436641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589107751846313477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23669974","author":{"steamid":"76561198067004133","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":24038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1036,"last_played":1642965437},"language":"finnish","review":"Still great.\n","timestamp_created":1466435377,"timestamp_updated":1637838503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533898293972015381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23669961","author":{"steamid":"76561198223859652","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1527623120},"language":"german","review":"Wenn man endlich seinen Freunden eine gute zuneigung zeigen will, muss man das Spiel kaufen","timestamp_created":1466435315,"timestamp_updated":1466435315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23669844","author":{"steamid":"76561198064969883","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":3250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3151,"last_played":1555034572},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾制作组，这么久不修复翻窗户溜鬼的问题！\n        我玩你吗的B？一帮傻逼主播没别的本事，就是他妈的翻窗户。制作组你们修复你吗B半天修了个什么？亏了老子以为你们修复了，结果还是这B样。没修复之前一大帮中国的跪舔狗强行说这不是游戏的问题，非要说游戏就是这么设计的，我设计你妈了个B，没点脑子。一款恐怖游戏。人主动骚扰鬼翻窗户溜着玩。结果后来说修复了，然而还是这个吊样。自以为技术多好呢还，国人就是不缺这种煞笔。\n\n早在很多最初翻窗户溜鬼的现象出现的时候我就说过这个问题。上面那段话是时隔这么久后我又重新玩过后的评价。你就把你那智障地图改一下能不能行？你们不是中国人，不知道中国有很多煞笔就是来犯贱的，也不逃生就跟鬼旁边晃悠，你追他 他就翻无敌窗户。差评游戏！除了想着讨好中国玩家赚钱，外挂问题，无敌窗问题一个都没解决。\n有那功夫来看看这游戏的中国主播，有多少煞笔是开挂的，是他妈翻窗户的？","timestamp_created":1466434837,"timestamp_updated":1478279952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23669831","author":{"steamid":"76561198139802097","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2751,"last_played":1529213411},"language":"english","review":"The game itself I love! Who doesnt want to be a killer from old movies we use to watch as kids? However still some things i would change/improve upon.\n\nGameplay:\n~ BUG! Have any sort of special characters in your name will reset your survivors/killers levels but not your rank. Beware (had to start off at lvl 1 all over again)\n\n~ Was hoping for more than one type of game mode (instead of just grab generators and run like hell) Maybe introduce other game modes or different twists. Would love to be stuck inside a haunted house with one of these creeps.\n\n~Vaulting is to op sometimes this coming from a survivor player, some instance of the maps where you can just vault over and over again to keep away from the killer is sometimes a bit op. There was one instance with 3 windows all next to eachother and no way for the killer to touch you.\n\n~ Survior co op play, this has been said so many time I think I dont need to state it once again.\n\n~Map generation is another thing, winning a match is based on how lucky your generators spawns are, Ive seen maps where 4 generators all next to each other making it impossible to get with a killer able to cover all 4 at once.\n\nRanking:\n~ For a game about survival and escape you loose rank if you escape to fast, seems to be more based on \"grinding/farming\" that actual escaping and surviving to rank up\n\n~ As a killer, if a survior disconnects/rage quits after you capture/hook/pretty much anything you loose those points you should have gained thus loosing rank/blood.\n\nMatchmaking:\n\n~Notice alot of bugs when it comes to match making, either having to relog, or spamming join lobby to get into a match\n\n~Needs to be some sort of matchmaking based off level/rank. Having a lvl 30 hunter and 4 lvl 5 surviors with no perks doesnt make for a very fair match.\n\n\nThese are just my random thoughts.

If you like competetive games then try this out for sure, but if not then i would't recommend this.","timestamp_created":1466424479,"timestamp_updated":1466424479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456467777490615845","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667625","author":{"steamid":"76561198222887312","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":900,"playtime_at_review":36377,"last_played":1660573912},"language":"russian","review":"Приседай и щелкай фонариком, подвал ждет тебя :3","timestamp_created":1466424142,"timestamp_updated":1567247799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667612","author":{"steamid":"76561198005648545","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":22058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1641769378},"language":"english","review":"OK.   a few things first.  Dead by Daylight is super hard on your nerves.  I mean, jangly, shredded, shaking to the point you have to sit back for a couple minutes after you complete the match, whether you survive or not.  For people who do not like Horror genres, being scared or the adrenaline spike you get after playing the most brutal game of Hide and Seek ever, you do NOT want to play this game.\n\nHaving said that.....\n\nHoly jumping Jesus, this game is crazy CRAZY addictive.  Let's start out with the game itself.  You and three other survivors  are on a randomly generated map, with a killer who's only purpose is to kill you by sacrificing you on a meat hook.  You escape by finding five generators on the map and repairing them, which reveal the exit(s).  During this time you are unable to communicate with your fellow survivors, saving pre-arranged signals developed before the match started.  \n\n  Any noise you make alerts the killer and displays on his screen.  ANY noise.  Screw up a generator repair, he hears it.  Wimpering in a closet while he's going by, he hears it.  Knock a pallet down, you guessed it.  The map is large and varied, so the killer may be on the other side of the map, or he might be in the cornfield with you.  The only way you know for sure is the scary music with violins ramps up and your heartbeat starts getting really loud.  If he gets close enough to you, you'll spot his field of vision as a red mist near the ground.  Note to new players, if you can see the red glow behind you, chances are good you are hook-bait.  Survivor's play in third-person mode, whilst the killer plays in first-person mode.  This allows the survivors to have 360 degree vision, whilst the killer is only able to see in directly in front of him.\n\n  Now in addition to all of this, there is a Meta-game as well.  Your characters may be equipped with items such as first aid kits, toolboxes, maps etc. etc. purchased with Bloodpoints (XP) or found in each match in chests littered about the sprawling map.  These items give you bonus's and help you escape; however, if you are caught with one in the map and are sacrificed, you lose it permanently.  Conversely, if you find an item in the map and escape with it, it is part of your inventory (until you are sacrificed with it, losing it).  This makes it a double challenge on the map as you are looking for generators and items, while keeping an eye out for the killer who is probably behind you.\n\nThere are currently four survivors to choose from and three killers.  It's simply amazing.  The more I play, the more I want to play.  Get this game.  Unless you are not a horror genre fan, this game is a must buy.","timestamp_created":1466424078,"timestamp_updated":1466424240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667544","author":{"steamid":"76561198015300085","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":87,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1466340425},"language":"russian","review":"Игра говно. 0 выживших из 10.","timestamp_created":1466423755,"timestamp_updated":1466423755,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479951411485671997","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667402","author":{"steamid":"76561198311541089","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1466845665},"language":"tchinese","review":"fps drop\nmany bug\nbut its fun","timestamp_created":1466422989,"timestamp_updated":1466422989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667391","author":{"steamid":"76561198064667340","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":35612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":388,"playtime_at_review":5543,"last_played":1660178749},"language":"english","review":"Its fun","timestamp_created":1466422889,"timestamp_updated":1466422889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452031970024108887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667280","author":{"steamid":"76561198072335109","num_games_owned":1363,"num_reviews":234,"playtime_forever":2108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1794,"last_played":1595889777},"language":"russian","review":"“Я знаю точно наперёд -\nСегодня кто-нибудь умрёт.\nЯ знаю где. Я знаю как.\nЯ не гадалка, я - маньяк.”\n\nТак уж повелось, что хоррор игры как правило однопользовательские, либо кооперативные и в них нету такого мультиплеера где игрок монстр бы ловил бы игроков, а те лишь бы беспомощно барахтались.\n\nКак правило угроза в хоррорах это ИИ на подобие Resident Evil, либо сбалансированный мультиплеер стенка на стенку, похожий на Left 4 Dead. Тут же выжившие могут лишь боязно убегать, а киллер должен принести в жертву как можно больше людей.\n\nПохожая игра все же была, называлась она Dead Realm (DR) которая больше напоминает салочки, но судя по обзорам игроков - на DR разработчики забили и я очень надеюсь что в Dead by Daylight (DbD) разработчики так не сделают, все таки у игры хороший потенциал.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=704819535\n\nПри самом старте вы можете выбрать за кого играть, либо за киллера, либо за выживающих. Выживающих четыре, а киллер один. Всего на выбор дается четыре персонажа и три монстра (будут добавлятся еще).\n\nЧтобы выиграть выжившим необходимо сбежать с локации через двери, либо через люк. Чтобы открыть двери, необходимо зажечь 3-5 генераторов (в зависимости от количества игроков за выживших) и открыть саму дверь. А люк открывается автоматически, когда остается один выживший.\n\nМонстру необходимо переловить всех выживших, но сам убить их он не может, а должен вешать их на специальные крюки чтобы принести их в жертву и не дать им слезть с них.\n\nВсе монстры так или иначе отсылают нам к определенным фильмам ужасов к примеру монстр ХиллБилли явная отсылка к кожаному лицу в “Техаской резне бинзопилой” и т.д.\n\nТак как игра не шутер, то пинг здесь при игре за монстров не настолько важен, а выжившие все равно никак не могут остановить монстра, да и сервера “почти” стабильные.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=704820090\n\nВсего сейчас доступно 4 карты (обещают добавить еще 8), на каждой из которых все процедурно генерируется: генераторы, локации, объекты, выходы, люки, барикады и окна - все это случайно перемешивается на карте, поэтому никогда заранее незнаешь что и где находится.\n\nУ каждого монстра есть свой особый перк, который поможет ему охотится на людей у Билли это бензопила, у Охотника это ловушки, а призрак может уходить в невидимость.\n\nМонстр всегда ходит быстрее выживших, поэтому выжившим очень часто надо прятаться и всячески двигаться так чтобы запутать врага, слегка оторваться по могут всяческие баррикады и окна через которые выжившие прыгают гораздо шустрее монстра.\n\nПосле матча начисляют специальные кровавые очки, которые можно потратить в Bloodweb, в которой можно получить перки и одноразовые предметы с дополнениями для них.\n\nПредметы можно так же находить и на карте в специальных сундуках в основном это аптечки, фонарики и т.д.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=706486367\n\nНо у игры так же есть и минусы. Просто невероятно огромное количество багов и недоработок, разработчики могут даже с Ubisoft посоревноваться в отвратительном качестве игр на старте.\n\nОчень часто игра бывает просто зависает, либо вылетает. Часто при поиске игры пишет Failed. Перки абсолютно не сбалансированы. Вся валюта достающаяся потом и кровью, легко накручивается читами.\n\nА при игре за выжившего до сих пор есть баги на которых можно бесконечно убегать от монстра. В игре даже нету простого лобби что бы сыграть в одной команде выживших с друзьями! Только лобби исключительно с другом монстром.\nКуча дисконектов и загрузок. Практически полность не работоспособный рейтинг.\n\nИгра получилась классной чего и говорить, за маньяка играть весело, а за выживших порой крайне страшно. Мне игра очень понравилась, но я не поставлю ей идеальную оценку, потому что слишком уж в ней много недоработок, которые портят общую атмосферу.\n\n+Весело за маньяка\n+Страшно за выжившего\n+Много перков\n+Никогда не знаешь какая будет карта\n\n-Много багов\n-Много недоработок\n-Дизбаланс\n-Не работающая ранговая система\n\n7 из 10\n\nUPD: Они не фиксят баги которые могут полностью крашнуть вам гейм, зато вводят платные DLC с монстрами и другими жертвами в игру за которую вы уже заплатили(!), можете спокойно класть болт на все то, что я написал выше.","timestamp_created":1466422335,"timestamp_updated":1481970662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":77,"votes_funny":43,"weighted_vote_score":"0.787481248378753662","comment_count":19,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23667118","author":{"steamid":"76561198027961355","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1746,"last_played":1537813318},"language":"english","review":"Not at all scary, but brings me back to my childhood hide-and-seek days!","timestamp_created":1466421419,"timestamp_updated":1466421419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48681214451789856","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23666999","author":{"steamid":"76561198095281671","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15886,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1614117054},"language":"russian","review":"Когда я был на 20 лвл за свинку и я ходил включать генераторы, Папич все время крутился возле генераторов и спрашивал, чего не чинишь, почему тебя так трудно найти?.
