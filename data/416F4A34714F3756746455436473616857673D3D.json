Der Grundgedanke ist ganz gut, aber an der Umsetzung hängt es noch ein bisschen.\n\nDas Spiel basiert auf einem 4 vs 1 Prinzip. 4 Überlebende müssen vor 1 Killer entkommen. Hierbei sind die Ziele sehr klar definiert. Die Überlebenden müssen versuchen alle Generatoren anzuschalten und anschließend die Tore öffnen um zu entkommen. Sollte nur noch ein Überlebender am Leben sein und mindestens 2 Generatoren wurden bereits eingeschaltet, hat dieser noch die Möglichkeit durch eine Luke zu entkommen (wenn der sogenannte Hauptschlüssel benutzt wird, kann derjenige auch entkommen, wenn noch mehrere Überlebende leben). Der Killer hat nur eine einzige Aufgabe: Alle Überlebenden zu töten!\n\nSpielt man als Überlebender, hat man die Möglichkeit zwischen 4 verschiedenen Charaktern auszuwählen. Alle Charakter verfügen über alle Items, Add-Ons und Opfergaben, aber jeder Charakter hat neben den normalen Perks auch noch sein spezielles Perk, welches nur er hat.\nBeim Killer kann man zwischen 3 verschiedenen Charakter auswählen. Der Fallensteller (arbeitet mit Bärenfallen), der Geist (kann sich fast komplett unsichtbar und geräuchlos machen) und der Hinterwäldler (benutzt eine Kettensäge) stehen zur Verfügung. Jeder Killer hat dementsprechend für seine Ausrüstung verschiedene Items.\n\nDas Spiel wird über eine Lobby erstellt, welche der Killer eröffnet. Sind 4 Überlebende anwesend, wird das Spiel gestartet. Bevor die Karte geladen wird, werden die persönlichen Opfergaben der Spieler verbrannt und haben Einfluss auf die Karte und das Spielgeschehen. Die Maps werden immer zufallsgeneriert.\n\nAls Überlebende muss man dann versuchen den Killer auszutricksen und ihm entkommen. Dafür gibt es reichlich eingebaute Möglichkeiten auf der Karte (Fenster, Bretter, hohes Gras, Hindernisse, etc.). Sollte der Killer einen Überlebenden erwischen, dann ist die Hauptaufgabe diese an den Haken dem Entitus zu opfern. Er kann sioe aber auch auf dem Boden ausbluten oder durch spezielle Opfergaben direkt töten.\n\nWährend man Spiele abschließt, sammelt man sogenannte Blutpunkte und Blutsteine. Die Blutsteine werden für den Rang benötigt (Rang 20 bis 1, wobei Rang 1 gut und Rang 20 schlecht ist). Die Blutpunkte hingegen werden im Blutnetz vergeben. Dort schaltet man damit dann Perks, Items, Add-Ons und Opfergaben frei und steigt dann nach und nach im Level auf.\n\nDas Spiel bietet im Moment nur die eine Modifikation, dass der Killer alle Überlebenden ausschalten muss (wie oben beschrieben). Man kann diese Art auf 2 Möglichkeiten spielen. Zum Einen im Zufallsmodus (Spieler können sich nicht gemeinsam anmelden) oder im \"Töte deine Freunde\" Modus. Dort kann man für seine Freunde eine eigene Lobby erstellen, aber man bekommt dort keine Blutpunkte und Blutsteine, verliert aber auch keinerlei Items.\n\nAnsonsten gibt es noch die \"Täglichen Rituale\", welche einem extra Blutpunkte bescheren.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPro:\n- Macht in den meisten Fällen viel Spaß\n- Zufallsgenerierte Karte\n- In der Anschaffung nicht zu teuer\n- Verschiedene Charakter auswählbar\n- Blutnetz (Level) sind mal was Neues\n\nKontra:\n- Leider kann man sich Ingame nicht verständigen, was das Zusammenspiel sehr erschwert\n- Gibt derzeit leider noch sehr viele Bugs\n- Zu wenige Karten\n- Nur ein einziger Mod (Generatoren einschalten und entkommen, das wars)\n- Das Matchmaking ist die reinste Katastrophe\n- Sehr viele Cheater unterwegs\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeider ist es im Moment so, dass der Killer sehr oft aus Frust das Spiel verlässt, wenn es für die Überlebenden zu gut läuft. Man bekommt dafür zwar keine Punkte mehr für den Rang abgezogen, aber verliert sehr oft die 5.000 - 7.000 Punkte für die Flucht.\nAuch ist es ein bisschen stark unausgeglichen, vor allem wenn ein Überlebender am Haken hängt. Oftmals campen die Killer diesen Überlebenden dann ab und er hat keinerlei Chance mehr. Zwar können die anderen Spieler in der Zeit für sich das Spiel eventuell retten, aber der geopferte Spieler schaut dann nur dumm drein.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFazit: Ein recht lustiges Spiel, welches einem einen bestimmten Unterhaltungswert bietet. Doch es muss auf jeden Fall noch weiter entwickelt werden. Bugfixes, neue Karten, neue Charakter, neue Items und neue Modifikationen müssen her, sonst ist der Langzeitspielspaß sehr schnell erloschen und das Spiel stirbt aus.","timestamp_created":1466418523,"timestamp_updated":1468080014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23666562","author":{"steamid":"76561198297876308","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1467326437},"language":"english","review":"a Great game","timestamp_created":1466418475,"timestamp_updated":1466418475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563173651695251465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23666508","author":{"steamid":"76561197965966319","num_games_owned":1502,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1466418421},"language":"english","review":"Bought this game to play with my two friends, we can't join a lobby together so the only option to play with each other and others online is to spam queue and try to get into the same game.

Игра окончательно стала дном, перечислю только основные моменты:\n1. Геймплейно (тут уж вкусовщина, никому не навязываю, лишь своими впечатлениями делюсь): баланса в игре особо не было никогда, разве что в самом начале, когда было 3 маньяка. Теперь его нет окончательно. Ваншотящие маньяки, вкупе со всякими барбекью - такое себе блюда. Последний маньяк - вообще блевотная мерзость.\n2. Баги. Ну, меньше их не стало. В купе со старыми багами появились новые: например, в последних нескольких версиях игра легко раз через раз может зависнуть на экране загрузки катки. К слову, патчей пять назад подобной вакханалии вообще не было (и это уже после блокировки части серверов РКНом).\n3. Донат. Беспощадный и бесполезный. Новые бесполезные шмотки выходят чаще, чем патчи. Бесполезными я их называю потому, что игрокам предлагают за реальные деньги купить вещи на сурвов, которые куда светлее и для маньяков видимее, чем те, что есть по умолчанию. Зачем покупать то, что тебя на карте палит - не ясно. Про систему \"вы можете купить персонажей не вкладывая реальный бабос\" - и объяснять не надо. Банальные подсчеты выдают, что один персонаж обойдется ~120 успешных каток. Т.е. в игре буквально жить надо, чтобы приобретать со временем персонажей. И да, на вопрос \"так купи нужных и все\" - отвечу, что тут не все так просто - новые перки, периодически неплохо на баланс влияют, а потому, скорее не новый персонаж нужен, а его способности.\n4. Комьюнити. Кемпинг - наше все. И для половины маньяков это так и осталось топовой тактикой\n\nПроект умудрился стать более жадным и багов стало в разы больше первоначальных при том баланс умудрился стать в разы более ущербным.\n\nВ общем и целом скажу так: проходите мимо.","timestamp_created":1466408249,"timestamp_updated":1555485273,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598796367645263672","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664947","author":{"steamid":"76561198138705441","num_games_owned":331,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":3988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3427,"last_played":1642968788},"language":"russian","review":"Симулятор нелегкой починки генераторов, а не игра о маньяках и выживании.

(However, you can test your connection to the killer in lobby by typing a message and observing the delay before it appears in chat.)\n\nI don't believe the developers have plans to add communication, but I am almost certain that the other issues will be fixed shortly.

I had dedicated so much of my time to stalking the new content that the devs would introduce every now and then. Whether that be through vids, twitch streams, news, pics, etc.\n\nAs I expected when I get a good vibe from any game, there is an addictive quality to Dead by Daylight. The procedural world that randomly generates the spawn points, the generators, the chest placement; it is spot on. And having that general variety of characters, be it on the survivors or killers side, adds just a bit more enjoyment to the game and keeps it fresh every time.\n\nSo, this game is addictive, mainly because as a survivor you want to ace the killer or for more personal gain, get your survivor ranks up. As a Killer, you want to live out your sick fantasies of being the sadist you really are. But don't you worry, we are all there with you...we are all masochists and sadists who bought this game and we are enjoying every minute of it.\n\nNow then, here is the real question, is this game perfect? HELL NO!\n\nThere are so many blaring glitches in this game from instant sacrifice deaths (Instantly dying without being on the hook) to general inability to doing simple game mechanics like pulling survivors off hooks or starting a generator. (These glitches can be rare, but when you play this game as much as possible, you notice some of these game breaking mechanics.\n\nYou will notice that this game is a \"Full\" game, however, it feels as though it was an alpha build, beta at most. There are things missing from this game that they promise in the future, like MATCHMAKING!?\n\nI cannot believe some simple features, like an end game chat or even a gratitude feature to communicate to your survivor friends that you might have liked their assistance with making that last minute save on your dangling body.\n\nIf you have 4-5 friends with this game, then you can partake in \"PRIVATE\" unranked, unawarded matches where the real fun is sure to be had. You may feel when you play with your friends that this was indeed the true way the game was supposed to be played. Honestly, I believe that to be true. I sit in a match lobby for five minutes at a time watching people join and leave. 10 to 15 people will disban from the lobby before you get 4 survivors that understand that attempting to join your friends is basically a 1 in a million shot until the devs impliment the matchmaking system so you can finally enjoy the game with your friends.\n\nI wish some of the features that others are talking about were in the game at launch, such as:\n-Lore behind Survivors...instead of just making them bland faces with names that I still dont even know,\n-Lore behind killers or even the world, I understand that this environmnet is supposed to mimic that B-movie horror-slasher vibe, but even those movies had a plot.\n-More customizability to characters, even if it were through unlocks.\n-More modes perhaps?\n\nI just feel that for a paid game at $20.00...although it is not that expensive, it is just so lacking in what makes a full game feel full.\n\nI am still giving this game a possitive rating, mainly because I am addicted to it even as I play on my own, and I can only imagine how addicted I will be when my friends can join a game with me in matchmaking.\n\nThe grittiness and the gore of this game makes it a challenge every time you play it, and the varying style of play through the people you verse is what makes this game so enjoyable for such a simple concept.\n\nI look forward to what changes are to come, and I hope this game is not neglected by the devs as a cash grab. There is obviously a fanbase that is loving this game. I hope to see you all in game as improvements keep coming our way.\n\nHappy hunting.\nKeep surviving.","timestamp_created":1466406363,"timestamp_updated":1466406363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664647","author":{"steamid":"76561198173614333","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1497088228},"language":"russian","review":"КАК исправить ошибку (DX11 feature level 11.0 is required run the engine)","timestamp_created":1466406147,"timestamp_updated":1466406147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664593","author":{"steamid":"76561198309598191","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1466337603},"language":"turkish","review":"çok guzel bir oyun","timestamp_created":1466405686,"timestamp_updated":1466405686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664586","author":{"steamid":"76561198122506508","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2920,"last_played":1530747045},"language":"english","review":"good game, good kill, good run...\n\n\ngood for everyone that's know how to survive and how to kill with fun xD","timestamp_created":1466405651,"timestamp_updated":1466405651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664524","author":{"steamid":"76561198256584799","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2273,"last_played":1538543574},"language":"tchinese","review":"屠夫  -1","timestamp_created":1466405063,"timestamp_updated":1466405063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664399","author":{"steamid":"76561198200012169","num_games_owned":747,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1576522077},"language":"russian","review":"НАЙЗИ ГЕЙМ","timestamp_created":1466404095,"timestamp_updated":1466404095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53155893087387085","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664385","author":{"steamid":"76561198197671167","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":778,"last_played":1631065013},"language":"schinese","review":"表示我需要一个中文 \n","timestamp_created":1466403959,"timestamp_updated":1466403959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664284","author":{"steamid":"76561198026585002","num_games_owned":389,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1648163139},"language":"english","review":"This game is incredibly fun.

Each one was from a victim standpoint.\nFixing the generator and killer clubs me and picks me up we both get stuck at the generator and even with another victim coming back to help me , still couldn't help me.\nAnother was being bashed to the ground to the point of crawling away , victims came to heal me but couldn't and killer couldn't pick me up to put me on hook ...\nFirst time as a victim was on hook , someone helped me off and I was wedged in the beam that supports the hook and couldn't get out at first. \n\nCan't seem to play with the same people unless you're playing against friends in private match mode ( not really a problem.. but it would be nice to be able to make new friends.. )\n\nOther than the few very minor bugs I HIGHLY recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1466402128,"timestamp_updated":1466402128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553703725337982178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664075","author":{"steamid":"76561198258087692","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":33082,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1614248370},"language":"russian","review":"!GG MAN !!!","timestamp_created":1466401655,"timestamp_updated":1466401655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664057","author":{"steamid":"76561198186750951","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1521522117},"language":"russian","review":"Симулятор того чувства когда с другом решили предложить девушкам по***хаться на природе !","timestamp_created":1466401517,"timestamp_updated":1466401640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23664040","author":{"steamid":"76561198066640538","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":27407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27105,"last_played":1645532962},"language":"english","review":"It's alright.","timestamp_created":1466401436,"timestamp_updated":1575299814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23663967","author":{"steamid":"76561198272260526","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":665,"last_played":1628564094},"language":"english","review":"The Trapper on the Macmillan Estate or something like that picked me up and went into the warehouse or something, I press A & D rapidly and I escape, But fall through the floor :/\n\n11/10 For the game.\nIt's still in progress.

(해제한 퍽 슬롯은 유지된다.)\n\n\n이런 기본적인 룰 안에서 다양한 상황이 연출되는 것이 이 게임의 묘미이다. 예를 들어...\n\n살인마가 생존자를 훅에 걸었을 때 다른 생존자들이 교란하며 멋지게 구출한다던가\n쓰러진 동료를 구하는 와중에 트래퍼의 덫에 잡혀서 제2, 제3의 희생자가 발생한다던가\n발전기 2개 이상 가동한 상태에서 다른 동료들이 전부 희생되고 혼자 남아 해치를 통해 극적으로 탈출한다던가\n건물이나 구조물을 통해 쥬킹(Juking)하며 살인마를 한곳에 묶어두고 당황하게 만드는 동안 다른 생존자들이 발전기를 돌려 탈출한다던가 등\n\n이런 다양한 상황들이 이 게임의 재미를 배가시키는 요인으로 작용하며, 그런 요소가 중독성을 가지게 만든다는 점에서 앞에서 비슷하다고 언급했던 이볼브와는 다르게, 멀티 전용임에도 불구하고 오랜 기간 유저 리텐션(Retention)이 높을 것으로 사료된다.\n(참고로 데드 바이 데이라이트는 DAU(하루 접속자)가 평균 만명 이상으로, 그와 반해 이볼브는 300~400명 정도에 불과하다.)\n\n\n다만 불안정한 부분이나 불만스러운 점 몇가지도 있는데 대표적으로...\n\n• 현재 스팀 친구와 공개 매치에서 파티 플레이가 되지 않는다.

Даже абсолютный новичок, который и понятия не имеет что к чему в этой игре, может попасть в одно лобби с маньяком высокого ранга. Или наоборот: к маньяку-новичку в лобби может попасть игрок высокого ранга, а то и вовсе первого (высшего).\n2. А в плане недочёта в картах - есть такие места, из-за которых нарушается баланс геймплея, ведущий к возможности игры до бесконечности. А именно - неудачная расстановка объектов на карте, где выживающий может бесконечно долго и беспрепятственно уворачиваться от маньяка. В таком случае игроку играющему маньяком приходится либо ждать, пока выживающий не допустит ошибку (что маловероятно), либо попросту выходить из игры (rage quit), потому что это действительно может вывести из себя :(\nА в целом - игра очень достойная внимания!

You either play as one of four victims trying to escape the PSYCOPATHIC killer.... or as the killer himself. Each and everytime I enter a game as Dwight (on of the charecters) I always get this \"victim\" aura about me hiding behind walls, trees and in bushes to make SURE I dont end up like the level 1 just did.

Суть игры заключается в том что вы играете либо за охотника либо за жертву. Наверное первая особенность  игры за охотника это вид от первого лица,а в свою очередь особенность игры за жертву это вид от третьего лица. Во время игры за жертву вам и ещё трём игрокам предстоит отремонтировать  5 генераторов и убежать от маньяка,а во время игры за охотника вам нужно убить всех жертв тем самым не дать им убежать. Это примерная концепция игры,а теперь давайте по подробней.\n\nТак как больше всего я играл за жертву ,то  и описать игру за неё я буду подробней,а игру за охотника коснусь поверхностно. Как и описывалась ранее всё что вам нужно сделать это отремонтировать генератор и сбежать вроде ничего трудного,НО  на деле это не так просто.В этом по мимо охотника будут мешать тиммейты,которые не вовремя нажали на  SPACE  во время ремонта и других действий типа лечения или разрушения ловушек (да в игре есть Quick Time Event и его там много,очень много) и приготовитесь  что если вас схватили вероятность того что вам придут на помощь 5% и 100.Вторая проблема – это призрак aka *б ТВОЮ МАТЬ,КАКОГО ХЕРА ЭТА С*РАНЬ НЕВИДИМАЯ.Да,этот персонаж жуткая имба и если вы научитесь играть на нём  то убивать жертв не будет составлять  вам особого труда.\n\nТак же в игре есть система прокачки она представлена собой в виде некой паутины по которой вы должны и прокачиваться по путно получая вспомогательные предметы(аптечка,фонарик и т.д.).Если я не ошибаюсь,а я могу ошибаться,то прокачка за всех героев  разная,как разная за героев жертв,так же разная за героев охотников.\n\nА теперь самый большой минус этой игры.ЛОББИ.Если вы хотите поиграть с другом ,то вам предстоит высидеть шикарные 30 минут(а то и более) поиска одного и того же лоби ,да бы сыграть за жертву. Слова  JOIN A LOBBY,WAITING и FAILED TO JOIN THE GAME.Серьёзно я наиграл в эту игру 5 часов и где-то 2 из них это поиск подходящего лобби.\nПодводя итоги можно сказать что игра действительно хорошая и играть в неё интересно и весело и лишь только иногда страшно.Советую ли я эту игру?Да,советую,но если вы хотите играть в неё с друзьями,то лучше подождать пока разработчики сделают лобби более удобным(если сделают вообще).А так моя оценка игре 7 из 10,играите на здоровье.\n","timestamp_created":1466386252,"timestamp_updated":1466386252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528122365474700928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23661774","author":{"steamid":"76561198150650006","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1468270464},"language":"english","review":"All this game needs is party making","timestamp_created":1466385579,"timestamp_updated":1466385579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563629031181335449","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23661670","author":{"steamid":"76561198081766349","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":35473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1321,"last_played":1656096067},"language":"english","review":"Fun as hell.\nBut needs some more work, there are lot of bugs that can ruin a game, but if you get by them it's really fun.\nHopefully soon they will fix these bugs.\n\nIMO: The game should've been more polished on the release, the beta shoulda been longer so that more bugs could've been reported.
