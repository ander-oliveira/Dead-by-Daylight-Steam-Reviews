Know two things before you play: 1) the devs would rather release new content than fix old bugs, and 2) the community is incredibly toxic; expect solo queue to be a nightmare with idiot teammates that are either bad or sabotage you, and killers that will camp or tunnel you out of the game.

still manage to enjoy this game most of the time despite its faults.  I've been playing over 1,000 hours over the course of a few years and have learned to deal with the most frustrating elements of the game.  The one positive thing I have to say about this game is that it's by far the best in its genre - no other asymmetrical horror game comes close.   However, while as a veteran player I have learned to live with the game's frustrations, I think those frustrations are too overwhelming to recommend the game for new players.\n\nThe first and biggest reason is the absolutely ridiculous grind.  When I started a few years ago, the number of characters and perks in the game was far lower than it is today, and the grind at the time was still daunting.  Most of the friends I started playing with quit within a month because the grind was too overwhelming.  And a few years later, it's far, far more overwhelming.  Unless you're willing to put thousands of hours into this game (even if I wanted to, I couldn't as I have a full-time job and a family), you'll struggle to keep up with acquiring the new charcaters, perks and cosmetics that are continuously added to the game.\n\nThe second biggest frustration is the lack of balance at the highest and lowest levels.  At the lowest levels, new survivor players get steamrolled by killers because they have no idea what to do.  This is overcomable though if players are willing to put in the time and practice to get better.  However, the imbalance at the highest levels are not overcomable because of the game design.  Experienced survivor players that can coordinate on comms (this was never intended when the game was first designed) will usually win against even the best killer players, and there's no amount of practice or improvement that killers can put into the game that will overcome that.  Experienced survivors benefit from coordination and the pure math that goes into how long it takes for killers to down and hook survivors compared to how long it takes to complete generators.  Killer players have been complaining about this imbalance for years, and BHVR has done very little to address it because they worry it will result in experienced survivor players (which make up a bulk of their revenue base) to leave the game.  So what is happening right now is the number of killer players keeps declining because veteran killers are increasingly frustrated with the imbalance, while new killer players eventually get to higher levels and then experience the same level of frustration.  This has led for longer and longer queue times for survivor players during peak hours because there is a significant lack of players willing to play the killer side.\n\nThere are lots of other things to complain about, but I won't go into too much detail, will just note some of them here:\n- Every update results in a ton of bugs because the game code has become so spaghetti over time and has been poorly optimized\n- Increasingly poor performance on the same hardware because of poor optimization\n- It takes forever for the devs to implement even the most basic bug fixes\n- Devs focusing resources on changes to the game that seemingly nobody is asking for, while ignoring changes that are commonly mentioned in the game forums\n- Focusing resources on game content such as new cosmetics and characters rather than game health improvements\n- I myself have not experienced a lot of hackers, but many on the forums have complained about increasing frequency of hackers\n- Devs retaliating against well-known content creators who voice legitimate criticisms about the devs or the game","timestamp_created":1652236319,"timestamp_updated":1652236319,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115280077","author":{"steamid":"76561198880286460","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":624,"playtime_at_review":1387,"last_played":1660286593},"language":"english","review":"amazing game","timestamp_created":1652234259,"timestamp_updated":1652234259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115279845","author":{"steamid":"76561198807242357","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":20355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":190,"playtime_at_review":18970,"last_played":1659422475},"language":"english","review":"Dbd was fun until they decided to make killers that you simply can't play against with. \nBUT, still very fun, especially if you have friends to play with. \nMake sure you have a place where you can scream cuz sometimes you just can't help it when you're playing against Ghost face or Myers or even Oni who is huge, loud and fkn terrifying.","timestamp_created":1652233731,"timestamp_updated":1652233731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115279035","author":{"steamid":"76561199056153532","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":43232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":406,"playtime_at_review":36875,"last_played":1660416042},"language":"brazilian","review":"√â meu v√≠cio, ent√£o sou suspeito pra falar!","timestamp_created":1652232066,"timestamp_updated":1652232066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115278702","author":{"steamid":"76561198131359293","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":24431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":445,"playtime_at_review":13016,"last_played":1660521268},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom","timestamp_created":1652231431,"timestamp_updated":1652231431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115278262","author":{"steamid":"76561198128725075","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":45974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3325,"playtime_at_review":27685,"last_played":1660600287},"language":"russian","review":"–ò–≥—Ä–∞ –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç —Å–≤–µ—á, –≤–∞—Å –∑–∞–∫–µ–º–ø—è—Ç, –∑–∞—Ç—É–Ω–Ω–µ–ª—è—Ç, –∑–∞–±—å—é—Ç —Ç–∏–º–º–µ–π—Ç—ã, —Å–ª–æ–º–∞—é—Ç –≤–∞–º –∂–æ–ø—É, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –≤—ã –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç–µ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –º–∞–Ω—Å–∏—Ç—å, –∞ –∑–∞ –º–∞–Ω–∞ –≤–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø–µ –∑–±—Å –∏–≥—Ä–∞, —á–µ—Ç–∫–æ, –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–Ω–æ","timestamp_created":1652230591,"timestamp_updated":1652230591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558878004550933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115277051","author":{"steamid":"76561198880451062","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1656025018},"language":"english","review":"The game is very fun once you start getting used to it.
