Getting to rank 1 killer is insanely difficult because of how toxic the people are. Even as a survivor main, i do play killer occasionally and im pretty good at it, but not good enough to get to Rank 1 for the achievement so i stopped leveling up my killers and will probably never play killer again. Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time completely ruin the game and should be removed, but never will. \n\nThis game is also extremly buggy. I did a glitch that a youtuber did (of course i let the killer kill me) just for fun and record a funny match. The killer had fun too so it was a good time. However, not all bugs are fun such as getting stuck in pallets, falling through the map, etc.\n\nMy biggest problem is how toxic the community is. I understand that not everyone is \"Go fuck yourself\" or \"Camper trash\" but the sheer number of toxic players outnumber the healthy ones. In my opinion, chat should either be completely removed for survivors and killers or have an option to disable chat between people in game. When i started levelling up my killers a lot of people kept saying i camped and threatened me because of this game way too much, when in reality the first thing i did was get away from the hooked survivor. \n\nI do not recommend this game because of the extremely toxic players. If you know how to play it can be extremely fun, but when you get your ass handed to you it feels like you lost an entire leg and you feel completely helpless. Toxic players also are not only survivors, but killers as well, but not as bad as survivors.","timestamp_created":1513042299,"timestamp_updated":1513042397,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471428573131561279","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38246529","author":{"steamid":"76561198261587753","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4488,"last_played":1640230481},"language":"english","review":"Best Game To Play","timestamp_created":1513040536,"timestamp_updated":1513040536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38244707","author":{"steamid":"76561198313419098","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1501886903},"language":"turkish","review":"Steam:Bu oyunu tavsiye ediyormusunuz?\nBen:Evet","timestamp_created":1513031499,"timestamp_updated":1513031499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38244670","author":{"steamid":"76561198031677039","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":144296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":307,"playtime_at_review":77898,"last_played":1659922963},"language":"spanish","review":"arreglen los hitboxes de m.i.e.r.d.a, y dejen de nerfear tanto a los survivors y buffear a los killers","timestamp_created":1513031295,"timestamp_updated":1577778628,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38243522","author":{"steamid":"76561198307642925","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5512,"last_played":1528215220},"language":"german","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1513027119,"timestamp_updated":1513027119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38243242","author":{"steamid":"76561198228379336","num_games_owned":653,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1942,"last_played":1558913196},"language":"finnish","review":"-more and more pay to win after every killer\n-slow matchmaking\n-tons of leaver\n+fun... sometimes","timestamp_created":1513026007,"timestamp_updated":1513026007,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38242900","author":{"steamid":"76561198311935505","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5331,"last_played":1549903926},"language":"russian","review":"нормальная интересная . кровавая игрина) мне нравится быть за маньяка )","timestamp_created":1513024633,"timestamp_updated":1513024633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38242446","author":{"steamid":"76561198376902447","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":936,"last_played":1554931911},"language":"english","review":"I am highest rank in this game.

I join many in calling this \"Dead by Gaylight\" or \"Deady by Nightlight\", I find it to be enjoyable. That is, when I'm not being camped by killers who want some crappy mask, or being stuck on the ground because a killer decided to exploit mechanics like the mori for points. Honestly though, people crapped on Friday the 13th for it's \"outrageous price\" compared to Dead by Daylight, but in this game, you HAVE to buy the killer DLCs, otherwise, at the very LEAST, items to unlock them will pop up INSTEAD of other really helpful and rare items. Ah, actually, I almost forgot the HATCH GAMES, by far the WORST part of this game; you see, once you either fix all generators and everyone's died or escaped, or, with 4 survivors, 2/5 generators are done and all other survivors have died, you can go for the HATCH. The problem with this is: when the killer and survivor find the hatch, they can have a NEVER-ending standoff, why? Because if the killer ATTACKS, they won't be able to grab the survivor and they escape, meanwhile, if the survivor jumps and the killer is close enough and not in the middle of an action like ATTACKING, the killer can grab their ass and they lose; as a result, the standoffs can technically go on until external circumstances occur to stop one or both parties involved. For AGES, people have complained, but the developers haven't done jack SHIT to stop it, even though it's as simple as a time-limit until hatch closes. That all said, it's possible to have a good time, unless you just completely suck at get-away or hunting-players-games, or you have anger issues. Just don't be Bryce and lead the killer to other survivors. Seriously, don't.

Поэтому если решили брать - постарайтесь сагитировать и несколько своих товарищей. 8 из 10.","timestamp_created":1512932792,"timestamp_updated":1512932871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38218271","author":{"steamid":"76561198389330206","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2467,"last_played":1598531331},"language":"schinese","review":"我很喜欢这个游戏 ，但我讨厌这个游戏的匹配机制，是不是这个游戏黄了？我一个20小时的农场主，和几百加的大神， 怎么打？更可气的是还一直嘲讽我，怎么让人玩游戏？敌人强不要紧，我要公平啊，公平都没有，你谈什么游戏，cnm。","timestamp_created":1512932454,"timestamp_updated":1512932454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38218082","author":{"steamid":"76561198355099688","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12828,"last_played":1635373107},"language":"german","review":"Bestes Spiel alles Zeiten xD <3","timestamp_created":1512931969,"timestamp_updated":1512931969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38217602","author":{"steamid":"76561198115022027","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":68885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16242,"last_played":1640909336},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun but there should be a penalty if the killer camps or has bad connection, its impossible to get points when the killer camps or has bad connection.","timestamp_created":1512930714,"timestamp_updated":1512930714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38217265","author":{"steamid":"76561198003681713","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":15121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8637,"last_played":1658167168},"language":"french","review":"Je viens de refaire une partie après une longue absence.
