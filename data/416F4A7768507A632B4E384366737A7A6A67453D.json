It's way too unbalanced. The devs don't know what they want, and everytime they release something new they nerf the hell out of it. The community's also WAY too toxic, people complaining about the other side's perks and such, here's an example : Killers will dodge survivors for playing the game (if they have over 100 hours, if they're wearing prestige costumes, if they use items, if they use offerings that give more bloodpoints) and survivor will DC before losing so killers don't get their exp, and that's what I mean by toxic, you're literally getting punished for playing the game.The game's also more frustrating than fun, as it heavily relies on perks so if you encounter someone with really good perks, you're guranteed to lose and that's why it's really unbalanced.\n\nHowever, if you'll willing to overlook those things  I'd recommend getting it, it's competitive and well not fun but nice.\nI don't regret my purchase myself, but the game's currently way too unbalanced and it feels as though the devs rely on their community for changes rather than relying on what they what, and that's one of the reasons it's really unbalanced.  One of the sides whine? \"Oh no, it's unfair for them!\", they're getting a huge buff. The  devs are also really trying to balance the game around low ranks but it's not a good idea since it makes it really easy for higher rank players.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a good game but in its current state I cannot recommend it. Maybe on sale for its 10$ but other than that, nope.\n\nIf your curious about the gameplay :\n\nAs a survivor, you get sent into a trial with 3 other strangers/friends. Your objective is to repair generators and open the door and escape. There are a few obstacles that \"protect\" you against the killer, them being pallets and windows. Be careful though, you can still get hit when going through windows. Pallets however, can stun the killer. But they're pretty broken at the moment, since they can teleport you to the killer's side giving him a free hit. Also, if you'rre the last one alive and there are atleast 2 generators done, a hatch will open for you  and you can escape through it. There's also a way of escaping through the hatch with others, for that you'll need a skeleton key or a dull key. For all 4 people to escape using the hatch, you need all 5 gens done. for 3 people to escape through the hatch (1 dead) you need 4 gens done. For 2 people escaping through the hatch (2 dead) you need 3 gens done.\n\nAs for killer, you get to choose between a variety of killers : \"Michael myers (aka the shape) leatherface (aka the canibal), freddy (the nightmare), doctor, hag, huntress, wraith,hillbilly, trapper,nurse. However, you need to pay inorder to play as half of them (doctor, hag, freddy, leatherface and michale myers). As one of them, your objective is to hit someone once or twice to get them downed, and bring them to a hook. That's not the only way of killing though, if you use a \"mori\" offering, you can use the killer's unique killing animation on a survivor after hooking them once. Every killer got only 1 unique animation though.\n\nThat about covers it all up :D","timestamp_created":1511597281,"timestamp_updated":1513937531,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494691997766494751","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37480311","author":{"steamid":"76561198133447271","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1643554584},"language":"schinese","review":"确实是一款不错的游戏，就是现在新手时期老是被吊和被溜","timestamp_created":1511597256,"timestamp_updated":1511597256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37480206","author":{"steamid":"76561198151764129","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":14181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8531,"last_played":1655812933},"language":"russian","review":"Worst balance\nEasy anti cheat working good only in fortnite\nWorst hitboxes\nLEGION! fixed and now nothing can\np2w(50%)","timestamp_created":1511597199,"timestamp_updated":1627154560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37479977","author":{"steamid":"76561198255689577","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":35087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32827,"last_played":1657308097},"language":"polish","review":"Imagine breaking game so goddamn much XDDDD","timestamp_created":1511597074,"timestamp_updated":1613215284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37479934","author":{"steamid":"76561198030190885","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":105181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":7659,"last_played":1660372496},"language":"russian","review":"5 сломанных пробелов из 5!\nДостоинства:\n+Токсичное комьюнити\n+Свои правила игры у сурвов\n+Можно снять товарища под киллера два раза подряд и так фармить очки.\n+Пати в четыре фонаря.\n+Целых два чувака с бензопилами: один бьет с разбега сверху вниз, другой (платный) бьет слева направо(!)\n+Можно кемпить хоть весь матч\n+Степашка даже пару раз приснилась.\n+Врасенька (С) iReyn\n+Пак с шмотками и не один за ваши деньги\nНедостатки:\n-Нет голосового чата прямо в игре, чтобы можно было дисморалить прямо там.\n-Нет престижа с обмазыванием каловыми массами\n-Игра может загрузиться 1х1 с киллером\n-Нужно больше шмоток на киллеров: фирменные пилы, топоры, маски, тотемы и прочее.\n-Нет киллера Робота-убийцы с циркуляркой, всегда такого хотел.\n-Можно застрять в палете, или палет спавнится вертикально и блочит проход.\n-Особо одаренные выживальщики не в состояниии уйти с карты более 10 минут после открытия ворот: ни в люк ни в ворота. \n-Прити гуд джоб соу фар!","timestamp_created":1511597052,"timestamp_updated":1511632933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576338529586791992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37479697","author":{"steamid":"76561197987012179","num_games_owned":569,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3068,"last_played":1625980545},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is a competative online multiplayer game-- the unique scenario: a slasher/horror-type plot where you can play as either the survivors or the killer.\n\nThe developers are very proactive with updates, responding to both balancing issues and bug fixes.

Hauptsächlich spiele ich als Überlebender, habe aber auch schon ein paar mal als Killer probiert. Es entstehen spannende Runden, man muss sich konzentrieren z.b beim Reparieren eines Generators; man schafft es in letzter Sekunde durchs Tor; man muss noch einen Kameraden befreien obwohl man fliehen könnte; man steckt irgendwo fest und muss zum Tor schleichen; sich in letzter Sekunde verstecken... etc etc. Der Soundtrack passt perfekt, er ist auf die Situationen im Spiel ausgelegt. Schleicht man, rettet man einen Mitspieler oder geht man in den Keller etc. ändert sich der Soundtrack. Das macht einen großen Teil der Atmosphäre aus. Die Maps sind gut gestaltet. Man hat viele Versteckmöglichkeiten, Gebäude mit besonderen Generatoren. Sehr gerne spiele ich beim Mac Millan Anwesen oder auch in Lerrys Gedenkinstitut. Es gibt viele verschiedene Killer und Survivor, so ist es immer abwechslungsreich. Jeder Charakter hat eine eigene Geschichte. Freddy als Killer finde ich sehr gut gelungen, ebenso den Fallensteller, die Jägerin, Die Krankenschwester... Problem an diesem Spiel sind oft die Spieler selbst... es wird gecampt oder andere Mitspieler offensichtlich verraten oder später in der Lobby beleidigt, weil etwas nicht geklappt hat. Der Einstieg wird einem nicht leicht gemacht. Am Anfang explodieren eben noch mehr Generatoren, da man sich erst an die Funktionsweise der Fähigkeitschecks gewöhnen muss. Bis ich das wirklich gut konnte sind schonmal 40 Std Spielzeit drauf gewesen. Man muss erst rausfinden wie man am besten vom Killer flieht oder wo man sich versteckt. Wann man Generatoren repariert oder wann man lieber wartet... Danach kann man aber auch gut zum Spielwesen beitragen und es macht auch mehr Spaß. Klare Empfehlung, probiert es einfach aus.","timestamp_created":1511592386,"timestamp_updated":1511601009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37472570","author":{"steamid":"76561198208964092","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2007,"last_played":1569078440},"language":"koreana","review":"굿","timestamp_created":1511592375,"timestamp_updated":1511592375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37472026","author":{"steamid":"76561198218303657","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22448,"last_played":1536652938},"language":"schinese","review":"贼

(Mainly for reasons above.) But the second free weekend, even though I approached it at first like \"well I'll just pop in and chop up a few survivors and get on with my life\", I wound up putting more time in, on both survivors and killer sides, and pretty quickly found myself convinced to buy.\n\nIf you're interested, try and get in and just [i]have[/i] that fun, and don't sweat the issues. As soon as you start going forums, things go downhill. As soon as you start caring about your rank, things go downhill. (Not fast, but downhill. Fast later tho. ;P)\n\nAgain, many of the complaints about this game [i]are[/i] legitimate (YMMV, and please, when you are reading comments in ppls' negative reviews, keep in mind that those are some of the most butthurt moments of their lives, and you should probably take it with a grain of salt), but the game is popular (critically important in an MP-only title!), and has a lot of unique and positive things going for it, too. And, devs are still active and engaged, and while they currently (2017-11) seem to be in a bit of a situation with growing complaints about certain balance issues in the game, I believe they will continue to put good effort in, and fix those issues, and others! gg!\n\nFWIW I play both killer and survivor and I wouldn't say I have a \"main\" preference.
