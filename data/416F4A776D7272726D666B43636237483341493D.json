put a lot of hours into this game and it's really hit or miss if it's enjoyable or not. I play both sides but survivor more often. I get that it's hard to balance a game 1V4... especially when there is a whole other dynamic... SWF. That's where it really gets tricky. It's difficult to balance a game that you could be playing solo with a bunch of randos or all friends with communication. That being said, they seem to focus a lot on cosmetics and micros instead of fixing bugs with the game. EX: Pallet stuns are busted right now, in a previous update they claimed they were fixed which was clearly a lie. Lots of issues with matchmaking, etc. I love the game, genre and lore and whatnot... but it's extremely buggy and rage inducing to say the least. Also the forced filter was the last straw for me. I'm an adult and shouldn't have that choice thrust upon me as if I were a child.

Если у твоего тимейта фонарик то в 70% случаях вас уже 3 а не 4 ибо этот шакал будет бегать за маном в надежде спасти другого сурва\n4. Если у вас в тиме стелс клодетки то тут как повезет \nлибо гены чиняться сами по себе либо вы единственный кто будет чинить, бегать и спасть \nтак как клодетки принципиально невидимые и будут стелсить до талого\nА теперь игра за мана\nс начала игры на манах вам будет кидать лошков но после 5-7 каток вам будут попадаться мега мансеры либо мега генрашеры ( не путайте у вас в тиме таких не будет вообще )\nесли вы видете в лобби хотяб 1 игрока с консоли то знайте он будет постоянно крутить гены \nв любой ситуации  \nесли вы видите чела с фонариком он будет редкостной занозой в заднице просто потому что он не в вашей тиме.\n100% у вас будет мега мансер который имеет часов в 2е больше чем все остальные сурвы вместе взятые и будет вас унижать при любой возможности (приседать возле палеты или окна, приседать в воротах, тыкать фонарем вам в ебало )\nпока вы будете бегать за ним вам зачинят все гены на ближайшие 3 катки вперед.\nа если вы не дай бог будете ошиваться возле сурва который висит на крюке то вы чмо позорное и не важно что было ранее, даже есть вам приседали и тыкали фонарем в ебало вам запретят кемпить за это.\nЕсли у сурвов есть ключ готовьте жопу, вас будут ебать)\nвидите карту ? тоже самое при наличии любой порчи она автоматически идет по пизде \nчтобы получить полезные умения вам нужно забашлять на DLC, но не все и на том спасибо.\nИтог: в целом игра годная, аналогов нету, задумка 10 ебанутых хитов из 10\nреализация 6 из 10 \nдонат не обязателен так как любой перк можно получить бесплатно \nза сурвов играть без компании хотяб 1 человека кроме вас невозможно разве что брать ключ который к слову не контриться \nв целом сойдет, можно поиграть с друзьми и пофаниться \nНе могу рекомендовать, так как игра затягивает и очень сильно а жопа от нее горит
