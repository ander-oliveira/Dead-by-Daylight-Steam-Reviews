The game is split up into two different teams in a 1v4 setup with two different playstyles. You can either be the killer whose job it is to hunt down the survivors and make sure they do not escape, or you can be the survivors who have very limited resources to stop the advance of the killer and whose job it is to repair five generators across the map and escape. When it comes to the level of fear that is imbued in the game, the survivor's gameplay is definitely full of it, the amount of fright and adrenaline that pumps into your veins as the killer chases you down is exactly what I wanted from a horror game. As the killer you can get an almost sadistic feeling of excitement you would expect as a killer during a chase with a survivor. This game has all the correct feelings for a horror game even though its multiplayer. Its addicting and can take alot of time to master. It has a variety of killers and survivors that each have unique aspects to them. The only downside is that alot of them are DLC, but the DLC themselves usually only cost about 5 dollars each and usually add one survivor and one killer. Overall if you're a fan of horror and have a good internet connection, I recommend you get Dead By Daylight.","timestamp_created":1577664827,"timestamp_updated":1577664827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60874726","author":{"steamid":"76561198355201445","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":22353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4464,"last_played":1650586748},"language":"schinese","review":"在线合作游戏，可以结识很多朋友，和朋友玩就很欢乐。\n看别人玩很下饭，从此每餐三大碗，还能时不时淦羊腿。\n自己玩血压容易飙高，键鼠已经换了好几个了~\n制作组良心，角色设计用心，屠夫各有特色。\n但是：匹配机制SB很多问题都是基于玩家水平不对等而引出的，还有在BUG堆中玩游戏，笑。","timestamp_created":1577664222,"timestamp_updated":1617177482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60874693","author":{"steamid":"76561198405673457","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3216,"last_played":1607510329},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1577664190,"timestamp_updated":1577664190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60874675","author":{"steamid":"76561198272208635","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1655531580},"language":"spanish","review":"todo","timestamp_created":1577664170,"timestamp_updated":1577664170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60874472","author":{"steamid":"76561198449782935","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":45848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11529,"last_played":1652896711},"language":"english","review":"like","timestamp_created":1577663932,"timestamp_updated":1577663932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60874162","author":{"steamid":"76561198160125554","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":3907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1641259352},"language":"brazilian","review":"Preencheu o vazio que o Friday the 13th: The Game deixou.","timestamp_created":1577663574,"timestamp_updated":1584413863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60874145","author":{"steamid":"76561198043885022","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1843,"last_played":1656982219},"language":"english","review":"So far it's been great to try an asymmetric game like this.

You can buy the characters they create in house with in game currency or real money although it is a quite the grind to do it only in game. \n\nThe killer design is usually pretty unique, some are still boring but they have had some really interesting designs as well and I appreciate the creativity as it keeps the game fresh. \n\nThe Okay:\n\nStability has been an issue since the game came out and has had ups and downs over the years. I think they need to add a way to rejoin a still active game when your game crashes near the start because it is very difficult to win with 3 players after losing one. \n\n\n\nThe Bad: \n\nThe ranked system is not great at matching with similarly skilled players and there is no unranked play or casual game mode except custom games. \n\nA killer can just decide you will not survive by camping the hook and tunnelling you down all game, this can be really annoying if you are playing with friends and can't just hop back into queue immediately. More frustrating is when they let you sit there bleeding out for minutes and refuse to hook you until the last possible second.\n\nOn the other hand survivors can also team up to mess with a bad killer and ruin their game. They don't do anything about rude in game activities most of the time and if you DC or AFK from a toxic game you could receive a penalty. \n\nYou can report someone, but it seems to have no effect.\n\n\nBlood points are what you get for playing matches, they are also used as part of the ranking calculation and as one of the in game currencies used to get new items/add-ons/abilities. There are many blood point issues, one big one is that the most you can have at any one time is 2 million. The 8000 cap per category in game is a bit low as well, some games you are stuck on gens all game (literally the goal of the game is to power them so you can escape but it is very easy to max out on any given category except survival). You could also save 4 people and heal them hitting the cap before the 4th save or max out on boldness because totems for whatever reason are in the boldness category or you could just have a few long chases with some good pallet stuns. I have had several games where I max out on boldness before we even get a couple generators due to a long chase with multiple stuns and every chase after feels like a waste of my time. The reason these caps exist is most likely to try to stop people from farming points by working with the killer but the only reason farming happens at all is because the bloodweb is so absurdly grindy it feels like playing a JRPG. I will go into more detail on that in the next section. \n\nThe bloodweb is a massive waste where 90% of what you unlock is either barely helpful or completely useless. Most of the things you unlock are offerings which will not even make back the blood points spent on them or have little to no actual effect on the game. There are also item add ons (some of which have little to no effect) and you will not get enough items to actually use all of them. Perks are really the only thing worth taking and over 90% are not viable at higher levels of play as you need to take Borrowed Time and a few other staple perks to counter the camping most killers do (For the record I do not blame the killers for this but the devs for encouraging toxic gameplay with how the ranked system is set up). As an example of how long it takes to unlock all the perks without hacking, I unlocked all the perks on one survivor at over 400 hours of play and barely level killers at all.\n\nMany of the perks are absolutely worthless. Quite a few could be consolidated into fewer more powerful perks while others need a buff. So many are situational and you have no way of knowing if they will be useful prior to a match. \n\n\nSolutions:\n\nRanked needs to have longer season, one month is barely any time at all. If the season was three or four months instead of one that would be a good first step. Pipping up needs to be harder as well, get rid of double pipping or add a way to double pip down and require maybe 10 pips per ranked level to make it tougher to get up there. There absolutely needs to be a ranked reward system so people have an incentive to actually rank up and stay there to improve matchmaking. The number of times I have played a game and the killer is nowhere near the survivors in skill level even though their number is the same is absurd. \n\nThe bloodweb grind has to be addressed. If you add a sell function where I can sell back the useless stuff I get in the bloodweb to get part of what I spent back it would be amazing. For example: If I select a grey item for 3000 I can sell it back for 1000 or 1500. This would make the grind feel better and I wouldn't feel like I wasted so much time grinding out the only important things (Perks). \n\nTake away the cap on blood points per category in a match or raise it to a much higher level. I want to be rewarded for good play, and if I ran from the killer all game and was not able to do  gens because of it or vice-versa I want to get the points for it so I can put a dent into the asinine grind called the bloodweb. Also remove the cap on total bloodpoints or raise it to a much higher amount like 10 million.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game could be 10/10 with just some minor tweaks so it teeters on the edge for me and I hope the devs continue to work on and improve it.","timestamp_created":1577660042,"timestamp_updated":1659290203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60870876","author":{"steamid":"76561198119773600","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1631678622},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego :V","timestamp_created":1577659840,"timestamp_updated":1577659840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60870708","author":{"steamid":"76561198901553244","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":77644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":337,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1660451241},"language":"spanish","review":"SOLUCIONEN LOS PUTOS ERRORES!","timestamp_created":1577659648,"timestamp_updated":1615273910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60870696","author":{"steamid":"76561198301446640","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37488,"last_played":1602906994},"language":"english","review":"Abosoluteley love this game and always will.Had so much fun alone and with friends the perfect game to pick up if your looking for a fun addictive and affordable horror game","timestamp_created":1577659632,"timestamp_updated":1577659632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60870354","author":{"steamid":"76561198115480740","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1617497626},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegaso Buenardo el juego 10/10 recomendado cabres juegenlo UwU","timestamp_created":1577659272,"timestamp_updated":1577659272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60870332","author":{"steamid":"76561198367967910","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":529,"last_played":1638671570},"language":"brazilian","review":"MARAVILHOSO","timestamp_created":1577659246,"timestamp_updated":1577659246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60870182","author":{"steamid":"76561198888466314","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1135,"last_played":1643290870},"language":"russian","review":"Привет всем! В данном отзыве хочу Вам рассказать про игру для ПК Dead by Daylight. Появилась данная игра относительно недавно, а точнее недавно набрала свою популярность. Узнал я про данную игру, когда просматривал список игр на сайте twitch.tv.\n\nДанная игра, как по мне, очень заходит, если играть в неё ночью и сейчас расскажу почему. Суть данной игры заключается в том, что есть маньяк, который ходит в определенной области и ищет своих сбежавших жертв и есть 4 жертвы, которые пытаются убежать от этого маньяка (что весьма непросто). И вот представьте, что Вы играете ночью за жертву и чувствуете, что за Вами начинает кто - то бежать. В этом момент Вы испытываете настоящее чувство страха, так как, как будто сами присутствуете в той ситуации. \n\nРасскажу про два типа персонажей поподробнее:\n\n1) \nРоль маньяка. Если Вы маньяк, то Вы играете против четырех других игроков (жертв). Ваша цель убить всех жертв раньше, чем они смогут убежать от Вас с замкнутого пространства. Убивать Вы можете разными способами, но лично мой самый любимый способ, это подвесить жертву на крюк. \n\nМаньяк в свою очередь бегает быстрее чем жертва, так как он должен быть способен догнать всех жертв, но это не значит что играть маньяков так легко. На карте есть много различных препятствий, через которые жертвы проходят быстро, а маньяк медленно. К примеру есть стена с выбитым окном через которое жертва с легкостью может пролезть, но для маньяка пролезть через окно целая проблема. Так что такие препятствия это плюс для жертв.\n\nКамера маньяка идет от первого лица, поэтому маньяку тяжелей заметить жертв и убить их:\n\n\n\n\n\nМаньяк побеждает в том случает, если в течении игры все жертвы были убиты.\n\n2)\nРоль жертвы. Жертвы играют заодно, т. е. они преследуют одну цель, а значит в их интересах делать все сообща. За жертв можно играть как своей командой, так и с другими игроками. Жертвам, чтобы вырваться из замкнутого пространства необходимо завести 5 двигателей, после чем им будет доступна для открытия дверь, через которую жертвы смогут убежать. Но завести двигатели не так легко. Лично для меня сперва было трудновато и заводить двигатель, и выполнять определенное дополнительно условие для того чтоб завести двигатель, и при этом смотреть чтоб маньяк не подкрался сзади и не схватил меня. \n\nЖертвы же видят себе от третьего лица, им легче обнаружить маньяка, а значит у них есть время спрятаться, пока маньяк не дошел до них:\n\n\n\n\n\nИграя в эту игру, игрок накапливает специальные очки опыта, за которые можно открыть для своего персонажа определенные перки, облегчающие игру.\n\nКонечно же не обошлось и без недостатков. Во первых данная игра не бесплатная и чтоб в неё сыграть необходимо вложить немного денег (что для большинства людей будет считаться невообразимым, так как основная масса привыкла играть бесплатно). В стиме если я не ошибаюсь, данная игра стоит что-то около 700 рублей. Не такие уж и большие деньги что б испытать что-то новенькое. Ну и второй недостаток этой игры - баги и лаги. Порой, играя, вскроется какой - то баг, либо игра к примеру зависнет на загрузке (приходится перезапускать игру). Часто игра виснет на момент сбора лобби:\n\n\n\n\n\nНо что за игра без багов... Надеемся в скором разработчики пофиксят основные проблемы игры.\n\nВ целом игра очень интересная. Я бы посоветовал всем поиграть в ней хотя бы раз. Если вы сомневаетесь в её интересности, то посмотрите как в неё играют к примеру на твиче и тогда уже решите, стоит её Вам покупать или нет.
