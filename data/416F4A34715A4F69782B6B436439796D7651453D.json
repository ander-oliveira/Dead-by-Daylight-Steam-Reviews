I personally love this game to death (literally) and as such I would recommend this to anyone looking to have a good time, however if you are looking for a game to be taken seriously this is probably not for you.\n\nAnything I could say about balancing issues with perks right now would be completely irrelevant as they are always changing things to try and make the game better, (despite what people say on social media about the game being broken 24/7) the only thing that can really be argued with is the personal power of each individual killer as there is still a tier list of best and worst killers.\n\nIf you are just beginning the game it might be harder to get into compared to if you played during the beta, because there is definitely a right and wrong way to play the game (these rules can change depending on updates however). Most of the time a veteran player (mainly a survivor) will trash talk newer players for not doing \"their part\" via hiding from the killer all game rather than doing generators at every possible moment, or not healing, unhooking, etc. (it's a long list of BS). The same goes for how killers are treated as well, and overall the community is quite toxic unfortunately, but half the time if you can ignore someone and their toxicity it's better than trying to frantically type out how \"trash\" they are before the killer (who at this time is still the host of the server) leaves and disconnects the post game chatroom.\n\nFor $20 this game has a lot of content, and the devs keep on trying to make it better with updates that include new maps, killers, and survivors (which are just perk vending machines basically). However most of the killers and survivors are dlc you can purchase to unlock, but you can't practice them before you make the purchase so I would recommend doing a bit of research before you buy any dlc if you are tight on cash, at the very least the maps come free with the updates for everyone with no need to purchase.\n\nTo my knowledge there is no other online horror game quite as fun as this one at the moment, and it still gives me scares from time to time, be it accidentally stepping on a trap, or seeing Michael Meyers popping his head around the corner to stalk you for more power. I highly recommend this game because I appreciate this game and all the hours of fun it's brought me.\n\n\n\n\nI think they've done a pretty good job so far","timestamp_created":1553009147,"timestamp_updated":1553009147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527602970600128174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49647873","author":{"steamid":"76561198810739763","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":24632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5857,"last_played":1651898936},"language":"spanish","review":"Me gusta mucho, pero como no hay servidores la partida tarda mucho en empezar.

It is to pit four players against one player, survivors versus killer. Naturally the four by themselves are weak before the killer, but combined they have the capability to escape the trial. The rewards for performance in the match include blood points, which are used to progress a character, iridescent shards, which are used to buy new survivors and killers, as well as skins for all of them, and pips, which advance your rank and who you are paired with and against.\n\nSurvivors- They are effectively skins of one another, but before leveling any of the characters fully they start with a set of perks that are initially unique to them. Leveling them provides tools and new perks to take advantage of. Four perks may be equipped, and one tool taken into the match. As one levels a character, \"teachable\" perks may be picked up, allowing their unique set to be learned by other survivor characters. Their side of the playing field is to avoid the killer by crouching and sneaking around one of the maps representative of the killers' origins. The survivor sees the world around them in third-person, giving them a large field of view to navigate the area with. Complete generators scattered throughout in order to power a pair of gates around the perimeter, open them up and get out! If found by a killer, their job is to evade the killer by vaulting windows, slamming pallets on them, and generally putting distance between themselves and their pursuer or losing them completely. Should all of your trial-goers be slain, fear not! If enough generators were completed, then a hatch oozing black mist will spawn on the map, an automatic escape for the last man standing should they be able to reach it undiscovered. You can even team up with your buddies, up to three, for some fun. There is an immense more to the aspects of this game, but that is better experienced and discussed among friends and forum-goers.\n\nKillers- They must hunt down the survivors and kill them all before they complete enough generators and escape the map! The killer sees the world in first person, limiting their field of vision significantly in comparison to the survivors. As of writing there are 14 (and a 15th soon to be released) killers to choose from, including licensed killers from horror films such as Freddy, Leatherface, and Michael Myers. Like the survivors, the killer may bring up to four perks to aid them in their hunt. Unlike the survivors, these killers differ immensely from one another, including how fast they move and their power unique to them, an ability to aid them in chasing and killing those pesky flies. In order to slay their quarry, they must hook a survivor on meat hooks scattered around the maps and have the Lovecraftian Entity slay and whisk them away as they suspend painfully. Additionally, bring a Memento Mori- an item that allows the killer to kill them with their own hands! Unlike the tools of survivors, the killers have add-ons that change their power in some way, either mutating it to be used differently or making it more effective/efficient. \n\nThe game has a fairly large community that consistently plays the game and swells to larger proportions during events. Due to the naturally antagonistic and competitive nature of the game, there is a lot of dissonance between players and of course the unfriendly verbal jousting it usually carries with it. I would not suggest playing this game, and particularly killer, without having some thickness to your skin. The steam forum here is a virtual cesspool of those who whine the loudest, but the actual forums dedicated to the game are a good place to ask questions and discuss various merits of the game and topics with other players. \n\nA topic that personally irks me, there are a good deal of bugs present in this game. Usually they are relatively harmless, a weird texture here, a perimeter wall that did not load it's textures in. However, sometimes there are bugs that actively hurt the gameplay- getting stuck in objects, loading errors, being ejected from a match for connectivity issues, a killer being unable to use a power, etc. As of writing many of these bugs are minimized, but newcomers will without a doubt discover some for themselves. Behavior, the owning company, makes a strong effort to stay connected to balancing efforts and bug fixes- this summer there will be dedicated servers, as the game has been peer-to-peer since it came out which has been the source of a plethora of issues. EAC, easy anti-cheat, does a fairly effective job of dealing with hackers and cheaters- while there are certainly ways around it, admittedly ways known to myself, EAC quickly picks up on game file edits from an individual and will disconnect players in the lobby as to avoid playing with that person. A suggestion, always make sure about 15 seconds have passed while in a lobby so that the system has a chance to look over everyone. For the more competitive, a tournament scene for this game largely does not exist, however there is a very basic ranking system for both the killer and survivor side with 20 being the lowest and 1 the highest. These ranks are increased by performance on specific aspects in a match, four metrics that are specific to each side. \n\nMy major criticisms- This game lacks game mode variety. There are only generators to complete sadly, but on a plethora of maps. That said, I personally find the game varies enough to be interesting in lieu of this. Additionally, this game at it's worst faces survivors that quit the match due to poor decisions and poor connections (albeit they can see their own ping in the lobby so that is usually on them), and on occasion against poorly balanced killers. Quitting a match like this leaves the other survivors high and dry, and far less likely to escape with any success.\n\nThis community, while good at antagonizing itself, is mostly a loyal one and stands with the game strongly. You will find more players willing to work with you and have amicable discourse than ones that do not- unless name-calling starts of course. Join us, if you like competitive survival and horror icons I'm sure this game has something for you!\n\n+ Interesting and fun gameplay\n+ Large variety in survivors and killers\n+ Looks decent graphically and generally runs well- I have some gripes about its high and \n   ultra personally\n+ Progression system\n+ Interesting maps and map designs\n\n- An ill-mannered cretin of a Steam community at times\n- Bugs that seriously detract from gameplay\n- Occasional matches that prove only frustrating from bad luck or various killer/survivor \n  actions\n- Peer to peer (but not for much longer!)\n\n[b][u]Edits Log[/u][/b]:\n\nAs of patch 2.6.2, I cannot recommend the game right now. While it is still of course fun to play, it is unstable, crashes consistently and often, matchmaking (while they are experimenting with how people are queued) is longer than usual following the first rollback made in the patch, and there seems to be an unusual number of people not loading in or straight up quitting the game because it went slightly wrong for them.\n\nAs of patch 2.7.0, I can recommend the game again. The end-game collapse, while ultimately just a pretty event, is a welcome change and a step in a direction to making the game even more than it was before. Failure to load into the game no longer results in horrible three versus one games, it sends everyone back to lobby with their offerings and items (thank goodness for that). I will not address killer changes, but this patch feels good and did good.","timestamp_created":1552996946,"timestamp_updated":1557374985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49645019","author":{"steamid":"76561198335000502","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":105182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39798,"last_played":1658397855},"language":"english","review":"pretty lit","timestamp_created":1552995365,"timestamp_updated":1552995365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49644897","author":{"steamid":"76561198796172202","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3082,"last_played":1658983390},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1552994627,"timestamp_updated":1552994627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49644848","author":{"steamid":"76561198855558215","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3251,"last_played":1655574491},"language":"schinese","review":"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198325035090/\n挂个人。\n我玩人类，我和他开局在一个箱子附近，我去开箱子，他也想开，但我跑得比他快。于是他翻了一个在我旁边的板子，来回翻爆点，屠夫来追我，我跑掉了。结果他又把屠夫引过来。屠夫把我砍到，挂到树上，他直接救两次，我就直接死了。这种消极玩家根本就不配玩这款游戏。","timestamp_created":1552994331,"timestamp_updated":1552994331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546002447605133057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49644549","author":{"steamid":"76561198412040849","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":141982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":380,"playtime_at_review":55323,"last_played":1660038495},"language":"russian","review":"Ёще та помоечка но можно поиграть)+","timestamp_created":1552992660,"timestamp_updated":1606330749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49644470","author":{"steamid":"76561198808571837","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10329,"last_played":1654347106},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень нравиться но обновления только для манов делают (((","timestamp_created":1552992217,"timestamp_updated":1552992217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49644255","author":{"steamid":"76561198289304871","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3375,"last_played":1625577396},"language":"russian","review":"Основу геймплея составляет изначальный выбор роли жертвы или убийцы.

В игре появилось кучу разной кастомизации, и МИНИМУМ патчей с какими-либо фиксами багов. Каждое новое обновление не приносит ничего нового в игру, большинство моделек взяты со старых карты, некоторые карты буквально одинаковы, просто разрабы удаляют 1 дом и ставят туда другой... Никаких намёков на новые режимы или какое то разнообразие в геймплее. Если кто то ждёт чего то нового в игре, то могу вас разочаровать... Если разработчики не смогли сделать даже постоянное лобби с другом ( после каждой игры нужно снова инвайтить своего друга), а так же не могут пофиксить бесконечную загрузку (каждое обновление гласит нам , что бесконечная загрузка исправилась... а на деля НИХУЯ). Ранговая система пуста и неинтересная... Мне кажется она вообще в игре не нужна, лучше бы сделали всеобщую статистику в игре. ( на самом деле тут очень сложный вопрос с рангами) Радужные емблемы работают через попу, ты можешь всю игру отвлекать маньяка на себя (не нарочно) и выжить сбежав со всеми выжившими и получить в рот бибу (- 1 капля), потому что систему емблем делала какая то шалава, которая не играла и не тестила как на деле будет работать емблема. За 3 года игры естественно начали приходить в игру альфасамцы ( чсвшные турнирные игроки) которые думают что это киберспортивная игра... Зачем они хотят думать что это киберспортивная игра? Потому что им нужно подкрепить как то своё чсв. ( ответ прост). На слабых рангах люди играют круче чем на 1ом ранге... крута... Так же любой маньяк - новичок может столкнуться с этими альфасамцами, которые всячески будут издеваться над ним... (все люди мрази есесна). За 3 года так и не добавили награду за ранг. Обновили движок игры - сломали оптимизацию под старые видеокарты... теперь многие игроки с плохим пк испытывают огромные проблемы при запуске игры, но кого это блядь волнует, у нас на следующей неделе выйдет новый пак скинов! Не будем забывать что разработчики обещают открыть свои сервера, чтобы всякая лагающая мразота (на маньяках особенно) не бегала по карте рывками, а после не писала gg wp ez. Так же они понадобавляли кучу маньяков, из которых нормально играбельных от силы 5. Играбельных в том смысле что, смогут составить конкуренцию сильным выжившим (задротам). Так же в этой игре вас ждут краши, вылеты, читеры,лаги, невидимые текстуры, токсичные игроки, однообразные геймплей... и всё это вы можете приобрести за 500 рублей.
