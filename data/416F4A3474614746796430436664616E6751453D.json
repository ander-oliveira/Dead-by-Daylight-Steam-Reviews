 可以不客气的说  这个版本玩人类就是  为了让屠夫杀 让屠夫爽，所以现在屠夫需要很长时间才能排到人类。最后我要说一下制作组，我认为大部分人都是通过直播或者朋友了解到这款游戏的，我也是一个300小时的老玩家了，但是制作组基本都是按照国外主播的意见来改，因为合服之后，国外主播很难对抗国服人类，虽说是恐怖游戏，但是什么玩多了也就不恐怖了，如果平衡性不改回来，我想没有人会玩一个只会修电机，按QTE躲猫猫的游戏，溜屠夫的技术也是不知道死了多少次看了多少视频才学会的，制作组的一意孤行只会让萌新望而却步，老玩家心灰意冷。","timestamp_created":1501484387,"timestamp_updated":1501484387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33921669","author":{"steamid":"76561198124317510","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":88615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59782,"last_played":1658727818},"language":"english","review":"god

Also I mainly play killer so this review will be mostly from that perspective.\n\nThat being said this is a really good game.\nIt has great atmosphere and sound, lovely maps and a competitive feeling, whilst staying casual enough to mess around in with friends. No matter what you play, be it killer or survivor expect a few losses in the first game, because there is a small learning curve. At the moment of writing this review the game is relatively balanced and in a very playable state.\nYou'll have a lot of fun playing as either killer or survivor if you are lower rank.\n\nHowever there are also some glaring problems with the game, namely the connection. Because the killer is always the host if your killer has a bad connection, everyone has a bad connection.\nThere is also the issue of survivors ragequitting when being hooked to keep their items which makes it harder for killers to rank up. At the moment of writing this review there is absolutly no reason, except for a little derank, to quit to keep your items.\nBut my biggest problem with the game is that balancing issues stay in game for way too long and it can take up to months for a single unbalanced issue to be resolved.\n\nStill in it's current state I'd say this game is worth picking up, especially if you got some friends who play it.","timestamp_created":1501468595,"timestamp_updated":1501468595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613204836845397949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33918835","author":{"steamid":"76561198369748604","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":29942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2046,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1660583398},"language":"schinese","review":"很刺激的1v4 游戏，励志成为一个人皇哈哈哈","timestamp_created":1501468482,"timestamp_updated":1501468482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33918501","author":{"steamid":"76561198009171124","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1540138888},"language":"english","review":"So the game is great. Unless you get 4 people on voice call that are working together. When they cram together and block you from walking down stairs, or unhook a person because you can't attack multiple times in a row (Fucking stupid btw, who can only swing a weapon once and then has to wait 3 seconds?) and they just crwd around and take one for the team, then heal each other fully again super fast and repeat.\n\nThere are some major issues here. First off, I get why they put in the delay in swings, so if hit once you might escape the second, but seriously. To fix this all you need to do is make it so they can never \"Fully\" heal, but still incorporate a way to move at full speed, i.e Adrenaline maybe. And this way it stops people from abusing such things. OR. You could hit multiple people with one swing? Would be quite realistic if you ask me, and then they can't group together and be wimps.\n\nSecondly. Blocking the Killers way??? Seriously??? They added fucking collision?? At least give the Killer a way to push them out of the way without dropping the person you are carrying, or even attack without dropping them. It's not unrealistic or unfair.\n\nThe fact that these game devs didn't think of these things makes me feel like they are extremely new to games. Every game with collision gets abused. Every game with delays in the evil characters moves/attacks gets abused. How is this not common sense to test these and fix them? Or do the Devs not care? Was this just a money grab like every other game out there now?\n\nAll in all, needs a lot of work. And I would not recommend this game to those who get very angry quickly, because you will find these pansies who have to take advantage of technical issues, and you will lose your shit.\n\nThere are better games than this out there, and I suggest you play them and not waste your money on this.","timestamp_created":1501466757,"timestamp_updated":1501466757,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447387099266052246","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33918387","author":{"steamid":"76561198054196942","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1623829643},"language":"english","review":"Ok all in all the game is extremely fun.

The feeling of actually outsmarting the killer and losing them when the find you,or just plain escaping and winning the match is one of the best feelings any game has given me.\n\nSadly though as of right now, not sure if it is the newest update or what but now there is just a ton of bugs. Sometimes hard to even get to a lobby with others,sometimes hard to join a match. Even once I do join a match I simply lag horrificly.

Even though the teamwork aspect is on a smaller scale, it's still teamwork nonetheless,the key is that it's executed differently\n\nKiller-You get a multitude of killers to pick from to fit whatever play style you'd like and you need to focus on keep any eye on patrolling generators while also needing to make sure that you, again, know the placements of generators well while also not having tunnel vision to avoid other generators from getting fixed or letting other people escape and try to hook as many people as possible\n\n\nPros\n\nChoice-One of DBD's big differences and one I actually strongly like is the ability to choose which side you want to be on (the killer or the survivors)\n\nCharacter Customization-While I am not a fan of the one use aspect of add-ons (just personal preference) I do like the concepts of add ons and perks which allow you to essentially create your own \"build\" of a surivor (On that note, a character builder would be a nice bonus for the surivors)\n\n Character Variety and Backstory-I really like the variety and different playstyles of each of the different killers, my favorites being Michael Meyers and the Butcher, I also like the varied surivors and their backstories, everything from a science nut to Bill (awesome cameo) to a drunkard who was always picked on, these backstories make character less stale and give them more flavor and substance\n\nMap Variety-This game in my opinion has more diverse and intriguing locations and is more varied compared to F13's maps, despite being smaller scale, its nice to have every neck of the woods as a playground, from a junkyard to an asylum to a hospital\n\nNeutral-As expected, the main point that is neither good nor bad, but is more so annoying, is always finding arrogant players who mock you for not catching them or might be cheap and ditch you with an \"every man for himself/herself\" mentallity, but this is to be expected\n\n\nDislikes\n\nNo voice chat-One place where F13 shines and where this game BADLY needs an addition to in my opinion is voice chat, text chat while playing a game like this is too tedious and can leave you open, in a game where teamwork is key, (despite maybe not as much) the game would STRONGLY benefit from voice chat\n\nNo Single Player-Both F13 and DBD suffer from this, and this game I feel could STRONGLY benefit from single player campaings in order to further expand the backstories of the killers and surivors, \n\nSkill Checks-The concept of skill checks in itself is fine, but the issue is that the skill checks are activated by an audio cue, which honestly can at times blend in with the noise of the environment or the music/ambient noises of the game, or sometimes you are soo deeply imerged you don't notice them until its too late and you fuck up, exposing your location, I feel as though this is one of the RARE times where a QTE would actually make sense with a button combination popping up on the screen rather than a wheel with an audio cue\n\n\nConclusion\n\nDead by Daylight may be similar to Friday the 13th, but I feel as though this game is different enough to warrant being a different surival horror game all togheter and is a fun expereincce in itself, its also somewhat harder than F13 from both perspectives in my opinion (i.e. harder to win and unlock things/rank up) but the game is overall a fun experience and something you wouldn't want to miss out on if you are a horror game fan, team based game fan, or both\n","timestamp_created":1501453978,"timestamp_updated":1501453978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33915277","author":{"steamid":"76561198135729114","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1588972251},"language":"english","review":"Quite

game is an excellent asymetric 4v1 horror game with a problematic community. You can play as any of 8 killers (at this time) each distinict in appearance, speed and mechanics. There are also 8 playable survivor characters that are less varied, but like the killers have some unique perks to unlock that act as a signature playstyle and each survivor is unique in apperance. \nControls and mechanics are simple and easy to learn, the survivors need to open the doors and escape, the killer needs to kill them all. Despite this, as this game is all online PvP there is a steep learning curve for new players that is ultimatly quite rewarding once you put the time in to learn. All matches are ranked, so your pefromance will dictate your ranking in every match, and your mechanics which dictate performance are different for survivors and killers (at this time). \n\nNow the bad. The community is flat-out terrible. Ultimatly there are two communities, depending on whether you prefer surivor or killer, and they hate each other with a passion. I would stay away from the discussion boards unless you are looking at announcements, much like you would stay away from YouTube comments. The anger and attitude is even on the reviews for this, as each side has play strategies that the other side feels is cheating, or is unfair. If you see references to \"camping\" or \"looping\" that is what I am refering to. The lobbies can be long, depending on the player make-up at that moment, some people will disconnect from games to try and screw the other side or avoid losing items. There are occasional bugs but the developers are constantly working on this game.\n\nUltimatly, this is a fun game. Give it some time to learn to play, ignore the rude folks and give it a go.

Или чтобы подбор персонажей под каждую игру был рандомный ( так даже лучше ), но, опять же, без одинаковых.\n4) ( Не обязательно ) Дать возможность каждому взять убер престиж.

Auch nach einem Jahr seit dem Release macht es 'höllisch' Spaß, der Nervenkitzel bleibt konstant - aber auch der Frust über bestehende Bugs und Abstürze. \nGrundsätzlich muss man sich zwischen der Rolle eines Überlebenden oder eines Killers entscheiden. Für beide Seiten stehen diverse 'Perks' zur Verfügung, also Fähigkeiten, die einem das Spiel wesentlich erleichtern sollen. Ich selber bevorzuge die Rolle eines Überlebenden.\nIn recht wenigen Spielen ging mir so sehr der 'A**** auf Grundeis', etwa wenn der Herzschlag einsetzt  sobald sich der Killer nähert. Anfänglich kann dies zu Panikreaktionen führen, weiß man nicht, woher er sich nähert und wohin man am besten gehen sollte. Keine Versteckmöglichkeiten? Schlecht! Rennen ist keine gute Idee, dies hinterlässt rote Streifen, die nur der Killer sehen kann und somit eine Ahnung hat, wo ich bin oder wohin ich mich bewege...\nMit netten Leuten macht das Spiel gleich noch mehr Spaß, die Schreie meiner Mitspieler hallen immer noch manchmal in meinen Ohren. \nNatürlich gibt es Dinge, über die man sich in dem Spiel ärgert. Zig Updates und Patches konnten viele Bugs entfernen, seit dem letzten Update inkl. neuem Killer, Überlebenden und Karte ist das Spiel aber wieder voll funktionsfähig - sogar das Matchmaking funktioniert!!!\nEin viel größeres Ärgernis stellen Mitspieler dar, die etwa in der Rolle des Killers zu Taktiken wie 'Facecamping' greifen, was anderen den Spielspaß nimmt und ein faires Spiel unmöglich macht. Natürlich ärgert man sich als Killer auch über Dinge wie 'Pallet-Looping' - allerdings verzögert dies meist nur das Ergreifen des Überlebenden. Man braucht schon starke Nerven, um sich mit der 'DbD'-Community einzulassen. Konstruktive Kritik oder Feedback kann schnell zu Beleidigungen und persönliche Angriffe führen.

It can be scary, which is rare in a multiplayer game. This game is so fun that the cons (of which there are many) are outweighed. EDIT: The game's ranking system is actually so toxic that this is no longer valid. This game's fun aspects are outweighed by the bad (read below).\n\nCONS:\nFun concept, but the game is flawed. What other game has you thinking about ranking when you play, rather than winning? This game is designed so doing 4 generators is a waste of time (just do 3). This game is designed so kiting the killer all game is a waste of time, even if your team wins because you're doing it, because you don't get all the right categories. This is equivalent to, say, in Overwatch, getting 20 eliminations, and being \"maxed out\" on points to rank. Then you have to get max assists and objective time, etc., rather than actually just winning. That isn't a well made game. The reason for this is simple: everyone can win. In a game so heavily focused on ranking and competition, having a system where everyone can win is simply not good enough. Unfortunately, this is such an integral part of the game, I don't see how the devs could fix it without actually trying instead of just releasing new DLC.\n\nAnother CON: Matchmaking ranks. I tried playing killer, and got to rank 9. Then I hit a wall. Why did I hit a wall? Because I constantly got matched against red ranks. I get more red ranks than green and purple, and I NEVER get matched with people of my skill level or below. Always higher. So basically the game is treating me as a red rank player, but I'm only rank 9. That is the equivalent of a gold or maybe platinum player in most other games getting matched against low master. In a game that matters so much about rank, this ruins the entire game.\n\nI hope the devs stop adding DLC and fix their game.","timestamp_created":1501399423,"timestamp_updated":1617991249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33898526","author":{"steamid":"76561198316249330","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":34193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26298,"last_played":1654614363},"language":"thai","review":"ห่วยแตกหาฆาตกรห้องนานมากกว่าจะได้เล่นแต่ละทีเสียเวลามากๆแก้ไขหน่อยครับ\nยิ่งแรงค์20-19 หาห้องแถบไม่เจอเลย พอกดเล่นทีก็เจอห้องที่เซอร์แรงค์ตํ่าๆกันทั้งนั้นไม่มีความบาลานเลย\nห่วยแตก","timestamp_created":1501397820,"timestamp_updated":1584593014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33898336","author":{"steamid":"76561198302987520","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":227421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1033,"playtime_at_review":105094,"last_played":1660563383},"language":"english","review":"Update at 3k hours: I still hate this game.  I bitch about it constantly.  It genuinely is broken.\nUpdate after 770 hours and like 2 years: The game still sucks and is broken.\n\nThis game is broken.  There are too many glitches and bugs, too many terrible people that play the game.  The devs are no help with the game.  They only favor one side of this community, the side of the killer.  Throughout many changes and additions to the game since I started playing, October 2016, the devs have ruined the game.  And let's be clear here, it is the devs fault.  They keep making changes that ruin the game.  With almost every single major update, you can expect a nerf to survivor, or a buff to killer, and always something that just completely breaks.  There is still a huge bug that has been in this game since it's first paid DLC, and that is decisive strike bugs.  If the killer drops or hooks the survivor at a very precise time, the survivor that hit the skill check will not be dropped.  That is just one example.  Another example of the devs being useless and nerfing survivors is the killer pip system.  The current way it runs is a killer that does terrible and only downs and hooks a survivor at the end will be forced to camp the survivor untill they die, ususally also getting one more person downed and hooked, killing them as well.  There are perks that survivors can run to lesson this, but they don't work well or are nerfed.  An example of this is borrowed time.  They nerfed it to be mostly useless as the amount of time it takes to run away is about as long as borrowed time lasts, making it so that it really is just a prolonger of death.  Another aspect of this is hitboxes.  The killer can body block people in a corner when they wiggle free, to make it so they instantly get downed again.  I have had this happen to me many times.  Another thing about the devs nerfing survivors is there are less palletes and windows then when I started, and even when this game was released.  It used to be that every single place that can spawn multiple of per map had at least 1 pallete, usually with 2 though.  However, the devs have changed it to only be 1 for the vast majority.  A huge thing that the devs have made that makes it nearly impossible to play is bloodlust.  If the killer is in a chase for a long time, they get faster.  It gets to the point where after 45 seconds, the killer is almost gauranteed to hit you.  I can provide many more example of the devs breaking the game, like the impossibility of going backwards into a pallete, or a 360, or the nightmare's lunge being broken because of how huge it is, or how the huge autoaim for killers, or the thing I'm most pissed about, the fact that PC doesn't have dedicated servers still, despite the fact that the devs promissed it around the time console released, which was around 6 months ago.  Just don't get this game is what I'm saying.","timestamp_created":1501396894,"timestamp_updated":1592398420,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4703635573387146","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33898306","author":{"steamid":"76561198329698259","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":32750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26194,"last_played":1625380052},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾游戏人类修机速度飞起，玩你妈","timestamp_created":1501396741,"timestamp_updated":1620485194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33897837","author":{"steamid":"76561198141202545","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":114429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":88,"playtime_at_review":59845,"last_played":1659901631},"language":"english","review":"its alright you might sqeeze 4hrs out of it","timestamp_created":1501394439,"timestamp_updated":1535464599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4taGFyd0CfdangQE="}
