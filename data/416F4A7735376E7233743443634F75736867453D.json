I figured I'd finally write it down so other would-be players comprehend how miserably unfun killer currently is to play.\n\nDid you forget to dodge the Survive with Friends groups joining your lobby? Are you any killer but Billy or Nurse? Golly, it sure is nice of you to take those handicaps. Be ready for when the survivors suddenly quick-switch their items at the last moment too.\n\nLet's begin; your hex totem(s) started near the survivors? Kiss your hex perk(s) goodbye. BNP(s) in game? If you don't patrol the gens in 20 seconds flat, prepare to suck it.\n\nSurvivor found! Do they have Sprint Burst? You can likely go back to hunting again.\n\nAble to give chase? Prepare to savour the true killer experience as you run in circles with an occasional pallet drop ad nauseum until at least two or three generators are finished (this is apparently considered chasing by the devs although there's little risk for any survivor who knows what they're doing, especially if they're built for the task).\n\nBroke off the chase? Better hope you find another in time to not lose the game.\n\nCaught up enough to cause an injury? If they have Dead Hard to successfully crutch the next hit with, you'll spend even more time running in circles until you're ready to dry heave from whichever feeling you make it to first; your choices are boredom or frustration.\n\nYou have downed a survivor at last! If they're your Obsession, you'd better not forget to try dribbling them when you pick them up, or you will go straight back to square one. \n\nAll that hard work has paid off, and you have a survivor in your arms. Did you check if anyone in the area has a flashlight? If not, be ready to go straight back to square one.\n\nNow let's hope you make it to a hook before they wriggle free (which is faster with Decisive Strike even if they aren't your Obsession, then you're back at square one again).\n\nAt last, you've hooked a survivor! Congratulations on not nodding off during all the running in circles and making it through the gauntlet of survivor crutches (which would otherwise result in screwing you and making your effort turn out to be a giant waste of time).\n\nSince you had the skill to get this far, you get to be bored all over again as a reward!\n\nIt's a given that any survivor team worth its salt is basically winning the game by the point you've managed this hooking, so your choices are either pitching a tent in the vicinity of those hard-fought gains or patrolling back and forth toward the nearest generators.\n\nIf the survivors know their business, they're likely to pop the exits while you desperately hope someone else will show up to finally make the game exciting (that's how killer works in Dead by Daylight: it promises a lot of fun and delivers precious little of it).\n\nAssuming they aren't foolish enough to come get their friend en masse, prepare for the arrival of your newest crutch: Borrowed Time. If the survivors manage to make this next perk go off when they unhook their buddy, there's a good chance you are about to totally lose the game. If any exits are opened by the time they do, it's a given.\n\nBe gracious when they chew you apart in the lobby for daring to camp and remember to smile: this is just how \"surviving\" works in the topsy-turvy world of Dead by Daylight! \n\nSurviving what?

yıllarda \"Teen Slasher\" adıyla yeni bir film türü ortaya çıktı. Bir grup gencin, bir seri katil tarafından sırasıyla katledildiği bu türün popülerleşmesinde The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Friday the 13th ve A Nightmare on Elm Street gibi filmler öncü oldu. Klişe senaryo ve olay örgüsünün yer aldığı filmler zaman içerisinde sinema severler tarafından çok tutulunca, günümüzde oldukça gelişen oyun sektöründe bu türün de kendine bir yer edinmesi kaçınılmaz oldu. Dead by Daylight tüm bu klişeleri bir araya toplayıp, onları kendi tarzına göre yorumlayarak, bizlere gerilimi had safhada yaşatan, mükemmel bir gerilim oyunu olarak karşımıza çıktı.\n\nKorku oyunlarında oyuncuları korkutmak için genellikle çok kullanılan \"Jumpscare\" tekniği artık oyun severler tarafından bayağı olarak nitelendiriliyor. Oyuncuların artık korku ve gerilim oyunlarından beklentileri de bu noktada farklı yöne kayıyor. Dead by Daylight ve Friday the 13th gibi kaçış temalı, çevrimiçi çok oyunculu korku oyunları artık oyun severlerin göz bebeği haline gelmeye başladılar. Gerilimin bir an bile kaybolmadığı, katilin nefesinin her an ensede hissedildiği Dead by Daylight aynı zamanda oyunculara katil rolünü de bahşederek tüm tabuları yıkmayı başarıyor ve  bize de şu sözü söylemek düşüyor \"Artık kaçan biz olmayacağız\".\n\nİncelemenin devamı için; http://www.locusludus.com/oyun/68/dead-by-daylight/","timestamp_created":1506434968,"timestamp_updated":1574794651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.649645388126373291","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35222275","author":{"steamid":"76561198421028750","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":39166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3324,"last_played":1644139287},"language":"schinese","review":"作为一个忠诚的杀机玩家，这是我玩的第一个很尽兴的游戏，我感觉永远都玩不腻，希望杀机可以越做越久，越做越好！但是，这个游戏的BUG还需要改善，光是掉档我就掉了2次，至于官方回复从未着落，我希望官方能推出一个自动检测掉档情况，然后补偿的系统，谢谢！","timestamp_created":1506434092,"timestamp_updated":1506434092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35222077","author":{"steamid":"76561198185972354","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":15169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15114,"last_played":1616491971},"language":"schinese","review":"醉了，游戏被封了，我又重新买了个，还是一样，破游戏，又浪费我52！","timestamp_created":1506433379,"timestamp_updated":1506433379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487288117408752441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35221676","author":{"steamid":"76561198118380133","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":35203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11847,"last_played":1658506267},"language":"english","review":"has its ups and downs but still fun af","timestamp_created":1506431948,"timestamp_updated":1509040254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502079665660858154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35221550","author":{"steamid":"76561198093863619","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1513957202},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏要连上服务器还得随缘？？？？我都开加速器了还一直连不上？","timestamp_created":1506431488,"timestamp_updated":1506431488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35221472","author":{"steamid":"76561198054411018","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1506436346},"language":"russian","review":"за первый час игры я минут 40 провёл в поиске лобби. дибилизм, я новый игрок, а меня кидают к чувакам с престижами. серьёзно?
