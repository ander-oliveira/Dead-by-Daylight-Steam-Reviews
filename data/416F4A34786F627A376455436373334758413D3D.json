You either play as one of a bunch of survivors or the killer in a randomly selected (unless intentionally manipulated via items) map where both sides have their own unique goals.\n\nFor the survivors, your goal is to simply escape from the map primarily by powering up generators (with Skillcheck™ involved like some QTE) and escape via the powered doors that open the path to the exit. Alternatively, if you're the only one left on the map (if your mates are dead/escaped), there is always that tempting 'Trapdoor™' that grants u safe passage and a ton of points (which I'll talk about later). Along the way, you save teammates, play hide&seek or 'benny hill' with the killer and sabotage stuff for points.\n\nAs the killer, you hunt and seek your targets (with each killer having their own mechanics) and play benny hill with the survivors until you put them up the hook and either play security guard or run off to chase the other survivors that are probably spamming the infinite jukespots aka SAFESPACE™   \n\nNow for the ACTUAL review. Why do I not recommend this game? Simply put, it still feels A LOT like a game in closed beta for various reasons. General issues are often bugs involving phasing and hit registering but I will touch on a few of those that are pet peeves of mine below.\n\n[b][u]LAG[/u][/b] - For some god forsaken reason, the devs decided to go p2p for this. Why is it bad? Playing across the globe with killers that grant you games with 3~4 sec delays for 99% of the match makes it barely unplayable. But hey you ask, not everyone is laggy and you might have the chance to play with people near you, why the hate? Its all fine and dandy until u see the next point below.\n\n[b][u]RANKS AND PIPS[/u][/b] - Everyone wants to be MLG these days and this game is no exception. Whats wrong with the rank system? EVERYTHING. Firstly the way to solely ranking up is to acquire pips that are acquired by performing certain tasks. So why is this bad? This means in matches, players are not in it to work with one another (as the survivor) or to fulfill a set objective (as the killer) but rather to maximize the amount of points they can get in a match. Now throw in the fact that if you do not get enough points, you will lose the pip and possibly rank down, everyone is in it for themselves. Now throw in random laggy matches, SAFESPACE™ bullcrap and even dumber offering combinations (2 survivors burn fog offerings for dem VAPENATION™ 420 FGT action) and DC causing you to lose a lot of pips, this system becomes a problem.\n\n[b][u]SAFESPACE™[/u][/b] - OMG U NUB, PLAY TRAPPER AND DON'T TOUCH MY SAFESPACE™...This is the official \"voice of reasoning\" for this stupid system that is the infinite juke spots...in recent patches, the dev nerfed parkour of ledges and windows but thats NOTHING compared to the infinites. Certain maps have spaces like the \"magic school bus\" and the \"3 yolo windows\" that circumvent the speed reduction nerf that was imposed in the patch. This means that if the survivor reach the SAFESPACE™, you're better off running away as the killer before the sandbagging and taunting you will receive from the survivors. YES, the KILLER is more afraid than the survivors in SAFESPACES™. BUT MEH THE TRAPPER IS THERE !!! Until you realize that even kids with ADHD can tell where a trap is and disarm your traps for dem free points and the fact that there might be MULTIPLE SAFESPACES™ in the map that you can't babysit your traps, playing a specific killer (that isn't really effective in mitigating this issue) to solve this issue isn't a viable solution.\n\n[b]ADDED -[/b] An example of SAFESPACE™ in action and popular Dead by Daylight streamer, TrU3Ta1ent's take on infinites/SAFESPACE™ [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/tru3ta1ent/UgliestFinchSmoocherZ]HERE[/url]\n\n[b][u]Matchmaking[/u][/b] - Oh boy when you talk about ranking and MLG as such, matchmaking is always a hot topic. Sadly in this game, its more of a hot mess than a hot topic. Firstly, there is barely any form of balance when it comes to matchmaking as the game will match you with high levels or even prestiged players when you are level 1. Add to the fact that there is no tutorial at the start and that said players have better perks/stuff on them, your chance of even getting enough points for a pip is as good as none unless u get a lucky break. Throw in the whole rank down system coupled with random laggy matches which are REALLY common, suddenly the whole steam refund system starts to make a lot more sense.\n\n[b][u]Insta-kill offerings[/u][/b] - Players can choose to burn offering to affect the gameplay of a match but unlike perks, offering CAN be gamechanging from map alterations to map selection and much more. However, one of the offerings that greatly affects this are the offerings that offer insta-kill for killers. What does this mean for the common player? This means, if you get caught really early on in certain matches before fulfilling your pip required points, you're as good as dead if you can't reach a SAFESPACE™ in time. Normally sacrifices allows you a chance of escape (if someone saves you) or offers your team much needed safe windows of opportunity for objectives (if you're unlucky and the killer decides to camp hook you). With this, everything is thrown out the window and you can kiss your bum as well as rank goodbye as the killer kills you and move on.  So much for ranked huh?\n\nAll in all, this game has a lot of balance and technical issues that they HAVE to iron out and I wouldn't recommend this game for more than $5 to anyone. This is really sad as this game have the potential but its implementation is seriously lacking...\n\n*Update 1* - Reworded some stuff so some kids won't get bumhurt and call the wambulance on me...\n\n*Update 2* - Popular Dead by Daylight streamer, TrU3Ta1ent's take on infinites/SAFESPACE™ and a SAFESPACE in action have been added","timestamp_created":1468316170,"timestamp_updated":1468861369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":208,"votes_funny":27,"weighted_vote_score":"0.641833662986755371","comment_count":18,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24270870","author":{"steamid":"76561198108569850","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1619108041},"language":"russian","review":"офигенная игра нету багов и того подобново отметка по 10 бальной шкале 10 !","timestamp_created":1468315699,"timestamp_updated":1468315699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24270824","author":{"steamid":"76561198032717530","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2240,"last_played":1499807324},"language":"romanian","review":"Finding a match takes so long, it makes no sense buying this.","timestamp_created":1468315493,"timestamp_updated":1468315493,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24270638","author":{"steamid":"76561198257003055","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1762,"last_played":1593202851},"language":"german","review":"Geiles spiel","timestamp_created":1468314660,"timestamp_updated":1468314660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500591039657592773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24270454","author":{"steamid":"76561198238759618","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1057,"last_played":1505934665},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu recomendo, mas por enquanto esse jogo está muito pesado e precisa muito ser otimizado o quanto antes","timestamp_created":1468313861,"timestamp_updated":1468313861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24270417","author":{"steamid":"76561198158163865","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1452,"last_played":1525225419},"language":"schinese","review":"想知道这100分钟怎么玩的？ 妈的老子一直匹配不到人，匹配到人了，还jb退，老子醉了","timestamp_created":1468313671,"timestamp_updated":1468313671,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24270378","author":{"steamid":"76561197984645336","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2098,"last_played":1612164652},"language":"english","review":"If your a smart survivor just hop over a wall until either the killer DC's or the hatch opens, repeat.

As of the date of this review you should consider this game early access.\n\nGameplay: The core gameplay is very fun when bugs, toxic players, or bad peer to peer connections don't hinder the experience. I find playing both sides to be challenging and rewarding. I personally like the killer because of the frantic nature. However, I still enjoy the careful and thoughtful play required to win as the survivor. Both roles can be surprisingly tense and I love it. The ranking system is stupid. You are penalized for being efficient as both killer and survivor. As the killer if you find everyone and do a good job of chasing them down, never letting them escape you get far less points. It may even be possible to kill the entire team and get deranked (I know it was before the patch that increased some point values). As a survivor you're heavily penalized for doing well. For example, I soloed three generators, opened the exit gate, and healed another survivor without getting spotted once. I even waited for the killer at the exit which is a cheesy way to get some bonus points for being chased and escaping. I got 9,300 points which is 700 shy of ranking up. When you come up short of 10k not only do you not gain rank, you actually derank meaning missing out on a few points will cost you two ranks. You'll often see survivors repairing generators after a match where the killer was dominated because they know if they escape they won't reach the 10k thresthold and will be deranked. \n\nControls: Functional, but with issues. The fact that there is no keybinding certainly doesn't help matters. No crouch toggle either. My main issue with the controls is how fiddly it can be sometimes when there are multiple things to interact with and those actions share the same input. As a survivor it can be difficult to disarm a bear trap under a hooked survivor because, depending on placement, you sometimes have to back up a little to find the sweet spot where the unhooking prompt goes away and is replaced by the disarm trap prompt. As a killer it can be tricky to pick up a downed survivor next to a windows as <space> both picks up survivors and steps through windows. It can also be difficult to find the sweet spot when attempting to pick a survivor up who is caught in a bear trap. I'm sure there are more examples but the point is there are too many actions assigned to the same inputs which creates problems.\n\nGraphics: Pretty meh. Muddy textures, a very aggressive depth of field effect (probably a style choice but I find it obnoxious), level geometry pop in is pretty obvious as well. I wouldn't say it detracts from the experience too much except for perhaps the pop in.\n\nSound: Excellent. Stellar. Masterful. Praise worthy. The music, the sound effects. The ambient sounds. Top notch! I'm glad they nailed this because sound cues are very important in this game. If you don't play with headphones you're missing out and putting yourself at a disadvantage.\n\nTechnical: A hot mess. No rebindable keys. Very few graphics options beyond presets. I experienced several in game crashes until I tried unplugging my controller (played with KB+M but had my 360 controller pluged in). I've also had the game freeze on the menu 4 times. Terrain clipping issues. Animations will decouple from time to time. Lousy peer to peer connections. Failed to join game, failed to join game, failed to join game. I'll say that it hasn't often been something game breaking, but a lot of little things that make this game feel like a beta or early access.\n\nStory: No lore explained in game. Go check the website if you actually care. Personally, I don't give a toss.\n\nCommunity/player base: Highly cancerous. This has nothing to directly do with the game, yet it's important as this game lacks any kind of single player mode. There is a very vocal segment of the community who is upset because the devs removed some crutches such as OP perks and some unintended exploits that allowed people to play survivors recklessly and without having to worry about being spoted by the killer. It feels as though that sentiment has bled into the gameplay as people disconnect (aka DC) as survivors all the time. Not only does the killer lose potential points but it's not fair to the other survivors because even if that person is likely or guaranteed to die staying in the game for as long as possible helps the other survivors. Killers DCing is even worse. There are killers who DC just before the survivors escape and while they don't get deranked they do get cheated out of an earned rank as well as they points they would have got for escaping. The devs tried to fix the issue by penalizing DCers and rewarding killers with points for a DC, however, as far as I know, people are still able to do it without penalty if they DC in a certain way. Regardless, DCs happen a lot. My last 4 or 5 matches somebody DCed. DCing can also cause weird issues for the killer in the time between the cheating scrub pulling the plug and game updating the scrubs status to DCed. I once was stuck in front of a hook for about a minute because the scrub I was carrying decided to DC as I was hooking him. I couldn't move or even look around until the game sorted itself out. PROTIP: If you don't want to play the game in the way the developers intended and you disagree with the fundamental concept as they've laid out in their Twitch Q&A then uninstall the game and play Domination in Call of Duty if you want to rush around capturing objectives. I don't often play as a survivor anymore as I've found I like playing the killer more. When I do play survivor I die... alot. Most of the time it's because I made a bad decision or got outplayed. Sometimes it's bad luck. Deal with it people. Stop your whining and \"git gud.\"\n\nConclusion: It's a fun game with meh graphics and amazing sound design. If you're OK with early access then I'd recommend picking it up. If you expect a released game to be finished then wait until things have stabilized and basic features are added with bugs fixed. I will update this review/rant when I feel the game is suitable to be sold as a finished product.\n\n404 out of 10.

A group of my friends and I decided to get this to play together, and honestly we always have a really good time. It's a great concept, and even after playing it for a bit it still sometimes scares me and makes me panic. \nTo be honest I kind of hate ranked play. I hate that I may be level 5 playing with people who are level 50 and have all these perks that I can't compete with. It puts me at an extreme disadvantage and makes leveling up harder. Also the survivor rank idea is just dumb and not neccessary, it's hard for me to even get passed 20 (the base rank). I also personally find the Wraith's disappearing power not very fun to play with as I\"ve never really won a game against one for obvious reasons. There are also some frustrating techniques players use such as killers remaining in the spot where they hung someone, killers putting a bear trap right in front of the hook, and reappearing as the wraith while i'm in a corner so I can't get out.

Been playing it for about 2 weeks now and I'm loving it. This game will seriously make you feel like you're trying to survive in a horror movie, so if you're a horror fan check it out. It definitely requires a little bit of strategy, but once you play a few rounds you'll get the hang of it. I was a little worried about it getting repetetive, but after 32 hours, it hasn't yet. They're also going to keep adding to it with new survivors, killers, perks and maps. \n\nPros:\n- Fun, intense gameplay\n- Makes you feel like you're in a horror movie\n- inexspensive\n- Great matchmaking -- generally does a great job of pairing you with similar level players. \n\nCons:\n- Can be frustrating, especially when you have teamates that aren't helpful. \n- There are two leveling systems: Levels and ranks. Ranks matter more but can be frustrating as you have to win multiple games in a row to rank up, and you lose part of a rank when you lose. Depending on how good you are, it can take a while. \n- Some of the player base can be \"elitests\", but not overwhelmingly so. \n- No party system, yet.\n\nI don't typically review games, but this is one of those games that caught me way off-guard, and I feel deserves it.

Because fans whined? Be big boy devs and finish the job!)\n\nGameplay can range from 10/10 to a 2/10 depending on the amount of glitches and exploits you experience. Sometimes you will just get stuck in walls, cause that's fun! Othertimes you wont get on screen indicators that are supposed to be there, sometimes survivors continue to grunt after they've been killed, sometimes the killer will be unable to pick up a survivor. Overall though, when the game functions mostly as it should, it is fun. Lots of fun.\n\nGraphics are meh. Go to the Unreal Asset store and pick a few packs full of nasty colors and mediocre textures. The visual design of the killers and survivors also leave a lot to be desired, with no real customization to speak of.  Visually the whole game is a 6/10. Could be better, could also be much worse i suppose.\n\nBottom line, ask yourself how much you would pay for a game that is and will be forever in beta? If the answer is equal to or greater than the price of this game, go for it.\n\nOh, something they don't mention anywhere on the store page, don't get attatched to your Rank.

YES YOU CAN, you cant play with friends and get stuff while also haveing a unfair advantage over the killer because thats stupid, if they add a entirely new game mode where the killer is KNOWING they are vsing teams that changes things, \nand if your complaining about the 'balence' of the game... your four normal people running from a supernatural monster with super strength, speed, hearing and sight. a monsterous godlike entity helping him find you, hell hes borderline superman, so YES if he starts chaseing you its going to be a bitch to get away, if he GETS YOU your screwed without help, but its so unfair he can just camp me and no one can save me..... yep read the above, you get caught your screwed without help, and if he decides to camp you there nothing you can do, your teamates at the time can either risk there own ass to save you...

I'm not sure whether its because of my wifi or the wifi of someone that I happen to be playing with like how it does in Call of Duty: BO2: Zombies but I can say I dont have a tolerance for that. It's quite annoying that whenever I turn or try to move from a bush to another especially since the killer is around, that it glitches up and I either miss the bush and end up far away from it and I almost get caught by the killer. And even when Ive tried joining a lobby it tells me that it cant find one or that I failed to enter one. My internet is perfectly fine, Ive checked it more than once and its even one of the fastest. I understand this is a new game and there will be bugs that need to be fixed especailly since there is quite a lot of them but I payed for this game to have fun. Im not having any fun since it glitches and I cant even find a lobby without having to create one myself and becoming the killer even when I want to play as a survivor. If you're thinking of buying this game, wait a little bit longer. There's many things that the developers need to fix. And if anyone wants, please add me as a friend on steam.

Gameplay is solid with most of the stuff done in a manner that is fitting for the concept : a lone killer versus 4 victims or a survivor trying to escape the brutal stalker.\n\nPlaying on either side is a challenge on its own right. Ignore the whining on the discussion boards. Some people think that the only way the game is fun for them is to keep on stacking wins in their favor. No doubt some game mechanics are being abused by the community (looking at infinite window cheesers) but steps are being made into making them more risky to keep on prolonging the time spent in a session.\n\nPros:-\n- choose to be either a killer or survivor (80% survivor 20% killer here)\n- random generator spawns\n- atmospheric music and environmental triggers ( ravens flying away if you get close / heart thumping when killer is nearby)\n- risk/reward management ( do i save this guy or do i get out and leave him behind? )\n\nCons:- \n- yet to be implemented ranked game with friends (coming soon)\n- infinite window cheesing by some high ranked players \n- penalties for DCing too low\n- no latency meter for survivors to assess connection to killers (game session host)\n\nVerdict: in the current state the core game is very much solid, but will require more updates from the devs. however, there's nothing to prevent anyone from getting the game now and figuring out the quirks and enjoying it as it is.\n\ntl;dr - wear diapers, you will shit your pants trying to get away from the killers.\n\n10/10 will play in the dark with headphones and scare myself silly.\n\n==== REVIEW UPDATE 05/18/2017 ====\n\nI have long left this game after finding that more and more killer skills and perks being tweaked according to the devs to the point where the killers are disadvantaged and disincentivised in trying to capture all the survivors.\n\nplaying the killer is now very frustrating.","timestamp_created":1468277024,"timestamp_updated":1495094972,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504830241203308105","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24263256","author":{"steamid":"76561198149789616","num_games_owned":463,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":15857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":89,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1660399385},"language":"russian","review":"Я весёлый маньячёк, люблю резать всем бочёк, распускать люблю кишки и сажать всех на крючки, иногда люблю пилу заводить её к утру бабы бегаю вокруг снова насажу на крюк, попытаешься помочь сгинешь сразу в ту же ночь, избегаю фонарей люблю пи3диTь я свиней, вот достану я капкан сразу цапну там и сям, будешь дёргаться поверь буду ждать ваших смертей, люблю в колокол шуметь и на вас люблю глядеть, будешь заводить движок я поймаю на слушок, ошибёшься только раз сразу ты получишь в глаз, только спрятаться горазд зашумит сердечко в час, я открою шкафчик вновь и пойдёшь моя любовь, выйдем вновь мы погулять дружно крюк мой обнимать.","timestamp_created":1468276725,"timestamp_updated":1468276867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24263221","author":{"steamid":"76561198065823496","num_games_owned":495,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":201103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":736,"playtime_at_review":3050,"last_played":1660167789},"language":"spanish","review":"**8/10** Muy buenas ideas, un juego bastante decente, y perfecto para fans del genero Slash terror típico. Aunque aún tiene bastantes cosas por pulir. En general, tanto a aquellos a los que les encanta el rol de Asesino implacable, como los supervivientes innatos, pueden encontrar el juego bastante adictivo.\n\nEl genero de terror multiplayer/coop lleva dando coletazos estos últimos años, con Indies que no terminaban de dar bien la talla. Este juego ha tenido un magnifico lanzamiento, a sido primero de ventas en steam en su salida, y presenta ideas muy interesantes. Aunque los desarrolladores son realmente una pequeña compañía, por lo visto están respaldados por Overkill, de Payday2, intentando copiar el modelo de desarrollo que les hizo triunfar con un juego tambien innovador, y por quien nadie daba un duro[La idea de sacar más y más contenido según la comunidad fuese comentando nuevas ideas]. \n\n**¿Qué ofrece?**\nTensión, colaboración, situaciones críticas, sistema Ranked por seasons de 1 mes, un buen ritmo ligeramente duro pero gratificante de progresión de personajes, habilidades como para hacer builds dependiendo de tu estilo de juego, niveles de prestigio, libertad para jugar tanto con atroces asesinos como de superviviente, mapeados muy atmosféricos, etc. Vi recientemente la Matanza de Texas El Origen, y el juego es tal cual, un tanto más oscuro. \nCada asesino tiene una notable inspiración; el Trampero viene a ser Jason de Viernes 13, Hillbilly es LeaderFace de la Matanza de Texas, el Espectro es el típico sobrenatural de aparecer en la espalda, etc. Y está confirmado que van a sacar más. Cada uno de ellos incluye su propio \"Reino\" de terror, ligado a su lore. Su lugar de pesadilla recreado por el \"Ente\", que viene a ser la oscuridad o el mal, y que parece nutrirse del terror de los supervivientes cuando el asesino los Sacrifica. Cada Reino tiene cuatro posibles zonas aleatorias. El próximo asesino comentaron que hiba a ser de caracter femenino(¿The Ring?), y su Reino tendria una ambientación de Cienagas, en plan pueblo de Louisiana.\n\n**Interesante, pero podría llegar a ser mucho más.**\nLo negativo que tiene, actualmente[12/7/16], es que necesita pulir muchas cosas. El Matchmaking es bastante malo, reuniendo jugadores en base al ping, sin dar importancia a la diferencia de nivel. Hay zonas de mapeado en las que un superviviente es inalcanzable para el asesino, porque el diseño de habitaciones les da mucha ventaja. Hay algunos bugs de netcode, de ocasiones en las que ves que deberías haberle golpeado, pero no, etc. Y necesita nuevas mecánicas alternativas, actualmente si o si, siempre hay que intentar matar a las victimas en unos ganchos, y existen pocas opciones de asesinato.\n\nPara que siga fuerte y crezca como debería, van a tener que trabajar bastante duro. Lo más dificil para una pequeña empresa no es hacerse oir y triunfar en una salida, para luego desinflarse, si no saber mantenerse, y trabajar a destajo como cualquier otra de las grandes compañias cuidan de su producto XD. Los de Payday pasaron por la misma situación, pero un éxito tan grande, se da en muy pocos casos. Haber si hay suerte y no paran de sacar contenido y mejorar. Actualmente cada semana hay un stream directo en Twitch de los desarrolladores, hablando del progreso, ideas, parches, etc. Dando la cara, porque para mantener el éxito inicial, deben llevar un alto ritmo de desarrollo.
