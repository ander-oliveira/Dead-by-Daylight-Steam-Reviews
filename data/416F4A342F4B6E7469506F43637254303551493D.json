The fuck I seriously hope this is an out of season april fools joke\n\nYour game is optimized like shit, I have huge microstutters that the support has not been able to fix (tried reseting pc to 0 ) They make the game worse with each update, literally ruin things that were ok instead of fixing things that need obvious fixing like the 60 fps cap I still have to go back to the settings file in appdata each time theres an update for that and lets talk about the famous hackers lmfao\n\nThey banned multiple accounts both mine and some of my friends for the following reasons : We have substantial proof that you were hacking while we weren't hacking, however we do encounter hackers multiple times in a row that they don't ban. Oh and don't try to appeal the ban, they'll take over 1 month to respond only to tell you we don't give a shit contact easy anti cheat, and when you do, easy anti cheat will take 1 month to tell you an automated respond that basically says to go fuck yourself we didnt look at your case but our anti cheat is perfect and would never ban if you didnt hack. and when you tell behavior about it they also tell you to go fuck yourself as well. then you wanna get nominated for labor of love????? \n\nNominate dbd for labor of love btw biggest joke i've heard since the end of the world announcement back in 2012 what the fuck have you guys been snorting over there at behavior seriously what in the flying fuck are you guys even doing lmfao","timestamp_created":1623806255,"timestamp_updated":1638897943,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517414689064025879","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93829228","author":{"steamid":"76561199157527191","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1660507393},"language":"english","review":"amazing game best game to play and fun to grind","timestamp_created":1623805776,"timestamp_updated":1623805776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93829210","author":{"steamid":"76561198097798980","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":135024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":215,"playtime_at_review":118524,"last_played":1660579926},"language":"english","review":"its alright i guess","timestamp_created":1623805752,"timestamp_updated":1623805752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93829159","author":{"steamid":"76561198295751904","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":20875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15559,"last_played":1657529250},"language":"english","review":"Unique mechanic, great to play with friends","timestamp_created":1623805651,"timestamp_updated":1623805651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93829130","author":{"steamid":"76561198900891022","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":819,"playtime_at_review":2695,"last_played":1660590609},"language":"brazilian","review":"amogus","timestamp_created":1623805600,"timestamp_updated":1623805600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93829113","author":{"steamid":"76561198297577245","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":47034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39491,"last_played":1658518020},"language":"english","review":"Playing this game brings me great pain and sadness.

Kudos, we needed that to  make this game more interesting, And they reduced the grinding by 75%. Well done.\n\nI can't believe this game would become worst from my last review.\n\nThe new match making system makes every game repetitive and boring. You get to a point where everything you play against are Nurses and Blights, always. I have stopped playing because it was my fourth/fifth consecutive game against a Blight, so boring. The only reason I keep playing is because I play with my friends, the moment they stop playing, I will leave this game as well.\n\nYou will start facing try hards which would make this game boring. Good luck when you play casual going against a killer with the best add-ons, perks and who, on top of that, camps and tunnels with 5 gens left. The same way, good luck going against try hard 4-men group of survivors that repair 3 gens in the first 2 minutes of the match.\n\nEverything in-store is super expensive and grindy, good luck trying to be a F2P gamer in a game THAT IS NOT FREE TO PLAY, YOU PAID FOR IT.\n\nAlso you reward for playing every constantly each month is 250-500K bloodpoints. If you don't know how much that is... It's enough to level up 1 single character from LV1 to LV20-25 ish. Such a joke of reward.\n\nWith each patch the developers fix 30 bugs, and introduce 100 new more.","timestamp_created":1623801303,"timestamp_updated":1656350498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509933769702911377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93827209","author":{"steamid":"76561198294089947","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":17252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1107,"last_played":1656817497},"language":"english","review":"kill

It still happens on higher rank tho, not that often. \nAs a solo survivor you can be lucky and have people who actually want to help. Or you can have teammates who let you die on first hook when you are [b]NOT[/b] getting camped or farm you by getting you off hook and not helping you escape that chase (by taking prot hits) - resulting in you getting hit and hooked again.\nMatchmaking isn't the best so you might be rank 2 and get a killer rank 16.\n\n[b]Killer:[/b]\nSurvivors are SUPER toxic.

It's very fun to play and consists of four survivors trying to escape from one killer. You can choose between different survivors and perks to go with them as well as different killers with perks to go with them too. No level is the same since every time you play the maps are randomized meaning even when you're on the same map it will be set up different each time. This game is great, I haven't had any trouble with it since I've had it. If you have played any other horror games, and liked it, i am sure you will you'll love this one.\n\n-mDriveUnit","timestamp_created":1623796836,"timestamp_updated":1645307733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93824912","author":{"steamid":"76561198093587751","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":375,"playtime_at_review":3419,"last_played":1660362049},"language":"english","review":"v nice, killers are hit or miss when being friendly","timestamp_created":1623796759,"timestamp_updated":1623796759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93824878","author":{"steamid":"76561198258254991","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6875,"last_played":1642452569},"language":"english","review":"This game has kept me entertained for years.
