The survivors are attempting to complete generators, destroy potential hex totems that destroy select killer perks if chosen, and rescue fellow survivors from the hooks the killer hangs them on before each phase runs its course and the survivor is sacrificed to the entity. Once all generators are completed the survivors must then open one of two exit doors and escape before the killer does what he was designed to do: kill them. The killers goal is to eliminate all survivors before all generators are completed, or before the last survivor jumps into the hatch (should 2 generators be completed). \n\nPros to playing/owning the game: Opportunity to play with your friends & work together versus a single target: the killer. Many hours of enjoyable gameplay making new friends (and some enemies) along the way. A variety of different maps, perks, killers & survivors to aid in making each game unique when compared to the last. Nice survivor matching system generally enabling the killer (host) and survivors living within a fairly near range to versus one another leading to lower ping/lag enabling all parties involved to play the game. Fairly constant updates adjusting and rebalancing the game and all characters within it (buffing and nerfing as necessary).\n\nCons: Some minor bugs (decisive strike not working in survive/kill your friends, having to get to 35% struggle in normal gameplay to trigger decisive strike if you aren't obsession, hitboxes of killers too large when survivors vault through windows. Difficulty/wait time at higher ranks for killers and at times survivors to acquire games based on the in game ranking system team building mechanics. Nothing in place to deter killers from camping survivors hung on a hook thus ruining the game for the survivor in the long run. \n\nOverall rating: 8.5 based on 355 hours of playtime","timestamp_created":1542063917,"timestamp_updated":1542063917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45787031","author":{"steamid":"76561198189855090","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17018,"last_played":1624444343},"language":"polish","review":"Recenzja zawiera wypowiedzi z przyjętego przez autora punktu widzenia, tak by nie było hejtów :D\nDead By Daylight, czyli w skrócie DBD to gra która przez lata bawiła i bawi osoby kochące gry asymetryczne tzw. gry asymetryczne.

The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games, and it is similar to the traditional European game Mau-Mau. \n\nThe game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robbins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois.\n\nIn 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.[3]","timestamp_created":1542052304,"timestamp_updated":1616651659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45784890","author":{"steamid":"76561198844567959","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":31868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5745,"last_played":1653971262},"language":"latam","review":"Es una chimbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","timestamp_created":1542051505,"timestamp_updated":1542051505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45784836","author":{"steamid":"76561198432757011","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":93859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2746,"last_played":1658159819},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую) я просто не могу оторваться!)","timestamp_created":1542051278,"timestamp_updated":1542051278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464695245027542114","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45784835","author":{"steamid":"76561198120438700","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":14586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1252,"last_played":1638254622},"language":"russian","review":"Уберите в жопу этих корейцев , не умеют играть да пинг у них высокий , почему нельзя выбирать Регион ?","timestamp_created":1542051275,"timestamp_updated":1542051275,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45784638","author":{"steamid":"76561198210765445","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":80,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1584806468},"language":"english","review":"If you love the slasher films of the 80’s, you will most love this game.

If you're going to play this game solo (which next to nobody does because of how bad the solo experience is), don't queue survivor unless you feel like throwing your pc out of a window.","timestamp_created":1541996213,"timestamp_updated":1557176180,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45773042","author":{"steamid":"76561198155573430","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":21662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1623811139},"language":"schinese","review":"额......怎么玩？(｀・ω・´)","timestamp_created":1541993359,"timestamp_updated":1541993359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45773002","author":{"steamid":"76561198244696142","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":143155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16805,"last_played":1657290098},"language":"schinese","review":"我希望黎明杀机能像马里奥一样，苟个几十年，倒了就再出一个......还有，苟护士天下第一。","timestamp_created":1541993101,"timestamp_updated":1541993101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530973434448242188","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45772797","author":{"steamid":"76561198453492194","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":74696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11159,"last_played":1653279984},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego mal balanceado, increiblemente lleno de bugs. pero lo juego igual.","timestamp_created":1541991826,"timestamp_updated":1596592045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45770893","author":{"steamid":"76561198369701801","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11974,"last_played":1645640914},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, однако однообразная, со врменем надоедает.","timestamp_created":1541980192,"timestamp_updated":1541980192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467289716005325317","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45770761","author":{"steamid":"76561198029357521","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":910,"last_played":1659383284},"language":"polish","review":"Swietna gierka, myslalem ze po 10h sie znudzi a mimo wszystko nowe perki sprawiaja ze kazda gra jest inna, kazdy zabojca jest zupelnie inny, niby robi sie caly czas to samo ale wystarczy troche sie wczuc i mozna grac bez konca.

The toxic community, mainly survivor mains, that promotes bullying, harassment and insults in the game. You won't ever find a match where someone is not tbaging, holding the game hostage, hiding with the gates open to take the hatch in the last second just to make you wait 2 whole minutes before having the ability to leave the game and constant insults, death threats and harassment on your steam profiles. Don't believe me? play for a hundred hours with your comments on public and you'll see how bad it is.\n\nAs I said behaviour Interactive main focus is on releasing cosmetics and half assed chapters with pretty much no intent to fix the game as they very rarely update it or try shifting towards a more diverse meta. They're happy with the current state of the game and won't ever try to do anything else.\n\nNow to end this review, I'd recommend you not to buy this game ever, yeah sure it's entertaining and quite addictive but it's simply not worth investing in a game when the devs really don't care about the problems plaguing their game and if you're gonna buy it anyways, then just play survivor and avoid the stress that comes playing killer as it's just an unfun experience once you arrive at red ranks that with the current system is fairly easy to do.","timestamp_created":1541978262,"timestamp_updated":1626838423,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45770560","author":{"steamid":"76561198351145089","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":140406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2490,"playtime_at_review":2761,"last_played":1660605737},"language":"english","review":"A game full of campers , cheaters and non team players, not worth the buy, the decvs only worry about thier money, not your experience, they allow killers to face camp you in your face and tunnel you, and you get shit for points and they get all, so yea this game is stupid and not worth your money or patience fuck the devs and this game and the cheaters they allow in it","timestamp_created":1541978222,"timestamp_updated":1600652293,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45769436","author":{"steamid":"76561198864201522","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":29338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15875,"last_played":1616657379},"language":"russian","review":"Ман ссы","timestamp_created":1541972287,"timestamp_updated":1569082644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316476821899414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45769302","author":{"steamid":"76561198146734925","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":29021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12896,"last_played":1637549949},"language":"brazilian","review":"Loops, loops everywhere... \nPelo valor do jogo, da pra jogar umas boas centenas de horas, recomendo","timestamp_created":1541971696,"timestamp_updated":1541971696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45769100","author":{"steamid":"76561198413340026","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":36020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22726,"last_played":1616874858},"language":"german","review":"ich liebe dieses spiel. :)","timestamp_created":1541970865,"timestamp_updated":1541970865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481927722692489624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45768566","author":{"steamid":"76561198715446424","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1591636867},"language":"russian","review":"Довольно страшная игрушка. \nМножество персонажей и монстров удивительно. \nС каждым новым обновлением появляется новый контент.","timestamp_created":1541968470,"timestamp_updated":1603919345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45768274","author":{"steamid":"76561197966356996","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6827,"last_played":1641732397},"language":"spanish","review":"La unica pega esque no tiene modo grupo.
