I am so torn between this game. I love the concept of the game and overall it is really fun but has its obvious flaws early on if kinked out can be a really interesting and intense game. Basically a game of cat and mouse with a campy cliched horror vibe to it. Cool enough if youre already into the gore/horror genre of games and movies. It is satisfying getting kills and trapping people and sacrificing them as a killer, and otherwise being a survivor equally as satisfying outwitting the killer or escaping. \n\nOn the other hand, there are blatant bugs that can completely piss you off and be a buzz kill which may or may not have been fixed by now. action queues not working when you hit the right button, exploiting perks and running around in circles in which you will NEVER catch the survivor as the killer. As I said, fun game overall for what is there right now, but with the few gameplay mechanics the way they are can either be really fun, or leave you extremely frustrated.

You either laugh at your enemies, seeing them sweating and getting angry, or you are the person being laughed at, feeling mad and exhausted even after wining. For this game is DESTROY or BE DESTROYED. Neither of these is any sort of good and healthy past time for me so I choose NOT playing this game any other mods, but \"Kill your friends\", which still lasts some sort of enjoyment.\n\n[UPDATED: 12.03.2022]\nHaven't played the game for a while, and since the Developers blocked russian region from buying any game content - ain't gonna play any longer. \n\nI played this game since beta, and have seen it changed numerous times. Have hyped on the first licensed killer Michael Myers, and got excited when the first indoor map came out. Have seen the endless \"loops\" and the best times of Memento Mori, even got my Hillbilly fully legacy-prestiged (wonder if new players have even heared about legacy thing). Even made a cosplay (and won a web cosplay contest!) - I was a big fan. Time passed, some things went south - the \"rainbow fog\" faded and I started realising, that the game was not that great as I thought. Lots of things were broken, bugged and one-sided - but even so I was still thinking of myself as a \"fan\". Cause even after I've made some big breaks - I kept watching the game developing and changing, every single update was not left unnoticed. Knowing the game's full lifetime and being with it on the whole journey - I think that's what differents a \"fan\" from a some random person, that has occasionally joined any project last week and agressivly yells in supportance of game without even knowing anythnig. A random person, that will vanish in a mounth, because they get bored with a game - and they skip to another. When people like me would stay, even almost without playing the game for the last year at all. \n\nLet's say, we had a weird relationships, almost love&hate based.\n\nAnd now I am not allowed to even visit the game's store page, because Devs blocked it in the Russia region. Well, that sucks.\n\nIf punishing innocent russian players is the only way of \"expressing solidarity\" with Ukraine citizens - then Dead by Daylight does not deserve any supportance from russian players and fans at all. This won't help the war at all - I can't see any supportance here, but spitting in the faces of people of the other country, just because they're happend to live there. Toxicity and the anger of the game's community was always the most common and the most important of the problems this game has faced. And by these actions you are raising it to it's limits. \n\nAt this moment of time you deserve a negative review bombing. Just because you are doing completelly the same, joing this idiotic parade that strikes the innocents with sanctions and shit like this.","timestamp_created":1472742473,"timestamp_updated":1652024571,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586476385593414307","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25286848","author":{"steamid":"76561198069428727","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":30629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1496593040},"language":"english","review":"More

El asesino es el host de la partida,condiciona que se pueda tener LAG, y si esto pasa habrá la apariencia de falsos golpes o ventanas que no se saltan pese a ser accionada la tecla de salto o bien que los jugadores se caigan durante o al inicio de partida.\n\nDesde la última actualización de su motor grafico de Unreal Engine, el juego ganó en la compatibilidad con las GPU, con lo cual mejoró notablemente el rendimiento de los FPS. En cuanto a la calidad gráfica, en medio a mí me salen las texturas con un gramaje en las sombras, cosa que hace que pase del bajo al alto sin pasar por el medio por lo mal que se ve.\n\nEl juego dispone de una constante ampliación mediante a DLC's que amplian asesinos, supervivientes y complementos para los mismos hacen que el juego tenga unos EXTRAS.\n\nSe hacen concursos constantes con los jugadores por parte de los desarrolladores, cosa que hace que haya una comunicación con la gente que sigue el juego. Es un punto a favor para ellos, es decir, no son de estas empresas de videojuegos que hacen un juego y se desentienden. Lo que nos deja con el mal sabor de boca de que no se invierte en arreglar bugs que han estado desde que salio el juego.\n\nLos menús han sido adaptado para consolas, simplificando la vista de todo y haciéndolo más atractivo.\nEn mi opinión los menús para PC son demasiado grandes.\nHay completa compatibilidad con mando aunque si eres de los mios, este juego lo jugarás con teclado y raton.\n\nLa comunidad de jugadores, en general no es mala pero podria ser mucho mejor. \nAsesinos camperos y jugadores troleros. Gente que no ayuda al compañero...pero asi es la humanidad.\nDigamos que la gente paga sus frustraciones en partida jugando sin sentido de jugabilidad: Facecamps, teabags, falta de altruismo....\n\nEn resumen, si juegas, es mejor con amigos Diversión \"con amigos \" asegurada.\n\n                              ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLo positivo :\n- Diversión con amigos asegurada.\n- Actualizaciones constantes de mejora.\n- DLC extras \n- Terror y tensión en partida constante. \n- Diseño gráfico y ambientación muy buena.\n- Desarrolladores se comunican, el proyecto no se abandona. \n\nLo negativo:\n- El server host es el asesino. \n- Comunidad con mal rollo.\n- Menus para miopes,  preparados para consola. \n- Optimizacion regular.
