game used to be good and now I dont even know what to say about it. It used to be so much easier, but now it feels heavily killer sided. The hooks feel like they are literally 2 steps away from one another and no matter where I crawl or run off to i turn around there is a hook. The killers abilities are really stupid for some of them, as well as the new matchmaking skill. The matchmaking system used to be so much better before, but now however the hell it is the ranking system sucks, and I constantly feel like I am going against smurfs and tryhards and it definitely pisses off new players. The solo queue experience sucks, and none of my friends play this game cause it is honestly that bad. The maps suck all the small ones like dead dog saloon, preschool maps, the school map, and haddonfield all SUCK. They were all reworked and they still suck more people off then pornstars.

Tem dois jeitos de jogar, um é sendo um sobrevivente, outro é sendo o assassino. Como sobrevivente vc pode escolher um entre vários personagens, cada um tem uma habilidade específica e vc pode ir upando elas conforme vai progredindo no game. Nesse modo vc joga com até + 3 outros jogadores que precisam trabalhar em equipe pra escapar do assassino. Como assassino vc joga solo, tendo que eliminar os outros jogadores. Vc pode escolher um entre vários assassinos, cada um com uma habilidade também e gameplay bem diferenciadas. Os gráficos são bem legais, não é nada super realistico. Não vi muitos bugs, jogo parece bem otimizado, os loads são bem rápidos também. É bem difícil de enjoar desse jogo, pois se vc escolher mudar de personagem a gameplay muda bastante. Uma coisa muito legal, é que o jogo é Multiplataforma, vc pode jogar com pessoas que jogam em consoles, não só em pc. O jogo base não é tão caro, se gosta de jogos do gênero pode pegar sem medo. As expansões adicionam assassinos, sobreviventes e cenários. Tem uns legais outros nem tanto.

Aside from that it has a sorta fun, non-engaging playstyle that could be fun if it weren't so meta oriented. \n\nMost of the games characters on the survivors side are actually quite unplayable. They have perks and abilities that make them leagues above everybody else, offering game changing boons like surviving hits that would otherwise lose you the game, to gaining access to dodges or quick heals, or other things that make you virtually unkillable. That or their perks are virtually useless and you should not play that character lol. You won't find a lot of variety and you will find yourself playing one of the few meta characters \n\nIts even worst as the hunter sadly, most of the hunters cant be played, plain and simple sadly. Their abilities can end up doing more harm then help, rendering you in a match you are guaranteed to lose. Only super meta builds and strategies will ever give you an edge, and all of them are boring and repetitive as crazy. You don't ever actually feel like you're hunting anybody or anything at all, and the super meta hunters don't even play in such a way as to make the game exciting, they're super point and click + a lot of walking around doing nothing but painfully managing generators and occasionally hunting a survivor. Even when you win it will still feel boring because you know they only lost because they were stupid for not following the really strict meta and that they were mechanically disadvantaged.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGame takes a massive time investment to get to max lvl and you will be severely disadvantaged until you do, has a super strict and unforgiving meta, and the play style is dry and repetitive with no exiting or new things ever happening. \n\nMight be fun with a group of 5 friends","timestamp_created":1657818493,"timestamp_updated":1657818493,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118809208","author":{"steamid":"76561199114414332","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1908,"last_played":1658370327},"language":"english","review":"Do not buy this game \nI'm addicted but its not a fun game send help please!","timestamp_created":1657818490,"timestamp_updated":1657818490,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118808975","author":{"steamid":"76561198153798896","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":42295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":74,"playtime_at_review":42100,"last_played":1660578769},"language":"english","review":"You either close the game after 2 matches or lose 10 matches with friends","timestamp_created":1657818171,"timestamp_updated":1657818171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118808614","author":{"steamid":"76561198888055023","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":32162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":588,"playtime_at_review":30296,"last_played":1660528102},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo jogo de estrategia e cooperativo","timestamp_created":1657817663,"timestamp_updated":1657817663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118808118","author":{"steamid":"76561197997503418","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5886,"last_played":1658121403},"language":"english","review":"Very unique 1v4 multiplayer game whose fun varies from game to game. Some matches as either killer or survivor can be heart-pounding fun, while other matches feel painful and drawn out, as if the other team is purposely torturing you. That being said, it's way more fun than frustration, just be prepared to find an opponent with 2k hours and a desire to make you feel sad. Overall, a great solo experience as a killer and a fun group experience to play with friends. 5 man custom games are the most ideal if you can grab 4 other friends.","timestamp_created":1657816960,"timestamp_updated":1657816960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118807868","author":{"steamid":"76561198036106013","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":37979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1426,"playtime_at_review":34449,"last_played":1660534101},"language":"english","review":"I enjoy this game a lot and the developers seem to be responsive to community feedback and quickly roll out updates and fixes.
