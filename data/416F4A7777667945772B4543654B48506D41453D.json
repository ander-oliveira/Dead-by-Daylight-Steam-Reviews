sobreviver um jogo, pode jogar muito bem, saber loopar, lanterna, pallet, jogar como nunca, mas todo game termina do mesmo jeito, maluco ta de NOED na mão, e vc vai morrer e ficar reclamando, infelizmente é assim que funciona, pelo menos uma coisa a Behavior arrumou, os gráficos, o jogo era totalmente mal otimizado, então hoje em dia ta bem melhor de jogar e não dar aquela desculpa q o

Nice fucking game.\n\nHave I mentioned the devs way to balance is to add perks that counter sometihng which ends up doing 2 things:\nA. 90% of perks are useless, 2 are must have no matter what (DS and SC for survs, Whispers and perk to stall the game like ruin for killers)\nB. You need to buy the DLC or wait for RNG shrine to give you an option to buy a perk you absolutly need to play the game like Franklin's demise or BBQ right now for killers. If you don't have them you lose.\n\nSeems like all assymetrical games are doomed for failure.","timestamp_created":1518458260,"timestamp_updated":1518458260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40028738","author":{"steamid":"76561198300278017","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10097,"last_played":1658067453},"language":"russian","review":"у меня была довольно хорошая прокачка да же у одно 1 престиж был и с какого то дня у меня все прокачи исчезли ( док-во можно посмотреть по скриншотам этой игры )","timestamp_created":1518457358,"timestamp_updated":1518457358,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40028019","author":{"steamid":"76561198134559541","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":16067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1655508460},"language":"russian","review":"игра для бшееных оч парней вапще оч крутая побегать поржать тупа от маняка ну угарно канешХЕХЕХЕХХЕХ ЕХЕ ХЕХХЕХЕ кафй кайфуй туп бегай страдай кайф старайся ор","timestamp_created":1518454884,"timestamp_updated":1626359668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40027790","author":{"steamid":"76561198417482896","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":7209,"last_played":1659397987},"language":"turkish","review":"oynadığım en eğlenceli ve bazı zamanlardada en stresli oyunlardan biri genellikle korku baskılı bi oyun değil ve bence çok güzel bir oyun ^^","timestamp_created":1518454015,"timestamp_updated":1518454015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40027724","author":{"steamid":"76561198039557301","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12707,"last_played":1635647093},"language":"english","review":"Entertaining, especially with a group of friends.","timestamp_created":1518453819,"timestamp_updated":1518453819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40027487","author":{"steamid":"76561198341076924","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2991,"last_played":1568220705},"language":"russian","review":"Такого говна я ещё не видел.
