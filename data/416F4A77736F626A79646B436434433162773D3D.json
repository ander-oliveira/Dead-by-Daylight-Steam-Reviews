Не говоря уже о стандартных багах по типу прилипания к текстурам (а разработчики наверное по этому поводу говорят мол, \"реализм, ребята, у кого не бывало, что он карманом к дверной ручке прицепится\"), или уходы в неведомое за текстуры, или странное поведение тел персонажей, продолжать можно долго.\n\nИ ладно бы можно было бы просто позабавиться с этим, так не удастся, потому что игра с графоном 2010 (как бы не раньше) года постоянно мотает и без того низкий фпс в сторону нуля.\n \nПлюс возьмем хост, который создаёт маньяк, и пинг с соединением которого ты можешь попытаться проверить только сообщением в чатике (потому что в игре даже настроек элементарных нет, не то чтобы показатель пинга с соединением сервера), и достоверности в нем будет менее 5%. А это как в L4D зайти на версус локалку, а потом удивляться, почему постоянно сливаешь. Тебя швыряет через пол карты, когда ты перелазиешь через доски. Или например ты вроде как и перепрыгнул через окно, и уже на два-три метра отбежал, радуясь за сохранность своей задницы, и тут же по ней же прилетает хитуля. Это было бы весело, если бы не было так грустно. А ещё автонаводка у маньяков. Уворачиваешься как боженька, стирая клавиши на клавиатуре, а здоровая хренотень в руках у маньяка магнитится к тебе через все 180 градусов. \n\nПро комьюнити говорить много не буду, везде своих дуралеев хватает, но адекватных здесь и правда почему-то немного. Не знаю, как живётся маньякам (я за них не играю), но даже самым что ни на есть золотым (а это растягивающим игру минут на 20-30) и то пишут про несуществующее кемперство и читерство. Впрочем, таких (золотых) маньяков поискать ещё надо. И все-таки много кто не брезгует облить человека помоями, чаще незаслуженно, хотя гораздо проще, как по мне, молча начать новую катку.\n\nКак итог: назвать это полноценной игрой язык не поворачивается. С такой производительностью разработчиков, игре следовало бы быть в тестовом режиме еще пару лет, а может быть, еще больше. \nНо она уже продаётся, и продаётся за 500р, хотя за такое и половину от этой цены стыдно было бы брать у народа. \nВпрочем, если кто хочет, может и приобрести это сырое блюдо, украшенное сверху безвкусными красителями (в виде длс, и за определённую (тоже завышенную) плату) от поваров, которое придумали отменный рецепт, но так и не научились его приготовить. \n\nЛично я лучше подожду, нервишки дороже.","timestamp_created":1484293158,"timestamp_updated":1543106505,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":56,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.680961072444915771","comment_count":19,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29218799","author":{"steamid":"76561198130477039","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1243,"last_played":1511809737},"language":"english","review":"Currently this game isn't even playable, I can't get into a game without it crashing.

Das finde ich an sich eine frechheit da das spiel sehr oft abstürzt und fehler hat, und anstatt diese sachen zu beheben konzentrieren sich die entwickler darauf neue sachen rauszubringen damit sie mehr geld abgreifen können.

It being about how traps, or perks are going to get nerfed or something that goes against your play style. Besides, the definition of a good killer is one that doesn't camp hooked and gains bleeding points for the survivor being rescued and then healed (if healed). Yet as a [b] Killer[/b] you need a stradegy a way to get enough points to get your [b][i]pip[/i][/b] that [b][u]contributes to your rank as a killer,[/u][/b] [b]1[/b] being the best. Or to kill everyone and double [b]pip[/b] earning you two pips to your next rank. Besides that the killers job is to go from gen to gen and patrol the area to ensure there are no survivors working on them. If a generator has progress simply look around for a hiding survivor in closets or crouched. Look around corners and dark/shaded areas as the survivor wll tend to blend in. Kill all the survivors before these gens are powered and you [b]win[/b].\n\n[h1] As a survivor[/h1]\nWhen you play survivor this is where it gets interesting, the job as a survivor is completely simple and straight-forward [u][b]Survive[/b][/u]. The entire game is leaned towards the survivor role. The killer is not that powerful as they used to be. Thats because a lot of people complain about things they clearly need improvment in, and the community is needy for the survivors to be better. Yet again, these people mostly play survivor so they don't understand it when it comes to the killers perspective. So the killer is often overlooked in this game, as people dwell on how killers need to be nerfed when they're objective is to [b]kill you[/b]. Besides, the object of the game is to have a stradegy to repair all five gens and escape the killer. You have to lure the killer to palets that can stun him/her if they're close enough to the palet. Giving you a chance to escape the killer chase. Then to be healed if you have been hit- looking for another survivor. On the other hand, if you are the last one left and there are only 3 gens left to repair- don't. There is a [b] trap door [/b] which you can escape from but its a matter of finding it. Once you know how the game works then you will find it very easy and very fun.\n\n[h1] Is this game worth it?[/h1]\nYes this game has a lot of potential, I am personally a programmer and know how the smallest this can be simply overlooked, these developers reach out to there community. Yet they only seem to care more about the [b] streamers[/b] more but thats because they rely on them to promote the game. This game is very fun, once you become skilled and know how a survivor plays or know what they're gonna do its simple yet complex to the idea of the stradegy. The survivors are easyier considering how they have the upper hand in the game. The reason why I reccomend this game is because its a fun game to kick back, grab a cold one and be best of the best for your team, or for yourself as a survivor. As a killer its fun to go up [b]real players[/b] and not AI's.\n\n\"See you in the fog\"-DBD\n\n[*] Survivor Difficulty: Easy-Hard (Auto-Hook repair & Bloodlust)\n[*]Killer Difficulty: Easy-Master","timestamp_created":1484255518,"timestamp_updated":1495213828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520379066467285156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29211376","author":{"steamid":"76561198114762108","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":38122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9000,"last_played":1646023238},"language":"english","review":"not fun, dont buy","timestamp_created":1484255243,"timestamp_updated":1624054521,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474147915840148926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29211333","author":{"steamid":"76561198037973758","num_games_owned":572,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":9480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8132,"last_played":1590408957},"language":"english","review":"not bad","timestamp_created":1484255086,"timestamp_updated":1561822236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29211190","author":{"steamid":"76561198192482679","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":26668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1426,"last_played":1654828099},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom.\nDá pra melhorar mais é muito bom .","timestamp_created":1484254586,"timestamp_updated":1484254586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29211080","author":{"steamid":"76561198356556115","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":34134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4047,"last_played":1658184868},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist an und für sich ganz gut, allerdings ist es völlig verbugt.
