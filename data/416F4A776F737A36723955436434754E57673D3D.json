It has a few bugs and kinks they seem to be working on currently, but it hasn't hindered my enjoyment. I do however think they need to do something to make playing with friends more fun. I wish you could play with friends without it being private only. I do understand why you can't simply let players get points during private matches, especially since people would abuse it, but there has to be better way. Gripes aside, I can totally recommend this game and would probably give a 7 out of ten, maybe an 8 with patches. Depending on your preference, it is at the very least a good slasher holdover until the Friday 13th video game. But what they could do in the future with this premise or with even DLC has me quivering with excitement. Just patch these issues quickly pleezes...","timestamp_created":1466208050,"timestamp_updated":1466208050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498254984617233276","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23623148","author":{"steamid":"76561198140580518","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1484056829},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень классная я сделал предзаказ  Dead by Daylight Deluxe Edition","timestamp_created":1466207458,"timestamp_updated":1489771384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23623132","author":{"steamid":"76561198311307311","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1573156291},"language":"russian","review":"Ребят привет,сразу скажу игра реально нормальная,а порой даже страшная(особенно когда за тобой бежит маньяк!!!!)Разработчику респект-уважуха,на ноуте пошла на высоких хотя по минимальным системным требованиям ноут не савподает(на 2 gb меньше ОЗУ)Игру рекомендую,но одному играть немного скучно...Играть надо с друзьямиии...Без багов,а так-же жду новых маньяков и персонажей!!!!","timestamp_created":1466207408,"timestamp_updated":1466207408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23623118","author":{"steamid":"76561198124929127","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1466189046},"language":"english","review":"güzel oyun, hadi şimdi siktir git.","timestamp_created":1466207333,"timestamp_updated":1466207333,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.410566449165344238","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23623110","author":{"steamid":"76561197995491517","num_games_owned":533,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1610695497},"language":"english","review":"Did not have very long with the game yet to write a PROPER review. But within the hour ive played so far, I enjoyed myself, and can see further enjoyment with the game. Played a couple rounds as the survivor and as the killer. Each time you play the game changes, bringing all new obstacles to the game. Ive played each killer so far, and two different survivors. My favorite killer so far has to be the wraith killer, the 3rd one added in. Graphics are ok, but at the moment im only using a gtx 550ti, as my 980ti had to be RMA'ed. Game runs smooth, I havent experienced any lag issues yet. Games load realtively quick. All n all so far it seems to be a solid survival game.

I question where I am and what is going on here, then I turn around and I see a 7 foot man standing over me which makes me nearly shit my pants. I bolt away quickly as possible and hide inside of this closet. I peep outside the door and see him walk by creaking the floor. When I see he turns the corner I jump out of the closet and run down to a strange looking engine. Luckily I am skilled with machines so I quickly am able to repair the device. A light turns on above me as the generator goes to full power. What does this strange contraption even do?  I ponder this for a while when a hand grabs my shoulder which makes me shart, luckily it isn't the tall man, it is a girl. She tells me we must escape while we still have a chance. \"What even is this place?\" I ask her. She opens her mouth to say something and suddenly the 7 foot man is there! He grabs her by the throat and throws her over his shoulder. I don't know what happened after that because I ran as fast as my legs could carry me. I figured whatever happened to her wasn't good because shortly afterwards I heard a brittle scream in the distance. \"I have to get out of here!\" I said to myself. Frantically I looked around trying to find anything to help me escape this place. Then I remembered the way I came in, surely I can still escape that way! I dash back the way I came and see a large gate blocking my way. I cry in desperation before I see a lever. \"This must open the gate\" I shout. Madly I pull down the lever, slowly the gate is opening. I turn my head and see the 7 foot tall man coming in my direction. \"Hurry up you damned gate!\" I yell in desperation. Finally the gate is open, and as I run towards freedom I am grabbed by the back of my neck! His grip is that of steel, I can barely breathe as his hand tightens around my throat. This is the end for me, I know it. Suddenly there is a bright light and the tall man grunts and drops me to the ground. \"What the hell was that?\" I think to myself. I turn around and see the girl, injured but alive. She nods at me as runs off as the man chases after her in anger. I couldn't believe my luck! I ran outside of the gates and cheered, as I was finally free of the terror thrusted upon me. I will never forget what that girl did for me.","timestamp_created":1466205096,"timestamp_updated":1466215277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505780339241027832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622664","author":{"steamid":"76561198035893904","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":19041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5350,"playtime_at_review":15217,"last_played":1660602785},"language":"english","review":"Game is miserable now even with a SWF.

Then when the full game was released, i was so excited for it, because in beta you could only play as one of the killers (the trapper). So when i hoped in my very first lobby, people were leaving, then joining, then leaving again. My first thought was that they just wanted to play with their friends, but then another answer poped in my head, they were just disconecting from the server and returning to the main menu because thats what happened to me. Then when i joined and actually played, the killer was a wraith, so i thought \"ah ok, i'll just play\" but no, the wraith is too OP, they kinda really need to nerf the wraith killer, but overall, when you get a killer who doesn't hook camp, or over abuse the wraith skill, then the game is pretty fun. Also, my opinion is that i have seen some people say that the game would be alot better with a \"invite a friend to a public lobby\" thing. Well i completely disagree with that, because this game is based around working as a team without people asking for it, if someone is on a hook, its common instinct to help them... But yes you will get those people who will only care about escaping and getting the generators rathing than helping a fallen survivor, but hey, in every game you play you are gonna encounter a few of these people, i guess for me its exciting just to see what kind of teamates you get and what type the killer is.\n\nI recommend this game, but if you are one of those impatiant, \"i want everything now\" people, well then this probably isnt this kind of game for you at this present point in time.\n\n8/10: Keep up the good work devs\n\nAlso remember people, this game not long came out, so gives the devs a break and let them do what they need to do, rather than asking for everything right of the bat.","timestamp_created":1466203978,"timestamp_updated":1466203978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622409","author":{"steamid":"76561198294355883","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1521553113},"language":"english","review":"No party only in private match gayyyyy","timestamp_created":1466203858,"timestamp_updated":1466203858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622389","author":{"steamid":"76561198017655613","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1603647861},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ive played in a while easily, as a survivor your heart starts racing as soon as the killer starts chasing you until you get away then its the best feeling ever !\n\nAs the killer you reign terror on the poor 4 sobs trying to escape, simple but not so simple at the same time, is to kill them any means necessary!! \n\n10/10 for me","timestamp_created":1466203775,"timestamp_updated":1466203775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622354","author":{"steamid":"76561198070446229","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1585421758},"language":"turkish","review":"SÜPER AYOL ALIN","timestamp_created":1466203628,"timestamp_updated":1466203628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":56,"weighted_vote_score":"0.75332951545715332","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622338","author":{"steamid":"76561198046238971","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":50829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21943,"last_played":1641456090},"language":"english","review":"Great, but better with friends","timestamp_created":1466203537,"timestamp_updated":1511378283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622332","author":{"steamid":"76561198095379301","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1589389474},"language":"english","review":"I want the booty!","timestamp_created":1466203493,"timestamp_updated":1466203493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23622328","author":{"steamid":"76561198149740082","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":96508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1309,"playtime_at_review":2573,"last_played":1660446510},"language":"english","review":"STOP READING AND BUY IT!

Theoretisch ist es das auch immernoch. Allerdings...\n... das Balancing ist noch sehr schlecht!\n\n... Der Killer ist von den Überlebenden nicht zu sehen. Man weiß also nie ob der einen hohen Rang hat oder ein neuling ist. Er hingegen sieht die Überlebenden schon in der lobby und kann dann einfach die Lobby verlassen wenn ihm die Überlebenden zu stark sind, was scheinbar auch ganz typisch ist. Das ist dann nochmal ärgerlicher wenn man zum nächsten Punkt kommt.\n\n... gibt es seit \"kurzem\" die Möglichkeit zusammen mit Freunden gegen einen Killer zu spielen. Die Option wurde eingebaut um sie dann 12 Std. danach wieder zu entfernen weil sie nicht funktioniert hat. Das war ärgerlich weil sich viele darauf gefreut haben. Dann wurde sie einige Zeit später wieder hinzugefügt und nun klickt man auf Bereit er sucht, er findet kein spiel und man klickt wieder bereit. Hat man dann nach 20 min endlich ein spiel gefunden verlässt ggf. der Killer das Spiel wie schon beschrieben. Dann fällt man zurück, ganz allein in eine Lobby und man darf alle Freunde neu einladen und das ganze spiel wieder von vorn beginnen. Auf einen Fix warten wir schon lange... \n\nWas man aber dazu sagen muss: Spielt man das Spiel ganz allein ist die Lobby suche nicht perfekt aber funktioniert besser und das Spiel an sich ist echt schön aufgebaut. Es steckt viel Liebe zum Detail in den Maps und die Umgebung und Sounds sind wirklich super!

I definetly recommend it. \n\nBut some things need fixed. It's obvious. I don't believe this game is eactly where the devs want it to be. And I believe they are trying to fix it. \n\nThere are problems. More than 4 times now, as the killer I have clipped out of the map picking up a victim, and more than three times I have have frozen completely in place pulling them out of windows.\n\nAlso, the ranking system is maddening. if you don't win 10 thousand points every single match, you don't rank up. and sometimes the amount of points you score is not dependent on your skill. if even one victim leaves the game before you kill them, you can effectively kiss having more than 10 thousand points on that round goodbye. \n\nSubsequently, the scoring system for the survivors is way too harsh in my opinion.  I can activate two generators on my own, and another while cooperating, save someone from a hook, not get touched by the killer one time, and escape perfectly, and MAYBE make it out with 10 thousand points. The faster you win, the less points you recieve, which is amazingly stupid. You are punished for having a perfect and quick round. \n\nLastly, and possibly the worst, People constantly leave the lobbies to find their friends. Two things can fix this. a cap on how many matches you are allowed to leave in a 24 hour period / severe consequences for leaving a lobby for no reason, or make a party system.  People want a party party system, Which Frankly I do not want. It's a detriment to the Killer when the victims can talk to eachother on skype while they're playing, even if they're on exact opposite sides of the map.\n\nSo add a party or don't, I don't care, but people constantly leaving one after another to find their friends is infuriating. And I think it ridiculous that more than three quarters of the negative reviews  on this game are because a party option isn't available. this game deserves more than just \"mostly positive\"\n\nThis game is great. being a killer is action packed and intense, being a survivor is heart pounding and fun. If you were a fan of evolve, or are a fan of horror, or action, or anything in between, do yourself a favor and buy this game.","timestamp_created":1466201487,"timestamp_updated":1466201757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23621801","author":{"steamid":"76561198043860850","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":316213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3969,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1660593677},"language":"english","review":"Awesome asymmetrical game!","timestamp_created":1466201408,"timestamp_updated":1466201408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23621725","author":{"steamid":"76561198057308776","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1638048630},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная, но вопрос можно ли использовать ключи на бету за делюкс издание сейчас (после релиза)?","timestamp_created":1466201188,"timestamp_updated":1466201188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23621722","author":{"steamid":"76561198142134833","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1558998701},"language":"english","review":"gust 1 mod ?????????????","timestamp_created":1466201184,"timestamp_updated":1466201184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23621706","author":{"steamid":"76561198019768649","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":34949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2479,"last_played":1547924748},"language":"english","review":"A new take on pvp.

Oh boy, bittersweet word that may be, grinding is now harder in the game and even more so it feels very slow the higher levels you reach, it'll take you nearly a month if not a \"cave-dweller\" to get 3 characters all to level 30, wich is in the game truly starts taking a new shape, so far I feel there should be timed boosters during the weekends or during certain weeks, and these could be announced, therefore dragging more players back into playing 'cause \"Oh shit, I get TRIPLE the points!?\", or at the very least, let us risk BUYING Blood Point boosters as DLC, there isn't much wrong to it, the game is still played and whoever levels faster will eventually land with players of either equal skill or levels, offer a mask or something with it just as an excuse, Payday 2 did it for a good while and people ended up enjoying a good handful of the DLC's, even when they just added more cosmetics and minor accessory tweaks.\n\nFor short: the game continues to deliver good times, but it does go from a nicely paced jog to a slog and crawl through the later parts of it. I think something like the timed \"à la MGS: V\" BP boosts or  \"Shark Card\" DLC's could be beneficial!\n \n\n( Original Review written in version 1.0.1)\n\nThe survivors are granted more chances of succeeding than a killer, over the fact you can vault windowsills without these being on a cooldown, like for example if the window came down and prevented that hole to be used, or the fact since the killer cant climb over chest high obstacles, a survivor can theoretically run around a tank tread in the farmstead per say, indefinitely, thus turning what could be an interesting chase, into a joke, this isn't me being salty, it's seeing a proof of read actually being applied in the game itself.\nThe game is good so far, it's VERY cathartic to be able to overcome odds in this game, but as it stands, the survivors are of 1.0.1 have the upper hand, but am looking forward to further balances in the next updates.\n\nONE. STRONG. POINT I WILL TOUCH. The game has people abusing already of things such as speed hacks (this luckily so far being rare, you'll mostly find foreign eastern players doing this), they're not unkillable, just, they jitter around constantly, so play it smart and there WILL BE  a good time to get them.

With VoIP to actually communicate with your team or taunt the survivors it can create some of the most hand shaking tension I've had in a multiplayer game.  All the killers feel unique with their specials and surviving feels like an accomplishment.\n\nThe Bad: The bugs. Oh my god is this game a buggy mess for a finished game.  It feels like the beta didn't really accomplish much in terms of bug testing. Also some new objectives would be nice other than \"Fix Generators, open one or both the doors, escape\" A small gripe to be sure, but something to consider.\n\nThe Ugly: You don't earn Blood Points in private matches. I can understand ranks, but I want to play this game with my friends, but I'm forced to play in public matches to level up my characters for perks. The ranking system also seems majorly borked since getting 3 of 5 generators, saving 2 people off hooks, multiple escapes from the killer and surviving doesn't get me a pip of rank. I mean surviving for the first few ranks should get you a pip. Oh and manage to survive but don't earn a pip? Guess what, you lose one. Possibly your items as well as punishment.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game with some great potential provided the Dev's listen to the community and fix some of these glaring oversights/Bugs. We want some kind of communication with the group. Even proximity based VoIP or some kind of quick emotes would do SO much in communicating.  This game (to me) is in the same vein as L4D or Payday.

The initial 'scare' factor does fade once you've played it enough, but the constant feel of dread does not\n- Loved and nurtured.. there's a beautiful finish to this game. It has been cared for, and this is evident in the characters and their individual abilities, the maps and the offerings to The Entitiy.\n\nTHE BAD\n- Connection issues.. constantly experiencing weird issues such as being kicked out of lobbies. I'm sure this will be improved, however the first patch seems to have only focused on graphical glitches.\n- THE WRAITH. Words cannot describe.. ever played Evolve? How much do you hate The Wraith in that? This is quite similar.. overpowered and therefore unbalanced; a game is in no way enjoyable ifyou know it is unwinnable.

Это тоже самое,как соеденить в одной игре Брандербургский концерт И.C. Баха и Personal Jesus группы Depeche Mode,музыка отличная,но вместе никак не слушается.\n\nОптимизация (стала чуть лучше с моего последнего обзора,но жрать 2 гига видеопамяти... Total War Rome 2 жрет столько при осадах 5000 VS 5000,а тут,да при таком графоне...).\nВремя на сбор команды (вылеты из лобби пофиксили,но за маньяка вы будете очень долго ждать пока соберутся выжившие,иногда по 20 минут ждал) -\n\nПлюсов больше,но если видюха слабая лучше не брать,на средних настройках игра после последних патчей выдает 60 фпс,но загружает видеокарту (ASUS R9 270) по полной. Я,конечно,понимаю,что видюха не топовая,но и с такой то графикой аля 2011 год можно было и оптимизацию на уровне сделать.\nПодводя итог: уже можно играть.\n           P.S. Мнения насчет последнего обновления разошлись,я лишь приведу свою статистику из 20 матчей,сыгранных за выжившего,новый маньяк попался 17 раз(1 раз хиллбилли и 2 раза трапер),новый маньяк победил нас 16 раз(мы выйграли лишь тогда,когда нам попался рак,который не умел использовать способности),а из старых меня один раз убил трапер и то,все остальные сбежали.

It's a game worth purchasing as DEVs are working on patching and adding new content to the game.\nI just hope that they will add in features where I can party with Friends and be working together in a game rather then trying to lobby with them (for hours on end..., but there was that one time where we did and it was so much fun)\nAlso, add on a mic option to talk to either teammates or even on lobby. It would be cool if DEVs add a mic option where we can actually talk like 'whisper' in the gameplay so it adds the surreal of the environment that we are in or something.\n\nOther than that, this game is fun for me and has many potential in it.

The game can be extremely unforgiving to newbies but that will motivate you to get better, at least it did for me. You will not be great at it from the get-go. There are a few bugs here and there but this game is fresh off the boat and I have no doubt that every legitimate problem will be addressed. I hope that the devs don't cave to the rage-quitters. I've played mostly survivor since launch (as most people are queueing up to be killers, creating a small wait time to be one) and I've found that there's a fair and balanced strategy to counter every killer. Sometimes there's no getting away and that's just the \"luck\" aspect of the game. Playing as a killer can be just as challenging and each has its own separate avenues for advantages. I highly recommend you check it out.","timestamp_created":1466194120,"timestamp_updated":1466194120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23619988","author":{"steamid":"76561198130613351","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1635532383},"language":"english","review":"No party system so dont expect playing with your friends unless you wanna play in a private game.","timestamp_created":1466193901,"timestamp_updated":1466193901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508379876613616943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23619965","author":{"steamid":"76561198110393707","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1497362660},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, которая сможет потрепать ваши нервы\nПолный обзор здесь\n\nhttp://vk.com/away.php?to=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FClHlKOS_Hbg&post=-116892976_18","timestamp_created":1466193794,"timestamp_updated":1466193794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23619963","author":{"steamid":"76561198080224242","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1627326897},"language":"english","review":"This is a very well made game.

I feel like the killer, the Wraith, is overpowered, because it can move so fast and the only things that give it away is the very hard to see patches of body and weird grunting it makes. I don't like the fact the add-ons only last for one round, i think they should last at least 2 or maybe more rounds. Other than that the game is pretty good. The character progression is great and the gameplay is mostly smooth.
