It is trying to get better though, I hope. The only downside are the people who play online but if you play casually with friends it’s the best scary fun you will ever have. The gameplay is simple to master and at first it might be scary, but you’ll get used to it (I know I did lol). This game does need some more work before it is great but right now it is just okay. Get this game when there is a steam sale unless you really want to play it. And Keep up the good work developers!\n\nCheck out my YouTube channel (ChristovonHool) for gameplay videos about it; if you want to get a feel for what the game is like. \n","timestamp_created":1546838694,"timestamp_updated":1546838694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48162515","author":{"steamid":"76561198266606938","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":158790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93865,"last_played":1639314074},"language":"schinese","review":"8014","timestamp_created":1546837840,"timestamp_updated":1547399189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48162385","author":{"steamid":"76561198136365349","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1546523149},"language":"schinese","review":"我深港专线的魔法，连CSGO美服也就175ms延迟，0 loss，玩这游戏就死活加载不进匹配不到人，你们的服务器是开在月球吗，8说了退款","timestamp_created":1546837181,"timestamp_updated":1546837181,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482631415128707886","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48162312","author":{"steamid":"76561198302249364","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29260,"last_played":1653844566},"language":"english","review":"Believe it or not but there is a game in this buggy program.\nfun things in this \"game\" :\n1)you gotta love getting camped\n2)clown and doctor are the most lovable killers\n3)getting killed on your first hook cause your team respects your privacy and leaves you alone is the best\n4)gotta love getting stabbed by the legion over and over and over and over and over again, so fun\n5)you will love the perk no one escapes death as a survivor\n6)getting hit even after you valted is an amazing experience\n7)if you get a prestige 3 nurse know that you will survive the game a 100%\n\njust some of the most beautiful things that will make you want to buy this game :)","timestamp_created":1546836687,"timestamp_updated":1546836687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48162022","author":{"steamid":"76561198160053053","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1620375025},"language":"english","review":"Clown gud killer.","timestamp_created":1546835032,"timestamp_updated":1641653099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48162004","author":{"steamid":"76561198056086814","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":21369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":698,"playtime_at_review":1678,"last_played":1660448622},"language":"french","review":"Jeu très captivant, stressant et qui requiert une attention constante à son environnement.

Unless you want to grind and be killer, solo survivor is absolute hell.  People say \"git gud,\" but that doesn't matter - the matchmaking will absolutely fuck you raw.  Rank 1 killers are so fucking OP it's actually crazy.  I watch a number of killer streamers, all of whom say things like, \"I haven't lost a game of DbD in months.\"  Why?  Because they almost always 3-4k once they know how to play.  Sure SWF gives the survivor side some hope, but the game is balanced based on SWF.\n\nI kept track of my games in red ranks, and it is 79% 4k.  The rest of the games are one or two escaping, with only 2 games in 100 wherein all 4 survivors escaped.  That is seriously fucked up.\n\nTunnelling killers are rewarded by BHVR, who simply does not build in a natural anti-tunnelling system.  D-strike?  I could give a fuck - build something into the game that keeps killers from relentlessly, cuntingly tunnelling people.\n\nPrevious evaluation:\n\nIt's hard to evaluation this game for a number of reasons.  First, it's asymmetrical, which makes the game very hard to balance.  This is the biggest single problem with the game: new players get absolutely trashed by killers and they don't want to continue playing.  Furthermore, if you DO decide to continue with the game, at least 100 hours of gameplay is needed before you start to feel a bit more \"comfortable\" in the game.\n\nThe pipping system is not the best - it needs to focus more on whether people eventually escape to reduce the crippling number of 4ks at low ranks.  Killers need to be rewarded more for less to recalibrate their notions of \"winning.\"\n\nAside from this, I've lost a LOT of offerings (many bloody party streamers) because the game crashes in the loading screen AT LEAST 1/5 of my games.  Ctrl+alt+delete...constantly.\n\nAside from these two pretty significant issues/hurdles, this is a pretty fun game to get into - especially if you find friends who will play with you.  Playing with friends is one of the few things you can do to somewhat level the game out and give survivors a chance to survive.\n\nIf you're going to play killer, same things apply: you really need a lot of hours to better understand the game and when you go against a survivors with friends group you are absolutely going to lose hard.  Lots of hours required to play better.  \n\nWith most games, a new player will be matched with another new player, and the matchmaking feels pretty balanced: not so with DBD, where the matchmaking feels very off for about 75% of all games.","timestamp_created":1546818111,"timestamp_updated":1610413191,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48158374","author":{"steamid":"76561198846873330","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3198,"last_played":1644152969},"language":"russian","review":"Очень хорошая игра,но троллей много)))))","timestamp_created":1546817456,"timestamp_updated":1546817456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48158345","author":{"steamid":"76561198803415079","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":65551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":333,"playtime_at_review":155,"last_played":1660251097},"language":"english","review":"To be completely honest, this game kills your soul. Not only is this game survivor sided, they will take every opportunity to tbag, and complain any time they get caught by the killer. somehow with every update, the game is getting worst and worst. There's a cycle of getting a new killer that can actually keep up with he survivors, then they get nurfed and survivor perks get buffed. For example, the perk that takes absolutely no talent what so ever, dead hard, now allows you to ignore a hit with would normally put you on the ground, but lets out a scream and gives the killer a hit animation and allows them to cover a shit tone of ground. If somehow you are able to get a survivor on the hook, one of the many op perks with allow you to eat hit like its nothing, like borrowed time, or soul guard. Against all odds, the devs have made it even worst! the new ranking system will make it so you play against people that are so much better than you, and than as a survivor, people who are no where near on you level that you cant even climb up. This game is never going to be balanced because they keep adding things that the killer needs to worry about, but not for survivors! survivors just have to sit on gens, while killers have to monitor each gen, chase, destroy these new boons, watch each door, keep an eye on the hooked survivor. The absolute worst case scenario, like hang your self from a fucking tree levels of rage, is a survive with friends group. It doesn't even have to be a good group, but the fact that one survivor can tell everyone else exactly were to killer is, will ensure almost every time that all four people will escape. Don't even get me started on the twitch streamers who sit on survivor and bitch when killers catch them.

I understand that the survivors were overpowered in the beginning and they still are pretty strong if you know how to play (I'm not too good myself) but I think it's safe to say that the game is now slightly if not killer sided.  I like the game but it just isnt fair at times.  I could think of many ways to make the game better such as stopping the sacrifice timer when the survivor is getting face camped or proxy camped, add a status effect (kinda like the killer's bloodlust) to make the survivor faster when they are being chased for too long, etc.  Until the devs work on it I must give this game a thumbs down.\n\n  Edit: I didn't think they could make this game any worse, but man was I proved wrong.  At this point I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more survivors turn to killer just so they have a chance at winning the game and actually being heard by the developers.  I get that I am not the best survivor and I'm certainly not the best killer, but the killers keep getting more and more buff and the survivors keep getting more and more nerfs.  I know that dedicated servers are coming in the summer but at that point I don't think the game will be fixable. The decisive strike nerf isn't the worst but it still cripples survivors because before they only had to worry about hitting it while having the chance of the killer having a stroke and spinning around like a mad man along with dribbling, and now they have to worry about a 40-60 second timer, the killer still spinning around and the possibility of dribbling.  I know that survivors were overpowered but now it's more killer sided than ever.  Devs, I honestly loved this game, but please buff survivors, even if it is just a small buff.\n\n  Here are some suggestions.  Survivors should have something kind of like blood lust, similar by making them faster as the chase goes on, but make it to where it isn't faster just enough to give the survivor more of a chance and make it to where the weapon has to hit their body to actually injure the survivor.  These are just some of my suggestions and I hope you at least think about it.  (These are just my opinions.  If you have anything wrong with them, leave your opinions in the comments and we can discuss these differences in a civil manner.) \n\nThank you for reading my opinion.","timestamp_created":1546805157,"timestamp_updated":1553820911,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503921210765838623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48154665","author":{"steamid":"76561198099238603","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14846,"last_played":1649238038},"language":"spanish","review":"una mierda lleno de bugs y errores al inciar la partida... se ve que estos no saben hacer ningun videojuego y salen a venderllo","timestamp_created":1546804995,"timestamp_updated":1546804995,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48153956","author":{"steamid":"76561198194874733","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2653,"last_played":1599871823},"language":"brazilian","review":"legal","timestamp_created":1546802859,"timestamp_updated":1546802859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48153925","author":{"steamid":"76561198869812593","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1545880452},"language":"english","review":"It Runs Tearibly On my computer\n","timestamp_created":1546802756,"timestamp_updated":1546802756,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439999997615814209","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48153755","author":{"steamid":"76561198269461005","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1656380914},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would recommend","timestamp_created":1546802252,"timestamp_updated":1546802252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48153410","author":{"steamid":"76561198024499440","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":16512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13963,"last_played":1499886731},"language":"german","review":"Die ersten paar Stunden machen echt Spaß,dann wars das aber auch. Wer auf Abwechslung und Vielseitigkeit hofft ist hier definitiv fehlt am Platz.\n\nDas Ziel ist immer dasselbe und Einzige,unabhängig der Karte,auch die Elemente der einzelnen Karten bleiben gleich:\n- Paletten um den Killer \"aufzuhalten\" (Lagerverwaltung lässt grüßen)\n- Kisten,die Items erhalten\n- und natürlich Fenster,durch die man hopsen kann\n\nAnsonsten sind die Karten ähnlich aufgebaut und lediglich durch grafische Elemente einzigartig,mit denen man nicht einmal interagieren kann. Sei es irgendwelche Clownwagen um die man läuft oder Boote,die man ebenfalls umläuft,oder Autos...die man ebenfalls umläuft. Natürlich gibt es auch Höhen und Tiefen in dem Spiel,sodass ein 3D-Steuerungserlebnis gefühlsnah wirkt,aber es gibt keine Abwechslung oder einzigartigen Hindernisse für Gegner oder Abkürzung wo man sagen,kann \"Das macht die Map einzigartig\".\n\nDas Gameplay an sich ist immer das gleiche langweilige Erlebnis:\n\nAls Überlebender sucht man die Generatoren von denen man 5 reparieren muss,damit der Strom läuft und man eines oder beide Tore öffnen kann um dann zu entkommen. Sollte man der letzte Überlebende sein und noch höchstens 3 Generatoren fehlen,dann kann man auch durch eine Luke fliehen,die irgendwo auf der Map versteckt ist. Es gibt Truhen in denen man Items findet,die auf 6 Stück limitiert sind:\n\n- Taschenlampe\n- Werkzeugkasten\n- Medizintasche\n- Schlüssel, um vorzeitig die Luke zu öffnen oder um Personen aufzuspüren (je nach Addon)\n- Eine Karte um die Generatoren zu sehen (was für eine Karte mehr als schwachsinnig ist)\n- und Firecracker um den Killer evtl. zu blenden oder um ihn zu sich hinzulocken\n\nDie einzelnen Itemklassen unterscheiden sich lediglich darin,dass sie über eine bessere Qualität in Form von mehr Haltbarkeit aufweisen,aber das wars dann auch schon (und nein ein Licht,dass die Form eines Geistes hat ist nichts besonderes)\n\nDer Rest des Spiels liegt dann darin vor dem Killer abzuhauen und im die bösen Paletten auf das Knie zu schlagen,weil das die Schwachstelle jeden Killers ist. Egal wie muskulös ein Killer ist und das er mit einem Tritt den Generator ausschalten kann,gegen eine Palette ist er machtlos.\n\nAnsonsten versucht man ihn mit der Taschenlampe zu blenden was eine Chance darstellt ihm zu entkommen,oder der Killer lädt seinen Schlag auf und sprintet dadurch ein kleines Stück nach vorne.\n\nSollte der Killer dann jemanden zwei mal getroffen haben um ihn dann töten zu können (durch einen Perk) oder ihn an den Fleischerharken zu hängen um ihn den schwarzen Spinnenästen zu opfern. Man kann sich selbst befreien vom Harken,die Chance ist aber eher gering,dass es klappt,daher verzichten die meistens vernünftigen Spieler darauf und warten bis ihre Mitspieler sie befreit richtig? Von wegen,wenn du nicht gerade in geschlossenen Gruppen mit Freunden spielst,dann lassen die Leute dich am Harken,da du für sie eher eine Chance darstellst zu entkommen,weil ACHTUNG! Killer neigen dazu,den Harken, an dem das Opfer hängt, gerne mal zu campen oder aus gemäßigter Distanz zu beobachten. Sollte das ein nicht zufriedenstellen kann man auch als Trapper,zwei Fallen hinstellen,da die Figur ein Stück nach hinten rutschen,wenn sie einen Spieler befreien wollen. So kann man die Befreiung eines Spielers in die Länge ziehen oder gleich weitere Leute fangen.\n\nUnd das wars mit dem Spiel,andere Optionen um zu entkommen gibt es nicht,man kann den Killer lediglich mit Lichtershow oder fiesen Europaletten aufhalten und wem das nicht reicht,der kann auch noch Harken manipulieren und damit dem Killer das Leben schwer machen,außer er hat einen Perk mit dem er dich instant killen kann,oder er campt dich einfach während du liegst,bis du verblutest,solltest du durch ein offenes Tor abhauen,hat er noch genügend Zeit dich aufzuheben und vom Tor wegzutragen.","timestamp_created":1546801198,"timestamp_updated":1546801198,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48153380","author":{"steamid":"76561198866962169","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1579351219},"language":"russian","review":"top","timestamp_created":1546801099,"timestamp_updated":1546801099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48153002","author":{"steamid":"76561198335367542","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1867,"last_played":1597236083},"language":"koreana","review":"세일해서 샀다가 큰 낭패를 보고있다. 애초에 고인물 게임인데 랭크별 매칭이라서 새로 시작하는 유저들은 매칭이 안된다.\n시작하면 20랭부터 게임을 하게되는데 매칭시스템이 아예 생각없이 만들어놓은 구조라 한게임을 하려면 정말 오래 기다려야 된다.\n오늘은 약올라서 2시간 넘게 기다려봤는데 결국 한게임도 못했다. 살인자가 방을 만들면 생존자 4명이 들어와서 레디 박아야 되는데\n내가 생존자로 들어가서 30분 기다렸더니 1명이 들어오고 30분 들어왔더니 한명이 들어오고 한명이 나갔다. 이 정신나간 매칭시스템을 고인물들은 고랭끼리 게임하기때문에 큰 불만이 없고 새로 들어오는 유저들은 아예 겜을 못하는 수준이다. 제발 사지마라","timestamp_created":1546800003,"timestamp_updated":1546800003,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507401943206787109","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48152878","author":{"steamid":"76561198024264513","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":21829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21557,"last_played":1546093518},"language":"english","review":"As survivor\n>jumped into a game\n>became the gen jockey for most games\n>got out most of the games played\n>got shit from my teammates for doing all the work and leaving\n>got shit for using \"crutch perks\" (because I can do something against literal 3sec invincibility after getting sprint burst effect)\n>got shit from the killer for \"gen rushing\"\n>asking myself, what's wrong with doing the only objectice of the survivors\n\nAs killer\n>jumped into a game\n>killing people, as you do\n>getting out with an average of 3 kills every game\n>got shit for \"camping\", because I was on the map while they unhooked somebody\n>got shit for \"picking crutch perks\", because I use Ruin from time to time\n>got people telling me to \"kill myself\" because I got a 4k one game\n\nIf I had to suggest something.\nBring out \"Perkless Mode\", where everybody goes in perkless, addonless and itemless.

It basically became a handicaped killer, that looses time by cloaking and uncloaking. he is massive as well and easy to sport even when cloacked. all the while some other killers are massively over powered, sonetimes making it quite impossible to win over, as the game mechanics favors them violently. \nI do not recomend this game, unless you have a group of 5 friend to play with. \n\n\n\n\nI cant recomend this game. \n\nSome killer are so much more powerfull than the others that it kills the pleasure yu can have either playing alone or with friend. \nOf course the most power killers are the one you need to by a DLC for, and it is discusting. \n\nThe devs dont even care, since they stop answering messages about those issues a long time ago. \nDont bother paying for immense frustration.","timestamp_created":1546796047,"timestamp_updated":1633337552,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48151530","author":{"steamid":"76561198874700168","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":27415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3649,"last_played":1657235357},"language":"spanish","review":"No me gusta","timestamp_created":1546795881,"timestamp_updated":1612240099,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423076927661895752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48151460","author":{"steamid":"76561198327794358","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":73671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73671,"last_played":1658253946},"language":"german","review":"Seit dem dieses spiel raus gekommen ist spiel ich Dead by Daylight und mir waren die buggs immer relativ egal ich hab die buggs eher gefeiert das war einfach das spiel es gehörte dazu aber dieses neue update ist der letzte schmutz ich empfehle niemanden dieses spiel im aktuellen zustand zu spielen es ist nurnoch geldmacherrei es wird nur auf die killer gehört survivor haben keine Existenz Berechtigung \nBehaviour hatte nur einen Job das spiel besser zu machen aber das neue System ist einfach nur ubfuck letzter schmutz","timestamp_created":1546795666,"timestamp_updated":1658254317,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48151399","author":{"steamid":"76561198822701960","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":799,"playtime_at_review":2104,"last_played":1659822464},"language":"russian","review":"игра очень крутая","timestamp_created":1546795520,"timestamp_updated":1546795520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507462680339813232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48151331","author":{"steamid":"76561198311328090","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":33616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24629,"last_played":1645277058},"language":"schinese","review":"都不错，就是TM的怨灵的那个逼脸这么难照瞎的？zzz做的什么JB脸？","timestamp_created":1546795260,"timestamp_updated":1546795260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552339553833007813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48151095","author":{"steamid":"76561198871155694","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1615992463},"language":"russian","review":"Ошибка 8014 играть невозможно!
