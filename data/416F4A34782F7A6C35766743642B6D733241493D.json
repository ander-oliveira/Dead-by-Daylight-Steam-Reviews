V hre musíte opraviť všetky generátory (na mape ich je 7 alebo 8 , ale stačí ich opraviť 5) aby ste mohli utiecť. Znie to jednuducho že :D ? Ale je tu jeden problém... Jediná cesta ako prežiť je opraviť všetky generátory a utiecť cez 1 z 2 dverí.(Poprípade ak budete mať u seba kľúč dá sa utiecť aj poklopom, ale musíte ho nájsť skôr ako Hľadač) Ale ak si niekto kúpil v obchode Huntera za 10€ tak je to skoro nemožné. Ak si vyberiete hľadača tak vašou úlohou je nájsť všetkých preživších dokým opravia generátory a povesiť ich na hák. V hre máte na výber cez 15 Preživších a cez 15 Hľadačov, každá postava má vlastné perky, ktoré si počas hry môžete odomykať. Každá postava má svoj level v ktorom si dané perky vylepšujete a rozširujete. Môžete si so sebou zobrať aj nejaké nástroje (baterku, mapu, opravársky set, poprípade lekárničky a tak ďalej) V hre je stále čo objavovať. Hra má veľa zaujímavých máp na ktorých sa nachádzajú truhlice s nástrojmi. V hre je takisto niečo ako Battlepass v ktorom si môžete odomykať nové doplnky a postavy. Každé postavy si môžete kozmeticky upravovať, alebo kupovať nové v obchode za gemy alebo kupovať za peniaze. Najlepšie sa táto hrá s kamarátom, ale ak by ste chceli hrať jeden Preživší a druhý Hľadač tak vám to pôjde len vtedy ak budete hrať spolu s 5 kamarátmi. Ak chcete hrať 2 Preživší tak vás to už normálne spojí s ostatnými hráčmi. \n\nTeraz si to tu spolu zhrnieme:\nPlusy +\n-Hra je celkom pekne graficky spracovaná\n-V hre je stále čo robiť\n-Veľa postáv\n-Hra má veľa dobrých DLC \n-Hra má veľa častých updatov takže sa určite nebudete nudiť\n\nMínusy -\n-stojí 19,99€ (Zato čo punúka je 20€ podľa mňa veľa...Ak si ju chcete kúpiť tak počkajte na zľavu kde bude stáť 9.99€)\n-Hra je v niektorých prípadoch Pay to Win. Dá sa povedať, že ak si kúpite premiového hľadača tak ste vyhrali.\n-Nemôžete hrať s 2 kamaráti s tým že jeden bude Hľadač a druhý Preživší.\n\nEšte dodám - Hneď ako si hru kúpite tak si urobte tutoriál v ktorom získate zadarmo 50K Bloodpointov a skúsenosti v hre.\nKaždý má svoj vlastný názor takže ak sa vám moja \"recenzia\" nepáči tak ju proste ignorujte :d.\nHru som kúpil keď bola v zľave a to za 9,99€ Recenziu budem postupne upravovať.\nZa chyby sa dopredu ospravedlňujem.

Maybe make it so the game can tell the difference between a player leaving and being forcefully disconnected? That's a pretty crucial detail to overlook when your game is exclusively multiplayer, but then again, you wouldn't know much about pleasing your playerbase now would you, BHVR? Honestly, you people make the likes of EA and Ubisoft look competent.\n\nSpeaking of the playerbase, I think it goes without saying that this game's community is downright horrendous. It's quite literally the most entitled, whiny, self-righteous cesspool I've ever seen in a video game. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the average MW2 lobby at the peak of that game's degeneracy was still more mature than the ones in this borderline judas cradle, only the other players can't call you racial slurs here because 99% of the chat is automatically censored for some reason. Take one look at the Steam discussions or the official forums for this game if you don't believe me; It is unreal how something like this can be so overrun with entitlement and degeneracy.\n\nThe saddest thing is how much potential this game has to be great, but as it stands, it's nothing more than spooky freeze tag with an ungodly amount of problems, a horrible community, and incompetent developers who could care less as long as their wallets get fatter. The problems with this game will never be fixed, the community will always be as terrible as it currently is, and the project as a whole will continue to get worse with each update until the developers either start caring or sell the game to someone who does. I want to like this game, I really do, but I've found that the further you go down the Dead By Daylight rabbit hole, the worse of a time you're going to have.

There is a chat at the final of the matches made specially to bring chaos, racism, discord, hatred and even worse.

No, this is just another toxic nonsense coming from those who defend not liberty but their free channel of all sorts of harassement. This is so obvious.. If we know there is someone offending us, wherever it is, you should be there to face them and respond them the way the fact demands. They will come and tell you to just ignore, like the developers do. So, my friend,  be careful, you're really going to enjoy this amazing game but the comunity will destroy you, little by little. There are a large, very large percentage of sick people around here and as it has happened to me, it is going to infect you also. I know.   You will agree with me pretty soon about how absolutely unnecessary is that chat at the final of the matches and how pathetic are the arguments of those who defends the existence of something toxic giving you the solution of ignoring someone harrassing you, using racist terms against you, cursing all your dignity... haha come one...

Better luck next time!\nit just sucks cause I really enjoyed the time I played, but it seems my progression means NOTHING.\nUPDATE: I redownloaded 4.6.0 and all my progress is there so I guess that's

casi un año que me compre el juego y desde que salió la espíritu eh seguido al juego y había estado fascinado con el genero asimétrico; era algo que me parecía bastante original y no fue hasta que sacaron a uno de mis personajes favoritos, pyramid head, que decidí ahorrar para comprarlo.\nHoy en día he de decir que para nada recomiendo este juego por dos principales razones; a no ser que de verdad te fascine el genero slasher, los personajes y el lore que te plantea el juego.\nLa primera razón por la que no lo recomiendo es el gran desbalance que hay y que claramente sabemos que esta muy a favor de los survivor, ojo no critico a los jugadores de survivor, este desbalance es problema del propio juego y hace que sea todo lo contrario a divertido y entretenido las partidas y las hace una experiencia estresante; Behaviour con cada actualización nerffea cada vez más a los killers y les da mas herramientas a los survivors para ganar la partida, claramente las premades tienen una clara ventaja y me parece que estas ocasionan parte de este desbalance, me parece absurdo que con un survivor me vea o vea mis tótems o y todo lo que haga, automáticamente todos los demas lo sepan y esto a mi parecer rompe la estrategia del killer; y este desbalance claramente lo veo cuando juego de survivor y me resulta un paseo por el parque ir en premade y da igual lo bien o mal que juguemos; el desbalance, el gen Rush y las premades tienen una clara ventaja y behaivor no sabe arreglar nada más que buffear y nerfear todo lo que ve.\nLa segunda razón es la inmensa toxicidad de su comunidad; por dios llevo jugando videojuegos toda mi vida y nunca había visto una comunidad tan toxica; las partidas se basan en la mayoría trollear y humillar a otros jugadores, tanto killers como survivors son bastante tóxicos criticándose el uno al otro la forma de jugar y creo que en esto influencia bastante el desbalance del propio juego; sin embargo obvio la toxicidad de un juego es cosa puramente de la comunidad, la verdad ya hace bastante tiempo que ignoro los comentarios de muerte que me hacen en el chat al final y todos los insultos y criticas que se avientan, pero para mi es triste ver que un juego que se base en el trabajo en equipo tenga una comunidad asi. Me parece a veces difícil entrar en el roll del asesino o en el roll del survivor por ver como se la pasan trolleandose entre si e insultándose al final de la partida por chat xd.\nEn conclusión, a mí me gusta mucho el juego, me enamore de sus personajes y lores; actualmente mis favoritos son enfermera, pyramid head, Michael Myers y Doctor, pero sinceramente no lo recomiendo a menos que te guste mucho el genero slasher y sus personajes de licencia, me duele y me parece muy difícil actualmente defender el juego por estos dos grandes motivos y la verdad seguiré jugándolo y divertirme lo más que pueda a pesar de los defectos del juego y espero que en el futuro lo balanceen…. ._.\n","timestamp_created":1618363300,"timestamp_updated":1643316353,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90272401","author":{"steamid":"76561198861699213","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":60534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":120,"playtime_at_review":22724,"last_played":1660585456},"language":"english","review":"This game is a buggy mess.

eso creo yo... entonces lo que hice fue patrullar 3 generadores cerca del gancho a ritmos irregulares... y la verdad nadie se atrevía a salvarlo.\n\nTienen que solucionar el problema de que el asesino no se sienta como un montón de plastilina al que puedes noquear tan fácil, que no puede saltar las ventanas, que le puedes tirar maderas encima, tiene que haber un control para los forcejeos cuando tienes a alguién en el hombro.\n\nhasta ahora no he jugado como superviviente, pero entiendo lo que hacen, creo que no tiene caso si no te conectas con 4 amigos que jueguen sistemáticamente.\n\nojalá este juego mejore su experiencia con el tiempo, quizá con un poco más de historia, y menos letras.\n\nSi campeas... es más fácil que los demás tengan tiempo de reparar generadores, pero... quedas con un mal sabor de boca -supongo yo- por no salvar a tu compañero.\n\nsi si si está chevere... pero siento que le falta mucho.\n\nLos puntos de sangre\nLas grietas\nPiedras iridicentes...\n\nson tan complicadas que no notas la diferencia... ahí se les fue la olla... mal diseñado...\n\nsupongo que mejorará.\n\nSi quieres jugarlo... juégalo.","timestamp_created":1618359788,"timestamp_updated":1618373362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90270445","author":{"steamid":"76561198889208566","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":28419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3601,"last_played":1659323354},"language":"koreana","review":"데바데가
