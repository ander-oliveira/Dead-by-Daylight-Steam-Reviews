My Opinion may therefore be of less value than those with thousands of hours of play time. Read at your own risk.\n\nDead by Daylight is an interesting game, for sure. Even though it largely lacks the horror aspect it may seem to promise, and is a somewhat bug ridden, it is quite addictive and has managed to keep my interest for a few months now. How has it kept my interest you might wonder (that is why you are reading this, I presume)? Well, for starters, the gameplay it is based on is quite a unique and therefore a rather rare concept: It puts you in the shoes of a survivor (or bloodthirsty killer), whose main goal is to repair generators, flee from the realm/map they are put in and survive (or, if you are a killer, sacrifice/kill all 4 survivors with the use of your unique powers). Because this heavily underused concept (though not unheard of) playing the game can feel quite refreshing in comparison to, say, playing another open world survival game. Admittedly, this might not be a selling point for a lot of people, which is why I will also tell you more about the gameplay itself. Since it is varies considerably depending on which role you choose to play, I will separate it into two parts.\n\nIf you happen to play as survivor (and if this is your first time playing), there are a few things that you should expect. Firstly, you will most likely die... a lot. Why is that, you may ask? Because of the many different killers and their unique powers, abilites and counters, making each match a different challenge that will test your perception, courage and, of course, skills and adaptability (all crucial to your chances of survival), creating a certain tention and excitement as you frantically struggle to keep your team (and yourself) alive. Questions such as who the killer is, what they are planning, and if you can afford to save your everyday Dwight from the clutches of a chainsaw-wielding Cannibal will constantly soar through your mind as you realize that the Dwight just got cut open, leaving you as the only survivor left...\nAll of this combined makes for a fun, varying and slightly dreadful experience to those new to the game and, if you live/die and learn for long enough by figuring out the killers' strengths/weaknesses, how they tend to act and how to use your environment to your advantage, you will be rewarded with an increase in competency and rate of survival that would make a killer weep in despair (what a twisted turn of events), and leave you with pride and satisfaction as you leap into the embrace of victory (which often comes in the shape of a window). This drastic improvement comes at the price of the previously mentioned tension and excitement, however, since it will feel like you have more control of the situation you are in.\n\nNext we have the gameplay of the killers, which, in contrast to the gameplay of survivors, often starts of easy as your victims tend to be confused as to what exactly they are supposed to be doing. You, however, know exactly what you are supposed to be doing. You are supposed to kill, slaughter and bring blood to the blood god (sacrifice the survivors). To aid you in the upcoming massacre, you are given abilities and powers specifically tailored to the chosen killer, allowing you to choose between a plethora of playstyles, all to your liking (you will need to unlock most killers, though). If you favor strategy and predicting your enemies' next move, you may like The Trapper, who allows you to strategically set up beartraps where you think your opponents will go, rewarding you with the sensation of being the evil mastermind you know you can be, as you laugh at the suffering of the poor souls who made your designs fall into place. Not your cup of tea? Then how about The Deathslinger, who suddenly turns the game into a first-person shooter... except that you are the only one with a gun. Or, perhaps, you will enjoy the simple pleasure of vomiting on people as The Plague, rewarding you with an easier time downing survivors (and potentially a lethal ranged attack). As for your foes, they will be able to share the enjoyment of vomiting and spreading sickness, too, which is a win-win scenario, really. Through these different powers, these and many other killers (including characters such as the living pinball of death, The Blight) will ensure that you find a playstyle that suits you. Furthermore, if you are anything like me, each time you manage to kill or sacrifice a survivor, a surge of cruel satisfaction will course through you, satisfaction that will become greater as you face off against more and more difficult prey...\nSpeaking of difficulty, if you join the dark side for long enough, you will eventually be met with a spike in difficulty. Do you remember how I said that a skilled survivor could make a killer weep? Yeah, I was not joking about that... As their competency grows, so does the challenge to please The Entity (the aforementioned blood god), and your skills will truly be put to the test. Personally, this challenge is exactly why I tend to return to this role: it forces me try my hardest to outsmart and overpower the survivors by using all the tricks and bits of knowledge I have learned in the past, making me feel that (almost) every victory is a well deserved one, but it can certainly be a bit off-putting to some. In the end, the amusement of being the killer narrows down to overcoming challenges, having access to diverse playstyles, and primal satisfaction.\n\nWe are now approaching the end of this review (I hope you have enjoyed the thoughts of an amateur reviewer so far), but before we conclude it, I will briefly mention a few negatives about the game. I do acknowledge that the game is far from perfect, and will therefore highlight a few flaws for your reading pleasure. First of all, we have the bugs. There is a reason the game has been affectionately called \"Dead by Buglight\" from time to time, since you are guaranteed to run into them if you play for long enough. Most are relatively harmless (visual bugs, for example), but bugs that directly affect the game and your chances to succeed are not out of the question. Another thing to point out is the balancing of the game, more specifically, the killers. Since the game is asymmetric, balancing issues are bound to occur but as you grow more experienced, you may realize the effectivity of your favorite killer may not be able to reach the standard of some of the others. While characters like The Nurse and The Spirit are considered top-tier threats, other killers, like The Trapper or The Wraith often fall behind and are sometimes considered almost completely unviable against high-ranking players, which may force some players to limit their choices when selecting who will do the murdering. Lastly we have the ranking system: a system that has a tendency to put newer players against those with considerably more experience, sometimes going so far as to make matches outright unfair for one side or the other, thus shaping the overall experience into a nightmare for one side, and a joke for the other.\n\nWith all that being said, my review has finally reached its end. For those of you who have patiently read through the entirety of this wall of text, I thank you for your time and hope that it has been a fulfilling experience. I would also like to wish you all a wonderful day, and great fortunes ahead.\n\nSee you in the fog.","timestamp_created":1613873262,"timestamp_updated":1614186392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87133449","author":{"steamid":"76561198401138846","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":39,"playtime_at_review":3029,"last_played":1659421905},"language":"spanish","review":"esta weno","timestamp_created":1613873028,"timestamp_updated":1613873028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87133373","author":{"steamid":"76561197973732276","num_games_owned":1050,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":7085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5355,"last_played":1644541769},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and interesting game of map control and mind games.

However, the dev team for this game are close to the worst I know. The game has one major flaw, and that is that it's foundations (the game engine) are terrible. Every new update brings more bugs than bug fixes, and bug fix sections bigger than the actual update content almost every time. Both of the latest major update have essentially broken the game each time, and it doesn't feel like there's any real work going into fixing this issue that's been ongoing for literal years. It's probably not an easy issue top fix, but it needs fixing. They do alright with balance, but there are still some maps, items, and perks that have issues there that are constantly being talked about, and nothing is being done, not for a while at least. \n\nIn short, while I love this game to death at it's core, the issues it has are so big that I couldn't possibly recommend it to anyone at this point, and that's saddening.

They're obvious bugs that need fixing but they wont get to it for months/ever. They make changes that 99% of the community HATE, and they know that in advance from the people who play the Public Test Build (PTB). An example is that the entire community said to the developers \"HEY, the new ui is terrible, please don't push it to live servers.\" Then proceed to push it to live servers as a big middle finger to its fan base. Along with this new ui came new animations for the survivors, and they just look terrible and have ALSO brought massive dysnc for the survivors perspective and other bugs. So while SOME of the time the hits from the killers perspective look fair, from the survivors perspective on the other hand, 99% of the time the hit is no where near them.

Playing casually becomes near impossible because of all the com teams you get ranked up against. The entire games are full of Head Ons, Deceisives, Body blocks, flashlights and gen rushes, and more. And not to be forgotten are the last few seconds of flashlight clicking and tee bagging in the end. Also the toxic after-game chats.\n\nAs Survivors Its a bit better. Although on this side, you have to rely on mates. These sometimes troll and/or disconnect on their first hook, which is also shitty.\n\nAnother problem is matchmaking which is the worst I have ever seen. Sometimes you play against only red ranks (rank 1-4) as a Rank 17-20 killer and sometimes Its the other way around.\n\nNow BHVR has taken away the possibility to see the ranks of every trial member which is another thing that is just disgusting. For example, you play against a rank 20 that plays like someone with 3000 hours? Damn you can't report him because you don't know if he has a fitting rank and the matchmaking  f*cked up again or if you play against one of the thousands of smurfs.\n\n(I apologize for every grammar mistake I made in this review I'm not a native speaker and as you probably have noticed by now my English isn't that great)","timestamp_created":1613867304,"timestamp_updated":1628903724,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87129355","author":{"steamid":"76561199082924365","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":4399,"last_played":1659934454},"language":"english","review":"Its a great game and you should try it if you like horror games!","timestamp_created":1613866962,"timestamp_updated":1613866962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87129139","author":{"steamid":"76561198288544690","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2228,"last_played":1640387895},"language":"english","review":"JOGO RUIM RUIM RUIM HORRIVEL BOSTA FRACO LIXO MT PESSIMO NAO JOGUE SE VC AMA SUA PESSOA.
