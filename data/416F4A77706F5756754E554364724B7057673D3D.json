Имена их перечислять не буду, это не важно. У каждого из них есть свои уникальные перки и способности. Помимо уникальных есть и общие. Игра на английском, поэтому перед тем, как поставить себе какой-либо перк лучше зайти в руководства и узнать о них больше. От правильного выбора умения зависит ваш шанс на выживание.\nВо время самой игры вы сможете найти ящики. В этих ящиках могут оказаться различные предметы, действия которых вы сможете усилить с помощью раннее упомянутых перков. Задача выживших - спастись от маньяка. Вам придется завести 5 двигателей, которые откроют доступ к рубильникам, открывающим дверь. Если остается всего один выживший, то на карте появляется люк. У вас появится выбор: либо искать люк (появляется в случайном месте на карте), либо заводить двигатель (и получить больше очков для прокачки). \n\nМаньяк:\n\nМаньяков существует 3 вида. У них также разные перки и способности.\n1. Умеет ставить капканы.\n2. Становится невидимым(но когда он уходит в инвиз или выходит из него, звучат колокола. Также если он в инвизе, то у выживших не звучит музыка, означающая присутствие маньяка рядом с ним.)\n3. Мужик с бензопилой. Заводя бензопилу нереально разгоняется.\nЗадача маньяков - повесить выживших на крюки(Во славу сатане, конечно)\n\nПосле каждой игры вам выдаются очки, которые можно потратить на прокачку ваших персонажей.\nВ игре присутствует кооператив. Вы можете собраться и поиграть с друзьями между собой, но у вас не получится играть с другими игроками. По моему мнению, это единственный минус игры.\n\nИгра хороша, минусов практически нет. Кому-то она может напомнить Evolve, но наоборот.\nИгре не хватает русского языка, т.к. разобраться со всеми перками без должных знаний не получится. Благо есть умельцы, которые все расписали в руководствах.","timestamp_created":1466506231,"timestamp_updated":1466506354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23683639","author":{"steamid":"76561198218844975","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":18434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1566406602},"language":"russian","review":"Игра просто супер поиграл вроде минут десять а оказалось целый час советую всем любителям хороров и мултиплеера!!!!","timestamp_created":1466506085,"timestamp_updated":1466506085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23683440","author":{"steamid":"76561197983662132","num_games_owned":481,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":14728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1461,"last_played":1644289868},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazingly fun.

С каждым прохождением обстановка будет генерироваться случайно – точки спавна предметов для выживших, расположение строений и прочих вещей, необходимых для выживания, будут постоянно меняться. Кроме того, выжившие никогда не будут знать с каким порождением ада им придется столкнуться на этот раз.\n\nИгра за обе фракции различается геймплейно – выжившие играют с видом от третьего лица, а убийца – от первого. Выбрав игрового персонажа, можно полностью настроить его характерные особенности и одеть по вкусу. По мере игры вы будете получать опыт, который позволит улучшать свое оборудование и открывать перки. Также можно получать бонусы и распространять их на весь отряд.\n\nОставшиеся в живых вольны выбирать стиль игры – выживать эгоистичным одиночкой или объединиться с друзьями в группу. В последнем случае гораздо больше шансов выжить, хотя бы из-за возможности спасти попавшего в руки убийцы партнера. \n\nСредств выживания будет не очень много – фонарики, которыми можно слепить монстра, да шкаф, в котором можно спрятаться. Но если вы найдете время для исследования окрестностей, то обнаружите много полезного оборудования и комплектующих для модернизации. Цель выживших – активировать на карте несколько генераторов, что откроет путь к спасению.\n\nЛюбители жестокости вволю отведут душу, играя за убийц, у которых есть огромные тесаки, бензопилы, капканы и даже паранормальные способности. В будущем пантеон убийц будет серьезно расширен – фанаты фильмов ужасов наверняка обнаружат в игре своих героев. В зависимости от персонажа изменится и геймплей – некоторые могут оставаться невидимыми, другие будут обладать возможностью видеть ауры людей, третьи быстрее всех передвигаться и т.д. \n\nDead by Daylight – очень атмосферная игра, особое внимание в которой необходимо уделять звукам – они могут помочь обнаружить убийцу или указать путь к спасительным генераторам. Кроме того, уникальные способности каждого героя, возможность глубокой настройки персонажей, модернизации оборудования и генерируемые уровни делают игру потенциальным хитом лета.","timestamp_created":1466497979,"timestamp_updated":1466497979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518248140811920166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23682183","author":{"steamid":"76561198108654757","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":906,"last_played":1561787270},"language":"english","review":"Sick to death of trying to find games with friends what turkeys would release a game on steam when there is no party matchmaking system.

So far, I've been playing this game and this game only for the past couple days. Even if there's only private matches and you get nothing out of it, it's still fun as fuck to scare your friends. Hell, it's fun for your friends to scare you! I am not the kind of kid that can handle horror, but this game balances that perfectly. It kind of reminds me of Capture the Flag mixed with Slender (back when it was considered scary.) I'm seriously addicted to this game.\n\nTL:DR Great game 9/10","timestamp_created":1466495155,"timestamp_updated":1481348774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420918375253677368","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681821","author":{"steamid":"76561198125088851","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1586515105},"language":"thai","review":"เป็นเกมที่สนุกมากๆเล่นเพลินๆได้ครับ คอเกมแนวนี้ไม่ควรพลาดเลย \nแต่!! เสียอยู่อย่างเวลาหาห้อง น่าจะสามารถชวนเพื่อน หรือกดตามเพื่อนได้ สำหรับห้องสาธารณะ นะครับ\nและน่าจะมีให้เลือกด้านได้ แต่ยังไงก็ให้ผ่านละกัน ส่วนคะแนน 8/10 ครับ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J5QRpnVByEU","timestamp_created":1466495115,"timestamp_updated":1466495115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681613","author":{"steamid":"76561198206411263","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31,"last_played":1471855043},"language":"english","review":"Resolution issues: \n\ngame launches in 720p resolution, and in the options there is a slider from 0% to 100% , no option to manually input your desired resolution.

But there is a killer in the same map that tries to hunt you down and kill you. Thats the game explained in 2 sentences, but there is so much more.\n\nI have bought this game a few days after release and now this game is at this point 2,5 years ago released and still running well! At this moment i almost hit the 1400 hours, for a €20 euro game. in 2,5 years, i have experienced almost every update, the goods and the bads.\n\nActually this game has come from a LONG way to be good as it is now. The first few months was a tremendous hard time to play and love the game. Many bugs, SWF wasnt even here, game crashes, FPS issues, exploits and so on. That was 2016 (the first half year of the release) in a nutshell. Many people joined the game and many left the game. At some point, the reviews were under the 55% positive rate around end 2016 and the game had also ~12k players at a day for a while (now its 30k).\n\nIf i look at the game now, its much, much better than it was ever before. The devs did a tremendous good job on make a really good comeback to fix this game, add new content and listen to the community (they really do, trust me). The game came with 12 maps on release, 4 survivors and 3 kill. Now its over 25 maps, 15 survivors and 14 killers! Thats some HUGE variety if you ask me.\n\nWould i recommend the game back in 2016? I dont know. Sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\nWould i recommend the game now in 2019? Absolutetly! Game is fun to play and more players are playing ever since before (almost then, except on some DLC releases / free weekends)\n\nIf you ever consider to play the game by yourself, feel free to add me and im glad to help you with your questions.","timestamp_created":1466493075,"timestamp_updated":1549881003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546406149864196777","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681430","author":{"steamid":"76561198044532075","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":7899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1651022975},"language":"english","review":"Good stuff, needs to get rid of the cheaters tho.","timestamp_created":1466492844,"timestamp_updated":1466492844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681403","author":{"steamid":"76561198054927345","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":1741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":954,"last_played":1600486234},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏还不错很有创意的玩法。可圈可点，特别的匹配系统你特么让我20级匹配到1级的老司机是怎么回事？","timestamp_created":1466492666,"timestamp_updated":1466492666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681286","author":{"steamid":"76561198143473823","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1561390490},"language":"russian","review":"Интересная задумка,но пока-что есть некоторые проблемы в интерфейсе и оптимизации,а так очень хорошая игра. \n","timestamp_created":1466491787,"timestamp_updated":1466491787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681275","author":{"steamid":"76561198101321842","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":718,"last_played":1477298467},"language":"schinese","review":"很好很吃鸡！！！玩十几个小时依然是二十级~~！求大神告诉我怎么在奔跑时不转身看后面？","timestamp_created":1466491693,"timestamp_updated":1466491693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554682374000549316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23681229","author":{"steamid":"76561198009378256","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":21864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":139,"playtime_at_review":19874,"last_played":1659539146},"language":"french","review":"Non, \nAllez regardez Varg31 ou Exlelite sur youtube pour aimer ce jeu.

Because the survivors aren't able to use their mics or type in-game, they aren’t able to know where their teammates are to go distract the killer, heal their teammates or work on the generators.

So there is Co-op just not with strangers, I can't blame them as I would really enjoy that as well but clearly their just too sore over the fact they can't play with their friends and gain experience together. Honestly the game would be broken if it was implemented as if anyone understood what the game was meant to be, I think they should be more understanding towards that fact.\n\n1. The Killer would always be handicapped in these situations, for example; a killer with Insidious perk has to stand completely still for a few seconds in order to receieve stealth and no terror radius. If I was killer I would stand nearby and camp obviously. If I was going against 4 friends, the one caught just has to inform them I'm invisible and then they all could punish me for the camp. Why would they ever well knowingly walk into a trap. knowing I am completely invisible and waiting. All they have to do is seperate and grab an easy 3 generator. Which is absolutely insane.\n\n2. Talking only creates more annoying situations, if one survior is just being an absolute ass. He'll just taunt me (the killer) with his annoying ass voice so I'd probably stop following him or go insane listening to that rubbish. Even if I could gain from hearing their talk online, what about the ones that use thrid party software. Killer again has absolutely no chance once again. It completely destroys the games intentions and horrorfic moments that makes this game so wonderful to play when it happens.\n\n3. It simply takes away some of the horror elements this game presents, it's complete silence and horror. Your wit alone could win the game. Can you outsmart another human player thats chasing the crap out of you in pure evil intent to hook and slice you into many little pieces, i'm sure many nay sayers couldn't so they bring up these topics and expects indie developers to fix every little problem that comes their way. Which is hilarious since other game companys that are 100x bigger and 100000x more wealthy won't even bother.\n\nThese are just a few examples why it probably won't ever be implemented (unless with much handicap to the friends). It just simply doesn't work in this games formula. Silence, Horror, Patience, Dexterity, and Wit. Gamers nowadays lack much patience and wit. So thats probably why they fail to get this game.

Currently, there are 4-survivor characters in the roster to choose from. There isn’t a real difference between these survivors since the Bloodweb (the upgrading system) gives you random perks and item drops per level. \n\nFor the killers, there is the Trapper, who specializes in using contraptions like bear traps to catch their human prey. Another killer is a shaman like assassin called the Wraith. The Wraith takes advantage of the darkness and can almost become completely invisible. In its specter mode, a translucent distortion in the near vicinity can alert the survivors to the Wraith’s presence. This staff-wielding predator cannot attack in its Specter mode but if planned well, the Wraith can surprise an unsuspecting survivor. Lastly, there is the Hillbilly, a chainsaw wielding disfigured man who can charge towards any survivors without any reservations with his blood caked chainsaw. The roar of his thirsty, unforgiving friend is the only warning a survivor needs to get the hell out of dodge.\n\n---\n\n [h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nFour survivors are trapped in an arena with a killer and their main objective is to simply avoid the killer and escape, preferably alive. They’re dropped in 1 of the 3 maps currently available. The maps are chosen at random in the start of every game.\n\n [b] The Survivors [/b]\n\n I’d like to start with some of the strategies I picked up during my time as a survivor. First things first, survivors can attain victory when a certain amount of generators are fixed to power up the gates, which are the sought after exits. Exit to what, you may ask? To more swamp, I guess. Maybe there’s a McDonalds on the other side and you can buy the killer a nice little happy meal.\n\n A simple heartbeat is an important sound cue for them and listening intently for this can mean life or death. Sprinting can make a survivor’s tracks more likely to be seen by the killer so a smart survivor knows never to run unless the popos…I mean unless the killer is giving chase. \n\nWorking with members of the team can turn the tide of the game but if the killer seizes a teammate and hoists them up in their strong shoulders, unless someone has a flashlight (this item can temporarily blind a killer), there’s not much anyone can do (You can do what I do and go up to the killer and give them a hug because really, just share your love. Don’t be stingy, fool.) You can start your very own rescue operation and bring your fellow survivor down from the meat hook but take heed; the killer could still be lingering nearby. If and when you do this, feel free to heal them up and be kind a Samaritan.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=707699468\n\n [b] The Killer [/b]\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are 3 killers. They use their distinct arsenal of traps and deadly weapons to capture their prey and prop them up on a meat hook to sacrifice them to the Entity, a supernatural being whose hunger is never satiated. The shape of unpowered generators is lit up to make things a little easier on the killer since they are hunting four little mice scurrying about (the location of these generators are randomly generated.) The slightest crunch of branches or the rustle of the grass can mean that a person might be nearby. Also, the orchestra will be following closely behind you because there’s nothing like a good chase music to get you in the mood to murder. \n\nThere is an upgrade system, called the Bloodweb, available to both the survivors and killers. Every level-up, the player can choose a perk and item drops that are organized in a web-like fashion. This is randomized so there’s a chance for a rare or common perk/item drop to appear. \n \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=707699326\n\n---\n\n [h1] Did ya scare me? [/h1]\n\nThe scare factor of this game, on the scale of 1-10, I rate Dead by Daylight a 7 out of 10. 7 being, “Thank you! I hope this spooky feeling lasts!”\n\nI played the beta version and my first round was one of the most heart-pounding experiences I’ve ever felt in a game. The adrenaline that courses through you as you trudge along the murky, and foggy planes of the map is quite something else. For obvious reasons, playing as the survivor brings forth more of the survival horror aspect of the game while the killer puts you in a role of a powerful hunter that emits the DGAF attitude.\n\nI wasn’t expecting much the first time I booted the game so I was in for a surprise during my first match. The atmosphere can be creepy and nerve wracking, especially if you can hear the killer, like the Hillbilly charging his chainsaw, in the distance. Wearing headphones is extremely recommended because the ambient sounds can be unsettling at times. Most of the time in a public lobby, it’s every survivor for themselves but I do make an effort to try and save any survivor in my team. \n\nThrough repeated exposures in the full game, I still find gameplay somewhat exciting and hand trembling inducing (in my case that is). I am not usually keen in playing multiplayer games but I’m not bored with this game…yet.\n\n---\n\n [h1] Graphics and Technical Issues [/h1]\n\nAlthough there isn’t much to tweak within the graphics option, the performance of the game is consistent. My frames haven’t dropped below 60 (Specs: GTX 970, i7-4790S, 12 GB of ram…so on and so forth). I’ve crashed a few times and from what I witnessed, a friend of mine crashed 3 times in an hour time span.  The multiplayer might not be as stable because there were some disconnections in some games. A not so great internet connection or Steam can be blamed for this phenomenon.\n\nDead by Daylight’s haunting environments just adds a nice flavor to each match but I just wished there was more variety to the maps. As time goes on, they start looking the same.\n\n---\n\n [h1] Wrap Up [/h1]\n\nI can say that I can recommend this game to any horror or non-horror fans. It’s a great game to get lost in for a couple of hours a day. It isn’t the type of game that I can play for hours and hours but leveling up is progressive enough to make you come back for more. Each match can be surprising, depending on your team and how the killer goes about their hunting routines. \n\nFor now, I am enjoying this game but I do wish that we can invite friends in a public lobby because the game can be fun fooling around with friends. Sometimes, I don’t want to go in there alone (I do understand that the killer will be at a disadvantage if, for example, there is a group of 4 people in some kind of VOIP program.) With that said, this will rid of the loneliness and suspense you would feel if you soldier through a game by yourself so there’s a pro and con if this feature is implemented in the game.\n\nThe host can create a private lobby but I have only one other friend who has this game and you can’t earn experience points in these matches. So if you got this far and you’re thinking of buying Dead by Daylight, feel free to add me. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n---\n\n [h1] TL;DR  [/h1]\n\n [b] Pros: [/b]\n\n -Heart pounding killer versus survivors matches\n- Haunting environments and sounds\n- Progressive leveling up system\n- Killers are fun to play\n- It’s suspenseful playing as the survivors\n- Consistent framerate\n- Every survivor for themselves\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- Crashes\n- Disconnections from multiplayer\n- Cannot invite friends from public lobbies\n\n---\n\nIf you stuck around me this long, and if you have the time, watch me fool around in Dead by Daylight.\n\n[url=https://youtu.be/ESUw5gTAaro] Dead by Daylight Video [/url]","timestamp_created":1466476513,"timestamp_updated":1608180510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":76,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.80911022424697876","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23678897","author":{"steamid":"76561198067501861","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1550463024},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game :)","timestamp_created":1466475367,"timestamp_updated":1466475367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485436886548995972","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23678883","author":{"steamid":"76561198049860248","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":29194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3826,"last_played":1653904586},"language":"english","review":"This game is basically like masturbation.

Just wish more people played still. Players tend to also be very toxic believe it or not. Also gets repetitive pretty quick.\n\n[Strike]First off, I would like to clarify that this game is a great concept, and is very fun with friends. However, this game needs to be an early access game, since it certainly has the bugs of one.\n\n1. Needs desparate fixing. Sometimes wasd will just break, and you can't move. Or trying to swap from one role to the other breaks your game.\n\n2. There needs to be a bigger reason for the killer to not camp someone on a hook. There honestly is no current reason for the killer to leave them because they know the survivors are just waiting for you to leave. You can power the generators while he camps, but most of the killers honestly don't give a shit. So you can either leave and give the person back or camp and confirm the kill.\n\n3. Can get pretty repetitive after a while, needs more gamemodes and more content.\n\n4. There needs to be some sort of stamina system for survivors vaulting over things. It's currently vaulting simulator since the survivor can so easily evade the killer by just constantly vaulting over the same thing over and over again.\n\n5. Needs more than one way to kill survivors other than just hooking them. The hook is already boring, I would love to see them be thrown into a pit of needles (Saw style) or something, and survivors need to pull them out, just needs more variety.\n\n6. [Strike]Can only play with friends in a private match. This sort of makes sense, but if you both are playing as survivors there is no reason not to implement that.[/Strike]\n\n7. Ranking up and item system is confusing. Seems lazily made.\n\n8. Game badly needs optimizing. Frames tend to get choppy (no pun intended).\n\n9. [Strike]Keys aren't rebindable.[/Strike]\n\n10. Matchmaking system is pretty broken.\n\nI really want to give this a positive review. However, there's just too many bugs and not enough content for me to give it.

anymore.","timestamp_created":1466468749,"timestamp_updated":1466468749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23677762","author":{"steamid":"76561198124607397","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":51810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3407,"last_played":1656537452},"language":"english","review":"Make

me start this off by saying I've played this game since the day it released in beta (June 1st, 2016). The game has evolved so much, some good, some bad which is understandable. However the community is the worst I've ever been a part of. The community went from being close knit, helpful and fun, to jaded, angry, and spiteful. This is the ONLY community I've been a part of where people will leave negative comments on your profile if they didn't like how you played.\n\nI'm going to keep this short and sweet:\n\nPROS:\n\n- Constant updates. New content is being released every other month. Some of it being free.\n- Paid DLCs are more than fair in price. Offering a new killer, map and survivor for $5-$7.\n- Cheap game, tons of hours to put in it.\n- Devs regularly do dev streams on Twitch.\n- Prestiging a survivor/killer gives you extra incentive to continue leveling.\n- No microtransactions.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Questionable balance changes to perks/ gameplay. Devs are too nerf happy. If something LOOKS OP, they nerf it into the ground. They also balance the game around rank 20's (the lowest rank in the game) and rarely make changes based around rank 1 (highest rank) feedback.\n- The community rivals the League of Legends community in terms of toxicity. Constant whining and crying from the community make the game unbearable at times.\n\nREGARDLESS of the cons, I will admit this game is well worth the price. Just be prepared to deal with a toxic community.","timestamp_created":1466468463,"timestamp_updated":1511890654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.682209432125091553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23677734","author":{"steamid":"76561198025599468","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3963,"last_played":1568228903},"language":"english","review":"I stopped playing because the balancing always favored the monster (and my game kept crashing, even after multiple \"fixes\")","timestamp_created":1466468412,"timestamp_updated":1537074317,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpoWVuNUCdrKpWg=="}
