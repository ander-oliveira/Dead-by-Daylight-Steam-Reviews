This game is going to give you jump scares.  It will make you laugh, cry and scream likely all in one match.  :P   \n\nI have played it since beta and there have been changes along the way. Some good some bad and some questionable at times but the game play and challenges have advanced over time.  \n\nThere have been many attempts to fix pallets and balance survivors vs killers which will be never ending.  Be prepared for patches and re balance fun once a New DLC is released.\n\nThey finally migrated to dedicated servers which helps with some aspects but the lobby cue, matching system is still in need of a rework. In a fast paced game like this you should not have to wait 10 to 20 mins or longer to get in a game.    \n\nThe new tome and rift system are a nice addition and give both new and old players new goals and to the game added challenges and goals to achieve.  \n\nThe game charges for DLC  which if you do not want to pay full price for you can always wait till sales like the Steam Winter  and other sales events.\n\nHave fun and remember its just a game.  Just like in any community you will come across those that like to stir the pot and those that like to help others.   Overall the game can be fun but at times toxic  attitudes and behavior can make that experience less rewarding.  If you run across button pushers ignore them as they feed on pushing your button.
