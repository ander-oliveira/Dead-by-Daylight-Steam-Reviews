Especially since the last patches (lesser amount of pallets, father lunge attacks by the killers) and the new introduced killer there is almost no counterplay for the survivors.

A také proto jsem se kvůli nim nechal zlákat a stáhnul jsem si hru ve FREE WEEKENDU a nelituji toho. \n\nAle teď k tomu, kdyby někdo nevěděl o co v této hře jde. \n\nV Dead by Daylight stojí proti sobě 4 přeživší (Survivors) a 1 zabiják (Killer), kteři se spolu utkávají na různorodých mapách a cílem přeživších je nastartovat 5 generátorů, nenechat se zabít a zároveň utéci zabijákovi, který je celou dobu snaží chytit a zabít je.\n\nPokud hrajete za přeživšíje potřeba po nastartování 5 generátorů je ještě potřeba otevřít 1 ze 2 bran a úteci. Generátory se startují pomocí držení levého tlačítka na myši a zárověň se občas objeví Quick time event, u kterého musíte zmáčknou ve správnou chvíli mezerník (space), pokud ho zmáčknete v nesprávnou chvíli hra vás potrestá prozrazením vaší pozice zabijákovi a ten si pro vás určitě rád přijde. Pokaždé pokud je u vás zabiják blízko rozezní se hudba která sílí a zeslabuje se, podle toho jak je od vás zabiják daleko. Pokud vás zabiják začne pronásledovat můžete využit palety nebo okna ke spomalení jeho pohybu a ulehčení vašeho útěku. Pokud vás poprvé zabiják praští, začnete kulhat a celkově se zpomalí váš pohyb, po další úderu již spadnete na zem a zabiják vás může vzít na rameno a odnést vás na 1 z jeho háků. Po cestě k háku se můžete bránit zběsilým mačkáním kláves A a D, ale pokud se zabijákovi povede vás na hák pověsit, ještě nezoufejte, protože vás 1 z vašich spoluhráču může zachránit, tím že vás z toho háku sundá. Bohužel oblíbená taktika zabijáku je, že čekají dokud neumřete a až potom teprve odejdou. Pokud se mu vás podaří sundat budete zranění, ale váš spoluhráč vás může vylečit stejným způsobem, jako se startuje generátor. Skoro za každou činnost co ve hře provádíte jste na konci kola obměněni body, za které si můžete vylepšovat postavu a získávat perky.\n\nPokud se rozhodnete hrát za zabijáka je vaším úkolem zabít co nejvíce přeživších a co nejvíce jim znepříjemnit útěk. Za každé zranění nebo zabití přeživího jste obměněn body, které také můžete použít na vylepšení zabijáka nebo přeživšího. Přeživší, které ho se vám podaří srazit na zem a poté vzít na rameno vám bude znepříjemňovat pohyb pomocí kláves A a D, ale pokud se vám ho včas podaří nabodnou na hák, než vám uteče, tak už je jeho osud vedšinou jistý.\n\nVe hře se také nacházejí předněty (itemy), které vám pomůžou lepé pžežít.\nBaterka - pomocí baterky můžete oslepit zabijáka\nLékarnička - zkuste hádat -_-\nMapa - umožní vám vidět genrátory\nNářadí - umožňuje ničení háků\n\nCelkové máte k dispozici 5 přeživších a 4 zabijáky, s ruznorodými vlastnostmi, které se můžete upravit podle svého gusta.\n\nA teď něco z mého pohledu.\nVelice se mi na Dead by Daylight líbí, jak se vývojáři snaží hru nadále opravovat, přidávat obsah a také obrovská komunita, která je velice aktivní. Bohužel hra je opravdu zabugovaná, mnoho bugů při samotném gameplayi, ale i při čekání na hru.

I was introduced to it while watching a youtuber play it in the background of one of his videos. I did some research and looked at gameplay videos, and was instantly hooked. The controls are fairly simple. Using the A-W-S-D keys and your mouse. In my personal opinion, I think that playing the killer is easier than playing a survivor. With the survivors, you have to turn on generators as objectives to power up the escape. What makes it difficult for the survivors is that there are multiple random skill checks on the odjectives that you have to timely push the spacebar to progress in the objective. However, I guess that's part of the difficulty of being a survivor because you also have to be aware of your surroundings watching for the killer.

But playing with friends makes this game 10x much more fun. But one thing I do hate is the nurse. There are 3 words i can only say about her and that is FUCK THE NURSE. She is way to over powered but after a while you can escape her preety easily but it does take time. Being the killer for me is quite fun but can be really hard and sometimes boring but chasing someone is always.

Las viciadas que tuve fueron enormes, dias y dias sin poder parar de pensar en levear, pero.. cuando faltaba contenido decidí cambiar de juego. Tras bastantes meses decidí volverlo a jugar, y descubrí sus puntos fuertes y débiles. Sus puntos fuertes es que el juego es genial, está muy bien hecho aunque tiene algunos bugs que te hace pensar si revisan y mejoran el juego. Añadieron nuevas dinámicas como es lo de golpear motores, cambiar los ganchos, nuevos mapas y ahora un superviviente sin DLCs. Un antiguo punto fuerte de este juego es la búsqueda de partidas, que ahora es horrible. Me he tenidp que cambiar a otra región de descargas solamente para poder jugar. En partidas de un jugador, es decir: tú solo, encuentra relativamente rápido, pero con amigos es horrible... puedes estar 30 minutos para una partida que luego dispone de un host horrible, espero que esto lo vayan arreglando ya que no me parece normal y es posible que sea lo que me haga dejar de jugar este juego.

Rem. when you were a kid and you're afraid of watching horror movies with lots of blood and gore in it? Well,this is exactly what this game has to offer. When i first saw this game i was skeptical of buying it. Most of my friends told me that it's quite fun. So, i tried it and to tell you frankly after playing 3 straight hours of it i felt like i was a kid again running away from monsters and creepy crawly things that i was afraid of. So much adrenaline rush in this game and my heart is beating so fast. I felt like i was really inside of the game itself. Pros: good gamepplay,nice maps except for that asylum new map it's a bit bright imo. Killer can see you anywhere with his FOV. Great addition of the new killer which is the nurse which i think is that the devs got the idea of her from the previous silent hill games. As for me it's an awesome game that needs more polishing. Cons: Needs to have at least a dedicated or an official server so that people won't get lag spikes due to the host's location,matchmaking is really bad and it is clearly evident that there are still lots of bugs around within the game itself. Overall, I would recommend this game to a friend and maybe for those who are looking for some different type of gameplay there that can make your hearts go out. Well go and have it a try.Run and hide as long as you can :D \n\n8.5/10 cheers XD","timestamp_created":1471976266,"timestamp_updated":1471976718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619883060455322266","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25095880","author":{"steamid":"76561198239613182","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":183420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1495,"last_played":1607004346},"language":"german","review":"Ein sehr geiles Game ;)","timestamp_created":1471975894,"timestamp_updated":1471975894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550893843173980713","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25095406","author":{"steamid":"76561198139135464","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1560611068},"language":"english","review":"nice game especially to play with your friends!","timestamp_created":1471974657,"timestamp_updated":1471974657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25095379","author":{"steamid":"76561198140048918","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":22469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1474,"last_played":1642545772},"language":"russian","review":"Игоа безусловно хороша, несмотря на больше колиество количество багов.
