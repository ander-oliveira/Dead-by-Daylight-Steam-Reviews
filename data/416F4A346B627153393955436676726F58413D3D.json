Я помню, когда  впервые в неё попробовал поиграть это был просто лютый пиздец, я люто обосрался  , увидев маньяка, он взялся не откуда, короче маньяк-невидимка , я его с того самого момента ненавижу всем сердцем , даже когда захожу в лобби и после начинаю играть  и слышу этот звук,того маньяка , я понимаю, что мне пиздец.\nКстати, по поводу лобби , если днём играть , то хуй подключишься , если вечером ну или же ночью играть , тогда нормально  всё будет;  не могу точно так говорить, потому что у кого-то  может все нормально быть с поиском лобби, но лично у меня вот как.\nВ игре есть несколько видов карт, точно не помню сколько, где-то 3 вроде. Так же игрок может выбрать за кого ему играть, за маньяка или же за выжившего .Присутствуют 3 вида маньяка: невидемый (Банши) , сутулый (Хиллбилли), и такой-качок (Траппер), каждый из этих маньяков по своему особенный . Есть ещё 4-ро выживших, не знаю что про них сказать, в общем две бабы и два мужика. \nЦель игры за выживших запустить определённое число генераторов и выбраться , а если игра за маньяка , сами понимаете - не дать уйти выжившим, убить нах**!!!\nТак же  есть система уровней и рангов, ещё присутствуют перки, помогающие вам что-либо лучше делать в игре. Дальше сами поймёте что и как делать.\nМожно поиграть вместе с друзьями , поугарать, с друзьями на самом деле веселее играть, чем одному, но есть один большой минус играя с друзьями ,вы не можете прокачиваться , ни ранг , ни уровень , ничего! Но в игре больше плюсов , чем минусов.\nВ общем рекомендую вам попробовать в неё поиграть)))","timestamp_created":1468640333,"timestamp_updated":1487971414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606953024864196777","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24346107","author":{"steamid":"76561198003477209","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":111010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65900,"last_played":1659074080},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and addictive...","timestamp_created":1468638992,"timestamp_updated":1542833470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24346061","author":{"steamid":"76561198037411974","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1468639238},"language":"english","review":"If you can't make a game with the ability to match you with similarly skilled players, don't make it multiplayer","timestamp_created":1468638734,"timestamp_updated":1468638734,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473988443613052368","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24345948","author":{"steamid":"76561198107618372","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1607600845},"language":"koreana","review":"good","timestamp_created":1468638154,"timestamp_updated":1468638154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24345832","author":{"steamid":"76561198197576795","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3152,"last_played":1641020085},"language":"thai","review":"เอาจริงๆนะดีมากเลย เล่น24ชั่วโมงเลย555\nให้ 9/10นะ\nเพราะที่หักหนึ่งคะแนน\nเพราะว่ามันชอบบัคง่าา\nXD :)","timestamp_created":1468637683,"timestamp_updated":1468637683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24345813","author":{"steamid":"76561198247930672","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":30873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1178,"last_played":1650075606},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom , vamos começar , mas lebrece esse jogo nao esta em fase final\n(TERA UM MONTE DE BUGS)\nmas ok,a versao de hoje podemos jogar comos amigos , como 1 amigo assasino e o resto dos amigos sobreviventes\nou 2 a 4 amigos se coperando, entao se sua intensao é comprar para joga com um amigo , compre .\nEssas verçoes antigas  há muitos bugs , desde falhar a encontrar a patida , lag , ou visitar o limbo no menu principal\nMas até você ver essa analise a situaçao mudou ( Hoje é dia 15/07/2016 se você quer saber ) \n\naté hoje tem 4 sobreviventes que você pode selecionar e 3 montros para matar seus amigos ou desconhecidos\n\nO jogo é simples TEM 2 TIMES HUMANOS e MONSTRO \nsendo que ha 4 humanos e 1 monstro\nHumanos tem que escapar ligando geradores e monstro tem que capturalos e colocar em ganchos \nhumanos podem se Coperar\n\nentao a Conclusao é = VALE A PENA","timestamp_created":1468637620,"timestamp_updated":1468637620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470887869596481323","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24345657","author":{"steamid":"76561198097729222","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":51459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51459,"last_played":1543714845},"language":"english","review":"Gamebad","timestamp_created":1468636814,"timestamp_updated":1586031602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24345617","author":{"steamid":"76561198173220473","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":6100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2072,"last_played":1503618242},"language":"english","review":"Let me tell you a story of a survivor.

OK here is why:\n\nCONS: \n- Repetitive (as hell) game design and everything in it - every map has the same feeling, goal and atmosphere (it's fun for 2 rounds) --- I was looking forward to run through beautifly designed levels like some cabins / cottage with forests around, and LAKE omg, the typical horror scenery... no, I got repetitive piles of walls and crap and few trees like I wanna play Paintball or what?!!...\n- Customization option is useless - you cannot change anything on your Hunter character at all (NOT EVEN weapon or overall look). With survivors, you can change 2 (!!!) damn kind of jeans and 1(!!!!!!) mustache (really, in 2016?!) WOW! \n- Overall graphics is not bad, but animations and physics looks like 2000's - feels awfuly skeletal the whole movement system\n- Leveling system is not enough motivating \n- Matchmaking is useless (you get 20-30 lvl oponent while you're 4) and it's even not functional most of the time.

But let me expand on that.\n\nThis game is overall fantastic. It has a great concept and its mechanics are pretty good. The audio brings suspence and the models of the characters are amazing. \n\nHowever the issues are the glitches/servers.\n\nAs of late with alot of maintenence to add party mode (Essentially you have to luck out on connecting with friends, you can't invite them without it being a private match) this game has become unplayable (unless you're lucky enough to get into a match). Now don't be disheartened by this. The developers are constantly giving updates which is a good, and majority of the time this game is functional. I would personally suggest buying this either when its on special or a week or two from now. \n\nOverall I give this game a solid 8/10.\nIt does bring the horror element without it being completely scary depending on your play style. \nFor myself I usually pop out brick when playing horror games, except for this game which still keeps me on the edge of my seat, allows me to actually enjoy the horror aspect of it. \n\nHopefully this review has helped :)","timestamp_created":1468590597,"timestamp_updated":1468590597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24334238","author":{"steamid":"76561198254931145","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1471382764},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾游戏毁我青春耗我钱财","timestamp_created":1468590526,"timestamp_updated":1468590526,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24334083","author":{"steamid":"76561198096272100","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":740,"last_played":1641185336},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是好游戏，但是没有汉化，至少目前没有，新手在里面前期很难存活，但是随着等级提高，可玩性变得更多。总体来说是个不错的游戏。","timestamp_created":1468589761,"timestamp_updated":1468589761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493150651454925537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24333864","author":{"steamid":"76561198113639223","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5566,"last_played":1486545900},"language":"schinese","review":"建议制作商出一个中文补丁，毕竟国内也有很多小伙伴一起玩毕竟不是所有有人都懂得英文","timestamp_created":1468588902,"timestamp_updated":1468588902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24333779","author":{"steamid":"76561198154014032","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1472222048},"language":"schinese","review":"老是有人来俺农场偷电！","timestamp_created":1468588485,"timestamp_updated":1468588485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24333664","author":{"steamid":"76561198003032494","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1586553861},"language":"russian","review":"Кароче игра збс, побегал от бухих хозяев огорода,правда они чрезчур огресивны,поэтому зачастую убивали,единственный минус что у них есть 6 чувство.А так игра заебись!","timestamp_created":1468587935,"timestamp_updated":1468587935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24333579","author":{"steamid":"76561198111987896","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1699,"last_played":1563376071},"language":"german","review":"Wirklich sehr gutes Spiel, vorallem für Leute die Nervenkitzel mögen ;D! \nIm Prinzip ist es auch wirklich gut gemacht mit den 4 Überlebenden und einem Killer, obwohl es hier und da noch ein paar kleine Bugs gibt.","timestamp_created":1468587619,"timestamp_updated":1468587619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24333448","author":{"steamid":"76561197998808912","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1468587123},"language":"english","review":"Horribly imbalanced toward the killer.

игры 4 против 1. Если кратко: четыре человека со своими особыми способностями, попавшие по различным стечениям обстоятельств в некое, никому из них неизвестное, пугающее место и должны сплотиться с целью приложить все усилия для включения неких генераторов (двигателей) что бы дать достаточное количество электричества  для открытия ворот к спасению.\nОднако, все не так просто. Спустя пару, а может и меньше минут они замечают пятого участника. Странное ощущение...сердце начинает настараживающе биться. Что происходит?! Он приближается и напряжение лишь нарастает. От страха выживающие бегут в разные стороны и, казалось бы от командного духа не осталось ни следа.. один из бегущих попадает в медвежий капкан и крик разносится во все стороны. Может быть кто-нибудь ему поможет?! Но нет. Все лишь беспокоятся о своих шкурах. \nТот самый \"пятый\" неспешно подходит к жертве, попавшейся в ловушку, стонущей от невыносимой боли. В залитых кровью от боли глазах виден ужас и отражение массивной фигуры, которая наклоняется и всбрасывает попавшегося на плечо. \nВ голове кроме боли появляется мысль:\"Почему он меня не убил? Куда он меня несет?!\". \nЧерез несколько мгновений остальные сбежавшие слышат пронзительный крик, который вынуждает их бежать еще дальше. \nНо лишь спустя некоторое время они понимают что они попали в западню из которой нет выхода. Механические ворота - закрыты. Вокруг лишь стены и странные столбы, с которых свисают окровавленные крюки.\nПочти отчаявшись один из них видет какое-то механическое устройство похожее на двигатель... попытка включить устройство. Неудача. Необходимо починить. \nКак только неполадка была устранена, загорелся свет. Теперь все поняли, что необходимо найти другие и включить их. Возможно чем-то это поможет...\nСобственно, возможно я смог донести до вас смысл этой игры, которая восхитила меня своей атмосферностью и, взаправду, смогла меня напугать. \nЕсть некоторые недостатки, такие как: выбрасывает из лобби при создании игры, иногда пропадают текстуры.
