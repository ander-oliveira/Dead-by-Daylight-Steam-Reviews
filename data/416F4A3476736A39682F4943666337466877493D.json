play something else for a week. Try Civilization or something,\"[/h1]\n-Mathieu Cote, Game Director of BHVR\n\nI have a lot of hours on this miserable excuse for a game. This doesn't include my hours on PS4 when I first started. The reason I switched from PS4 to PC was in hopes of a better experience from all the bugs and lag that I had on there. Spoiler alert: PC is only mildly better in those regards, at least when I switched and from what I hear, console has only gotten worse since I left the platform. Oh, and all the DLC and progress I had on PS4 is [i]still[/i], as of October 2021, locked there with zero signs of cross progression despite other games providing it between console and PC. This is inexcusable with the amount of money they make. This is simply to force players who are trying to escape the shit show that is console into re-buying all their DLC, cosmetics, progress etc. \n\nLet me make this extremely clear: [b]BHVR do not care about the community.[/b] I've been playing since the Stranger Things DLC came out and I have only seen a rapid decline with this game. They remedy one thing, take one step forward, and fuck up about 8 other things, taking 20 steps back. They. Do not. Care. All they want is your money. \n\nThe only time this \"game\" is ever fun is when you're just messing around as survivor with friends. If you try to escape, take it seriously, play on your own, play killer you will simply not have fun. This game is broken, unbalanced on both sides, laggy- And I haven't even begun to talk about the community which they refuse to comment on. \"It's like a drug. When you have a good game and good times with your pals, it's great. When no one is toxic in a game and there are no bugs and you're on a good balanced map, it's fantastic. I wish every game could be like that.\" Is something I wrote in the original version of this review and I'd like to take it back because you never get a good game. It never happens. And you keep playing hoping for that one super fun great game. But it never comes. It will never come. Don't buy this game. Don't convince your friends to get this game.\n\nThis game's community is quite honestly a cancer. It is rancid, no one cares about anyone else, all they do is camp, t-bag, flash light click, tunnel- Honestly the real challenge is finding someone in this game that isn't a complete dickhole. It's nothing short of a disgrace. Both \"sides\" are full of nasty little pigs and it's a miracle if you find anyone playing respectfully. And even if you play respectfully yourself, you'll still get fucking end game chat bullshit. I don't even know why they have end game chat on PC- All it is is a breeding ground for toxic behaviour, console players don't have it so why do we? It should honestly be disabled across all platforms or at the very least be something you can manually turn off yourself. I even find myself being toxic in response to toxicity. It's not the kind of person I want to be but BHVR doesn't care and doesn't want to make a move to make this a better community. They like it like this apparently. To them, this is fine. Camping, T-bagging etc. None of that is punishable. \n\nI said in my previous review how I wish I could go back to the innocent days when I first started, trying to figure things out and just having a good time. But unfortunately I can never go back to that. And BHVR is a company that doesn't want this game to thrive apparently. Every new DLC they shit out is broken on release [i]despite[/i] having Public Test Builds where they, you know, have people test it and tell them when shit's not working. But do they listen? Ha. Haha. No. Usually they ignore any problems and change things no one asked to change. \n\nOh and their latest travesty is being supportive of NFTs and selling them. As if this company couldn't be any more of a sick joke, they sold the Pinhead model from their Hellraiser chapter to some shitty bitcoin scam to be sold as ugly little jpegs that people can pretend they own for thousands of dollars at the expense of crippling the environment even further.\n\n[u]BHVR, the company behind Dead by Daylight, does not care about you.[/u]\n","timestamp_created":1589437317,"timestamp_updated":1634617540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69103556","author":{"steamid":"76561198254358298","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2112,"last_played":1658621148},"language":"english","review":"ez","timestamp_created":1589437224,"timestamp_updated":1589437224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69103496","author":{"steamid":"76561198938918245","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":210,"playtime_at_review":2619,"last_played":1659538208},"language":"russian","review":"норм","timestamp_created":1589437113,"timestamp_updated":1589437113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69103397","author":{"steamid":"76561198884021347","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":10676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3598,"last_played":1650586349},"language":"brazilian","review":"recomendo

jogo foi a primeira e única merda que aconteceu na minha vida inteira e ainda continua sendo um lixo de qualquer forma, senta que lá vem história e vai ser longa.\n\nSe tu nunca ouviu falar desse jogo ou tem vontade de jogar mas não comprou ainda, meu amigo, não vale os mínimos 33 reais gastos nessa bosta de jogo e muito menos nas DLCs. (Quando eu digo que não vale comprar a DLC, explicarei melhor logo logo...)\n\nÉ tanta coisa nesse jogo que não nem como explicar em uma resumo só, por tanta experiência que tive nesse jogo, e não foram poucas, tanto que fiz bastante conquista e dependi minhas horas de vida nessa porcaria.\n\n[h1]Gráfico[/h1]\n\nO próprio jogo em si tanto no baixo ou no gráfico não mudam praticamente merda nenhuma, única coisa que deixa são o ambiente mais escuro ao invés de ficar mais claro, como fica nos gráficos no baixo. Parece que uma criança de 13 anos começou a aprender a modelar no blender e falhar miseravelmente por ser um bosta total na vida como é o meu caso. O jogo no baixo não tem nada de especial entre a qualidade no máximo, isso eu te garanto com tanta certeza no mundo.\n\nE ah, quer deixar o jogo no low para melhorar fps? Esquece amigo, por isso não vai existir nesse jogo em qualquer maneira, é melhor mexer no próprio arquivo do jogo e tu mesmo criar uma própria configuração do que esperar do que um dos devs façam algo a respeito sobre o desempenho do jogo.\n\nVocê pode morrer em ter um computador foda que o jogo vai ser um lixo de qualquer maneira, sem contar os travamentos do nada quando tu carrega ou que um jogador desconecta na hora do carregamento, isso é uma história para outra parte da \"resenha\".\n\n[h1]Hitbox[/h1]\n\nMaluco isso nem se fala sinceramente, se tu acha que Dead By Daylight vai ter uma hitbox boa? Ai que se engana amigo, quando tu vai estar em chace com um killer ele vai te acertar a 218921894214891289298 km de distância de você com um Killer lagado pra desgraça que vem jogar no seu servidor que mora na Argentina ou nos Estados Unidos, como é de muitos killers por ai mesmo tendo uma conexão boa entre os servidores \"Brasileiros\".\n\nComo é o caso do Fred que a hitbox dele demorou muito para ser arrumada em muitos patchs e nunca ser ouvido pela comunidade do jogo, e ainda ficou pior do que estava antes. \n\n[h1]Anticheat[/h1]\n\nAnticheat pago pelo baixaki de foi colocado no jogo, uma forma tão merda para conseguir burlar o jogo é esse Anticheat, que é tão fácil conseguir hackear que até um recem-nascido consegue hackear e conseguir colocar mais bloodpoints ou colocar prestigio nos seus personagens sem nenhum problema algum ou até mesmo tomar algum banimento sobre o que aconteceu, porque os devs do jogo tão nem ai pra tí se tu tiver pretigio com todos os personagens ou ter todos os personagens, skins, items e oferendas da forma mais filha da puta possível.\n\nSabe quando eu disse que não vale a pena comprar as DLCs do jogo? Procura por Fiddler Everywhare no Google e depois me diga o que achou ao invés de gastar 1 real com esse jogo patético.\n\n[h1]Servidores[/h1]\n\nSe você gosta de jogo com pessoas de fora a mais de 500 ms, o jogo é perfeito para aqueles que querem testar sua paciência, tendo em vista os jogadores boludos do jogo e pessoas de console que consomem 99% dos servidores lotando o jogo inteiro e arruinando o seu jogo todos os dias e fazendo você se fuder em uma partida com 0 geradores feitos e com todo mundo no hook com menos de 5 minutos de partida. Máquinas perfeitas feitas pela Behavior que sempre está para melhorar o jogo.\n(ironia)\n\n[h1]Balanciamento[/h1]\n\nEssa é a parte mais divertida desse jogo, se você é um killer novo no jogo que comprou o jogo recentemente ou que comprou mais nunca jogou, pode tirar o cavalo da chuva porque esse jogo não existe balanciamento para nenhum desses times, se um dos seus amigos do outra lado da tela tiver um rank vermelhinho se quer, sem precisar ter um rank exato você já vai estar na cova amigo. Se prepare para tomar milhões de stuns de pallets, teabags e piscadinhas de flash para fazer o seu neuronio parar de funcionar.\nConseguir derrubar alguém? Parabéns amigos, MAS CALMA LÁ! O amigo vermelhinho do outro time esta indo na sua direção, o que fazer?\n\n- Se fuder porque não tem o que fazer, porque o cara fez um flashlight save\n- Tentar esqu---... \n\nDeixa quieto, porque não tem o que fazer, porque o amigo vermelhinho lá em frente ao ranks 20 e 15 estão lá para ajuda-los no que for preciso sem precisar de muito esforço, são esses leveis que quando jogam sozinhos apanham diariamente. Mas é culpa deles? Não.\n\nQuer jogar sozinho junto com 3 survivors? É um plano horrível, jogue sempre com amigos porque sempre vai ter um vai trolar a partida, não um, mas o time inteiro pra trollar a partida toda, usando self-care, fazendo flashlights de merda tentando cegar toda hora e correndo pelo mapa fazendo totem e nenhum gerador porque só querem bloodpoints e não saber de ganhar uma partida.\n\n[h1]Considerações finais[/h1]\n\nSe tu quiser fazer com que o seus neurônios queimem todos os dias e que crie rugas de tristeza e raiva antes dos 20, esse é o seu lugar. \n\nParabéns Behavior por fazer um ideia tão merda virar realidade, são pessoas como vocês que fazem esse mundo ser o que é hoje em dia, tendo desenvolvedores merdas que não ligam para a comunidade e trazendo lixo todos os dias para o mesmo jogo todos os meses e dias.","timestamp_created":1589428993,"timestamp_updated":1623817420,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549549520015716553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69099294","author":{"steamid":"76561198171163459","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":65435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":749,"playtime_at_review":40068,"last_played":1660569294},"language":"thai","review":"เกมดีคับพี่น้อง","timestamp_created":1589428684,"timestamp_updated":1589428684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69099227","author":{"steamid":"76561198990697745","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":96888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24591,"last_played":1653239482},"language":"english","review":"amazing

O problema principal não é nem o balanceamento como muitos dizem, visto que na maioria das partidas o resultado sempre é equilibrado: 2 sobreviventes morrem, e 2 sobrevivem. Há um fator \"sorte\" dentro e fora do jogo: o primeiro é que sobreviventes podem aumentar suas chances de sucesso ao realizarem testes de perícia ou escapar de ganchos/armadilhas utilizando oferendas e perks. O segundo é que em cada partida, além de você nascer sempre em locais diferentes, o mapa é escolhido aleatoriamente (exceto se utilizar alguma oferenda pra aumentar a chance de ir para outro mapa, mas mesmo assim ainda é aleatório, e existem mapas mais vantajosos que outros pra cada killer), com posições de geradores, ganchos, pallets e porão sempre alteradas, ou seja, nunca vai existir uma partida igual a outra, mesmo que seja em um mesmo mapa. O maior problema desse jogo, na minha opinião é a comunidade, que em sua maioria quer inventar regras de como ou não se deve jogar, criando um ambiente tóxico e frustrando a jogatina, principalmente pra quem joga de assassino, onde não importa a estratégia que você utilize, você sempre será xingado no final de uma partida. O sistema de Ranks não é nem um pouco intuitivo, pois não existe recompensas pra quem se mantém no topo, e também há um problema no matchmaking, onde pessoas de ranks baixos acabam caindo contra ranks altos, o que acaba sendo injusto e arruinando a experiência. Em geral, o jogo tem muito a ser melhorado ainda, mas é um ótimo game para ser jogado sem competitividade, pois se for levar a sério, você vai passar muita raiva.","timestamp_created":1589407078,"timestamp_updated":1589407078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578846156597137451","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69087114","author":{"steamid":"76561198838275478","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":487,"last_played":1589591675},"language":"schinese","review":"it vevr good\n","timestamp_created":1589406811,"timestamp_updated":1589406811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69086875","author":{"steamid":"76561199020928520","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1652656163},"language":"brazilian","review":"delicia de joga, fugir do killer e explodi o mic na call com os amigos.","timestamp_created":1589406417,"timestamp_updated":1589406417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69086738","author":{"steamid":"76561199016795865","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":27114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":163,"playtime_at_review":3440,"last_played":1660472744},"language":"spanish","review":":¨d","timestamp_created":1589406213,"timestamp_updated":1589406213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69086445","author":{"steamid":"76561198120211680","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":6421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2752,"last_played":1633988848},"language":"latam","review":"Soy alto manco","timestamp_created":1589405697,"timestamp_updated":1589405697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vsj9h/ICfc7FhwI="}
