Its not for the faint of heart either. When starting out you'll deff have a sense of being scared which is good! After you put in so many hours into the game you'll get over the fear factor which you might think is a pro but personally is a con since it takes away a feeling for the game. I'm mainly a survivor main with probably 90% of my total hours being a human rather than kill/monster. So this review will be somewhat survivor sided. You'll enjoy playing waaaay more when playing and communicating with friends whether you guys are having a good time or sweating ya'll butts off. With so many perks and combo you can play with there's really no limitations. Learning how different killers play and how to counter act them plus New maps and variants to discover. Items play a huge roll imo since it allows survivors to have extra abilities that may or may not give the killer a few trips along the way. Of course with pro's there are the con's where Killers will tunnel and camp survivors making it miserable. Having MMR (skill based match making) was a huge turn off and probably what is causing the game to slowly die sadly. With so many survivors playing and not enough killers you'll be expecting a \"decently\" timed search for a match, but never the less its still worth playing. Always play with friends / LFG over searching for match solo since 80% the time you solo Q there players are aids and will not be helpful to you. Recommend finding the Dead By Daylight discord and you should be able to find ppl to group up there to have a much more enjoyable time.","timestamp_created":1647283499,"timestamp_updated":1647283499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112185863","author":{"steamid":"76561198869215415","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":365,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1660509507},"language":"hungarian","review":"Jö és hanguilatos játék azoknak akik szeretnek csapatban dolgozni vagy egyénenként kihivásokat keresnek","timestamp_created":1647283243,"timestamp_updated":1647283243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112185433","author":{"steamid":"76561198310942508","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1648904651},"language":"german","review":"Is nice","timestamp_created":1647282653,"timestamp_updated":1647282653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112185170","author":{"steamid":"76561198884905928","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":40715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":772,"playtime_at_review":26305,"last_played":1660602478},"language":"spanish","review":"queso","timestamp_created":1647282329,"timestamp_updated":1647282329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112185085","author":{"steamid":"76561198376021668","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"playtime_at_review":16689,"last_played":1660596027},"language":"brazilian","review":"pallet 👍","timestamp_created":1647282236,"timestamp_updated":1647282236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112184567","author":{"steamid":"76561198848121593","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":36171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":804,"playtime_at_review":32624,"last_played":1660587815},"language":"english","review":"Needs to add sex.

can only start to explain why I don't think Dead by Daylight isn't a good game to buy. \n\nLet's start with the basics. Starbreeze Studios made Dead by Daylight and released it on June 14th, 2016. For a little more than 2 years, they continued to update the game, and improve it. For a reason that I do not know, Starbreeze Studios sold Dead by Daylight to BHVR(Behavior Entertainment) for roughly 16 million dollars. Starbreeze Studios made an amazing game, and I love Starbreeze Studios. Other games that they have made are quite successful and I recommend you check them out. BHVR got handed an amazing game, and that is the only reason that Dead by Daylight is successful. \n\nGod, I don't even know where to start. \nI know I've looked at reviews that have called the game devs bad, and been like, \"Damn, the devs aren't great, but at least the game itself looks okay, even if they're not updating or supporting it, it might still be fun.\" And a lot of times that might be the case. But not this time. BHVR is still updating their game, but they aren't doing it well. Now and then they'll make some good updates, but those updates typically come with more problems. Here are a couple of times(trust me there are more than I can put on this list) that BHVR has fucked up and done nothing about it for months, years, or even to this day. \n\nIn Dead by Daylight, there are an unreasonable amount of cheaters. Most players run into an obvious cheater 3 or 4 times a day if they play enough. Cheaters can make the game go on forever, making it so you have to disconnect or just leave the game open and not play it. Disconnecting, of course, comes with a penalty, because how dare you dc against a cheater who isn't letting you play. Cheaters can teleport, fly, change health states, have infinite perks, you name it. BHVR has done NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL to combat cheaters. They have 1 anti-cheat that they use. EAC(Easy Anti-Cheat). This anti-cheat blocks players from getting into the game while they have hacks on, but there are so many keys and loopholes that hackers have found and as of now EAC isn't stopping ANYONE from hacking. On top of all of this, a little bit ago Dead by Daylight had a DOXXING problem, yes, DOXXING. Hackers were able to find your IP and address with the click of a button. This lasted for months, and you know what BHVR did? nothing. They fixed it after about a month(which is an unreasonably long time for such a serious issue), and they never tweeted, posted, warned, or even acknowledged the issue. Many players were playing during that time unaware that their addresses could easily be leaked.\nOn top of all of this, Dead by Daylight, around a year ago from when I'm posting this, made the game free on the epic games store. This let cheaters make an unlimited amount of accounts, so they can get banned upwards of a thousand times and still be able to play for free. BHVR is also selling accounts cheaper in other countries, to raise profits, letting hackers buy cheap accounts whenever they want. \n\nPoint 2: BHVR doesn't care about you. They don't care about me, or even the people who earn them tons of money by making content about the game. What they care about is money. They release more skins than updates and only care about profit. \n\nAnother point is about the MMR system that BHVR uses. To put it frankly, it doesn't work. If you'd like to know more about the MMR system, please click [url=https://youtu.be/yU0_axvQ0Ew]here[/url].\n\nThis point is less about the devs, although they can certainly be blamed for this too. The game is very toxic. There are a lot of people who are very, very, VERY toxic. You have been warned. \n\nNow, if you read all of that, and still are thinking about buying the game, I'll explain the game to you the best I can. If this doesn't answer all of your questions, I encourage you to go watch a YouTuber/Twitch streamer named Otzdarva. He is a very kind soul and has made many tutorials about the game. \n\nDBD is an asymmetrical horror game. The game isn't scary at all, so if you're truly looking for a scary game, click off of this page. This game is not scary, or a horror game.\nThere are 4 survivors and one killer. The killer's goal is to kill all of the survivors by hitting them, knocking them down, and putting them on hooks. A survivor's goal is to escape. They do this by powering on 5 out of 7 generators on the map, and then opening up an exit gate and leaving. When a survivor is hooked, another survivor must come to the hook and pull them off of it, getting them back into the game. A generator takes 80 seconds to complete when you're working by yourself, but multiple survivors working on a generator at the same time speeds up the process. If the killer finds a survivor and decides to \"chase\" them, a survivor's only hope is to run. There are walls, windows, and pallets, designed to give survivors an edge against killers. Survivors can vault windows much faster than killers, and they can drop pallets on killer's heads to stun them, making distance and time for them to run away.  \nThere are 27 killers in the game, as of the Onryo being released. Each killer has their own killer power, to help them kill survivors. here are very basic explanations of them. \nThe Trapper can place down traps to hurt survivors that step in them.\nThe Wraith can turn invisible to sneak up on survivors. \nThe Hillbilly can use his chainsaw to dash across the map, and down survivors in one hit. \nThe Nurse can teleport through walls and other objects. \nThe Shape(Micheal Myers) can stalk the survivors to grow his power. \nThe Hag can place down traps that she can teleport to should a survivor step on them.\nThe Doctor can blast survivors with electricity, driving them insane. \nThe Huntress can throw hatchets at survivors, injuring them from range. \nThe Cannibal(Bubba Sawyer) can use his chainsaw to down survivors in one hit. \nThe Nightmare(Freddy Kreuger) can send survivors to the dream realm where he's more effective.\nThe Pig(Amanda Young) can place reverse bear traps on survivors' heads, giving them another death to worry about.\nThe Clown can slow survivors down by hitting them with bottles filled with toxic gas.\nThe Spirit can phase in and out of existence, surprising and confusing survivors.\nThe Legion can go into a frenzy, hitting survivors rapidly and moving faster.\nThe Plague can infect survivors, giving them no way of healing.\nThe Ghost Face(Danny Johnson) can stalk survivors, leaving them exposed and easy to target.\nThe Demogorgon can attack survivors with a longer lunge, and teleport to previously placed portals. \nThe Oni can use the blood of the survivors to enter a blood frenzy, increasing his power for a short time.\nThe Deathslinger can use a harpoon gun to shoot and reel in survivors.\nThe Executioner(Pyramid Head) can use trails of torment to make killing survivors easier.\nThe Blight can dash, moving rapidly and bouncing off of objects.\nThe Twins can release a small child named victor, who can track and attack survivors. \nThe Trickster can throw knives at survivors, injuring them from a range.\nThe Nemesis(Nemesis T-Type) can infect survivors and use a tentacle whip to injure them.\nThe Cenobite(Pinhead) can attach chains to survivors to slow them.\nThe Artist can create and send crows flying across the map to try to hit survivors\nThe Onryo(Sadako Yamamura) can phase in and out of existence, and teleport to TVs scattered across the map to give the survivors another threat.\n\nThere are also many different survivors, but none of them have powers or are different in any important way. \n\nSurvivors and Killers can also bring perks into the game. There are a total of 197 perks in the game, and I won't explain them all. Please look at Otzdarva's youtube for explanations. \n\nYou can play with friends in a group of up to 4, but only on survivor. Killer is a solo experience.\n\nWhether you choose to buy the game or not, I wish you the best of luck!\n\nSee you in, or out of, the fog. <3","timestamp_created":1647265465,"timestamp_updated":1647265465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546479463577270508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112171624","author":{"steamid":"76561198965260426","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3528,"last_played":1647390560},"language":"english","review":"Good for a night with the boys or a chill solo time.

And obviously not for kid.  There are various character of killers and survivors to choose and also the random map. The graphic is very nice for horror game, sometime it has a bug but it’s okay for the game that didn’t take much space on your computer. I don’t know why it take a long time for random a team and find the room when I play at night, more than playing on the afternoon.\nIt always became a funny game when you play with your friends (full team for 4 survivor and 1killer, or only 4 survivors) because it is the game that need teamwork to win (for survivors). By the way, the thing that make this game very interest is the ending of gameplay. If you play good but you die before winning (run out the map) or can’t kill all of the survivors, you will gain a lot of blood point that use for upgrade your skill of character and buy item. It mean that you don’t have to win in the game to be the real winner, your gameplay will judge that.\nIt has a various character that you can enjoy without paying more to play (but yes, the interest character always have to pay for). But on the Stream, it often have a promotion that you can buy the game in very cheap price from the original price and also the characters that have to pay for playing.\n","timestamp_created":1647262935,"timestamp_updated":1647262935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112170274","author":{"steamid":"76561199238021952","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":39379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3469,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1660569236},"language":"thai","review":"ดี","timestamp_created":1647262559,"timestamp_updated":1647262559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112170165","author":{"steamid":"76561198116901944","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1568,"last_played":1647262174},"language":"english","review":"garbage

Tee killer is not the big bad chasing surivors around while they cower in fear. Infact, the killer bullied and harassed by survivors every step of the way, forced to chase them around a low lying bush and being blinded by a flashlight so bright god would blink. So if your looking for a power fantasty of playing your favorite movie monster, i'd recommend moving on.  If you want a janky (but unique) multiplayer experience, and intend to play VERY casually, it might be worth it on a sale. maybe. \n\n\nOutside of very low rankings,  i would not recommend it at all, with it becoming progressively less fun as you play more and more.\n\n\nThe crux of the issue comes down to two core issues: gameplay aspects that are SO bad that the community came up with unoffical rules, and the nebulous nature of those rules causing rediculous harassment. \n\n1. Both sides have the capability to utterly ruin the game for the other side. A killer can facecamp a survivor, literally staring at them on the hook until they die, with no recourse to rescue that player. If the survivors are winning (which will happen often due to the game being utterly imbalanced if 4 survivors are using discord together), they will farm the killer for points, creating one of the least fun gameplay loops i've ever played. Due to being unable to surrender, you just have to accept the next 10 minutes of your life is gona be shit, or be banned. \n\n2. Some survivors specifically seem to only want a bot player, and will harass you for daring to play the game anywhere outside of their specific rules of how a killer \"should\" play. Did you try to defend the hook from 3 friends swarming it trying to rescue their friend? chase one player too long? use a specific perk that they didnt like?  Hope you like harassment, insults, and possibly death threats, because they will leave every nasty message possible, (including leaving insults in other games screenshots when you block steam comments on your profile)\n\nThe biggest problem of all? it shoulden't be on the players to solve any of these things. Its up the devs to design a game that is fun for both parties, and if players abuse one strategy or another that is utterly unfun to fight against, it needs to be changed. But you wont see that here. Youll see them regurgitate update after update, leaving the game rotten at the core with a nice shiny horror themed coat of paint on top. \n\nTLDR: HARD PASS, particularly for those who want to play killer.
