You can either be a Hunter or the prey and experience the thrill of the hunt on either side and it gives the game a nice vibe and there is a lot to explore and you are having fun either as a survivor or a killer.\n\nAs you play more and more you realize some perks are useless, some are clutch, some are MUST and some are just dirty broken. (i don't blame killers for bringing NOED cause its mostly a must atp)\n\nYou play more. You get better either as a killer or a survivor and start to rank up which just gives you an awesome feeling knowing how you improve and making your own playstyle, having your favourite killers and survivors (even though after a while the difference between survivors is just how they sound and look) and you probably having a lot of fun playing more and more\n\nYou start to get easily frustrated since there is a LOT of times that you feel powerless. You distracted the killer that found you for like 10 minutes before he/she was able to catch you... why there are no gens that are done?! or it took me forever to catch this Meg with Dead Hard and 3000 hours of looping experience just to realize its a survive with friends, the gens are done all of your totems are gone and you just got blinded by her friend making you drop her and she is miles away now teabaging at the exit gates while pointing at you. \n\nThe game can be really fun but feeling hope and powerless is just when you want to dc, uninstall ect especially as a Killer who is suppose to have the power, the control\n\nSoon you realize that its nothing more than a bullying simulator. The Killer is the big silent kid and the survivors are the small loud kids and who is the bully? It depends on the match. If the survivors are working together then they are the typical elementary school bullies who can't do anything to you physically but they throw rocks and mean words at you then run away if you try to beat them up. If they are bad then the killer becomes the big bully that beats up the children. Notice how i say it depends on the survivors? In the very end it only does. With Clutch perks and good comunication the killer has no chance its a 4 on 1 afterall. 2 can easily distract the killer while the other 2 rushes down the gens in the matter of minutes.\n\nOverall the concept of the game is good its amazingly good. Both killers and Survivors are very likeable and loveable their stories are amazing and each could easily make it into a horror movie anytime (not looking at movie killers like Myers ect) but the gameplay is too simple and rely on that very heavily which makes the game VERY difficult to balance. In order to make the game TRULY ballanced the base of the game should be reworked, but no one wants that soooooo..... yeah.\n\nThats All. I do recommend this game just don't blame me if you regret it out of salt.","timestamp_created":1559640813,"timestamp_updated":1559640952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51044237","author":{"steamid":"76561198210378389","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":173146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":561,"playtime_at_review":128982,"last_played":1660585901},"language":"english","review":"Im sorry for all the new players I have encountered","timestamp_created":1559640484,"timestamp_updated":1627436875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51043374","author":{"steamid":"76561198165828512","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":163289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2792,"playtime_at_review":36306,"last_played":1660478594},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel hat mich schon seit der ersten Spielstunde Positiv überrascht.

It was Fun, i met some nice people and i also bought a lot for cosmetics and stuff.\n\nBut the last few updates did the game dirty, it wasn´t fun anymore, the killers get BUFFED and the survivors NERFED. This is not how balancing is working...\n\nThe Map reworks are also VERY very unbalanced: Loobs getting destroyd, some doors are blocked by the new annoying \"pallet-doors\" wich kills you most of the time...\n\nHitboxes ... i dont even want to start with these...  XD\n\nSurvivor-perks: the old and good perk got changed to the bad, the new perk that are coming are mostly bad too -.-\n\nokay okay, my words to this Community and Game: This game used to be fun back in 2016-2019. 2020 began to change the hole game in the negative direction...  Yeah i met some nice people i'm still in contact with, and i am also glad i´ve met them! \nBut i hope for behavior that they fix the game and bring up some old game elements.\n\nI am totally done with this game, aint fun at all and the community is TOXIC as hell, so if you want to have fun and stuff : Look for other games ... please :)","timestamp_created":1559632497,"timestamp_updated":1623411930,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042777","author":{"steamid":"76561198426310098","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2285,"last_played":1644048570},"language":"portuguese","review":"Mt bom pra trollar killers","timestamp_created":1559631423,"timestamp_updated":1559631423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042698","author":{"steamid":"76561198850242022","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":47715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12537,"last_played":1641917879},"language":"turkish","review":"This game is so scary.

I've had this game since release, I just never get time to play it. What I can say, is it has come a long way since its original version. The game itself is about as balanced as it can be, for the atmosphere it is trying to create(4 versus 1 is not an easy game to make, not to mention one where you can freely choose to be the monster as opposed to waiting your turn)\nNaturally there are going to be issues that need to be addressed as the killer/survivor nerf war goes on, and it needs to be expected. For the most part, its relatively fair. I barely get ANY time to play and video games anymore, and I can log in, as a killer, hunt some survivors, get a few kills, (and have a few where a well-coordinated group of survivors destroys me) and I have fun. The biggest issue people are having is with the community. Here's the thing, if you pay these people any mind whatsoever, that's on you. Yes, every time I play, someone pipes up at the end of game chat complaining about some tactic, and every time I laugh about it (There is no such thing as \"hook-camping\". period!). If you choose to sit at the hook and watch the lone survivor you caught die, that's on you, and it is 100 percent okay to play like that....whats *supposed* to happen is the survivors are supposed to use that to their advantage(while your camping, they know your not moving). Most do....of course we're still left with a salty survivor who got killed and is waiting for his 5 seconds at the end of the game to tell you all about it. Ignore that clown. Play the game how you want to play it, and have fun doing it. Look at the community as neat little \"bonus\"(some of it is funny......I had a player tell me \"NoScope huh? more like NO SKILL\" and I almost pee'd myself laughing so hard)","timestamp_created":1559628278,"timestamp_updated":1559628278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51041890","author":{"steamid":"76561198110952929","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":64985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31793,"last_played":1653199111},"language":"english","review":"pipipipopopo","timestamp_created":1559625483,"timestamp_updated":1559625483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475961536169052124","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51041534","author":{"steamid":"76561198833100857","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":34169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2464,"last_played":1655538884},"language":"english","review":"Favourite concept and funniest coop game ever","timestamp_created":1559623153,"timestamp_updated":1559623153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51041287","author":{"steamid":"76561198883802214","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13377,"last_played":1567877793},"language":"russian","review":"Первые 10 часов игра оправдывает жанр хоррор.

Survivors need to repair five out of seven generators on a given map to turn on the two gates, open them, and escape from the killer. The killer WILL FIND YOU, and you must buy time for other survivors to repair generators using pallets, windows, and the power of toxicity. You can play solo with random pubs, or with any amount of friends up to three. Each killer has unique powers to serve the survivors' lives to The Entity\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Attractive art/graphic style that compliments the theme of the game perfectly.\n    [*]Simple but addictive gameplay that has hooked me for over 800 hrs, as you can see\n    [*]Many many maps, with small randomly generated aspects to spice up the gameplay\n    [*]Survivor tools, addons, as well as killer addons also helps give the game more replayability\n    [*]You always have something to work towards. Leveling up characters, getting new perks, prestiging characters, going for steam achievements, this will all last you over 1000 hours if you last that long.\n    [*]Interesting world/lore, top notch killer designs.\n    [*]Developer streams, roadmaps, overall good communication with the devs and consistent updates\n    [*]Start off scaring your pants off, play long enough to experience the fun, more competitive side of the game. There is always room for some casual fun, memes, and shenanigans.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Up To You[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Base Game + All DLC at full price is currently $107. That's a lot of nickle and diming, but it's mostly pretty nice content. [b]You can buy dlc characters in the in-game store, using currency earned by playing the game.[/b]\n    [*]Microtransactions - Cosmetic only. Thing is, darker clothes give a small edge for survivors, but technically you have access to dark clothes from the start, so it's not pay to win. It's optional, can be bought by playing (**A LOT**). Items in the store look good, and you can actually see youself wearing what you buy since survivors are in third person. Killers well... they see their weapon in-game, and the skin in the lobby.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Core gameplay flaws - For more skilled, competitive players,\n    [*]Microtransactions - Cosmetic only. Thing is, darker clothes give a small edge for survivors, but technically you have access to dark clothes from the start, so it's not pay to win. It's optional, can be bought by playing (**A LOT**). Items in the store look good, and you can actually see youself wearing what you buy since survivors are in third person. Killers well... they see their weapon in-game, and the skin in the lobby.\n    [*]Long-ish queue times lasting several minutes. Not always the case, and has improved overtime.\n    [*]Community can be VERY toxic. People in general get upset in this game, they will let you know when they are, and it will be your fault.\n    [*]The developers don't play their game, and when they do they suck at it, and dont understand the higher skilled level of play\n    [*]The previous point leads to bad balancing. For new players, killers can be very difficult to deal with, especially with their \"rank system,\" high-skilled killers purposefully bring themselves into lower-skilled games. This is because high-ranked games are a nightmare for killers. The devs don't know how to balance it, and survivors with enough skill will always survive unless you use the most powerful killers.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\ndbd is a game I have a love-hate relationship with. The gameplay is addictive, the world and lore intriguing, with large amounts of quality content and infinite replayability that makes it one of my favorite games of all time. However, I have personally been plagued by issues that make the game difficult to play, or unplayable, through most of my 800+ hrs, although it seems I am a rare case. On top of possible game-breaking issues (crashing, anti-cheat false-positives), the game has an issue with balancing, which can be difficult in an asymmetrical multiplayer game. The community is very toxic and sometimes it can take a long time to find matches (10+ mins living in US-East) though long queue times are less common these days. But believe me, surviving with friends and killing unfortunate souls is worth it.","timestamp_created":1559528528,"timestamp_updated":1559528528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51023979","author":{"steamid":"76561198042024117","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":34959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17687,"last_played":1636564446},"language":"english","review":"Fun gameplay most of the time, but there are parts that literally just encourage repetitive sprain injury and keyboard/controller damage that the devs and community defend as being acceptable because the INTENTION of the feature is to physically harm you.\n\nOutside of the literally painful gameplay there is the mentally painful matchmaking system which puts players of wildly different rank together, a buggy lobby system unfixed for years, loading screens that crash at least one out of every three matches, outsourced anti-cheating programs so that the devs admit might falsely ban you with no recourse, and absurd amounts of grinding and dedication to unlock perks, followed by absurd amounts of grinding and dedication to RE-unlock the perks potentially on over 10 characters.
