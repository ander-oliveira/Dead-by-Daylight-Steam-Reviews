Every now and then, some funny blunders happen and we all end up dying for doing something stupid.\n\nIf you love a challenge, playing killer definitely offers a good mix of challenging yet rewarding game play in which you can outplay 4 other individuals in their attempt at escaping you.\n\nThe characters are for the most part a joy to look at, though i wish every character felt more unique aside from the cosmetics you can get for them. A traditional class system for the characters or their skills only tied to them like the killers would make for some interesting game play and balancing, but what the game offers currently is totally fine.\n\nOverall, the game is great and i highly recommend, especially if youre a fan of classic horror slasher movies and whatnot.\n\nThe only downside for me is the community.

A continuación describiré los aspectos positivos y negativos:\nLO BUENO:\n-Juego competitivo con sistema de rangos (de 20 a 1) e insignias( son cuatro dependiendo de si juegas como superviviente o asesino), perfecto para aquellos a los que les gusta exigirse a si mismos.\n-Rituales diarios: son \"misiones\" que puedes cumplir para obtener puntos de sangre extra.\n-Personalización de tu personaje. Los desarrolladores dieron ahora más opciones a la personalización con la nueva tienda en donde se pueden comprar cosméticos y personajes con fragmentos irisados o con auricells.\n-Variedad de supervivientes y asesinos así como de mapas, objetos y accesorios.\n-El juego te llena de adrenalina tanto si juegas como superviviente y como asesino. Por ejemplo, cuando vas escapando del asesino, cuando este pasa muy cerca de donde estás escondido y no te ve o cuando estás persiguiendo a un superviviente y solo piensas en atraparlo.\n-Juego en constante actualización con nuevos contenidos.\n-Con respecto a la tienda, los cosméticos y personajes que se pueden adquirir en ella se pueden hacer con fragmentos irisados (se consiguen dependiendo de la duración de cada partida) o con auricells (\"monedas\" que se obtienen comprando con dinero real).\nLO MALO:\n-Hay algunos asesinos camperos. Lo más gracioso es que algunos lo justifican: \"si no quieren que campee no hagan gen rush\", \"si no quieres que campee no me hagas pallet loop\", etc. Puede que en casos excepcionales como en el caso de que te toque jugar contra un supervivente que esté usando hacks esté justificado que lo campees o lo tunelees. Personalmente, considero que campear es una práctica sucia que arruina la experiencia del juego, la partida se torna aburrida.\n-Supervivientes tóxicos que se creen OchiDo y sus amigos, usualmente forman parte de premades. Puedo dividirlos en dos partes: los que perjudican a sus compañeros y los que se \"burlan\" del asesino haciendo tbag. Los primeros harán cualquier cosa para hacerte la partida imposible como hacer ruido a propósito para que el asesino vaya a tu posición, hacerte bodyblock en lugares cerrados o peor aún, cuando el asesino te persigue, etc. Los segundos se pasarán toda la partida fastidiando al asesino y llamando su atención por cualquier medio, por lo general son los que hacen tbag luego de tirar un palé o cuando están en la puerta de salida. \n-Los rage quiters. Son los jugadores que se desconectan de la partida cuando van perdiendo. Como superviviente están los que se desconectan cuando fallaron la prueba del decisive strike o cuando los tumban y saben que ya van en su tercer cuelgue. Como asesino están los que se desconectan cuando no mataron a ningún superviviente, cuando le rompieron sus tótems de maleficio o en cualquier situación que consideren difícil. Mi consejo es que, si vas a desconectarte de la partida, que sea cuando de verdad lo necesites, no cuando te dé una rabieta porque vayas perdiendo.\n-El juego sigue teniendo bugs aunque solo me he topado con uno en todas las veces que jugué, la mayoría de otros bugs los vi en videos o capturas.\n\nEn conclusión, recomiendo Dead by Daylight porque, aunque es un juego desequilibrado (4 vs 1), no deja de ser emocionante y mejor todavía si lo juegas con amigos. A pesar de algunos jugadores que contribuyen a empeorar la experiencia del juego, estos siempre van a existir. Lo que uno debe hacer es aprender a lidiar con ellosy seguir adelante. \n","timestamp_created":1530374218,"timestamp_updated":1530374218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495412856340408325","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43189544","author":{"steamid":"76561198384756928","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":545,"playtime_at_review":3918,"last_played":1659883087},"language":"schinese","review":"有没有大佬告诉一下萌新如果打开的时候显示无法连接在线服务怎么办啊！！！急","timestamp_created":1530371386,"timestamp_updated":1530371386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551724135875701904","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43189456","author":{"steamid":"76561198809538757","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":91510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2196,"playtime_at_review":66800,"last_played":1660494565},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดี =^=","timestamp_created":1530371165,"timestamp_updated":1592850461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43189342","author":{"steamid":"76561198348996244","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":72422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31942,"last_played":1656087014},"language":"english","review":"The game has gotten better over the years.
