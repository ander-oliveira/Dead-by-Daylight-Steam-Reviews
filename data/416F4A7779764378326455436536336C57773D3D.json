The only reason it's released is because we as consumers, have ridiculously low standards.\n\nIf you're okay with the way the game is set up and you're in it with a more...competitive manner in mind, then you'll be disappointed (unless you're lucky) seeing as they're constantly trying to shove unfair advantages down our throats by encouraging us to use addons/offerings every single game, and which ones you get ofcourse is completely random, meaning that the outcome of a game more or less depends on how lucky you were when you opened up your blood tree.\n\nThe fact that you're not even able to  group up with your friends to play online is ridiculous. People who have played it might try to bring up the argument of \"HURR DEY R TRYIN 2 MEK IT FEIR SO SURVIVURS CENT COMMUNICET DURR\", okay, so what you're saying is that they're focusing on fairness between the Survivors and the Killer? Which is then contradicted by the fact that this game relies HEAVILY on how lucky you are with the perks you're able to purchase in the blood tree.\nImagine a team of survivor and just 1 of them having the sprint perk, and the Killer's been unlucky with his blood tree, and he has something like Deerstalker.. Yea no, that one guy, he's gone, don't matter if you on his ass, he gone.\nOor a team of survivors with a perk like \"HURR WE CEN SEE DUH BEAR TREPS WITHIN 2 METUR REDIUS\", while their killer is someone like the Wraith with the crow perk, yea no, they're all fucked. Every single Survivor? Yea, dead. Just dead.\n\n\nI mean... one positive is if you actually have an abundance of friends with this game and at least 3 of them are ready to play 24/7... then yes, by all means, it's only like 20 bucks or something, and you'll probably have a good time.\nIf you DON'T have 50 friends with this game, then skip skip skip, save your money for drugs and alcohol and your next door stripper","timestamp_created":1467612632,"timestamp_updated":1467612632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24071594","author":{"steamid":"76561198108942562","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8039,"last_played":1658525736},"language":"english","review":"SICCKK GAME I LOVE IT  PLS BUY AND SUPPORT THIS STUDIO.

Um im Rang nicht abzusteigen benötigt man mindestens 10.000 Blutpunkte. Diese sind aber einfach erspielt insofern man nicht am anfang der Runde drauf geht.\n\nEin nervenkitzel löst die Musik im Spiel aus die auch mir immer noch Herzflattern bereitet wenn ich kurz davor stehe zu entkommen und alle anderen Tot sind oder wenn ich vom Killer verfolgt werde.\n \nSollte man frisch ins Spiel einsteigen rät sich: Übung macht den Meister. Das ihr am anfang wohl mehr verliert als Gewinnt ist klar. Sich zu Opfern oder geschnappt zu werden ist nicht unbedingt schlimm. Voraussetzung ist das ihr in der Runde bereits genügend Aktionen getätigt habt die euch Punkte einbringen. \n\nMerke also: Auch wenn ich nicht entkomme, kann ich im Rang “aufsteigen” bzw Absteigen da Levensystem 20 (niedrigste)  -> 1 (höchste) .\n\n\nMein Fazit aus dem Game:\nEs eignet sich perfekt für schöne Runden mit Freunden aber auch allein. Ich hatte schon viel spaß dabei den Killer zu trollen oder vor ihm wegzulaufen. Das Spiel bereitet manchmal gut Nervenkitzel und das liebe ich. Dabei stellt Dead by Daylight aber auch Games wie Friday the 13th in den schatten, denn das Spiel ist noch lange nicht so scary wie DBD.\n\nSupport Erfahrungen:\nSehr gut! Solltet ihr ein Problem haben seit ihr da auf jeden fall gut aufgehoben. Die Jungs versuchen alles euch zu helfen.\n\n\nKlare Kaufempfehlung \n","timestamp_created":1467600749,"timestamp_updated":1508804149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24068166","author":{"steamid":"76561198026564492","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":260913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1880,"last_played":1658637246},"language":"spanish","review":"buenisimo,  tanto ser el superviviente o el asesino.","timestamp_created":1467599981,"timestamp_updated":1467599981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24068105","author":{"steamid":"76561198149457803","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":163471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":800,"playtime_at_review":4828,"last_played":1660539823},"language":"english","review":"after the 2.6.0 update a lot has changed in the fog. one of the biggest and most anticipated changes was to the perk \"decisive strike\" which was one of the most unfun perks to ever go against. reworking this perk has been needed since 2016 and it has been strong ever since it came out, however, instead of reworking it into a new fresh and fun perk the decided to gut it and make it not even worth running on fun builds. now the perks requires you to get focused when you get removed from the hook and gives you a free escape if they choose to pick you up during the sixty second window. the issue is that the will more often then not happen in a match and you will just be left on the ground for sixty seconds. I was hoping for the perk to get a rework like alert or calm spirit giving you a nice advantage in some situations while being fun to use. \n\nThe new ranking system isnt for me. it requires you to carry your team as survivor or play super aggressive as killer in order to rank up. in this update you now need to get three emblems iridescent emblems and one bronze, this is asking drastically too much if you are with or against competent survivors. the best way to illustrate this is from the survivor side as survivors have 4 people COMPETING instead of working together in order to rank up. in order to get iridescent lightbringer you need to repair 2.7 generators to get a iridescent emblem, this works out to having to work on generators for about 3.6 minutes of the match. in order to get iridescent unbroken you need to not go down once in the match. to get a iridescent  benevolent you need to get 3 saves and 1 full heal on a survivor, if none of your team goes down you will only get a bronze emblem. last but not least is the evader emblem, to achieve iridescent in this you need to run the killer around for about 3.5 minutes. keep in mind if the killer downs you you will not be able to achieve your iridescent in unbroken. so in total to rank up you will most likely need to: repair 3 generators, run the killer for 4 minutes, save 3 people and do a bit of team healing and then because you probably got down in the chase get a gold-silver in unbroken. the thing that makes this hard is that while going for saves you can not do gens, while being chased you cant do gens, while doing gens you cant go for saves or be chased. while you are working on one of these your team is probably doing gens or getting saves also meaning that you are on a clock to do all of this before your team does.\n\nkiller is also awful right now (i am a nurse main so there will be some bias). instead of being allowed to finish games quick to rank up the killer needs to be able to find a way to slow the game down.  killers also need 3 iridescent and one bronze in order to pip. the first emblem \"gatekeeper\" has you gain points towards it for however long generators are not powered you gain 1 point per second with a multiplier based on how many gens are up (5 = 100, 4 = 80 3 = 60 2 = 45 1 = 35) and you need to get 55 000 points in order to get an iridescent. this emblem however is nice because if you kill everyone without a single generator being done you will get an iridescent regardless, you will most of the time never get this if you are not playing nurse because killers are simply too slow to manage this feat. Devout will give you an iridescent if you kill all 4 survivors, once again this is hard to do unless you are playing a meta killer on the survivors underestimate you. malicious is the worst offender, this emblem gives you 1 point each time you hit a survivor and two points each time they reach a new hook state, you need 36 points in order to get an iridescent. this emblem is difficult because you loose 1 point whenever a survivor heals. meaning you need to get 4 kills and not let them heal in order to score an iridescent. chaser is the last emblem for killer. this one works similar to evader for survivors as it is all about the chase. you need to get 2550 points in order to get an iridescent. points are awarded for fining a survivor (5 points) hitting a survivor (55 points per hit) if a survivor is downed within if seconds of the chase you will gain 90 points, if the chase ends withing 30 you get 60 points, 45 = 50 59 = 40 and over a minute will give you thirty points.  so in a match to pip i need to: not leg one generator be done or grind out the game, get 4 kills, slug and let survivors save to get points toward my chaser emblem and then score a bronze - silver in malicious.\n\nAs much as i agree that the rank system needs to be more challenging i do not agree with needing to compete with teammates you play like there's a gun to my heat as killer. having to run strong builds each game is not fun, what if you want to try and rank up with off meta perks, sometimes as survivor you don't have a choice to rank up. you team will farm saves leaving you with only a bronze benevolent and if you get downed you will loose you iridescent unbroken making a rankup point impossible. what if you have a 4 man voice chat group who rushes your generators meaning you don't get your gatekeeper emblem. overall if you want to get to higher ranks you need to play perfectly and hope your team slacks off or in killer's case, hope that the survivors eat chalk.\n\nalso the new matchmaking system is a joke (45 minute killer ques with people out of your rank) :)","timestamp_created":1467599786,"timestamp_updated":1554008803,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24067964","author":{"steamid":"76561198074260679","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1023,"playtime_at_review":6267,"last_played":1660503127},"language":"english","review":"Good game\n\n\ngot more bugs than gaben's butt crack","timestamp_created":1467599398,"timestamp_updated":1467599398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24067842","author":{"steamid":"76561198027252867","num_games_owned":815,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":15870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7737,"last_played":1610871666},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight, where the points don't matter and bugs are marked as features. \n\nIt is impossible to actually win against a killer if they know what they are doing. I've played plenty of hours on both sides now and it's just way too tuned in their favor. From the burnables to the very core mechanics of the game, inserting the killers as the host of the match ensures they will get hits that are questionable at best in the survivor perspective. The only time anybody lives against a killer who know what they are doing is if the killer allows it or if someone steals hatch (which is also something the killer could block if they want). I love asymmetric games but even the best teams of survivors can't outplay a good killer. Maybe when dedicated servers become a thing and killers can no longer hit through obstacles will there be a chance for the survivors to win because of skill and teamwork rather than just getting lucky or being allowed to leave.\n\nAs much as I love this game and will still play it despite its flaws, I can't recommend it due to the sheer fact that even after all this time that it's been around they still haven't fixed these glaring issues","timestamp_created":1467598938,"timestamp_updated":1569906365,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24067714","author":{"steamid":"76561198168189140","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1817,"last_played":1532241892},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩!!!","timestamp_created":1467598564,"timestamp_updated":1467598564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24067620","author":{"steamid":"76561198112183784","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":57366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":978,"playtime_at_review":32171,"last_played":1660594614},"language":"english","review":"The game is great.

The game was almost perfectly balanced before this patch. Now it's 1 sided as all hell.

They have also done nothing to fix performance and netcode issues. I have a PC that's more that able to run this game at max settings but I am forced to play on all low due to the very unstable FPS. The net code is the classic UE4 bs where there is a HUGE difference between where you are compared to where you are on the killers screen which leads to being hit when your through the window and running 5-10 feet away already aka out of his range of attack but still gets the hit.

I'll be upfront in saying that it still has some problems. At the time of this review, the game was version 1.0.2 so there's still a lot of bugs to be fixed. With that said, nothing I've encountered so far has made the game unplayable. Slow and unbalanced match making is the biggest issue for me at the moment.\n\nSurvivor - Each match is a thriller. The already tense atmosphere tighten when the killer comes in range. After that it's a frantic sprint trying to shake a serial killer off your trail and hide again. Your companions can be helpful and take you off the killer's hook, heal you, or try and lure the killer away. Or they can be dicks and completely ignore you as your life blood waters the corn rows beneath the meat hook you're impaled on. Matches as a survivor are always a rush. The only problem I see so far is that it's extremely hard to rank up as a survivor vs a killer in my experience. \n\nKiller - Take your pick: Bear trapping psycho, stealthy wraith, or sprinting chain saw murderer. They're all fun and have different strategies to hunt down your prey. The less the survivors work together, the easier it is for you to pick them off one by one. Definitely a nice change of pace when you're tired of running for your life and want to do some of the executing. Since you need 4 survivors to 1 killer, it obviously takes longer to queque up. Seems to be easier too, the only time I don't rank up in the match is one when of the survivors disconnects and robs me of the points I'd glean from ruthlessly hunting them down. You can't spell slaughter without laughter after all, and managing to crucify all four players on my sacrificial hooks puts a big old smile on my face. \n\n","timestamp_created":1467593852,"timestamp_updated":1467593852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24066356","author":{"steamid":"76561198065627002","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1471561256},"language":"english","review":"I would totally recommend this game to anyone.

This is the first horror game that is very good at giving me the creeps.\nThe ambience is well made and is sustained for the entire game, both visually and auditory.\n\nThe Killer and the Survivors are balanced - well, usually, if you play as a 4v1 or 3v1.\nQuickplay is fine, and certainly causes more (fitting/good!) discomfort/creep (noone to talk trash to :P), but you'll have more long-term fun when you get murdered by your friends.\n\nFor the Dev Team:\nIf possible, can you add partied matchmaking, or add at least some progression for killing your friends? Sure, you can play w/o the unlockable perks, but it would be nice to have.\nAlso, if you can, add the ability to cycle/select the killer, instead of defaulting the host to be the killer. Maybe not specifically for QuickPlay, but for private games. It would be so comfortable to not have to make a lobby when you want to be the killer (especially for those with rather slow pc's/ISP's)\n\nTL;DR: If you plan on playing this game for a longer time, make sure your friends are also buying a copy.","timestamp_created":1467592664,"timestamp_updated":1634583194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24065482","author":{"steamid":"76561197998032748","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":70499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2068,"playtime_at_review":1227,"last_played":1660492893},"language":"english","review":"My last review was when I had 20 hours into the game, here I am at 536 hours and still playing.\n\nSend help, I've lost everything.
