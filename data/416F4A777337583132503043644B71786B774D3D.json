Its very fun but has a very toxic community player base. After 1400+ hours I recently received a ban from the developers for \"threatening to DOX players.\" There is no possible way to make that sort of threat on this game as they have filters in the end game chat that show up as hash tags if you say something that is a threat or extremely offensive. After contacting their support team to find out exactly what was said because people can fabricate anything with technology today I was coldly and harshly told that the ban was staying and I had no right to know exactly what was said. I tried to inform them that I am a disabled veteran who suffers from mental health problems from my time in service and that this game was my form of therapy or a way to escape a really bad reality sometimes and I was basically told that they did not care. This company is not veteran or mental health friendly and at the end of the day you are money to them. There is no guarantee that your account or any investment that you make with this game is safe and if someone doesnt like you enough, they will make something up and get you permanently banned with no way to appeal. Again, after 1400+ hours and hundreds of dollars now wasted, I can do nothing to appeal what is an unjust and unfair ban.","timestamp_created":1639407810,"timestamp_updated":1639407810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52971571683883667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105767648","author":{"steamid":"76561198341837237","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29171,"last_played":1653142004},"language":"polish","review":"Spoko giera","timestamp_created":1639407403,"timestamp_updated":1639407403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105767509","author":{"steamid":"76561198316488998","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":403,"playtime_at_review":12121,"last_played":1660565489},"language":"schinese","review":"什么B游戏  打个游戏这个地图  人看见板就放   一个个板区还套路不了。打NM。直接放板放到5台机","timestamp_created":1639407216,"timestamp_updated":1639407216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105767263","author":{"steamid":"76561198337303286","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1640108080},"language":"russian","review":"сойдет для чила под пива","timestamp_created":1639406896,"timestamp_updated":1639406896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105767151","author":{"steamid":"76561198411771093","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1920,"last_played":1658840683},"language":"brazilian","review":"mt bom e foda <3 sem palavras\n","timestamp_created":1639406742,"timestamp_updated":1639406742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105766710","author":{"steamid":"76561199139542967","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":35239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1010,"playtime_at_review":28162,"last_played":1660594057},"language":"english","review":"It's amazing.

Also public games felt pretty toxic to new players the very few times I tried em. \n\nPurchased to play with friends, but it was just hard to get into for me. I don't really get off on horror games in the first place, so already the game needs to really offer me some interesting gameplay, and this just didn't have it for me. I didn't find it friendly to new players at all either with none of the buffs or debuffs being explained anywhere obvious like in tooltips etc, and if they exist I can't remember ever being told where to find the info in game. So the whole thing was just an exercise in frustration with none of the adrenaline rush people who like horror games enjoy. The only time I had fun was when I played with people who were also new and we were just goofing around. As soon as it became even remotely competitive or about trying to actually win it was just a shit time for me. \n\nLike yes, you got me, I am dead, there is literally nothing I feel like I coulda done

my review to negative as devs finally fully fell into the tolerasty and are censoring almost any single word in a game chat. Even a word \"kill\" even tho this game is about kills and surviving. \nDisgusting and hypocritically. \nLooks like \"You gave us your money? Good, now shut up your mouth\". \n\nNot going to spend any coin on this game anymore and dont recommend to spend money on it to anyone. \n\n***\n\nNever even expected that I will ever write a review on this game but hm. \nThis game is a love-hate. \n\nA lot of bugs which are not being fixed for years, issues after every single update, sudden disconnections, sudden progress lose, weird matchmaking, issues with optimisations, unbalanced maps, too strong or too weak perks from one side (and list can be continued). \n\nAnd fun, divercity of killer mechaniches and characters, regular updated and improvements, enough of players in online to be able to find a match (well, that's not always very fast but still), new achievements, new maps and thematic ingame events from the other side. \n\nThere are basically a lot of things I like and dont like in this game. But despite of negative sides, I keep playing it for few years already as it \"catches\" and that is the most important thing for me. \nIf previously game have done it with its weirdness and almost memetic amount of bugs, now is also added an aesthetic part. \n\n\"The Portrait of Murder\" is already something about art, not just a game chapter. Idk if you got a fresh blood in your team or just a wave of inspiration, but the result is great. Most of all I want to point on Artist's animation, those \"bird\" moves are really hitting the point. \nAnd the map is wonderfull. I really like the direction the game is moving currently. \n\nWhat I also like besides the game by itself is its extremly toxic community. I really hope, developers of Dbd will not fall into tolerasty, so popular nowdays, as creators of LOL or Heroes of the Storm did with cencoring every comment which does not contain tons of sugar and pink boggies. Leave us a bit of poison xD\n\nWhat else would I wish about this game? More updates and new character, new designs and mechanics, more original characters and ones from other horror settings. More ingame events as I like them and they are really involving. \n\nP.S.

Don't invest much more into the game, because the more you understand, the more disappointed you may get.\n\nHoly crap, its gonna be a long one\n\n[h1] The Survivor Experience[/h1]\n\nImportant to put this out here: if you want to play survivor, do it. Specially if you  have friends who you can play with and coordinate your movements, have some fun and enjoy each other's company. If you play solo, you may encounter some weird teammates who just want to ruin your game, but the good thing is that you can relatively quickly die and move to your next game. The skill cap is high, lots of maps, killers and perks to learn to play around.\nYou will sometimes encounter killers who camp you on the hook or tunnel you. Don't worry, this almost always can be countered, unless your team has made some major mistakes earlier. Problem is, many times countering this is not your job. For example, if the killer tunnels you, your teammates have to take hits for you, but in solo they may not do it.\nYes, this game can be frustrating sometimes. Get used it. \n\n[h1]The Killer Experience[/h1]\n\nAfter playing a fair share of killer I came to one very wise conclusion: don't play killer. It's that simple. Imagine the frustration, focus, concentration required to play survivor, multiply it by 10 and you get your killer experience. Now, in the beginning, you may have fun. But thanks to the SBMM system (Skill-based Matchmaking) the better you get, the better survivors you get against you WITHOUT seeing their or your own MMR. Translate this: the more you play, the harder it gets,  without a feedback of real progression and/or without additional rewards.\n\nEarlier with the rank system you could at least see other people's ranks. So many times if you'd get destroyed you could say, \"ohh well, I got destroyed, but I am rank 5, and these guys are all rank 1, and I got 6 hooks on them, so maybe its not that bad\". Now you have no information whether you are getting better or not. And there is no end to it.\n\n[h1]Balance[/h1]\n\nOn the high-end this game is incredibly survivor-sided, meaning even if you play your killer without mistakes (with some exceptions, like Nurse), you are relying on survivors making mistakes. If they don't do, many times the situation is immeadietly a loss. Worst part being: it's not your fault. Many times it feels like there was little to no room to play better at that exact moment.\nIf this wasn't enough, survivors can also bring [b]incredibly strong items[/b] in addition to the meta perks, of course, just to make it even more impossible.\nNow I know these days people are talking about the latest tournament, where both killers are survivors could bring any items and perk without restrictions, and that the results were relatively equal, but many of these people forget to talk about:\n\n[h1]Maps[/h1]\n\nMaps... oh, God! Where do I even start? In the tournament above the players weren't allowed to choose maps, and of course they weren't! I could name probably like 10 maps that I think are just unfair and should be removed from the game completely without a major rework. Gas Heaven, Haddonfield, 5 Badhams, Cowshed, Storehouse, Mother's Dwelling, RPD.... And these are just the ones I think are unfair... there are 10 more I can easily put into the \"incredibly hard\" category for killers. It's amazing to understand that the moment I load into a game on Mother's Dwelling, well, I'm already loosing.\nNow, I am not saying you can't win on these maps. What I am saying is that if survivors know what they are doing, it's almost impossible for them not to get at least 2 escapes. Storehouse is the simpliest example: if you just leave one of the 2 gens in the \"pocket\" formations the killer cannot defend that generator at all. (combine this with the strong main, and strong loops around) etc. etc.\n\nYou could think, that if killers suffer on these maps, than the survivors are having fun. I believe sometimes it is the case, but as a killer, if you want to win, you are forced to play very territorial, proxycamp and kill someone very early, otherwise you wont even get a single kill. This playstyle, in my personal opinion is not fun to execute, and also not fun to play against. \n\nI am going to talk about this later, but it's worth mentioning that the last 2 maps added by the devs are RPD and the Crow map are both hard for killer, thus it gives motivation to play territorial. (Crow map I think is hard, but RPD is MUCH MUCH worse)\n\n[h1]Community[/h1]\n\nDespite meeting some genuinely wholesome people, who also understand how the game is designed, and how is the game balance supposed to work, I'd say around 10% of the playerbase are incredibly toxic people who are only able to care about their own feelings and motivations. Unfortunately this 10% is the loudest one screaming in the endgame chat and on the forums.\n\nThere are many different types of people, killers who just play to piss off  survivors, survivors who just play to make killers mad. Some of the most loud ones are survivors who are convinced that tunneling and camping should be bannable, because they don't understand how the game balance works (to be fair, I wish these things were not part of the game, but making it bannable is just silly).\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that no matter what you play and how you play, people will be mad at you and hate you for who you are, but also for who you are not. It literally doesnt matter. People many times just accuse you of things you havent even done and proceed to report you.\nIf you are resilient to these kind of interactions, I applaud you.\n\n[h1]Devs[/h1]\n\nSo I wanted to say a few words about the devs, because I feel like it's an important thing. It feels like the devs are either a bit incompetent in terms of understanding where they want to see this game in a few years or they are bad at communicating this to the players. Me, a player who reads all of their posts, watching every video they release, have no idea what are they trying to achieve. They added circle of healing, a too powerful perk for the survivors, who would see play even after a major nerf, but they never nerf anything in like the first 3 MONTHS (!!!) of its existence. It feels like they are gathering statistical data about the perk to then nerf it or not, which may sound logical, but no idea if they balance for the new players, or the advanced ones. \n\nLong story short, judging by their comments and words I do not expect this game to move into the direction I would like it to go. Which is fine, but I really hope that the majority of players do not agree with me so that the game is not going to be abandoned in a few expansions.\n\nI am kind of happy to see, though, that many higher-MMR killer, and even lower ones start to stop playing or switch to survivor. Thus survivor queues are becoming longer. Maybe we can expect a change...? I doubt it, to be honest. I've been hopeful too many times. And every time it's been the same.\n\n[h1]Killers[/h1]\n\nA few words about the different killers. I think they are mostly great. There is no balance between them, though.. Main problem is, it feels like it doesn't matter if I play a strong killer or a weak one, I get the same maps, same survivors...\n\nOn the other hand: high MMR survivors are playing against the same few strong killers over and over again, occasionally finding a poor Myers, or Clown there...\n\nI do like that the killers are different, I'm just not sure if they should be this much different. But well, again, I have no clue what the devs stance on this is, because there is no communication.\n\n[h1]Cheaters[/h1]\n\nSmal note: many cheaters, specially on high-MMR, you can report them, but it usually takes 2-4 weeks for them to actually get banned.\n\nI'm done here.","timestamp_created":1639366740,"timestamp_updated":1639366764,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533381223678588867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105745060","author":{"steamid":"76561198951506475","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":16622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":14343,"last_played":1659396325},"language":"spanish","review":"balanceado como el orto","timestamp_created":1639366110,"timestamp_updated":1656188702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws7X12P0CdKqxkwM="}
