It can take a couple hundred hours to unlock all the perks and killers (without microtransactions), which is the main “meta” of this game. The perks have a horrible power creep problem with 10-15 perks severely outweighing the other few hundred, and it feels that only one perk out of the 24 added every year actually gets a decent amount of use because of all the other generalist perks that can be brought in every situation. Perks drastically impact how a match can go, which makes unlocking them all a chore.\n\nMatchmaking is busted, with it being tailored around performance and not rank, so newer players end up going ip against 2,000+ hour gods. Ranks don’t mean anything too, the devs for some reason haven’t implemented a rewards for reaching higher ranks.\n\nCharacters are locked behind tedios grindy currency or paywalls, even the original DLC, I can understand licensed killers like myers and Freddy being locked behind paywalls, but it makes no sense to make the original killers and dlc require that much grind, you already have the shop which I inagine brings in a decent amount of revenue.\n\nThe actual game can get rather repetetive on both sides with the newer killer designs being specialists who can sometimes do something interesting for the game, but fall overall (Blight and Demogorgon for example), ironically the most fun killers to get chased by are the higher tier ones, as you have to mix up your movements and hiding. Chase killers being more fun to play against then information or stealth ones. The maps don’t help as BVHR doesn’t want to remove or look at problematic maps like haddonfield or The game.\n\nWhile I think it’s a decent game, I reccomend getting it on sale or staying off of public matches just to mess around with friends.","timestamp_created":1575854974,"timestamp_updated":1608919476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59532839","author":{"steamid":"76561198104924099","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":13452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10912,"last_played":1649485711},"language":"english","review":"it is a Horrific even if your the killer","timestamp_created":1575854946,"timestamp_updated":1575854946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59532807","author":{"steamid":"76561198813171774","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8654,"last_played":1633790646},"language":"german","review":"ich liebe dieses Spiel sehr","timestamp_created":1575854896,"timestamp_updated":1575854896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59532286","author":{"steamid":"76561198988175999","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":15534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4279,"last_played":1657855228},"language":"english","review":"it is a good game if you like a repetitive play experience and i would recomend\nBut it has very bad hitboxes.","timestamp_created":1575854052,"timestamp_updated":1614720249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59532028","author":{"steamid":"76561198987609493","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1577780658},"language":"english","review":"This game is really enjoyable. 10/10 recommend","timestamp_created":1575853592,"timestamp_updated":1575853592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59531892","author":{"steamid":"76561198859200100","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":149989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11320,"last_played":1658482357},"language":"english","review":"The best thrilling and exciting multiplayer game with friends!","timestamp_created":1575853373,"timestamp_updated":1575853373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59531812","author":{"steamid":"76561197962390003","num_games_owned":542,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1153,"last_played":1654649485},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, this game scratches an itch I didn't realize I had.

Cada nueva actualizacion trae consigo bugs bastante molestos y que de plano te sentencian en la partida y no queda mas que desconectarse o perder instantaneamente. \n\nCon la salida del nuevo asesino (claro porque para asesinos si tienen tiempo), salio un bug  en los ganchos del sotano, donde los jugadores quedaban atrapados sin poder moverse. Arreglaron ese bug en una actualización y al instante hay un nuevo bug para los asesinos, que se quedan pegados al dañar generadores. Digo yo, seran retrasados los desarrolladores?, como es posible que no puedan sacar una actualización correcta?. Cada dia se hace menos divertido este juego, porque la idea esta buenisima, pero los constantes bugs y malos ratos que te hace pasar matan toda la magia. No me queda mas que no recomendar este juego.\n\nActualizacion 2020\n\nPareciera que no podian cagarla mas con este juego, pero al parecer si pudieron. Con la ultima actualizacion se ha vuelto injugable. Su juegas de survivor, es casi seguro que te van a tunelear y a campear. Si juegas como asesino, a menos que tunelees y campees es re dificil sacar mas de 1 kill. Todo desencadena en un mismo problema. El gen rush que hay ahora es horrible. Si como asesino te sale un premade de jugadores, despidete de una buena partida. Si como survivor eres el primer en caer, despidete de la partida tambien. Este juego lamentablemente paso a ya no ser entretenido.","timestamp_created":1575847805,"timestamp_updated":1585454993,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59528000","author":{"steamid":"76561197960779912","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":95676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75325,"last_played":1654846169},"language":"english","review":"So Ive been playing this game ever since middle school (5 years ago) and i finally came to the idea of writing a review this game is fun with friends and if your trying to just play by yourself, but sometimes it could be a bummer too since this game has been very common with bugs for over the past 5 years which personally i never really had a problem with but everytime they try to fix it they manage to create another bug the developers tried to work around face camping and nerfs which seemed to work but some things were not necessary if they can finalize this game i would give it a 10/10 right now though it is a 8/10 game not saying that i don't love this game because i do i grew up with this game but if your looking for something fun to play with your friends and you like horror genres this is your best bet.","timestamp_created":1575846874,"timestamp_updated":1575846874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59527991","author":{"steamid":"76561198321807415","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":68008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9970,"last_played":1648956010},"language":"english","review":"I want to commit an act of terrorism","timestamp_created":1575846857,"timestamp_updated":1638492430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59527699","author":{"steamid":"76561198402310790","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2857,"last_played":1658097791},"language":"brazilian","review":"https://www.twitch.tv/g0dric","timestamp_created":1575846372,"timestamp_updated":1575846372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59526813","author":{"steamid":"76561198289536977","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":74595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1094,"last_played":1657479223},"language":"english","review":"Very intense and fun gameplay\nNot a salty community\nOverall 10 out of 10","timestamp_created":1575845057,"timestamp_updated":1575845057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59526604","author":{"steamid":"76561198096124316","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":108,"playtime_at_review":10883,"last_played":1660365079},"language":"english","review":"You'll hate this game, but play it anyways.\n","timestamp_created":1575844713,"timestamp_updated":1591964208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59526562","author":{"steamid":"76561198306395994","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":84063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34985,"last_played":1658796335},"language":"english","review":"Great Game! for about a year..... this game has NOTHING NEW. the only \"new thing\" is new killers but even then where is a new game mode? where is new graphics? there is nothing GAME CHANGING just new killers or new perks that change the meta\nbut nothing on changing the game  NOTHING","timestamp_created":1575844653,"timestamp_updated":1575844653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59526386","author":{"steamid":"76561198118606686","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":51867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":15,"playtime_at_review":42849,"last_played":1660429322},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito divertido para se jogar sozinho e/ou com amigos, além de ter uma boa comunidade e ter atenção dos desenvolvedores para termos atualizações constantes.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1575844087,"timestamp_updated":1610482603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59526178","author":{"steamid":"76561198430388583","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4344,"last_played":1594253933},"language":"spanish","review":"muy

Then turn back, because in order to even get close to the point where you can play like they do requires a stupidly long grind, or a significant investment into DLC characters for a mildly reduced grind.\n\nThis is not a game that can be played casually. If you really enjoy every aspect of the game and are willing to commit to grinding out all the characters, then I would recommend it. The game is fairly well balanced, runs well and looks great, so your first hours will be really fun. However, as you become more invested in the game and more involved with its mechanics and progression, some of the late game customisation options start to seem mandatory in order to make the build(s) you want to play. The result is that less enthusiastic players are forced to spend lots of time playing characters and builds they don't enjoy in order to play the ones they do.","timestamp_created":1575838370,"timestamp_updated":1575838370,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59521183","author":{"steamid":"76561198292676758","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":76188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52848,"last_played":1658508717},"language":"russian","review":"КОНЧЕННАЯ ИГРА","timestamp_created":1575837582,"timestamp_updated":1575837582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477328002452850342","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59521122","author":{"steamid":"76561198026068492","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1414,"last_played":1592847311},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1575837491,"timestamp_updated":1575837491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59521105","author":{"steamid":"76561198027166478","num_games_owned":361,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":55160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22985,"last_played":1635518844},"language":"english","review":"Great game, did a very good job so far\n\nedit: Still a great game still a very meh job so far\n\nedit: hours 666, still a great game still a very meh job so far","timestamp_created":1575837470,"timestamp_updated":1593559483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59520952","author":{"steamid":"76561198103037746","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":176579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":418,"playtime_at_review":153252,"last_played":1660059778},"language":"english","review":"hey guys ding dong big chungus forehead pickle boy here again back at it again with another food review today were reviewing dead by daylight a terrible game that doesnt have big chungus as a skin for the clown fr fr.","timestamp_created":1575837306,"timestamp_updated":1600867084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59520907","author":{"steamid":"76561198287188367","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":28371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":97,"playtime_at_review":3984,"last_played":1659473017},"language":"german","review":"It's very fun, sometimes scary and even alone without friends you can have a ton of fun as survivor or killer.","timestamp_created":1575837255,"timestamp_updated":1575837255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59520814","author":{"steamid":"76561198877260543","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1591287209},"language":"english","review":"wexrdctfvygbhunij","timestamp_created":1575837144,"timestamp_updated":1575837144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59520412","author":{"steamid":"76561198127791365","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":4069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3000,"last_played":1594587771},"language":"english","review":"awesome game","timestamp_created":1575836704,"timestamp_updated":1575836704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59520392","author":{"steamid":"76561198013725596","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16474,"last_played":1658271827},"language":"english","review":"How do I say this. The game is extremely fun if you can get 4 people together with a group working together for everyone alive. But being by yourself solo it's not as fun as you really start to see the issues that your much more powerless playing as a survivor. The one thing i hope for in this game is some more perks on survivors side that are better. Some of the more recent perks have not really been extremely beneficial to survivors they either are worse perks that already exist or are just okay. I think the new chapter cursed legacy is probably a step in the right direction for survivors as we now have a pallet reset perk. These are the type of perks i want to see more as they really help it to feel more balanced for lower ranks and higher ranks since the killers just have such powerful perks it really makes it unbalanced. I know this is an unpopular opinion but i think barbaque and chili can be balanced since it is so powerful by just making it so you can only use the hooking aura showing 4 times like how the bloodpoints booster works for it. This would balance this perk so easily. It would still be a great perk but not as amazing as it is now. This would obviously make a lot of killer mains angry but it would only be good for the long run since more people would want to play survivor.\n\nNow this of Course is all my own opinion but i still think it can be seen as helpful to developers and people who read this.\nI do Strongly reccomend the the game to people who like horror icons and want to feel like the survivors or the killers as you do play a 1v4 against 1 killer with 4 survivors work together to survive. it is a extremely fun game with friends and it can feel great to get good as a killer or a survivor. But just a warning people really like to play killer so long killer queues and shorter survivor queues. But i play both and I have fun playing both. So i hope to see anyone who is reading this in the abyss.

Today we’ll be looking into Dead by Daylight an asymmetric competitive game in the same vein as Evolve that places one scary killer against four slippery survivors in a cat and mouse game that would make Tom & Jerry proud. This game has a fairly unique style but is it worth your money and more importantly your time? Let’s find out! \n\nEveryday I’m Hooking: The game is a large departure on the normal design of player-verses-player and though not the first game to do it; being the first real success story of the genre. You play as either a survivor or a killer in a four against one match where a single killer attempts to eliminate the four survivors by placing them on meat hooks throughout the map long enough (or often enough) to have a creature called the entity to consume them. The survivors are attempting to well...survive but also win by escaping either through gates opened by powering generators or a special trap door hidden on the map. Each killer has unique abilities, ranging from lunge attacks to invisibility but the survivors are all identical aside from beginning perks they can select (and eventually unlock for other survivors) and cosmetics. Ultimately, the killer cannot be defeated only slowed down and is racing against time to eliminate the survivors before they complete their objectives. \n\nScary Music: Everything about this game is about the atmosphere, the ambiance; from the lighting to the music and sound effect, even the voice acting is all sharpened to a keen edge to make the killer feel like a force of nature and the survivors like scurrying rats avoiding said force. The game is balanced very well and although the survivors will typically loose overall it is common for little victories to be achieved or even that lone survivor to escape the final few moments. The leveling system is also very interesting as you unlock all your items and perks through leveling in a system that has you gaining points for playing and unlocking items in a web, once the web is completed you level up, moving up to a more complex web. This creates an elegant system where new players aren’t penalized as much in abilities / items but veteran players have more toys to play with. In the end the main difference is going to be the skill and preferences of the players not obtaining that +5 shotgun of face smashing. \n\nShock Therapy: I despise the doctor, there I said it. In my eyes he is the single most frustrating killer in the entire game that boarders on a toxic play experience; one that usually has nothing to do with the player controlling him during the match. That aside the game is very stable and has a community that is active all hours of the day. I do see the occasional intentional drop from frustrated players, which gives all remaining players a bonus in points but this also tends to weigh heavily in favor the killer for that individual game. There can be a level of frustration against certain killers and a single wrong move can ruin a game; thankfully you are only ever a few minutes from a new game. I would like to see more detailed tutorials as, although great, the current tutorials are lacking and the game requires a fair bit of research outside of the game to improve. To be honest I never found this a deal breaker however, in some ways it was actually fun to figure out previously frustrating elements of the game. This is game is a great example of the ‘just one more game’ effect that leaves you in bed hours after you should be. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for asymmetric death-match style game there simply isn’t a better one out there. Games in the past have tried, failing and some amazing games have side modes that mimic this design, this game stands above them all like a killer at a downed victim slowly bleeding out.

скажу, это второй аккаунт, на первом в ДБД наиграно больше 600 часов.\nПостараюсь быть краток.\nИтак, плюсы:\n+ геймлей интересен и разнообразен, как за счет разнообразия персонажей, так и за счет игроков, каждый матч будет не таким как прошлый (как впрочем и во всех сессионных играх)\n+ игры в среднем минут по 20-30 максимум\n+ интересный сеттинг (лора немного, и очевидно оценка субъективная, но мне по душе)\n+ много косметических предметов, так что любимого выжившего можно приодеть как душе угодно (плюс сомнительный, конечно, но все же плюс)\nМинусы:\n- Очень много гринда, прокачать все перки на одном персонаже займет минимум месяц ежедневной игры\n- Всё еще приличное количество багов (разработчики активные и стараются, но отшлифовать игру пока не могут). К кривым хитбоксам в целом можно привыкнуть, да и BHVR обещают починить эту проблему (вызвана она недавно введенными выделенными серверами, так что это последствия работы над игрой).\nИтого:\nЕсли не играли - посмотрите стримы или видео, можете подождать бесплатных выходных, попробовать поиграть хотя бы часов 5-10 и решить подходит Вам такой жанр или нет.\nЕсли зайдет - рекомендую найти официальный канал дискорда по данной игре и играть компанией, так намного веселей (хотя лично я в удовольствие играю и соло выжившим, сложнее но интереснее)","timestamp_created":1575829832,"timestamp_updated":1575829832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503891050815582275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59513811","author":{"steamid":"76561198145648974","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":63199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":716,"playtime_at_review":14996,"last_played":1660142778},"language":"spanish","review":"es bueno y punto .","timestamp_created":1575829578,"timestamp_updated":1575829578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59513721","author":{"steamid":"76561198971949822","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":20782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":77,"playtime_at_review":4443,"last_played":1659822366},"language":"russian","review":"Вроде неплохо, а вроде х*йня.","timestamp_created":1575829486,"timestamp_updated":1655209106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59513563","author":{"steamid":"76561198146282650","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":19841,"playtime_last_two_weeks":193,"playtime_at_review":12130,"last_played":1660578113},"language":"koreana","review":"애미 씨발 매칭도 하도안잡혀서 기도해야되는데 잡혀도 살인마가 매크로 아니기를 기도해야되는 기괴망측한게임 개발자새끼들은 생징징 편의성패치 하지말고 살인마를의한 패치도좀 해라 그따구로 쳐하니깐 살인마 안할려들지  야발련들아  참고로 생존자유저임","timestamp_created":1575829329,"timestamp_updated":1637882145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59513223","author":{"steamid":"76561198452726219","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12915,"last_played":1657923651},"language":"spanish","review":"exelente juego! tiene sus detalles despues de cada actualizacion , pero disminuye cada vez !","timestamp_created":1575828970,"timestamp_updated":1575828970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59512979","author":{"steamid":"76561198077383149","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1576343218},"language":"russian","review":"Жаль потраченных денег.
