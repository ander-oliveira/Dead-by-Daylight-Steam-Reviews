Of course, sometimes you get to the point where it totally annoys you, but as a tip, you can also play killer yourself.... ;) besides, not every round goes like this. It is a 4 vs 1 game with some jumpscares if you are new, but also for a veteran, sometimes.  The toxicity in this game is unfortunately undisputed. People often forget that it's just a video game. Unfortunately. I've been playing this game since 2016 and, in fact, still enjoy the game, even though I've only been playing it solo for about 3 years now. I also don't think the new patch is as bad as it is made out to be by the Survivor community. All in all a solid game with always new content.

Unfortunately, an update has been released couple of days ago for this game which made the game ugly which a new killer has been added ( The Heg ) that makes a match impossible to win. My message for the makers of Dead by Daylight is to make some changes to modify this killer's abilities (The HEG) and perks or DELETE it from exist, so both Killers and Survivers can enjoy playing this amazing game.

Although, the killers are sometimes extremely OP the first time they come out, the devs do their best to fix it as fast as possible.

It's so difficult to find a good game where the devs consider everyone and do their best to include all of their audience. \nI love this game and have been very faithful and loyal to it since it came out. It's lasting fun for hours, and although it's supposedly \"repetitive\", how can it be when you can change your perk build, and you get a new killer every game with a different play style along with a different map. You have to adjust your play style each game, and learn to play to the killer's tactics. This game is overwhelmingly fun, and I will always recommend it to everyone. \nPlus - it's always on sale for about 50% off, along with the DLC being 30% off. \n\nBest asymmetrical horror game, and the only one to truly live and thrive after a month.\nWonderful game, I always come back for large patches and new DLC, and enjoy each killer and survivor.

There are a couple games out there that are like DBD, but I think that DBD sets the bar with this genre. The main goal for the Survivors of DBD is to repair 5 generators in a randomly generated world and escape. The goal for the killer is fairly simple, kill the survivors before they can escape. This is done by slashing at them until they are down, and then putting them on a hook to slowly bleed out, or be saved by other survivors. Overall, the gameplay is very good. Besides a few bugs that were more funny than frustrating, I enjoy playing with friends and killing other people and their friends. The problem with this game comes from the community. The community focuses more on trying to be decent people and letting everyone have fun instead of trying to win. This mostly comes from people who mostly play survivors. When I first started trying out playing as a killer, anytime I would camp a survivor that I hooked, I would be berated by the survivors at the end of the match for tying to win. I've also played as a survivor and watched my other survivors complain about the killer camping. I'll admit, it's not fun to be camped, but the survivors aren't the only ones trying to win. There's also rampant farming aswell. Sometimes from bots, but mostly from the same people who want everyone to have fun instead of win. I've played a few times with friends who thought it'd be fun to help some killers farm. While it felt nice, it was really boring. Half the time the killers didn't know we were trying to help them and they just killed us right away.\n\nSo, Overall this game is really fun to play, but the community is best left ignored.","timestamp_created":1481754801,"timestamp_updated":1481754801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28367836","author":{"steamid":"76561198169343561","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1301,"last_played":1523196974},"language":"french","review":"Guys it's just IMPOSSIBLE to join a game with your friends i dont recommand","timestamp_created":1481754573,"timestamp_updated":1481754573,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575807034969329834","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28367754","author":{"steamid":"76561197992696127","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":21938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12861,"last_played":1587238755},"language":"russian","review":"Это не игра, а набор багов какой-то...\nI think we did a pretty good job so far.","timestamp_created":1481754184,"timestamp_updated":1511704966,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484803467988967896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28367559","author":{"steamid":"76561198004395406","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":92939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79698,"last_played":1659306117},"language":"english","review":"It's been a while, lets change the review.\n\nThe game is now plagued by blatant hackers and cheaters.\n\n(Some not so blatant...)\n\nThe devs refuse to do anything about it.\n\nAlso MMR has ruined the game, can't have fun in the game anymore unless you can full time play this game;

Hra byla popsána v mnoha recenzích již níže. Já se zaměřím na důvody proč nedoporučuji tuto hru. Tato hra má neskutečné problémy co se týče zahrát si vůbec. Zapnete a připojíte se. Bohužel častokrát nedoběhne loading a vy stále koukáte a čekáte a nic se nestane. Další možnost je že se připojíte do hry a jste tam už jen 3 nebo 2.... Hra nijak nikoho nepenalizuje. Dále častokrát odpadne samotný lovec. Což je při tak zdlouhavé procedůře dost otravné. Samozřejmě Vás hra boduje za to co jste všechno zvládli. Bohužel lvl nejsou až tak podstatné a tak jsou body dost k ničemu. Kupujete si za ně výbavu apod. ale ta je jen na omezený počet použití a tak se dostanete do fáze kdy s sebou nic netaháte. A poslední mega výtka je k OP lovcům. Co placený přídavek to horší a horší. Chápu že jako oběť nemáte mít moc šancí. Ale pokud není lovec úplny idiot tak skoro vždy zvítězí. Funguje to i naopak. Máte blbou náladu? Dejte si to za lovce. Výhra je skoro vždy jistá.... pokud netrefíte na sehraný team. Bohužel hra je založená převážně na náhodě a placené přídavky dost hře ubližují. Doufám, že s odstupem času recenzi změním.

Perchè lo ammetto, dare la caccia ai sopravvissuti è divertente. Il concetto alla base del gioco è interessante, e il prezzo è onesto anche se a quanto pare sono destinati a uscire sempre più DLC a pagamento che non sono necessari per giocare e/o vincere ma il non possederli limita la selezione dei personaggi sia per killer che sopravvissuti.\nIl motivo è per cui il pollice è in giu è prima di tutto il fatto che il gioco è molto buggato. Molti di questi bug sono storici e sembra che gli sviluppatori se la prendano molto comoda a risolverli. Poi gli stage sono davvero concepiti male, troppe infinities, troppe barriere, che fin troppi sopravvissuti abusano spudoratamente e non ci si può fare nulla \"fà parte del gioco\". Qui non si tratta di abilità o accessori che a seconda delle opinioni possono essere considerati sgravi, è proprio il modo in cui gli stage sono stati realizzati che è sbagliato. Quindi si tratta di un gioco troppo difettato per meritarsi un pollice in su. Poi il gameplay è davvero scarno, praticamente guardie e ladri. C'è il killer che deve ferire e sacrificare i sopravvissuti, e loro devono attivare le scappatoie attivando dei generatori cercando di non farsi vedere. O se hanno voglia di trollare, facendosi vedere e tenendosi al sicuro girando intorno a una infinity. Tutto qui. I due tasti del mouse e ovviamente i WASD per muoversi sono tutto cio che attivano le azioni del gioco, niente menu, selezione oggetti (all'interno del gioco) o che. Un prodotto estremamente scarno e sempliciotto, ma pur così molto imperfetto.

No really, I did :(\n\nThis is a game that caters to both the inner sociopath and the inner socialite. The premise is simple. 4 nervous survivors attempt to outwit and evade 1 of 6 (i think) twisted psychotic killers and escape the level. This is done by the simple act of powering up 5 generators to give power to the level gates. Simple enough, and actually a tad repetitive after a while. However each game still manages to inject just enough suspense, excitement and fear to keep you coming back. Teamwork pays off, but you can be the selfish type and just try to ensure your own survival. Perks and items collected from crates or from levelling up will make your survival a little easier.....maybe.\n\nAs a killer, you play a sometimes frustrating game of cat and mouse, attempting to find, chase and capture survivors so you can hang them from meat hooks.....yes that's right, finally we can do what we've always wanted to :) The killers are all different with their own skills, perks, playstyle etc and it's difficult to select a favourite as they all play so differently.\nThe trapper sets his traps and attempts to lure or chase his prey onto them. The hillbilly charges across the map maniacally swinging his chainsaw. The wraith is a stealthy stalker, etc etc.\n\nMaps are all dark and misty, very atmospheric in some cases. The graphics in general are nothing to write home about. The textures of the characters in general are pretty poor and the killers seem to be lacking something. However, you won't notice it, you'll be far too busy screaming \"OH FECK, OH FECK\" as you dash frantically across the map, leaping walls and throwing pallets down behind you in an attempt to lose the 7 foot tall hatchet wielding psychopath who seems intent on having you around for dinner.\n\nIn conclusion, a very good game. Suspenseful, tactical and rewarding for those that learn to play. My only gripe so far is the community, or parts of it at least, but its no worse than many others. There have also been a few serverside issues that can cause problems joining a game, but that's a minor issue as it doesnt happen often.","timestamp_created":1481706240,"timestamp_updated":1481706626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28356970","author":{"steamid":"76561198351127050","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":157,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1660584544},"language":"schinese","review":"可以","timestamp_created":1481706051,"timestamp_updated":1481706051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28356950","author":{"steamid":"76561198273016044","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1793,"last_played":1589874436},"language":"english","review":"Since the last update I have being laging a lot can you please fix it.???\n","timestamp_created":1481705855,"timestamp_updated":1481705855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28356936","author":{"steamid":"76561198064748793","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6757,"last_played":1658654768},"language":"thai","review":"ไม่ว่าเกมจะเปิดมานานแค่ไหนผู้เล่นก็ยัง toxic เหมือนเดิม  ทีมหลุด 2 มึงก็ยังยืน แค้มป์ คุณภาพจริงๆ เห้อขยะ","timestamp_created":1481705779,"timestamp_updated":1582329970,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28356535","author":{"steamid":"76561198251810688","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1651170013},"language":"schinese","review":"我不太敢玩人类所以享受不到遛狗的乐趣","timestamp_created":1481702878,"timestamp_updated":1481702878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28356406","author":{"steamid":"76561198098836693","num_games_owned":883,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":54974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10535,"last_played":1657941926},"language":"english","review":"I love the game when it works.
