и сами видите количество часов. Это уже о многом говорит.\n\nВ данной игре я с самой альфы. Тогда игра была вообще другая, в ней было проще стелсить, нельзя было ломать генераторы и сначала (насколько помню) не было перков как таковых, они появились позднее, кажется, в бете.\nБыл только один маньяк (капканщик) и четверо первых выживших, а также только набор карт Macmillan estate. Тогда игра доставила немало веселья, несмотря на очень малое количество игроков, первые впечатления были до усрачки страшные, особенно при первом знакомстве с перком insidious, когда убийца стоит на месте и звука террора не слышно, маскировка, так сказать, очень жутко. Кстати, особый привет хочу передать маньяку с альфы meow meow или как-то так, если он русский и читает это. Самым весёлым для выживших и грустным для маньяков было быстрое перемещение через окна (завод - идеальная карта, где можно было бесконечно бегать по кругу через второй этаж и маньяк не мог догнать и ударить).\n\nПрошло время, игра вышла в бету, где добавили пару маньяков (опять же, если правильно помню), а потом уже в релиз. Но багов на релизе было очень много, даже писал огромный пост с ними, большинство из них со временем благополучно поправили, но тут киберпанк 2077 нервно курит в сторонке, учитывая количество багов.\n\nВ общем, стали добавлять маньяков, выживших, монетизировать тем самым игру. Ещё добавляют куча \"шкурок\", которые меняют лишь внешний вид и не несут ничего нового в плане геймплея. Такое их обилие абсолютно не нужно, тем более за деньги. Есть возможность купить нелицензированных маньяков и людей бесплатно за очки, но они долго копятся. Но жадность разработчиков видна по одним и тем же скидкам даже на первые DLC, которые вышли несколько лет назад (-40%), а также по нежеланию за 4 года игры добавить в неё что-нибудь новое. Да, тут по-прежнему один режим по ремонту 5 генераторов и побегу через ворота, который просто полируют и дорабатывают 4 года, попутно выкачивая деньги за ненужные шкурки. Да даже за участие в альфа-версии я не получил копию игры, дали лишь 10% скидку на неё.\n\nЧто касаемо механики - то уникальные здесь только маньяки. Выжившие одинаковые, их перки можно наследовать с достижением 40 уровня персонажа, а значит, просто меняется \"шкурка\", внешний вид, и любому можно дать перки, которые покупаются в храме или наследуются.\nУ маньяков же такого нет, у каждого свои особенности, скорость, умения и тактики, по большей части за счёт этого игра и популярна (если не брать во внимание спортивный геймплей и игру с друзьями, что любую игру делает веселей).\n\nСейчас, когда вышло обновление с новым интерфейсом и анимациями 4.5.0, играть за маньяка стало проще, а за выживших сложнее, на мой взгляд. Люди по большей части не любят перемены и начинают осуждать это, но каждому своё. Когда-то и крюки можно было сломать по всей карте и маньяк был бессилен, да и в окна можно было прыгать почти мгновенно, тогда как маньяк перелезал долго, дольше, чем сейчас. Но всё меняется и нужно к этому привыкать, давая обратную связь, чтобы изменения не привели к катастрофе.\n\nВердикт на сегодня: хорошая мультиплеерная игра, где больший интерес достигается путём выполнения испытаний, не так давно появившихся в игре и открытия тем самым историй разных персонажей.\nСамый огромный минус - токсичное сообщество. Я много играл за маньяка и по сленгу здешних игроков \"кемпил\" и \"туннелил\" людей. Потому что я могу, потому что я маньяк, никто мне не должен указывать как мне надо играть, играю как считаю нужным. Даже в человеческой среде маньякам в большинстве своём чужды моральные аспекты различных вопросов. Но когда я играл за каннибала, например, когда пила ещё не перегревалась, и мне хотелось помучать игроков, ощущая беспомощность от того, что висящий не сможет спастись, то после игры мне приходила гнусная критика не только во внутриигровой послематчевый чат, но и в профиль Steam, на мою стену. Конечно же, я удаляю комментарии, предварительно добавляя человека в вечный чёрный список (уже больше 100 человек в нём находится и будет со временем больше) и спокойно играю дальше как хочу. Не надо указывать маньякам как играть, и когда переключался на людей, то не занимался тем же самым, понимая, что это всего лишь игра, и что маньяк делает что заблагорассудится, я их не осуждаю.\n\nВ общем, 7/10.","timestamp_created":1605222340,"timestamp_updated":1615583506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79171526","author":{"steamid":"76561198256954176","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":18268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6623,"last_played":1653512845},"language":"german","review":"bestes game","timestamp_created":1605221237,"timestamp_updated":1605221237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79171276","author":{"steamid":"76561198440865155","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":69031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":16658,"last_played":1660277884},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1605220762,"timestamp_updated":1605220762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79171193","author":{"steamid":"76561198879378288","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1626664486},"language":"brazilian","review":"top","timestamp_created":1605220636,"timestamp_updated":1605220636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79171124","author":{"steamid":"76561198210036949","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1435,"last_played":1658257982},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo divertido, oque estraga é a comunidade\n","timestamp_created":1605220493,"timestamp_updated":1605220493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79170951","author":{"steamid":"76561198182793727","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":34349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21971,"last_played":1659080186},"language":"latam","review":"e estado presente en el juego desde el primer año, ha tenido sus altibajos pero siempre es divertido de jugar, siempre espero a que el juego mejore con cada año\nmuy recomendado ;3","timestamp_created":1605220160,"timestamp_updated":1605220160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79170774","author":{"steamid":"76561197984790512","num_games_owned":1334,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":87,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1605217424},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is taken directly from a slasher film (in the best way possible).

Personally, I've seen gameplay of Friday the 13th and was not impressed, moreso skeptical about balance and fun for both sides. This skepticism carried over to Dead by Daylight and I ignored it on steam and brushed it off as a game I would never play.\n\nThen, a few years later, my friend came to me saying \"Hey check this game out it's so cool\" and of course I brushed it off... Until I watched him play. What I saw was not a buggy mess like Friday the 13th but a genuinely fun and well made horror-action game. So I picked it up and was immediately hooked, I wanted to learn everything about it, how to get good as survivor, killer, how to counter and mindgame; I was fully sucked in. The atmosphere and basic gameplay are amazing and when I first started I felt very immersed into the trials I was in. All was great and dandy...until I played online. Up to this point I only played custom games with the friends that got me into it, where we all played relatively fair with no Mori's or keys etc. So once I played online with randoms I came face to face with the games issues, balance. If there's one thing that sums up the major problems with this game it's this; Either side can, if they choose to, make the game horribly unfair and unfun for the other side. All because the developers have chosen to keep the explosive options in the game, so they community community comes up with their own \"honor code\" with strategies, perks, and offerings that are so powerful people don't use them. Only problem is not everyone honors it and of course the code varies from player to player and blah blah blah. Quick solution, balance the game.\n\nSome killers power's could also be buffed or nerfed and like 90% of perks are useless and the 10% people use are super powerful. HOWEVER, you can get some amazing close games with both sides not bringing their explosive options or playing customs with friends, where you dictate the rules.\n\nOverall 10/10 if everyone avoids the explosive options or the devs finally fucking removes them\n4/10 when you get moried 2 mins in after getting tunneled.\n\nAlso you can now kick babies in the PTB so if you're into that sort of thing...","timestamp_created":1605219599,"timestamp_updated":1605219721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.661500871181488037","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79170485","author":{"steamid":"76561198306472067","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1605222096},"language":"english","review":"my stuff bro i love this game af af","timestamp_created":1605219332,"timestamp_updated":1605219332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79170416","author":{"steamid":"76561198180787351","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":11340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2544,"last_played":1652145976},"language":"english","review":"da fah-fah 😳","timestamp_created":1605219222,"timestamp_updated":1605219222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79169810","author":{"steamid":"76561198241937100","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":1129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1654236923},"language":"brazilian","review":"O maior crossover de vilhões do halloween, com direito ás raridades das antigas como Michael Myers até as novidades da nova geração como Stranger Things.

Je vous parlerai de ce que j'en pense sous la plupart des aspects.\n\n[h1]Résumé du Jeu[/h1]\n\nDead By Daylight (qu'on va abréger en DBD) est un jeu de survival horror en co-op et pvp, où 4 survivants devront faire équipe pour réparer des générateurs pour ensuite s'échapper. Mais ces survivants sont enfermés avec un tueur sanguinaire, qui fera tout pour les arrêter.\n\n[h1]Les Graphismes[/h1]\n\nPour ce qui est des graphismes, je trouve que le jeu est plutôt beau, même si je trouve dommage que certains aspects ne sont pas assez travaillés. Je pense notamment aux cheveux des survivants, qui n'ont aucun mouvement à eux seuls, où aux tâches de sang pixellisés sur la hache de la chasseuse par exemple.\nSinon le jeu est sombre et est bien travaillé pour ce jeu.\n\n[h1]Le Son[/h1]\n\nJ'aime beaucoup le son du jeu, je le trouve bien travaillé et il est nécessaire pour bien jouer. Je trouve tout de même embêtant que le bruit des générateurs ressemblent beaucoup aux battements de coeur.\n\n[h1]La Jouabilité[/h1]\n\nLe jeu est à la base plutôt fluide, facile à magner pour les bases, mais après il faut avoir beaucoup de stratégie pour gagner.  J'apprécie beaucoup le système de \"cartes\" à équiper sur son personnage pour le rendre plus efficace. Ce jeu peut être très agréable si vous jouez à 5 avec vos amis en vocal.\n\nIl y a beaucoup de personnages à jouer autant chez les survivants que chez les tueurs, ce qui permet de beaucoup changer quand on désire du nouveau.\n\nCependant, il y a tout de même de gros problèmes qui nuisent au jeu, comme par exemple le temps d'attente avant de rejoindre une partie (qui est d'au moins 10 minutes), ou encore le fait que le tueur s'en va d'un coté, puis réapparaisse derrière son personnage, ce qui est complètement impossible normalement. Et en dernier, jouer par exemple en tueur, et se retrouver face à des joueurs de rang 1 à 5 (des hauts rangs) alors que vous n'êtes que rang 19 et que vous avez du mal à jouer votre personnage\n\n\nPour résumer, c'est un bon jeu qui a une durée de vie assez longue pour ceux qui veulent avoir des frissons, ou juste s'amuser entre amis.","timestamp_created":1605216643,"timestamp_updated":1605216643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79168462","author":{"steamid":"76561199066500195","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5913,"last_played":1656275338},"language":"english","review":"Shit game, some awful updates, and probably some of the worst gameplay I've played.

The developers have been given many, MANY opportunities to make improvements to their game but they seem to be unable to figure out how to take any of the feedback they are given and make the magic happen. The only content creators you will see who continue to record or stream this game are channels that have given up any hope of playing other games to all-in on this one. Survivor queues are incredibly long and Killer queues are instant (gee, I wonder why? It can't be an indication of a balance issue, can it?). The game continues to charge more and more money for the game you've already paid for, and while you may argue this is due to the cost of servers and their consistent patches, what if I told you that these patches don't contain any of the commonly requested fixes?\n\nThe developer Q&As go like this:\nPlayer: \"Hey, is this game feature going to be improved in any way?\"\nDevs: \"Um... we'll look at it when we get back.\" Translation: F off, we're not doing anything.\n\nIn spite of this garbage treatment, the developers continue to fight for our financial support and have the absolute AUDACITY to ask for Steam award votes like they've really given it their all, and their game is something so polished and well-made that it deserves any sort of accolade. Instead, you'll get a buggy mess with a toxic community, developers whose hands are tied by the company that doesn't give a flying fuck if their game is good or not as long as those DLCs keep getting dropped every 3 months, health be DAMNED.\n\nAll I can hope is that their upcoming competitor releases soon and they finally fade into obscurity the way they've always deserved. Goodbye, Dead By Daylight, and good riddance.\n\n==============\nOld review below\n==============\n\nThis game may be the most frustrating example of a developer milking their audience dry since League of Legends. The community is about the same level of unskilled and toxic as well. Not only is balancing incredibly poorly managed, the developer attitude is garbage (once when a gamebreaking bug was called out on stream they famously said \"just go play something else\") and the core of gameplay (perks) is locked behind a massive grind that requires up to 70 hours to level a single killer/survivor to max, and that's assuming you make a substantial amount of points in every single match. The gameplay loop for survivors is hold M1 on a generator and press space in the small circle that occasionally pops up, or run in circles as you get chased by the killer.\n\nThere's no actual fear or really any semblance of impressive gameplay, just run in circles and hold one button while rarely pressing another. Killer side, you run in circles and try your best to catch survivors while eating up to four second-chance perks that are constantly run in every match by any competent player. You'll be consistently frustrated, and despite the lack of an in-game communication feature many groups you face will be on discord calling out movements and giving each other an unfair advantage that invalidates most information-giving perks survivors would normally have to use. \n\nThe licensed killer/survivor DLCs are a gimmick, not a game-seller. Yes you can play as a character from Stranger Things, Myers from Halloween, Freddy from Nightmare On Elm Street, things of that nature. No, they do not inherently make the game more enjoyable.\n\nGetting into the playerbase, it's nothing but toxicity and frustration with a game that barely functions in the best of times. Slurs are thrown around in postgame, people wish death on you, your family, your dog, whatever. There are the occasional good eggs but most of these are drowned out by the absolute cesspool that is that 99%. \n\nNow, if you needed yet another negative. There are a few cosmetics you can earn ingame through a massive grind-fest, but prices are inflated so you will be encouraged to spend real money on the extra premium currency to buy things. Did I mention that this $20 game with another $120 worth of DLC and hundreds of dollars in premium cosmetics also has a paid battle pass system added on? If that's not enough to dissuade you, you must have a wallet of iron or REALLY just love horror icons running around like Scooby-Doo villains. Give this game a hard pass, save yourself hours of your life that you won't get back. Play something more enjoyable with more value for the base game price.","timestamp_created":1605214562,"timestamp_updated":1644909631,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53987729549407959","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79167471","author":{"steamid":"76561199092738245","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1634685643},"language":"english","review":"good game \n","timestamp_created":1605214476,"timestamp_updated":1605214476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79167401","author":{"steamid":"76561198400656260","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1658694209},"language":"english","review":"good game me want more partnered dlcs","timestamp_created":1605214382,"timestamp_updated":1608759819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79167345","author":{"steamid":"76561198373513471","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1613956756},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenardo","timestamp_created":1605214314,"timestamp_updated":1605214314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4dOO3/UCcff/rQI="}
