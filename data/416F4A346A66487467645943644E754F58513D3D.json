The reason I mention the hype is because much of the game's changes appear to have been influenced by loud groups of players, which in turn has prioritized certain game features over fixing game bugs. It has a few bugs, the worst of which are getting stuck in an incapacitated position, getting stuck on hills, wraiths being able to attack from cloak mode, and playing matches with more than four players at a time. There seems to be no solution for them right now. A lot of kinks have been worked out since release, though. Despite these bugs, the game is very thrilling and capable of creating those \"OH SHIT\"/badass moments in game when you save teammates and they in turn save you, when you survive by the skin of your teeth, throw a pallet on the killer just in time to escape, hop off the hook with 5% chance, crawl to the hatch to escape, hide in the grass as the killer walks past you, power up the gate just as the killer approaches, as he chases you, outwit the killer and dip out just in time to escape his line of sight, run into the basement and save the guy who thought no one had the balls to save him, burn the wraith with the almost useless flashlight giving you just enough time to escape... or when the killer tricks you and you die, feeling like you've been outplayed. On the other side, as killer you have to trick the survivors, and there are few feelings that match that of completely annihilating a group of survivors or slapping the cocky grin off of Claudette's face when her victory twerk at the gate is met with No One Escapes Death, and you carry her back to a hook. Dead by Daylight might not scare you after a while, but it will still get your blood pumping and your adrenaline kicking in as you hunt and play with your prey or try to not mess up at all and die gruesomely for it. I would recommend it for the $20 price, as you can also play with friends in ranked or offline in a Kill Your Friends mode, which can be hilarious as one of your friends as the killer tries to intimidate the rest of you. Yes, this is a game where you can get loose and silly with friends while trying to kill and save each other. There are downsides, and they're annoying, but DBD offers more fun and legendary memories than it does frustrated ones.","timestamp_created":1468993046,"timestamp_updated":1468993046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519125699996948242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24420001","author":{"steamid":"76561198249922202","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3855,"last_played":1547885413},"language":"schinese","review":"用屠夫献祭了3个还没够10000分，怎么设定的？","timestamp_created":1468992340,"timestamp_updated":1468992340,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24419950","author":{"steamid":"76561198046325898","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":976,"last_played":1533726119},"language":"english","review":"1) Loads the game\n2) Gets friends to play Survive with Friends\n3) ready up\n4) Game not found.\n5) Repeats Step 2 and 3 until game is found. \n\n***1 hour later***\n\n1) Game found\n2) All players are ready and game is loading\n3) Gets chased by the Killer whole game \n4) first to die \n","timestamp_created":1468992022,"timestamp_updated":1468992022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24419918","author":{"steamid":"76561198271922331","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":86,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1481947358},"language":"english","review":"i dont like this game becuase i cant even play it\n","timestamp_created":1468991864,"timestamp_updated":1468991864,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24419669","author":{"steamid":"76561198234848996","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1471875725},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好玩的，很刺激","timestamp_created":1468990143,"timestamp_updated":1468990143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24419614","author":{"steamid":"76561198137658716","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":114240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1138,"last_played":1633200693},"language":"thai","review":"HEY!!!

Alternativ kann der letzte Überlebende durch eine Bodenluke entkommen, welche sich erst öffnet wenn mindestens 2 Generatoren aktiviert worden sind und nur noch ein Überlebender übrig ist.\n- Als Killer will man natürlich alle Opfer niederstrecken (1. Schlag verwundet, 2. Schlag streckt nieder oder ein Treffer mit der Kettensäge streckt auch nieder). Danach das Opfer über die Schulter geworfen (die winden sich dann noch, also nicht zuviel Zeit lassen) und an den nächsten Fleischerhaken mit den Jungs & Mädels. Das mysthische Böse \"der Entitus\" wird sie sich nach ein paar Minuten holen und sie dadurch entgültig aus dem Spiel nehmen. Bis dahin können die Opfer aber noch befreit werden.\n\n\nWie spielt es sich?\nDie ersten Stunden gehen rum wie im Flug. Als Killer pulsiert das Adrenalin und die Vorfreude endlich junge, unschuldige Menschen jagen und schlachten zu dürfen, als Opfer kauert man hinter Bäumen und Felsen um dem suchenden Blick des Killers zu entgehen. Von der Stimmung her einfach nur nice. \n\nLangzeitmotivation?\nDas Spiel hat von der Grundmechanik keine große Abwechslung zu bieten. Jagen, reparieren, jagen, entkommen, jagen, sterben, reparieren, jagen, reparieren, jagen, etc und dennoch gleich keine Runde der anderen. Ist der Killer ein Camper so sind jene die am Haken hängen unrettbar verloren, wogegen die übrigen in Ruhe die Generatoren reparieren können und entkommen. Ist der Killer jagdhungrig, gibt es deutlich mehr Aktion. Spielt man als Team oder lieber als Einzelgänger...\n\nIch habe die letzten 100 Stunden viel Spaß gehabt und auch wenn das Spiel  stückweise wie eine Betaversion anmutet finde ich, dass für ~20€ ein schönes Spiel mit viel Potential auf einen wartet. Das Entwicklerteam ist klein, also wird dieses Spiel noch einige Zeit in diesem Zustand verbringen, aber wer sich an sowas nicht stört, der macht mit Dead by daylight nichts verkeht.\n\nImmer noch unsicher, ob das Spiel was taugt?

Örtlichkeiten auf diversen Maps an denen es für den Killer so gut wie unmöglich ist den Überlebenden zu erwischen\n- leider teilweise egoistische Community, die nicht versteht, dass es in diesem Spiel um Teamplay geht (hierfür kann jedoch der Entwickler nichts)\n- Killer, die disconnecten, wenn sie merken, dass sie die Runde nicht gewinnen können, die Folge: Die Überlebenden bekommen keine Punkte für's Entkommen \n- Spieler, die disconnecten, sobald der Killer sie erwischt hat\n- Killer, die am Opferhaken campen und es somit mehr oder weniger unmöglich für die anderen Überlebenden machen, das Opfer zu retten\n\nDas sieht zwar auf den ersten Blick recht viel aus, reicht jedoch nicht um den Spielspaß bei mir zu trüben.\n\nPositives:\n\n- unglaublich spaßiges Spielkonzept\n- teilweise doch tolle Teams, die es verstehen MITEINANDER zu arbeiten und sich gegenseitig zu helfen\n- bisher noch keine einzige Beleidigung im Lobbychat mitbekommen\n- unglaublicher Adrenalinpegel beim Spielen (bei mir persönlich als Killer sogar noch einen Ticken mehr als als Überlebender)\n- das Levelsystem finde ich super, vorallem da man ab einem bestimmten Level gut überlegen muss, in was man seine Blutpunkte investiert\n- trotz immer gleichem Spielablauf keine Eintönigkeit (zumindest bei mir nicht)\n\n\nIch würde dieses Spiel jederzeit weiterempfehlen, vorallem da ich stark davon ausgehe, dass noch einiges seitens der Entwickler kommen wird. Ich freue mich auf neue Maps, Killer usw.\n\n","timestamp_created":1468962186,"timestamp_updated":1468962186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24414760","author":{"steamid":"76561198148897669","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1077,"last_played":1645392769},"language":"german","review":"Also meiner Meinung nach ist das Spiel den Erfindern gut gelungen, Naklar gibt es mängel an manchen Situationen, aber trotzdem macht das Spiel sehr viel Spaß.

I've played this game for about 24 hours of my time and I've acquired a good feel for the game, thus allowing me to give this opinion.\n\nPros of the game -\n\nVery thrilling - Whether you're the butcher or the cattle, this game makes you feel every moment of the nail biting tension; narrowly dodging the crazed swing of the Killer whilst diving over a window feels great and I've let out more than one cheer when I've caught a pesky survivor infinitely spamming through windows by outsmarting him.\n\nSatisfying - For me personally, I find this game satisfying either as survivor or as killer. As a survivor it's satisfying to narrowly evade the killer, rescue your hooked friends, just escape through the hatch or the exit in the nick of time, laughing in the face of the killer as you dance away into the night. However, your experience as a killer is fun too, whether you play Trapper, Wraith or Hillbilly, you'll feel smug satisfaction when you catch an over-confident survivor attempting to rescue a friend or foolishly repairing a generator next to your bear trap. There's also an odd satisfaction to be gained in watching the survivor struggle against the Entity, knowing their friends are waiting for you to leave but you stand there, watching and waiting.\n\nVariation - The game, despite some of its drawbacks, is immensely varied. This is achieved through an offering system which allows you to influence the game to gain additional bloodpoints, affect your vision on the map or even spawn yourself further away from the killer. Additional bloodpoints in certain categories certainly encourages people to play in different styles every game e.g. objective spamming, pissing off the killer or helping your friends, all in the name of bloodpoints. This also ensures that the game does not devolve into a one sided beating for either faction every game, leading to games where survivors escape under 5 minutes or the killer silently eliminates the survivors without a single soul escaping.\n\nAtmospheric - Whilst certain mechanics in the game do break immersion at times, overall I found the game to be the best \"horror movie experience\" I've had thus far in a game. Admittedly the heartbeat mechanic (essentially a mechanic letting you know when the killer is near as a survivor) does add tension, I think it would add even more tension if they removed the heartbeat mechanic, leaving you wondering whether the killer is 100 feet away or 2 feet behind. Map design, corners and escape mechanics add heavily to the atmosphere and the setting of the game by creating a world where the killer could be around every corner and only a clever pallet drop could be the difference between life and death.\n\nSomewhat Balanced - Mechanics in the game are clearly attempting to balance eachother out, whether it be the skill check mechanic for healing, generators and disarming traps; or the escape and catch mechanics for both survivor and killer. The game partially ensures that the game is not a cakewalk for either side providing both parties are competent and not abusing mechanics or camping.\n\nCons - \n\nMatchmaking - By far one of the most irritating aspects of this game is the elongated matchmaking times, whether you play with friends or alone, matchmaking is sometimes a chore and leaves me not wanting to play once I find a game. Whilst the devs are \"attempting\" to alleviate the issues, matchmaking with friends remains nearly impossible, often taking dozens of tries to even get into a lobby with other people.\n\nUseless Perks and Offerings - The Bloodweb mechanic in the game is an interesting form of progression, often leading to interesting choices in the latter levels of the web but ultimately, quite a few perks and offerings and items remain virtually useless and unviable in the game. For example, the Premonition perk for Dwight is basically useless, giving you a sound to indicate that the killer is in front of you when I already have eyes to tell me this myself. Also, flashlights and maps are basically unviable as the self-heal and medkit mechanics and perks are basically the best perks in the game.\n\nAbuse of Mechanics - In my opinion this is the most broken and annoying aspects of the game. The animations and vaulting mechanic in the game are prone to abuse by survivors due to the killer being slower to vault through windows and having to smash pallets slowly to get through them. Infinite Juke spots (essentially escape spots where the killer can NEVER catch a survivor) are a common sight in the game and often entangle the killer with one survivor whilst the other 3 repair generators. Eventually the killer will either have to go and deal with the other survivors or risk losing the game and perhaps even being entangled in more infinite juking. Just to re-iterate, the killer can never catch the survivor if they abuse these locations properly and the game rewards the survivor by forcing the killer to leave and allowing them to escape.\n\nHook Camping - To be fair, this is the only way that killers can actually win the game, due to the infinite jukes and the idiotic escape hatch mechanic. Essentially, killers are forced to wait by hooks to ensure that the survivors don't unhook their friends and heal them, thus losing out on their prey and perhaps even all 4 survivors escape.\n\nPointless and slow animations - For the killer, slow and pointless animations are a staple of their gameplay. For example, if you work hard to catch up to a survivor and strike them, you are instantly bound into an animation where you wipe blood on your sleeve and the survivor gains a speed boost. This essentially rewards the survivor for being struck, as self healing and team healing are easy to do with medkits or even without medkits, thus rendering the first strike of the killer in favour of the survivor. Other animations that are prone to exploitation are the bear trap animations, which take far too long and allow survivors to potentially run right past you without you noticing and even give them time to unhook their friends whilst you deploy a bear trap underneath them.\n\nDisconnecting and Lack of Punishment - People can simply disconnect from their game if they are struck by the killer and caught or they just don't feel like playing. They don't lose anything meaningful or valuable and aren't punished with a cooldown for abandoning games, taking away bloodpoints from friends and killers alike. This remains a pivotal issue in the game and usually occurs in 1/3 games that I play. It's annoying for the killer because he/she loses potential bloodpoints and punishing for the survivor because they lose a team mate.\n\nThe Hatch - This is more of a personal annoyance but it seems to reward the survivors for dying. Essentially, there are 3 potential exits for the survivors, 2 of which require 5 generators to power. The final exit is for the last man standing (yeah I assumed your gender >.<) and is a hatch in the ground which opens after 3 survivors are permanently killed. This hatch is campable by the killer and the last survivor and rewards the last survivor for essentially letting his team mates die, failing to complete the objectives properly and provides an easy way out for a lazy survivor. It also punishes the killer for killing 3 survivors and usually prevents them from gaining a 4th sacrifice for the Entity.\n\nI had and continue to have quite a bit of fun in this game but I'm not blind to the glaring flaws in the mechanics or ignorant of the fun and potential this game has. Ultimately this game is a fun experience if you're willing to overlook a lack of polish and tough out some douchebag abusers every few games. However, I wouldn't say this game is worth the €19.99 price tag but certainly worth €14.99 or even €10.00.","timestamp_created":1468947460,"timestamp_updated":1468947492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479797959327697754","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24410702","author":{"steamid":"76561198093308283","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1535883785},"language":"russian","review":"СОВЕТУЮ
