They certainly don't know how to deal with them, or how to solve problems.\nEvery single update they brought out, further reduced the balance of individual elements as well as the game as a whole.\nEven now, the game is a terrible mess where the killer has significant advantages and the survivors only have a tiny chance of surviving.\nThe chase part is not balanced, the map gen is still not fixed, progression is still whack.\nThe Huntress was an abomination of design. The entire game was built around killers who had melee range. In comes a killer with a RANGED attack. If you're in a chase against the huntress, you -cannot- win/evade it/her unless you play on a single specific map and get lucky. Now there's TWO ranged killers.\n\nEDIT 08-08-'16:\nThe devs still persist on lopsided fixes, only creating more problems instead of solving them. They're also officially responded to specific questions about overall or specific balance on which they did not give favourable replies.\nSome people intentionally change their download region, on which the matchmaking is still dependant at the time of writing, so they will lag a lot as a killer(and thus, host) for an easy gain in points. The devs cannot do anything against this, for there is no way to prove it.\nWith how the game is now; as soon as you're spotted by the killer, you have only a slim chance of breaking that chase and surviving. The maps are too open, the perks are too unbalanced, the game tailors too much to cheesy, exploitative attitudes and of course, the community has turned really toxic.\n/EDIT\n\nEDIT 10-07-'16:\nWith how the ranking system worked from launch onward until at least the time of writing this edit, I haven't gotten above rank 10 myself so that I get into games with more competent people.\nMy early review below reflects the lower half of matchmaking.\n/EDIT\n\nYou'd think since it is 4vs1, it'd be a team game.\nYou'd think it is a game that is balanced around teamwork.\nUnfortunately, the game frustrated to no end, because it is exactly what the devs wanted:\nThe game is all about egocentric playing and making the most out of every situation for your own good. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not what a lot of people expected at launch. A lot of players still don't seem to understand the basis; in the end, it's all about your survival, not making sure everyone gets out. Helping others is an extra optional challenge.\n\nExamples: If a teammate is captured and put on the time-out hook, killers that camp that hook are not punished.\nYet as a survivor the reward for saving someone off the hook is minimal, butt the risk tremendously large.\nIt is made worse by that if the killer quickly returns to the scene, he now has two targets. But who do you think is the more likely to get chased? The fresh survivor who unhooked the other fellow, or the one that was just rescued and is wounded, loud, slow and leaves a blood trail behind him?\nIdiots, newbies, assholes and the better players know this and will abuse it to no end. They will make you suffer for just a handful of extra points and/or their own survival.\nBecause they know that all they have to do is run faster than you, and they can get away safely with those extra points for rescuing you, whilst you go right back onto the hook.\n\nThis is just one example, but the entire game is in disbalance like that. Any points reward are instantanious, whilst any situation isn't.\nAfter coming off the hook, you still need to escape the area and avoid the killer until you get healed up. By someone else, or the use of an item you need to equip. But the points system doesn't give you anything for losing the killer in a chase and hiding.\n\nAs up to patch 1.0.2 and its hotfixes, all the devs have done to remedy any known issues is nerfing it on one side only, creating a lopsided experience.\nSurvivors endlessly abusing window vaulting on certain spots on the map was a problem for killers. Aside from the number of people willfully exploiting it, it was used because survivors often do not have the right perks or options on the map to get out to safety [i]without[/i] using such a cheesy tactic.\nBut instead of [i]adding[/i] more balanced options for survivors for that scenario, the devs 'fixed' it by nerfing the window cheesing. Creating more inbalance towards the killer, whilst the actual problem still persists.\nI find that nerfing mechanics is the wrong way to deal with balance issues.\n\nI'll most likely keep playing it now and then, because the 2016 summer sale was disappointing and what else am I gonna do?","timestamp_created":1467553615,"timestamp_updated":1532903215,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50574648380279541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24048797","author":{"steamid":"76561197972810663","num_games_owned":628,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1647125631},"language":"french","review":"On ne peut pas changer les touches, si t'as le TM dans ton pseudo steam il faut que tu le vire même si ça fait 7 ANS que tu l'a pour avoir la save de tes stats... si tu te fait choper le tueur RESTER a coté de toi jusqu'a que ce que tu créve donc voila une perte de temps ce jeux ...

Dabei geht es darum, dass die Survivor Generatoren reparieren müssen um die Ausgänge mit Strom zu versorgen und damit vor dem Killer flüchten können. Der Killer muss die Survivor aufspüren, jagen und töten. Letzteres kann er jedoch nicht selbst tun sondern muss die Survivor an einem Haken aufhängen. Die Survivor können versuchen sich selbst vom Haken zu befreien oder aber den Tod so lange herauszögern um von einem anderen gerettet zu werden. Hierbei ist zu beachten, dass es für Hilfe und Team Aktionen weit mehr Punkte gibt als wenn man stur alleine Generatoren repariert.\nAußer den Ausgängen gibt es auch noch die Möglichkeit eine Falltüre auf der Map zu finden um durch sie zu flüchten. Die Falltüre öffnet sich durch 2 Dinge:\n1. Man ist der letzte Survivor weil alle anderen bereits Tod sind oder geflohen sind\n2. Es gibt einen Schlüssel den man über das Blutnetz bekommen kann\nDas Blutnetz stellt eine Art Skilltree dar, wo man allerdings alles Skillen muss um im Level aufzusteigen und ein neuen Blutnetz zu bekommen. \nEs gibt aktuell 4 verschiedene Survivor und 3 verschiedene Killer wo jeder seine eigenen, ganz speziellen Perks freischalten kann. Aktuelle Maximalstufe liegt bei Lvl 50, danach kann man sich Prestige Level freischalten.\nAußerdem gibt es auch ein Rang System dass von 20 abwärts verläuft.\n\n[h1] PRO´s\t[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]eine komplett neue Art von Spiel\n    [*]Nervenkitzel pur\n    [*]sehr spaßig mit Freunden zusammen\n    [*]schaurige Atmosphäre\n    [*]das Spiel ist auf Teamplay ausgelegt, alleine erhält man kaum Punkte\n[/list]\n[h1] CONTRA´s\t[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][strike]aktuell keine *offizielle* Möglichkeit mit Freunden gemeinsam ein Öffentliches Spiel zu betreten[/strike]\n    [*]noch häufige Abstürze\n    [*]einige Bugs im Spiel aber auch in der Lobby zB Blutnetz leere Felder wo man nicht weiter skillen kann und daher kein     lvl up\n    [*]wenig Abwechslung weil immer der selbe Ablauf\n    [*]Camper verderben den Spielspaß und geben einem nicht die Möglichkeit zu fliehen/retten etc\n    [*]Entwickler verwerfen ihr eigenes Konzept leider viel zu schnell und geben bei allen Kleinigkeiten der Community klein bei. Kann man positiv oder negativ sehen. Für mich ist das eher negativ.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Anmerkung: Meine lieben Killer alias Dauercamper, hört bitte auf Leute am Haken dauerhaft zu campen. Das vermiest jedem das Spiel und bringt euch auch fast nichts. Ihr bekommt die meisten Punkte durchs Leute finden, jagen etc aber nicht beim rumstehen und den Leuten beim sterben zusehen. \nGenauso die Leute die nur alleine rumlaufen und niemandem helfen. Generatoren sind wichtig ja, ABER es ist ein Teamspiel und wenn alle zusammen spielen hat es der Killer ultra schwer. Ich erlebe es immer wieder, dass ich jemandem helfe, dann selbst am Haken hänge, 10 m. neben mir repariert jemand einen Generator, der Killer weit weg und der lässt mich verrecken! Leute ernsthaft mal.... was bringt euch das? Umso mehr Leute tod sind umso unwahrscheinlicher wird es das ihr selbst überlebt.

First of all, I wanted to say that the game is still consistently have updates and new content, in my experience I have a very few bugs in my matches, performance is fine on my mediocre PC in comparison with very good hardware on the market at 2021 November( mine is i5 10400, rtx2060s, ssd, win 10, 24 gb ram). \n\nSo what's with the issues and other stuff. \n1) Balance. Though game itself is probably in the most balanced state now in comparison with 2016 meta of 5bnps(brand new parts) and sabo gods, and later in 2017-2018 Nurses and Billies and on swf side keys and other stuff. Though the game still is a pretty survivor sided, especially for SWF(survive with friends) groups.\n2) MMR. new matchmaking system works very strange, sometimes as one killer you can be matched with low level survivors, and if you switch to the killer you mostly never play you can be matched with 5k hrs groups which is impossible to win. Solo survivor games as well are pretty much disbalance roulette where you don't know what people you will play with and killers are pretty much amazing every game. \n3) Perks, Mostly a lot of perks are still useless, but now more and more people running different builds and perks which is great in my opinion. \n4) Dead hard is still broken.\n5) Anti-cheat and report system is still very bad. Though there aren't many blatant cheaters, but there are quite many players who hack inventory and add-ons or items + legacy. And report system works very poorly.\n6) Maps are mostly broken as well in terms of balance, mostly survivor sided but sometimes game generates big open zones on maps without pallets at all.\n\nOverall I can recommend the game, but it's still very frustrating to play sometimes.","timestamp_created":1467543693,"timestamp_updated":1637791365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540389955043792725","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24044695","author":{"steamid":"76561198303634823","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1506184924},"language":"schinese","review":"GOOD","timestamp_created":1467543305,"timestamp_updated":1467543305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24044652","author":{"steamid":"76561197997021045","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2265,"last_played":1473788817},"language":"german","review":"Ein tolles Grundkonzept, welches viel Spaß verspricht.

Только вот в ней много багов и недоработок. Например: бывает такое, что меня из лежачего положения не может поднять маньяк, мои союзники так же не могут меня вылечить. Было такое, что союзники проваливались под карту, им оставалось только выходить из игры. Игр в таком жанре я не замечал, только Friday 13, которая выйдет в этом году и вряд ли будет такой интересной. Хотелось бы чтобы в игру добавили русский язык и возможность играть в ранкед с друзьями. DbD доставляет много удовольствия, рекомендую всем, над ней работают и скоро игра будет намного лучше!В игре есть маньяк и до 4 жертв. Есть три вида маньяка:Трапер(ставит ловушки), Билли(Ходит с бензопилой вместо одной руки), Анти - Натурал(Может становиться невидимым). И 4 вида жертв:Быстрая чувиха, чувак, который играет только в тиме, черная одиночка и Киркоров. У каждого маньяка есть уникальные перки, как и у жертв.Вам будет доступен неповторимый способ прокачки, генерируемый рандомно. Цель игры за маньяка: Постараться не дать жертвам сбежать и принести их в жерту(повесить на крюк). Цель игры за жертву: Завести генераторы и открыть дверь\\найти люк. Геймплей очень разнообразен - с каждым маньяком нужно будет чудить что - то особенное, так - же за маньяка - не каждая жертва будет простафилей со двора.
