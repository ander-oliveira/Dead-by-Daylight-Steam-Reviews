The premise, at first, sounds intriguing and almost enticing. But, it isn’t until you play for a while where you really learn how the game rolls.\nOf course, when four players are put against one, there are many powers and weaknesses that must be put into play to equal the playing field out, and this comes through the natural progression of leveling up and unlocking beneficial perks to aid in either your survival or carnage.\n\nWithout a friend to play with, the game immediately feels more lonesome, and you are forced to play with other random players. It is a game of luck as to whether your teammates will play the objective and try to survive with everything they can use, or if they turn towards the selfish route and don’t put forth any effort to help the team whatsoever.\nOften times, this can go for the killer too. Sometimes they are fair, and sometimes they will camp a survivor until said player is on the cusp of death with no second chance at trying to do anything.\nThis, paired with a plethora of perks and add-ons that the community deems “toxic” or “overpowered”, can lead to a notable problem of people lacking a fun, satisfactory gameplay experience.\n\nSo, the important part. Would I recommend this game personally? No.\nCan it be fun? Why yes, it definitely can!\nBut more often than not, you WILL be stressed about the littlest things. When the events of a game don’t go in favor of a certain team, they will be toxic in the post-game chat. If you stop helping the team for a noticeable amount of time, you will be called out.\nThis game’s community is known for being toxic, so unless you have a friend that you are comfortable with tackling the challenge of survival strategically, you will likely become frustrated at some point in time.\n\nThere is a lot of experience and things that go into successfully winning matches consistently, so if you are up for the task, I’d say give it a shot. Just be prepared for whatever might be thrown your way.","timestamp_created":1572932633,"timestamp_updated":1575160689,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301835060119629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56536832","author":{"steamid":"76561198441336164","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":32745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14893,"last_played":1639493902},"language":"schinese","review":"我们的bug没有游戏","timestamp_created":1572932193,"timestamp_updated":1572932193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56536775","author":{"steamid":"76561198969720285","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4010,"last_played":1579587529},"language":"english","review":"gr8\n","timestamp_created":1572932100,"timestamp_updated":1572932100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56536658","author":{"steamid":"76561198194035939","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8265,"last_played":1631362473},"language":"koreana","review":"잘

Even started with a DbD mobile AP for \"Free\", it is literally a tradition to start a new project without finishing the others, or at least making them more playable. Also the Devs push out content every 3 months, cosmetics almost daily (Some are more expensive than the majority of \"indie\" games), new tomes roughly every 3 and half months, and rarely listen to the community despite asking for our opinion. \n\n2.-The Devs weird \"Fixing\" methods:\n\nFor every \"Patch fix\", there will ALWAYS be a new bug ready to kick in, for some people, is only natural that it is considered the bread and butter of DbD, plus, it won't be fixed completely at 100%, step by step, not baby steps tough, more like a premature baby, it will take more time to truly find the meaning of the word \"Fixing\".\n\n3.-The community in general:\n\nThere is a simple phrase that I like to remember a lot: \"A toxic game, means a toxic community\", and this is not an exception, the meaning, is that this game has more discussions than any other game I have in my library,it means that the people are not completely happy, instead, are annoyed, mad, sad, arrogant or just being Toxic, etc. For the first time in many years that I had been on Steam, I commented and even posted on almost everything related to DbD community on some topics, I never had the need to do that for a game that was supposed to be fun, but instead, it is frustrating most of the times, knowing that it will be the same thing over and over again with the majority of players who doesn't even care about the others, only to harm and fill their egos and lack of achievement on real life. Facebook community is more complicated, so I won't even bother to explain that. And the post-chat only purpose is for people to complain (usually at the killer).\n\n4.-Match search and ranking system:\n\nFor most people, what matters most is TIME, they don't care about the ranks as long they get to play in a match in a hurry, for others, ranks maters, because it reflects the \"gameplay experience\" of the survivor and killer \"in a way\", but the main trouble is that the match searching and the rank system is a total joke, I seen full higher rank (Red) survivor playing against a killer with the lowest rank (Brown) and vise versa. This is nothing new at all, and one time, not too long ago, there was a bug achievement that changed a lot of players way of thinking, ranks didn't matter anymore and since the system is broken, there is not much hope for new players if they get easily frustrated for that matter and such.\n\n5.-The servers:\n\nLag, is the true enemy of every player, but when we talk about quantity over quality, is important to explain this, the servers are in bad condition, more people playing at the same time, means that lags can get even worse as you play, survivor or killer, it affects everything and everyone, since the pandemic started, all went to crapper and USA and Canada seems to have less trouble with this, but still, in other countries, is just harsh.Time will change, since the devs told us that they are working on it, but it will take time.\n\n6.-The GAMEPLAY:\n\nWe should never forget that this is a game of 4 vs 1 player.\n\n-SURVIVORS: \n\nMost of the time, survivors tends to play with each other as commonly know as SWF (Survivor With Friends or Surviving With Friends) as 2, 3 or even as a full team, meaning that they have better communication and strategy, planned perks and items with add-ons or nothing at all, all can be organized, if they have experience or know what they are doing. BUT...solo survivors are the true players of the game, since that was the main idea for randoms meeting each other and survive with no plans at all, but you know how things can change in a blink, SWF are troublesome, since not all players are good, some are worst than others, take your pick, playing with someone who knows a lot, a veteran, pro, whoever, can help them reach higher ranks, at the cost of earning personal gameplay experience, I seen a lot of red ranks with the mentality of brown ranks, and guess what...vice versa, this is were it gets complicated, since the matchmaking tends ruin almost everyone fun. SWF are usually toxic, T-bags and such other toxic behavior is presented to 70 and 90% of the time. And that's bad for the Killer and solo survivors, since SWF can change the course of the match depending of the killer ability to stop them and outsmart them, and as for the solo survivor...is a nightmare, Just convince a friend to play with you, not all of the SWF groups are toxic, but a lot of them get cocky and entitled when they're winning.\n\n-KILLER: \n\nPretty normal the main reason why people buy this game in the first place, me for example, I'm a fan of horror movies, specially SAW, so that is why I bought the game on discount on a christmas eve with the DLC included, anyway, a true nightmare if you are new playing against veteran survivors, with all the bugs, crashes and bad rank system that happen very often, it doesn't surprise me that people can get really annoyed or tired of playing killer, some killers aren't not common on high rank match, for example, Pig, Ghost face and  Demigorgon, not high top tier, but unlike some killers, that are MORE common on high ranks are Nurse, Spirit and Hillbilly, it gets annoying seeing them every match, and that is sad. BUT, it doesn't mean ALL killers are bad, it depends on the PLAYER, the best example I can think of is the Clown, he has the worst map control of all killers, but with the right perks, right add-ons and knowing all maps pretty well, can guarantee to earn a lot of BP. Its normal for killers to fail into killing a full team, 3 survivors, 2 or just 1.The problem with tunneling, face camping and slug is because being toxic or the \"Gen rush\", but that's another story. \n\nIts indeed a toxic community, since both sides are treated like garbage, it is a cycle that never ends, but I consider both main survivors and killers very complicated, playing both sides will make you understand more and being polite and humble could change everything, but that's just a dream.\n\n7.-Streamers and POSERS:\n\nPeople buy stuff because they just saw someone having fun with it, but what they do not know is that just because a game is popular, doesn't mean is good at all, a lot of people plays the game just because, most people doesn't even know the memes, basic knowledge of horror movies, other games, or anything else, and the majority only plays survivors because SWF is a good and sad way to get higher ranks and iridescent Shards with not much effort, plus more blood points if they coordinate with offerings for extra BP, etc.\n\nPopular streamers like \"Monto\" and \"not otzdarvaI\"  can make the game look fun and easy, but its not, they were at the very BEGINNING of the game, and they know how annoying and sometimes boring it can get the majority of their match, but, they are just doing their job as streamers, sponsoring products and other stuff. Unlike some other streamers whose main purpose is to be toxic, arrogant and being an entitled player, I won't mention them, because the community already knows who they are, you can ask them yourselves!\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIf you want to buy the game, do it, but with DISCOUNTS, Halloween and Leatherface DLC are the only DLCs that will provide you with useful tools. The rest you can either buy with play time or are only useful if you're invested in the franchise, and if you're willing to have a lot of mood changing, fine, just be prepared to drink a lot of toxic juice and avoid being a potato, pray that the servers won't fuck you up and the community won't crush your soul down!","timestamp_created":1572924154,"timestamp_updated":1591435209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608704686164855957","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56531366","author":{"steamid":"76561198254169501","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":129956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123675,"last_played":1658740619},"language":"spanish","review":"juegazo","timestamp_created":1572924065,"timestamp_updated":1572924065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56531146","author":{"steamid":"76561198302854147","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11706,"last_played":1581120428},"language":"english","review":"fun to troll","timestamp_created":1572923769,"timestamp_updated":1572923769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56530864","author":{"steamid":"76561198953696428","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6356,"last_played":1655467399},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏现在改的还行（来自一个玩了105小时的憨憨的发言","timestamp_created":1572923390,"timestamp_updated":1572923390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56530774","author":{"steamid":"76561198141519515","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":72059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1113,"playtime_at_review":35556,"last_played":1660415303},"language":"english","review":"Would recommend if you like intuitive gameplay that requires skill.
