评测的平衡性什么的我不了解也不讨论，这两天万圣节打折，正好之前对这个游戏感兴趣就趁着这次打折入了，再买这前看到玩家们的评测大多都是不推荐这款游戏 ，其原因大多就是优化差，平衡性差。\n这对我这种娱乐玩家来说都不重要，于是还是入了这个游戏，从进游戏就真切的体会到优化是不太好，为此还专门去网上找游戏卡帧的解决办法，最后终于算是有点成效，不是那么卡了，不影响基本的游戏体验，可能和大多数新手一样，被各种怼，然后我就想是不是太心急了，没做新手教程就直接开始游戏，我就想做一下新手教程熟悉一下游戏，结果我发现这个游戏没有新手 教程，就只有几个给新手看的短片，我心想算了，没有就没有，自己一点点摸索，因为开始总玩人类，都是匹配5分钟，存货30秒的那种，我就决定玩屠夫，想着杀光他们，然后悲剧就来了，我用的隐身屠夫，但是我总感觉人类可以看到我 ，他们离得远远地就看着我，我一靠近他们就放下一块板子，然后靠这块板子周旋，我去踹板子他们就跑没影了。再后来我发现我一个屠夫径直赛跑跑不过人类，我心想肯定是遇到老司机了，还在吐槽游戏的匹配设置，但是当到游戏结算界面的时候我才知道，什么都是放屁，什么老司机，高手，滚一边去，就是一群改档的煞笔，20段全满级技能，他们那是不是外挂我不知道，我只知道他们这样我没法玩，我不怕被虐，不怕输，但是我怕被不公平对待，都是花钱玩的游戏，凭什么他们开挂逍遥法外，我就去网上查关于这个游戏外挂的一些问题，发现好像这个游戏外挂横行有一段时间了，也没人管，所以我选择放弃，游戏那么多凭什么就跟他玩命呢，我说这么多就是想告诉那些对这个游戏感兴趣，但是还没买的玩家说，可惜的好游戏，他并不值得你去为它花钱，因为他不会让你开心。","timestamp_created":1477734479,"timestamp_updated":1477734479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461506366729736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26286768","author":{"steamid":"76561198083661066","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":32813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1288,"last_played":1656237549},"language":"english","review":"THE

te salven hasta que te mueras ,despídete de tus objetos, ofrendas, accesorios ,y si no hiciste mucho durante la partida tendrás poco puntaje y bajaras de rango, por otra parte si te toca alguien que sepa jugar dejara que te salven porque obtendrá mas puntos al haber  persecución, ataque, enganche, desangrado, etc. \nHay asesinos se lagea para ganar, ya que él es el host y no hay manera de ver el lag, solo podemos probar en el chat, si se demora en mostrar lo que escribiste es que es un lag y cuando empiece la partida será aún peor, otros lo que hacen es lagearse cuando empiece la partida, de esa manera uno no se da cuenta por medio del chat.\nRecomiendo que juegues con amigos, si juegas solo tú, te tocan supervivientes que se desconectan, no saben jugar, si eres rango 1 te tocaran gente que sabe jugar ,pero me ha pasado a veces que yo y el asesino somos rango 1 mientras los demás son rango 20 (noobs) y tú solo no puedes hacer todo.\nDepende te tu país ,zona horaria para que encuentres gente, no es un juego que juegues con personas de todo el mundo ya que no hay servidores, un ejemplo si es de noche y en tu país no hay mucha gente jugando ,el juego buscara usuarios en un rango más amplio que ya no solo sean personas de tu país y así sucesivamente, hasta que encuentre supervivientes si eres asesino, en el caso de supervivientes es más fácil encontrar asesinos pero ya sabes a lo que te enfrentas(lag,camp,etc).\nAgrego:\nEl juego se vuelve repetitivo, al principio te va a encantar pero con el tiempo ya te vas dando cuenta, ejemplo:\nEl asesino: Generadores, persecución, atacar, enganchar, matar.\nSuperviviente: generadores, sigilo, persecución, escapar o morir\nEl juego se centra en la persecución, encuentras lo divertido en eso, nada más.\nSi juegas como asesino te costara tiempo acostumbrarte con cada personaje, encontraras gente que sepa jugar, lugares de trolleo donde te hacen perder mucho tiempo, gente que te va a fregar cada rato con la linterna, que se hagan más rápido con la caja de herramientas, que son equipo y se hablan con un programa externo y les informan donde estas, etc.\nTendrás que usar ofrendas, accesorios, habilidades para contrarrestar al superviviente.\nComo superviviente tendrás que saber esconderte, lugares donde podrás escapar, hacerle perder tiempo, trabajar en equipo ,hacer generadores sin fallar, enfrentarte a asesinos tramposos que campean, se lagean, etc. \nMejor jugar con amigos en equipo para tener un mejor desempeño durante la partida, pero del asesino no se sabe cómo te va a

I may just be lucky on that part. \n- The controls can be a little weird, especially the quick-time stuff, but it just takes a few rounds to get used to.\n- I've had issues with parts of the map not quite loading, but those are usually fixed with the updates.\n\nI don't mean to rattle on, but this is one of the most addicting games I've played in a long time.

I went from being cautiously optimistic about this game to it being one of my favorite games to play, on any platform. \n\nThe developers have created a pretty unique world, with some really cool characters. I like how they focused on creating their own world with each character having unique perks, fixing bugs, adding in things, etc.. before they went with a licensed DLC. With that, I am referring to the Halloween/Michael Myers pack that was released. IMO, it was very smart to do this with the Friday the 13th game coming out next year, helps this game compete. \n\nMy only complaint about this game is I wish it had dedicated servers instead of P2P connections. This would solve the lag and disconnects , that happen sometimes. Otherwise, the game is an absolute blast.\n\nIf you have friends to play with it's definitely worth picking up and honestly even if you don't you should still get it.
