Thus, the better community, the better gameplay. You feel urself very comfortable. Community of DBD is very good. People play match, because they want to win. Nothing is instead of. And ofc developers are gettin' their impact in community by creatin' punishments for toxics, campers, etc.\n2)Graphics\nIt sounds weird, but the first impression is visual. Graphics are medium. Not bad, but doesn't consist of sth impressive, so don't be afraid of this part.\n3)Gameplay\nIt's the very enormous theme. On a 1st glance a concept is simple: 4 survivors and a killer. But it's divided on a lot of parts. At first survivors need to fix generators, a killer is defendin' 'em. And then perks break into a match. If killer has a hex, survivors should to destroy totems before fixin' generators. A killer also is messing survivors' life via catchin' 'em and placin' some traps. They should help 'emselves to win. If 3 survivors have died and have fixed a generator, the last is to find a hatch. A killer can close a hatch and start the collapse. The last survivor is to open the 1 of 2 gates.

Also back when infinite-loops were common and where gens took three years and the blessing of a catholic priest to finish. Since its first debut to now and I have to say.\n\nI'm not impressed.\n\n---[Money and How to Make it]---\n\nThe game is 20$. Seems fair for the amount of hours I have right? Well hush that mouth and mosey on down to the DLC section. I'll wait.\n\nDid you see the price? Right pretty big. But the game is constantly on sale right? 50%? 60%? Alright that turns that 144 into 72$ at an average ontop of the 20$ pricetag. \n\nNow hold on there partner, you're thinking \"That's only 92$!\", but you haven't factored the riftpass for those epic fortnight charms. That brings it to 102$, oh wait you wanted to hop on down to the store and get a nice Auric Cell exclusive skin? Well pardon my french but that's another 10-15$ from you. 122$, my word it must be the holidays and you splurging out that sweet december-funds dough aren't you?\n\nWhat's that now? A new killer and survivor? With new Meta Perks? Well tan my hide that's another 7$, oh pardon me it was a licensed killer, that'll actually be 12$. \n\n134$ to get all the bells and whistles, some of which you'll actually need to play competitively because Lord knows the Secret Shrine doesn't know how to pump out those goldmines.\n\nWhat's that? You don't want to spend that kind of money? Well you **could** play freemium and earn the non-licensed killers with some shards that take you half a century to earn. Ontop of the grinding you'll have to do to actually unlock the perks once you manage to unlock the survivor/killer of your choosing. You'll be trading that 134$ for about 250 hours of gameplay at a minimum, and that is at a disadvantage. You won't have the same perks and trades as some of the folks that have money to throw around.\n\nWhat's that? You don't have 1000 hours to spend on a game that can't decide what it wants for itself? Well my friend you've never played Dead By Daylight.\n\n---[Consistency, Updates and the Ire]---\n\nThe game has been getting a steady flow of updates, and horrible intangible bugs that run within it. But you know I say updates but I should say \"updates\". With a loose tongue and a bit of gold at the tip, because that's exactly how these \"updates\" feel.\n\nYou know the type of updates where the community is begging to change one simple thing for several months then finally some news comes out with hype behind it. The crowd gathers around, children and their mothers gussied up for the unveiling of the ripe-red curtained to be pulled back and have the gods themselves answer our prayers that we've been asking for since Day 1 of release. \n\nOnly for the curtains to be raised to show some gold-painted donkey with tacked on red slippers that only *slightly* mitigates the problem and hell even sometimes causes more problems.\n\nWe ask for change, and we get a money-bundled killer with perks that fix *the meta*. We ask for balance and we get redone maps with horribly bugged out sections and minor boosts to things that should have been reworked years ago. \n\nWe as for consistency and the game is torn down, remade. And then torn down and remade again and each time it breaks the consistency and the balance somehow further. It becomes a never-ending cycle of having minute fixes for things that should've just been redone to work in the new mechanics, leading to more issues that are then also solved with minute fixes for things that should just be fixed in the first place. All behind a paywall and a \"new killer\" tag. \n\nThe only thing the updates have been up unto this point, consistency-wise is disappointing. But here is hoping the next update can fix the blunder of the last [6].\n\n---[Gameplay]---\n\nIt's one of a kind, and that's the problem there are no other games like it which means things like balance, mechanics and general fun is thrown to the wayside.\n\nWhy should they care right? F13th flopped, every other asymmetric that does a horror angle ends up not gaining as much traction.\n\nThey shouldn't have to worry about the fact that playing killer at some ranks is the equivalent of slowly poisoning yourself, that playing survivor without friends at every rank has the same feeling. \n\nOr about how some of the addons are actually detrimental to your play-style, how some of the perks are down-right useless and made obsolete by newer (Surprise surprise), streamlined options. How there's an incredibly boring meta, how some killers far outperform others in almost every way. How little there is to do for survivors besides gen-rush, because honestly what else is there to do? Totems?\n\nHow unfair the game can be, how steep the learning curve can be. Do you know it is common thought that those with less than 1000 hours in the game haven't really experienced or learned it? Hope you can memorize every perk, totem/survivor/chest/pallet and hatch spawn and also be able to remember the nuances and counter plays to every 164 perks there are, and ontop of that learn to counter every killer's ability ontop of the synergy with those perks they have, or else you'll have a bad time as soon as you hit purple-red, and I *do* mean you will have a bad time because there are much more of those than there are close or equally footed matches.\n\nBut enough about that, go ahead. Give it a try. Pick it up on Xbox Gamepass and try it out for yourself, or dig around for someone that has a copy or two and see if they'll let you take a spin on the toxic hurricane that is this flaming trashdump. \n\nEnjoy the occasional desync and anti-cheat mess up, the wonderful and beautiful people in the voice, I'm sorry, Post-Game Chat.

Design wise, most of the maps are just either forests/swamps with different names and have poor lighting where you can barely see anything and cornfields that hurt eyes. If you prefer to play as the killer, be prepared to endure lots of teabagging and toxic flamming. \n\nAs a killer, you deal with pallet after pallet after pallet slammed in your face. Most of the games are gen rushed which ends pretty much before you can even do much. If you don't have Hex:Ruin basically you're screwed, and if you do the totem usually gets cleansed within a minute. and then you screwed. The whole vicinity of this game relies on survivors deciding not to be serious and gen rush, for you to have any chance.\n\nI do not recommend this game and wished that I had just stayed on youtube watching people playing it instead, it certainly is alot more entertaining when you watch people edit out of the fun parts and not having to deal with this mess.","timestamp_created":1559210564,"timestamp_updated":1559210564,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521857917308807373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50953331","author":{"steamid":"76561198133388550","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":23096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":929,"last_played":1650915794},"language":"french","review":"Il m'a toujours fait de l'œil ce jeu, car Freddy, Jason, les méchants-qui-tuent, toussa, j'adooooore. Mais étant pauvre et trouillarde (non !) j'ai jamais passé le cap... J'ai sagement profité que le jeu soit gratuit récemment pour essayer avec des camarades de décès, donc pas une grosse expérience de mon côté mais après des débuts vraiment très très frustrants et rageants è_é (liste non exhaustive : on a eu le coup où le tueur qui host se déco au moment où on s'apprête à finir de réparer le dernier générateur APRES 50 TENTATIVES LAMENTABLEMENT REDUITES A NEANT / quand on débute, le tueur semble vraiment op, suffit qu'il connaisse la map et certaines strat' (la stratégie bien connue du campage perpétuel) et la game devient juste un cauchemar (dans tous les sens du terme) pour nous, pauvres victimes sans défense de la noobiness. Le mate qui se fait choper vers le début et qui décide de se déco comme un pleutre qu'il est. Les raclures de bidet qui ont oublié que ça reste un jeu où on doit teamwork pour survivre (SURVIVRE ! bon sang) et qui s'en battent la rate de ta face, et qui se barrent sans un regard en arrière en te laissant crever dans ton sang tout chaud. etc. etc. tant de haine et de mépris de la vie, tu vois.)\n\nAprès des parenthèses beaucoup trop longues, ben finalement je me suis surprise à vouloir réessayer, et réessayer eeeet ben j'ai fini par l'acheter, ce jeu de satan. Faut try hard un chouïa (Shuya c'est toi ?) et pas lâcher l'affaire pour saisir les mécaniques et commencer à espérer survivre un peu (comme dans tous les jeux tu me diras, certes. & sûr que c'est pas acquis mais quand tu vois que le tueur TE VEUT TOI et personne d'autre, que quoi qu'il arrive il s'acharne sur TOIII alors que tu n'es qu'une pauvre damoiselle en détresse qui ne sait toujours pas faire un test d'habilité sans tout faire péter, BEN ça t'énerve un toutpitipeu è_é) \nFin bon, c'est pas du try hard chiant et répétitif comme dans les BR que j'ai laissé tomber (coucou H1Z1 - non je n'ai pas 102 ans), y a de l'adrénaline, de la peuuur, du suspens, des hurlements sonores, du SANG @_@ (sauf sur la chair déchirée par le crochet pointu... ils font attention à notre sensibilité <3).... voilà voilà.\n\nJe recommande évidemment de jouer avec des amis, c'est beaucoup mieux (j'ai jamais eu l'occasion d'être à 4 amis contre le tueur, ça doit être le must de la vida). Le jeu est vraiment bien et addictif (cette envie de toujours mieux faire, se dépasser, aller plus loin... survivre finalement, oui :'), je débute juste donc j'ai pas relevé les bugs dénoncés par mes confrères de review. Je vis encore l'innocence des prémices, purs et immaculés, sans taches autres que celles que mon crétinos de perso laisse derrière lui après que cette sécrétion glandulaire de Freddy lui ait griffouillé le fessier bordelus è_é.... euh, les taches énoncées plus haut. Mais bon ça... A LA LIMITE. BON.\n\nA suivre... peut-être que je vais, de rage, le (ou me ?) jeter contre le mur d'ici deux jours, qui peut le dire ? Pour l'instant, je recommande, y a vraiment plein de façons de jouer à découvrir et explorer, pas mal de personnages sexy et répugnants et payants (merci Steam) qui ont chacun des caractéristiques propres (c'est pas du JDR intensif maiiiis on gère les compétences de nos perso, leurs items et la couleur de leur pantalon ! ce qui laisse encore davantage de manières de jouer et de stratégies subtiles et intelligentes à élaborer. - EEEEET on peut jouer des semblants d'Ellis ou de Zoey ! Vive les zombies.) \n\nIl a sûrement des tas de défauts mais ce que j'aime dans ce jeu, c'est qu'il est différent de tous les jeux en multi auxquels j'ai pu jouer, et il me permet de plonger moi-même au cœur d'un film d'horreur et ça, ça n'a pas de prix. (je te HAIS Myers) Parfois on s'y croirait vraiment, d'autres fois en revanche les gens ne jouent que pour les points ce qui donne des games relativement vides, parfois drôles certes, mais fondamentalement différentes de l'expérience attendue x) et où on voit le tueur planter les survivants une ou deux fois pour obtenir ses points avant de finalement les aider/troller et vice versa. Mais bon ça A LA LIMITE, c'est bon enfant. Faudrait juste pas que ça arrive trop souvent. \nCe jeu me maintient aussi loin de l'état de rage que d'autres me l'inculquent profondément (salut CS). Ça enquiquine toujours de mourir au début d'une partie et d'être la proie préférée du tueur jusqu'à la mort par embrochement, et ça énerve. Ben voui. C'est frustrant... mais au final c'est assez vite oublié en ce qui me concerne car je ne joue pas éperdument pour mon rang ou mes points. Je m'amuse quoi. Ouais. \n\nEn définitive, j'ai peur, je perds, je gagne et j'aime bien. Youpi youpla.

It used to be a very solid and fun experience that provided a lot of unique moments and challenged the player to be strategic and prepare for anything. It was really cool and always a blast. The addition of some of the most classic and beloved figures in horror was a wonderful cherry on top, all of whom worked well alongside the pretty solid original collection of characters the developers made themselves, though that quality become far more hit or miss as time went on. Actually, that summarizes the entire game's development cycle now. The developers actively silence, attack, and chastize their playerbase on forums, twitch, and other means. The updates have become more and more aggressive in their desire to nerf the killer side to the ground while giving survivors infinite second chances, methods of invulnerability, options to waste time and stall, and the most boring, unenjoyable, and toxic abilities/items/mechanics I have ever experienced in a video game. If I had to guess, this is most likely due to the development team having zero spine and folding like lawn chairs every time the community of survivor mains scream at them on Twitter, an odd trait many if not most survivor mains seem to have. Why this is I've never understood but its very much a reality unfortunately. The focus has become more and more on skins and monetization rather than actual content, regular game updates, and maintaining a quality live service model. They've become progressively more greedy and corrupt and genuinely could not care less what you, the player, think of that or them in general. They've also decided to actively push political and social stances, they personally hold, onto the playerbase and injected it into the game on more than one occassion. 90% of the community always express their displeasure when this occurs but the devs and many Youtubers who share these beliefs will silence you or outright ban you, be it from the game itself or their social platforms such as Twitch for example. There is now also the threat of, when playing killer, a survivor reporting you for harassment simply because you shit on them and they happened to have a \"gay pride\" cosmetic equipped. You did nothing wrong and merely played the game, but they've weaponized pandering into actual methods of removing you from the product you paid for. I haven't experienced this myself, though I have been threatened with it in the past, and I'm aware of others who have suffered this fate. The developers don't even address this issue, rather, deny its even something happening at all and that you're a lying troll for even suggesting otherwise. It doesn't help that, as the years have gone on, this game's playerbase and devleopment team have become more and more toxic. They are now some of the worst people to interact with, in any and every way, I've ever seen in a video game. Its borderline insane. Ultimately the history of DbD is a very sad one, from one of the greatest gems of gaming all the way down to where it is now, a festering and rotting wound on gaming as a whole. Its sad, disappointing, and entirely avoidable but the developers simply couldn't be bothered to care. It would probably be worth on sale for a few bucks but beyond that, avoid this game like the plague. The game's terrible and getting worse and the playerbase has been steadily dropping fast for months. Check SteamDB or SteamCharts yourself if you don't believe me.","timestamp_created":1559160404,"timestamp_updated":1658284295,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50934688","author":{"steamid":"76561198154423324","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":848,"last_played":1649469062},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom para jogar com os amigos, terror um pouco leve, bem divertido recomendo.","timestamp_created":1559160259,"timestamp_updated":1606499473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50934669","author":{"steamid":"76561198432180662","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":155134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":739,"playtime_at_review":71410,"last_played":1660274536},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pior que crack...","timestamp_created":1559160169,"timestamp_updated":1559160169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50934330","author":{"steamid":"76561198008086800","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":1616275051},"language":"english","review":"Very fun, thumbs up!","timestamp_created":1559158722,"timestamp_updated":1559158722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506667137145996094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50934254","author":{"steamid":"76561198115989013","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":12687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8095,"last_played":1658257174},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simulador de pique esconde com Assassino e Sobrevivente . \n\n>Se me camperar eu dou T-bag e quito !\n>Se me der Loop eu dou facecamp \n\nA comunidade que é tóxica ♥","timestamp_created":1559158403,"timestamp_updated":1559158403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50933703","author":{"steamid":"76561198369280098","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":65268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61234,"last_played":1658790202},"language":"english","review":"very ok. too much bugs","timestamp_created":1559156217,"timestamp_updated":1637778649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50933457","author":{"steamid":"76561197991233795","num_games_owned":842,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":6317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1650667493},"language":"english","review":"is good","timestamp_created":1559155243,"timestamp_updated":1559155243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50933206","author":{"steamid":"76561198283865786","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":132465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2246,"playtime_at_review":128811,"last_played":1660517212},"language":"english","review":"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2. 1/2 cup white sugar\n3. 1/2 cup brown sugar\n4. 1/4 cup water\n5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n6. 1 pinch salt\n7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced\n8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie\n\nDirections:\n\n1.
