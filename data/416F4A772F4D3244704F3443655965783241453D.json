If you get into a game as a survivor hopefully you will be lucky enough to finish the game without any suicides, D/C's, or face camping, if you are killer because of the smaller community there is a looooooong wait and if you get into a game with a 3-4 stack its best just to look for a new game. \n\nnow that you know this i can say i recently have only played survivor,  but as such i have learned that if you come at this game with a positive attitude and play just for fun and not get super angry or serious, this game is very enjoyable and whereas some of the above problems can sometimes still apply they are easy to ignore.  ( at least at low ranks)\n\ncurrent pros\n- fun interesting games with a variety of maps and killers\n- horror movie feel and different ambiances for each killer and map\n- usually pretty even games ( again as a survivor at low ranks)\n- not a completely toxic fanbase and actually some pretty chill people (low ranks) \n- easy to find a match as game grows\n- disconnects get punished but its not such a severe punishment that if your computer or internet fails you will feel it painfully \n- since the game grows the now dedicated servers try to pair you with even skill levels on both sides ( survive with frens excluded ) i do hear they are a problem at high ranks i just am not playing to get there\n- i hear crossplay is coming but not sure what is going on there\n \nas a casual player  there are only a few cons to work through ( and how i do it)\n\n - some toxic people who believe they deserve to win or everyone needs to play their skill level\n~~either quit  before chat comes up at endgame or and what i prefer to do say gg at the end of the game before people start talking and when i do this people seem to be nicer ( especially if you compliment people :) \n- suicides on hook\n~~ just play and if  you survive yo u do if you don't well just try to pip ( earn points ) and count that a win ( aka look for the small victories)\n- i dont play killer but abusive survive with frens ( i have played with 3 stacks that annoy me) \n~~ as survivor if you do swf just try to play and not bully, as killer just let them end the game quick, if they gunna be abusive then don't hook people and don't give chases (they will de pip)\n- some lopsides games\n~~ usually i just play it out these things happen in all

I love playing killer but I also play survivor and I've gotten to rank 10 or lower with either. Would I recommend this game? yes, but would I say it's a guaranteed finished game? No. This game has a very skilled high ranked system in which favors survivors, if you want to have a stress free fun game then play survivor, if you want a challenge play killer, which sounds incredibly backwards and strange for a horror game but. Currently the game is very broken it feels, where killers when it comes to a more intelligent and high skilled play level have a harder time winning than survivors. I could relate the games balance to something like league of legends, where as the skill level increases so does the game speed and the risk to reward value of certain playstyles. Some things become more viable than others (Running ruin all the god damn time as killer and so much Decisive strike as survivor) that other perks and addons become less viable and not just that but WHOLE KILLERS become less viable, simply because killers are the only characters in the game that have unique powers connected to them in comparison to the survivors that have nothing special besides bringing new perks to the game. Besides all the downsides, I've found myself to enjoy both sides of the game over time, it brings that horror itch I've been begging to scratch and somehow it has faster wait times than the game white noise. If you're playing survivor that is, the game itself has some kinks when it comes to actual gameplay but it's definitely heading in the right direction! While the devs have been very hesitant to respond to killer mains and very quick to buff a lot of things, they've more recently taken action to buff and debuff some things and try to rework others and while the dev team has been a bit static on changes they seem to actually take into account everybody's word when it comes to game balance. While I'd think the game needs a separation between casual and ranked gameplay, with people who play survive with friends and try their hardest and people who use instant downs and mori's whenever they play as killer, then the people who just want to have fun trying their own weird ass builds and seeing how it'd play out, I feel like it's developing in the right way, sooner or later it'll be an excellent game that I think anybody can hop into, but for right now I'd consider it an early access. Hop in if you'd like, let the devs know what you think. I can tell you this though, if you get hooked into it you do and you can't stop.","timestamp_created":1573180482,"timestamp_updated":1573180482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56732489","author":{"steamid":"76561198370341068","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":83,"playtime_at_review":8370,"last_played":1659767869},"language":"koreana","review":"이게임은

But it has one quality which I'm am so extremely unused to, coming from games like TF2 and CSGO: an active developer and fair monetization.\n\nThis recent 5th anniversary stream has made me realize that this game has one of the most loving developers that I've ever seen. They release an insane amount of content at a breakneck speed compared to Valve and Blizzard. \n\nNot only are the constantly releasing new killers, survivors, maps, gameplay mechanics, etc. They're also consistently revisiting older maps, killer, mechanics, and perks that are overpowered, underpowered, or just boring and bringing them up to the standards of the new content.\n\nAfter a good 400 hours a game time, and probably double that just discussing the gameplay and watching streams/videos from the community, I can safely say that the community is significantly less toxic that what is may seem. I remember when I first started playing, people where constantly bemoaning that the DBD community was the most toxic game that ever existed, but I can easily disagree. Racists, Homophobes, and generally distasteful people are usually shunned out of community circles in most cases. Discussion around the game is usually pretty civilized, especially when you compare it to games like LoL or CSGO.\n\nDead by Daylight has issues, I don't care enough to list them here. Buy the game and suffer through them yourself. You'll eventually realize that the game is worth its issues, and if you don't, play something else.\n\nIf you are going to play this game, I recommend you do this one thing: Join the community.\nWatch streams, debate in the forums, cry about what you think is OP in the community discussions. It's as fun as actually playing the game most the time.","timestamp_created":1573175756,"timestamp_updated":1621994241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56729172","author":{"steamid":"76561198068620431","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":49814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36685,"last_played":1631928822},"language":"english","review":"The developers genuinely don't give a shit about their fan base.

([i]Once you get a hang of the mechanics and what to do[/i])\n-The ranking system feels fair. The points and how they're earned push me to be a more well-rounded DBD player.\n-Surviving with friends is fun, KYF ([i]Though I don't play it much[/i]) is enjoyable as well.\n-A [b]PLETHORA[/b] of characters to choose from.\n-An even larger variety of perks to customize your character into [b]ANY[/b] play style you can think of.\n-Consistent patches and detailed descriptions of what has changed.\n\nCons:\n-[b]BUGS[/b] bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs\n-The fact that the plethora of characters and cosmetics to choose from is over [u]100$usd[/u] in total DLC\n-The feel that when things are going bad, they release content to satiate the masses.\n-The feel that they pump out so much content in a short span of time to specifically generate interest and make sales instead of fixing glaring issues.\n-The community, if you can even call it that, has devolved into toxic camping, tunneling, t-bagging, sandbagging, harassing jerkwads that take advantage of mechanics that, [b]WHILE IN OTHER GAMES ARE FROWNED UPON AND USUALLY REPORTABLE[/b], are totally allowed in the [i]\"reporting\"[/i] system of DBD.\n-([i]Correct me if I'm wrong[/i]) The devs taking input from large streamers and not smaller bits of the community?\n-The events are uneventful\n^ \nAs another reviewer put them\nv\n[i]\"Finally, DbD just gets stale. It’s the same game mode repeatedly. Events are nothing special and don’t add much of anything. Double BP, Moonrise, Summer BBQ, it’s all the same thing just with some nice décor and one extra meaningless objective like grab a lantern on your way out or do this special generator in particular. [u]It’s just boring and uninspired.[/u]\"[/i]\n\n\nThe community alone has been the set-off for me to finally write a review after 3 years. In the beginning, the community in the game wasn't that bad. The rise of jerks in the game, however, has scared off many players including me where I've had to take weeks off just to feel a [b]WANT[/b] to play again and even then it was small. The gameplay can't even be enjoyed when killers and survivors alike belittle you post game after playing like a bunch of toxic a-holes.\n\nTeammates will work with the killer, draw attention to you on purpose to kill you off, farm you for points, AFK or DC on you ([i]I get about a DC every 2-3 matches or so[/i]), or just be a general pain in the ass. Killers will camp you for the entire 2 minutes you're on a hook and allow no opportunity for rescue, hyper focus on one person at a time to kill them off or slug ([i]down people to the ground[/i]) from the get-go.\n\nBoth ends of the game's spectrum face challenges and toxicity, but the reporting system doesn't allow for it. The amount of times I've been told by members of the DBD community [i]\"It's not a bannable/reportable offense\"[/i] is ridiculous. Why isn't it? Why is this considered toxic and unjust in [b]ANY[/b] other game you may happen to play, but with DBD everyone just throws up their hands and says [i]\"Whatever\"[/i]? \nAre the devs doing anything to remedy the issue? After 3 years, I don't think so.\n\nI don't want to give this game a bad review. Despite all of the [b]GAME'S[/b] issues, I still enjoy playing it. I enjoy introducing people to it, teaching them, having fun with friends or streamers. The community, however... It's absolutely horrendous, has only gotten worse with time and proceeds to get even more unbearable. I preemptively sympathize to any person that buys or gets gifted the game, faces the doodoo community and doesn't want to play anymore.\nI think this is where I uninstall.\nI'd say it was a good run, but it was okay at best.\n\nI feel like the Metacritic and Gamespot reviews for the game say it for me, but...\nMetacritic\t\nPC: 71/100\nPS4: 64/100\nXONE: 58/100\n\nGameSpot\t\nPC: 6/10\n\n...I'd give it a hearty 6/10\nSorry to do you dirty after so long DBD, but it's about that time.","timestamp_created":1573168120,"timestamp_updated":1573169072,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":223,"votes_funny":31,"weighted_vote_score":"0.741358458995819092","comment_count":29,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56723845","author":{"steamid":"76561198945452688","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":120390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3880,"last_played":1656287699},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego tiene una temática interesante, lo recomiendo","timestamp_created":1573167310,"timestamp_updated":1573167310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56723808","author":{"steamid":"76561198109389927","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":63333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":903,"playtime_at_review":4664,"last_played":1660519908},"language":"english","review":"SPIRIT IS SO FUN TO PLAY AGAINST","timestamp_created":1573167269,"timestamp_updated":1573167269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56723717","author":{"steamid":"76561198438493528","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":14585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12280,"last_played":1646241682},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego sensacional, divertido e entretenido","timestamp_created":1573167135,"timestamp_updated":1573167135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56723577","author":{"steamid":"76561198169458901","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":51567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40885,"last_played":1658256156},"language":"polish","review":"tak","timestamp_created":1573166936,"timestamp_updated":1573166936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/M2DpO4CeYex2AE="}
