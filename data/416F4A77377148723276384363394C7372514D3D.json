That's important because you should null far older reviews. I would consider giving this game a mixed review, but if the choice is yes or no, I can't say yes.\n\nThis used to be a more casual game. You could play your favorite killer from movies, video games and television. The problem is they simply never cared to balance the game. Not only that, but the bugs every time they introduce anything. All save maybe one map is balanced to favor the survivor side. Survivors lose because they make mistakes more than the killer plays well.\n\nWhile I have met plenty of friends here, the introduction of a HIDDEN competitive ranking (MMR) keeps driving away friendly killers and survivors who tried to play the game well. Rather the opposite. Toxicness is encouraged as \"gameplay\". Too many people one killer and survivor just live out sociopath fantasies here. It may be a horror game, but it should be a fun one not a sadist simulator.\n\nWhether or not I play this, the player base has lost good people and often may drive away good new people. This is not healthy unless they remove the MMR and listen to the majority of players rather than themselves or a small fraction of players.","timestamp_created":1648072765,"timestamp_updated":1648072765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667060256004333496","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112717741","author":{"steamid":"76561198156387959","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3172,"last_played":1654189918},"language":"brazilian","review":"é baum................................................... só isso oque vc quer a mais?","timestamp_created":1648072440,"timestamp_updated":1648072440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112717598","author":{"steamid":"76561198997679224","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1612,"playtime_at_review":3703,"last_played":1660449586},"language":"english","review":"bussin","timestamp_created":1648072202,"timestamp_updated":1648072202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112717473","author":{"steamid":"76561198185886781","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":12859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":68,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1660350933},"language":"polish","review":".","timestamp_created":1648072013,"timestamp_updated":1648072013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112717436","author":{"steamid":"76561199066710053","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1293,"last_played":1648419970},"language":"latam","review":"Me cague toda","timestamp_created":1648071951,"timestamp_updated":1648071951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112717185","author":{"steamid":"76561198063628103","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":47860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47029,"last_played":1652494505},"language":"brazilian","review":"Baum.","timestamp_created":1648071618,"timestamp_updated":1648071618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112716825","author":{"steamid":"76561199224793170","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":44875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3982,"playtime_at_review":13151,"last_played":1660602755},"language":"english","review":"this game will make u go insane\n","timestamp_created":1648071051,"timestamp_updated":1648071051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112716683","author":{"steamid":"76561197966145202","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":142,"playtime_at_review":16933,"last_played":1660256515},"language":"german","review":"Einfach nur Buggy!

On the surface, it's glorified hide and seek. However, each Killer makes the game more unique and their add-ons even further that aspects. Survivors are all pretty much the same, save for the three unique perks each one has. Some are CLEARLY better than others, so its up to you to prioritize which you want to eventually pick up. The game /is/ a grind, but it's a fun one at least. Sometimes you won't even realize just how many currencies you aquired just from playing. Now this may not be true to everyone as skill levels may differ coming in but rest assured that if you want to get better, you can, it will just take time and practice. Overall, I think the game is fun and has a lot of potential to be a masterpiece. As it stands, however, it's a pretty fun and above-avarage experience.

It was an incredible original concept and an incredibly unique multiplayer experience. \n\nFast forward to mid 2021 and the game devolved into a dumpster fire. Constant updates, new mechanics, new perks and nerfs have made the game incredibly imbalanced.\n\nWith hundreds of unique perks available both Killer/Survivor limit themselves to the same 4-5 meta perks because they are the only viable way to win the game or gain bloodpoints for upgrades. Hundreds of perks are neglected and never used and Behaviour never tweaks, buffs, or nerfs perks adequately to balance them. *BE WARNED FOR NEW PLAYERS* Certain strong meta perks may only be available on P2P Survivors and Killers and if you don't spend irl money to purchase these characters or premium currency you will be at a massive disadvantage. \n\nThe game is strongly survivor sided due to perks and balancing issues and be very aware that playing as Killer is a grueling uphill battle from start to finish. Survive with Friends is gamebreaking and allows survivors on teams of up to 4 use comms on discord and communicate and warn each other about things the core game otherwise wouldn't allow without the proper perks. The Circle of Healing survivor perk is also gamebreaking with no signs of a proper nerf in sight. If you want to play Killer be ready for incredibly challenging, intense gameplay that allows for zero mistakes while teams of survivors dance around you effortlessly. Unless debuffs are added for playing in teams this imbalance will always make the killer's job much more difficult and frustrating, especially at higher MMR level.\n\nThe statistically least played Killers are nerfed for seemingly no reason while the strongest and most OP Killers are buffed or remain the same. Behaviour has no intention or care for some of their most neglected assets in order to pave the way for more unpolished Killers that can only be purchased with irl money and can't be purchased with premium currency. \n\nBehaviour is incredibly out of touch with the community and prioritizes making money from new Killers and Survivors over patching and fan feedback. This review will go completely ignored by Behaviour so if you are a new player I hope this review is helpful.\n\nYou WILL notice glaring issues on both sides. No, these issues will never be patched, addressed, or fixed in any way. Play this game if you want the brief thrill of chasing somebody or being chased by Michael Myers.

I got it for free Halloween 2018 because some people wanted to play it with me and I quickly sunk a lot of hours into it. None of those people still play this game because they are so fed up with the toxicity the community engages in and how the developers ignore and encourage this toxicity. I played this game, and brought a lot of DLC, because of how fun it is to play with friends, but what's the point in playing a game where you get frustrated with underhanded players when we could just play a coop game against AI where the chance of being tea bagged (or hit on hook) doesn't exist)\nKiller play styles that are considered underhanded and frankly strip the fun out of the game: camping a hooked survivor, downing several survivors and not hooking them in the hopes you can cripple all the survivors (or slugging), abuse of game mechanics, tunnelling (targeting one survivor, especially those just unhooked) all run rampant and the problem gets worse by the day. The only survivor perks that are able to counter these behaviours are nerfed (because the developers consider the way a minority of players to be using them to be detrimental to the game and so deciding to punish the rest of the players too). On the flip side toxic survivors, who abuse various mechanics meant for self preservation to bully less experienced killers, use of flashlight spam or even sabotaging other survivors has no repercussions if a killer isn't as skilled or better (which we'll come back to later) and trying to report players for such behaviour falls on deaf ears with the devs outright saying \"we won't punish players for this action\" despite it ruining all the fun of the game for everyone and driving players away in droves\nThe matchmaking system is frequently subject to changes (due to it desperately needing an overhaul of some kind) but this invariably results with literal beginners with half an hour's play time facing off against players who have sunk a disturbing amount of time into the game. The fixation on rank also leads to issues with the aforementioned toxicity as players become to focused on improving their rank to consider if they are enjoying the game and if they are making it enjoyable for others.\nCertain killers are also frequently overpowered, Spirit and Doctor being the main contenders with whatever the latest release often muscling in on their territory (currently Nemesis who immediately tanks the frame rate) while other killers are often neglected and underpowered. As a result instead of the interest of \"what killer will I be against today?\" you are left with \"which overpowered crap is this toxic ass going to play?\" which again saps the fun away. There needs to be a better balancing system in play for killers, with more frequent tweaks being made and a better more focused way to encourage playing a variety of killers\nThere is also currently a policy on the official forums to remove any post about the current boycott and ban any user who posts about it, which reeks of higher corporate censorship- this I absolutely do not blame the devs for, but I also cannot recommend a game where such actions happen behind the scenes. The boycott itself was over how there has been a serious push to tart up the game and push for transactions over fixing any real issues (the Binding of Kin chapter was notorious for this issue) and horrific amounts of instability (the Resident Evil map is still under observation more than a month after release due to it literally crashing everyone's game when it was first released and being \"locked\" for 2 weeks after that) and general grindiness of the game. BHVR has done very little to address these concerns, if anything. This game has a stranglehold on the asymmetric PVP horror genre, and is the only real title BHVR has and as such the suits are clearly milking this game for all it is worth.\n\nI really want to enjoy this game. The fact that I have spent over 200 hours playing this mess and then a further 30 writing this review shows that I care about this. I want to be able to sit back with some friends and play a handful of games against players who aren't going to be total ♥♥♥♥♥. I want to know that there is some real serious effort going into making this game as good as it can be and not getting as much money from it as possible. I would like it to be actually balanced (or as balanced as a game built around unbalance can be) but right now that just doesn't seem like it's going to happen","timestamp_created":1648053693,"timestamp_updated":1648053693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112703966","author":{"steamid":"76561199227250438","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1777,"last_played":1648055066},"language":"english","review":"its fun","timestamp_created":1648053390,"timestamp_updated":1648053390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112703005","author":{"steamid":"76561198196666261","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":45481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2069,"playtime_at_review":1653,"last_played":1660565431},"language":"english","review":"Never the same game twice.

I get it killers are there to kill but dude what fun is it really for a killer to slug all survivors and leave them on ground to die. How is it  fun to have a game that ends with all people making under 20k points when the update reset it to 40K possible... like what? As a killer I hate that survivors being extra toxic when I am actually playing fair unlike my other \"killer buddies\". It just has gone further and further into the ground. The fact that people are now looking for other games outside of this one just proves the point. Sure people can say that its just people being babies, but it literally is not fun to play this game anymore. On either side... I would not recommend this game at all and I don't feel bad saying that... Ill play COD and listen to little kids curse at me all game over having to deal with a toxic killer or survivor.
