know what game i really hate?\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands\n\nLet's talk about 'tactical realism'\n\nNot real life. not the simulation of military life. Tactical realism.\n\nanyway Ghost recon wildlands claims to be on the cutting edge of tactical realism\n\nJust don't tell that to any current, former, or future operatives who will instantly bring up [b]magic bullet issue[/b]\n[i]Magic bullet?[/i]\n\nyou read that correctly.\nNot only can you tag an enemy soldier who will walk into a building without losing the 'tag' that tracks his moments with extreme precision, but your teammates instantly become JFK murdering sniper elite; sneaking through the trees, the bushes, the tall grass, the short grass..... the air.\n\nThey become invisible. They are only visible to the enemy when you are spotted.\n[b]Welcome to tactical realism[/b]\n\nSo you set 3 targets you'd like your team to eliminate?\nDarn. they walked into a building that was reinforced with 4 feet thick concrete walls. Whelp i guess you will need to patiently wait like a real sni-\n\n[i]did you just shoot all 4?[/i]\nall 4?\nat once?\nthrough concrete?\nno visual on the targets?\n\nThat's realistic. I have spoken with many millions of current, former and future members of the united states marine corps who tell me that this is how they deal with every engagement & that it is, in fact, standard operating procedure to use the [b]magic bullet strike[/b]\n\nCruise missiles are outdated.\nWelcome to the new world.\n\nFor the sake of tactical realism, i'm gonna have one of my soldiers carry a drone that will weigh him down considerably and likely be only useful if i w- NEVER it WILL never BE useful. NEVER.\n\nThere was this invention called binoculars. The [i]binocular[/i] can be pulled out in roughly under 60 seconds. Oddly, they have an unlimited power supply, and it takes only the knowledge of how to hold 2 cups vertically to operate them. Tactically, i feel binoculars are realistic and the best decision for recon but thankfully Ubisoft has enlightened me on the issue. Many current, former, and future soldiers should know that binoculars are not as efficient in stealth surveillance of the enemy as a buzzing mechanical bird that flies unnaturally.\n\n\nBut don't worry\nfortunately the A.I. makes up for the glaring holes in the set up and delivery of Ghost Recon Wildland(s)\n\nThe first time i stuck my drone eye length with an enemy and he seemed to slowly notice that a flying machine was hovering just feet from his nose, i sat back and realised that GRW is probably the first and only game to actually capture the fact that some soldiers do actually suffer from mental conditions such as blindness & also deafness, some soldiers are mute to physical touch and i feel [i]so[/i] happy that Ubisoft took the step to include disabled people as soldiers, albeit enemy soldiers.\n\n\nBut on [b]tactical[/b] realism :\nThere is considerably no tactics.\n\nYou don't really stack up on buildings and clear rooms because the AI doesnt require you to do that. They will run at you like zombies with guns. They don't actually stay in place, hold a defensive position and wait for you to clear it.\n\nIf you shoot at the enemy, they don't flank you. They turn and run at you like zombies with guns.\nIf you lob mortars, they don't seek cover. They turn and run at you like zombies with guns.\nIf you are outnumbered, they will run at you like zombies with guns\nIf you outnumber them, they will run at you like zombies with guns\n\nIf you set up an ambush, they won't seek cover and try to figure out where you are. They automatically know and run at you like zombies with guns.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if you use a line formation, echelon, wedge. Nothing matters. The result is the exact same.\nThe loadout you use doesn't matter because magic bullet.\n\nThe shooting mechanics are like pubg meets fortnite if you decide to not use the magic bullet and force and actually have gunfights but the sad reality that you can complete entire engagements without ever firing anything but magic bullets is a bit weird in that it feels like that game plays itself while you just say \"kill this, this, this, and this guy. Okay now move up. kill this this this and this guy. move up\"\n\n\nAnd for the sake of tactical realism. You can get shot anywhere with no specific effect. This means that it doesnt matter how you use cover, all wounds are the same. So you get shot in the arm, you get revived by a teammate, and you get up with no problem with your arm.\n\nThere's unlimited medical supplies because there is no supplies which means you don't need

Recommend for people who want to play as survivors with friends üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄ\nThat's so good and fun for your team and if you play with Good Killer that's was great!! üòÄ\n\nOn this game have to side of survivors and killers\n4 Survivors and 1 Killer per match \nI really love this concept of this game. That's fun!\n\nAfter that is so long short review is ending up there üëÜ  but if you need to know more just read below \n\nBut this is comment for beginning player between rank 20 to rank 15 that's bottom rank range on this game and you random match (don't play with team play) please read this\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ For playing Survivors üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ : \nüîµ If you play only one character you have to repair generators, help you friend from hook and try to learn path on many maps in this game. On the beginning maybe you will lucky for survived but mostly starter is dead from Momento Mori by killer's hand or \nsacrificed üòÖ\nüîµ Try to learn about ability of every survivors and killer that's can help you for beginning because Perk is everything on this game. Better Perk, Better escaped ways ( such as with some of item can help you open secret door, med-kit for heal and tool box for fix generator)\nüîµ You will learn new word about 'Camper' that's called for Killer who don't try to find another survivors but they will catch only one or two survivors and stand near people who hooked for waiting someone came for help this bad lucky guy and hit helper. Bad ways mostly team will died because of kindness for want to help team member\nüîπ But, If you meet camper please repair generators before or if you're people on hooked please wait not try to unhooked by yourself. If you have Luck Offering maybe it worked or if it's not you will died early than other\nüîπ And try to calm down when you met Camper, sometime survivors who hooked by camper on that match will try to died and out of this game early. Some of them will disconnected of that match by unplug icon showing on that survivors because mostly survivors who play main roles for survivors DON'T LIKE CAMPER so please be kind with them and not hot-headed \nüîπ Mostly Camper that I was met on this game are üôá‚Äç‚ôÄCannibal, ü§° CLOWN   ,üõé WRAITH, other some.\nüîπ (Optional) Mostly killers will thinks Camper is the ways to win the game that is not true or false on my opinion but mostly survivors will not love it. Just that is. My friend talked about Game Theory on Mathematical Science, Win-Win game is the good way for both side with survivors and killers. Don't like camper is your choices and killer will play camper that's their choices too. Please considering about it üòÖ\nüîπ (Optional) I tried to write GGWP - Good game, well play :) for every killer who play good and make the game more fun, sometimes my team is completely died on hook, Momento Mori or other several ways but main of this fun is we tried to survived, healing friends, repair generators, clear totems, run away from killer. I think this is heart of this game for make fun and more point to upgrade all characters üòâ\nüîµ And some killer are new player like you or they did not play great with killer or they want to do their daily quest with killer characters. Mostly of them will release you, just run for chased you or hit you for their quest. (Please) Do not type easy - ez on comment box but this is optional so only thing that's I can do for this game is beg many player to do better things for other\nüîµ Mostly, Killers (especially camper) will quick out of disconnection of match when the match ended. If you love someone play-style or want to play with other survivors on this match you could add friend with them on steam on that room before you leave bc this game did not have match recorded, lol\nüîµ A little bit suggestion, be careful with body block some ways with you and your team when run away from killer ;D\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nüòàüëø For playing Killers üòàüëø\n‚≠ï Of course, our objective is kill or survivors before they completely repair generators \n‚≠ï So many killer that you can choose to play but for my suggest if you don't have DLC. I suggest Trapper for beginner and when you know more map and hiding places on several map including some perk working with survivors and your killer. The Nurse is good choices for chase survivors. But this is just only my opinion. Maybe you can choose any character and you love they appearance and play other killer for learn teachable perks for character you loved!\n‚≠ï When you play a few times you will think killer is hardly to play but if you can read their mark on the ground, know many place that have pallets, heard heartbeat of survivors in locker or can hurt someone to dying state. It's make you fun. I think that's great for playing üòπ\n‚≠ï Many survivors will run away from you. That's good for them but funny things is how you can reach them XD. Sometime you will meet party of friends who played together, they will ran around or do somethings that can make you laugh  üòÄ\n‚≠ï Good way for playing killer for me is earn more blood point with catch survivors, hooked them, damage generators, destroyed obstacle, closed secret door or other. So I'm try to disrupt them by Hex perk that's survivors hated it. I will not kill someone early and release some people to heal each other for they can earn some point and I can hit them again ü§™\n‚≠ï Killing have several ways with kill by your hand or some offering and perk. Hooked them 3 times\n‚≠ï Try to walk around, It can help you found survivors (When my friends played killer, she will release all of survivors out and sometimes she not found any survivors bc of map is too dark for her LOL) Observe the mark or started with some perk that's can help you to reading survivors aura. There are easy ways for beginner\n‚≠ï If you want to be Camper so that's your choice but remember if you camp. You will lost some opportunity to reach survivors bc of many survivors have their own way to play, some technique of survivors that good for you to know for chased them ;D\nüî∏ If player leave match that is their right ;)\nüî∏ After you rank upgrade to 15, It hardly to camp will success bc mostly survivors that have high rank will have easy way to win the game so I suggest to chased survivors by yourself and not camper before reach Rank 15\n\nüíüü§üFor playing both side ü§üüíü\nüîµ Game have some bugs, of course every game have bugs \n     üîπ Sometimes you can climb to the rock or just go in it Haha\n     üîπ Maybe survivors can't go out of the gate and they will walk through the door go to the end of the map and can't escapedüòÇ (If lucky they will fall on the end of the map and appear again on the canter of map)\n     üîπ Lacking problem (Mostly is internet connection, different time zone or computer spec) Some people will slide through the ground, warp in the second.
