review above is as accurate as one could describe the phenomenon that is DBD. It is so accurate that I myself along with many others have given up and quit this attention-seeking grade-school-delinquent simulator. Seriously guys and gals, there are so many other productive, fulfilling, and meaningful things you could be doing with your precious time on this planet, instead of being made feel like you're in prison having to put up with a bunch of pathetic excuses of human beings, for just trying to enjoy a video game for an hour or two on your hard-earned off day(s). This game in my opinion honestly just isn't worth the frustration. Not to mention that the game is in no way, shape or form is even close to being beginner friendly. I'm not exaggerating an ounce when i say that you need at least around 1,500 to 2,500 hours in this game just to actually be able to have access to most of the perks that players can pick in the loadout menu. In my opinion, that is just way too much grind for anybody who just wants to play for fun (casually). Speaking of playing casually, that isn't an option in this game. Like Le-Le-Le-Legoshi's comment above me stated, once you get past the lowest rank category for either killer or survivor (that being ash rank), all of a sudden everybody turns into professional tournament players and there is no room for said fun. They are all about efficiency and steamrolling you while being as degenerative as they can, just to show off and try to make you feel out of place, and so I am going to have to give this game a thumbs down, which sucks because this game could be so much more, well... fun. I think that it once had potential, but now it's long gone. If I were you guys i would try just about any other game that you had in mind.","timestamp_created":1658005233,"timestamp_updated":1658005233,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494011968374252319","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118923597","author":{"steamid":"76561198306850548","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":162,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1660431917},"language":"english","review":"best

\"grind\" meanwhile they are nerfing all bloodpoint perks and forcing you to prestige your characters to get your perks to a better tier, but in reality what they are doing is forcing me to lose all my 2016 addons that i have been holding on to for a long time, the game is survivor sided for the most part making it feel like sometimes no matter what you do you can't win, then the amount of cheaters is flat out disgusting, i have entirely stopped playing killer because every 4 or so games you run into a cheater who will try to hold you hostage in the game forcing you to dc and take a penalty, looking at some positives though this game does have a lot of unique killers you can play keeping it nice and fresh but when playing survivor you tend to play against the same 5 killers when there is over 20 incredibly fun to play with friends, I'm sure new players can like this game easily just from someone who has been playing for a long time seeing the changes they have made kind of

Нет, будьте готовы, что в том случае, если Ваш игровой профиль в Steam открыт для комментариев, то в скором времени он будет полон сообщениями с \"наилучшими\" пожеланями успеха в труде и личной жизни от \"ухажеров\" Вашей мамы.\nЦель маньяка в игре - поочерёдно, искусно пользуясь собственными способностями, избавиться от выживших, ловя их один за другим, насаживая на крюки, пока некая Сущность не заберет их в виде жертвоподношения, и не дать им завести пять из семи генераторов, расставленых по карте случайным образом. \nЦель же выживших, на практике, это починить те самые генераторы за рекордный промежуток времени, когда лишь один из команды сурвов - так называемый про-MLG-мансер - должен будет отвлечь маньяка на себя. Пять минут - и маньяк-новичок, словивший до этого все паллетки на карте лицом, уже наблюдает за тем, как в открытых воротах сурвы ти-бэгают и щелкают ему в лицо фонариками.\nЕсли Вы желаете достичь неких высот в этой игре - будьте готовы потратить сотни, а то и тысячи часов на гринд, оттачивание навыков и бесчисленное количество попыток и унижений. \nВ игре за выжившего Вам поможет хорошая команда из знакомых и голосовая связь по Discord; в игре за маньяка - стальные нервы и грамотные билды из перков, которые ещё нужно суметь получить. А на высоких уровнях рейтинга будьте готовы внезапно встретиться с читерами.\nИграть ли в это - решать Вам. Dead by Daylight может похвастаться только одним режимом и сотней скинов для персонажей, самым токсичным комьюнити и маханикой, которая сама делает игроков таковыми, но Мне, потратившему уже за две тысячи часов своей жизни в этой игре, уже поздно куда-то идти ещё.

E invece è il killer a giocare in prima persona mentre il sopravvissuto in terza, tanto che qualche volta mi sono preso un colpo giocando da killer dei survivor che saltavano le staccionate senza aspettarmelo. Andatevi a cercare su youtube dbd moddato con la prima persona, da cagarsi addosso. Parliamo del competitivo: mi potete gentilmente spiegare come possa un gioco 4 vs 1 definirsi gioco COMPETITIVO? E' palese che ci sia un netto sbilanciamento a favore di un team di 4 persone e allora gli intelligentissimi sviluppatori cos'hanno pensato bene di fare? rendere overpowered i killer! Quindi che succede: se giochi survivor da solo hai bassissime possibilità di vincere, se giochi killer da solo invece sono alte. Ma cosa succede invece se 4 amici decidono di formare un team di 4 persone che comunicano tra loro? L'esatto completo OPPOSTO! Sarà l'esperienza più frustrante della tua vita: Survivor che si instacurano, generatori che vengono riparati in mezzo minuto, survivor che si metteranno in 4 pur di non farti appendere il compagno... insomma 99% delle volte con 4 premade contro perdi in maniera veramente frustrante! Ma allora mi chiedo: ma possibile che non vi viene in mente oltre a far uscire nuovi personaggi di mettere una modalità 2 vs 6? Magari con mappe più grandi? Invogliereste molta più gente a giocarci considerando che (almeno secondo me) la cosa divertente di sto gioco è fare il killer. Ma poi parliamo dei personaggi: personaggi bellissimi, ognuno con una propria specialità e competenza... peccato valga solo per i killer dato che i survivor hanno solo i perk che puoi prendere dagli altri survivor. Perchè non date una qualche caratterizzazione/specialità a ciascun survivor come con i killer? E poi ultima cosa: variate sto gioco, create qualcosa di innovativo, il progetto è interessantissimo, peccato che da 4 anni a questa parte non si sia evoluto per NIENTE! Guardate altri giochi che hanno fatto successo come sono cresciuti, voi siete conosciuti solo per il meme di Zeb89 che gioca solo a questo, svegliatevi un attimo e cominciate ad investirci seriamente su sto gioco che le potenzialità le ha. A giudicare da come si è sviluppato negli ultimi anni sono dell'idea che forse 4/5 euro li può valere, di più assolutamente no dato che sono gli sviluppatori i primi a non crederci","timestamp_created":1657980849,"timestamp_updated":1658239107,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118905146","author":{"steamid":"76561198815036371","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":27368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3502,"playtime_at_review":17847,"last_played":1660405897},"language":"tchinese","review":"rewq","timestamp_created":1657979649,"timestamp_updated":1657979649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118904013","author":{"steamid":"76561199363645695","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1658138783},"language":"dutch","review":"super leuk spel","timestamp_created":1657978100,"timestamp_updated":1657978100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118903764","author":{"steamid":"76561199122502761","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":200,"playtime_at_review":5060,"last_played":1660485198},"language":"koreana","review":"재미짐","timestamp_created":1657977749,"timestamp_updated":1657977749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118903715","author":{"steamid":"76561198821071341","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":9476,"last_played":1659781111},"language":"koreana","review":"정가 주고 구매했는데 개쩝니다.","timestamp_created":1657977665,"timestamp_updated":1657977665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118902176","author":{"steamid":"76561197971438017","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3859,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1660600309},"language":"german","review":"anfangs etwas schierig zu versteh was und wie man machen muss aber hat mans raus macht es richtig spaß ...vorallem mit freunden zusammen wenn man sich absprechen kann :) \n","timestamp_created":1657975384,"timestamp_updated":1657975384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118901473","author":{"steamid":"76561198054068974","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":65,"playtime_at_review":2574,"last_played":1660399448},"language":"english","review":"Amazing fun","timestamp_created":1657974347,"timestamp_updated":1657974347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118901245","author":{"steamid":"76561199071066984","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":46079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1072,"playtime_at_review":43924,"last_played":1660472962},"language":"english","review":"made my anger issues worse","timestamp_created":1657973967,"timestamp_updated":1657973967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ieG8g4IDfZ/JxQM="}
