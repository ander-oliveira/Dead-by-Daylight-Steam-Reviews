The developers have buffed killers in a way that the average player cannot survive without supremely good communication. To which the developers have not included any official means of communication in game with other players. There is no way to tell what your teammates are doing unless you have brought specific perks (Bond, Kindred, etc). The devs have balanced this game away from four random survivors trying to survive together. \n\nLet's not forget how the community has been reacting to this update either. Tunneling and Camping is more prevalent than it ever was. It was always an issue, but now with the every killer having a free stack of STBFL baked into their kit has made chases much more difficult for the average player. Killers have had 0.2 seconds of their attack animation recovery shaved off and survivors lost 0.2 seconds of their speed boost when hit. These numbers don't sound like much but 0.4 seconds is a substantial amount of time, especially when many killers already have abilities that can shut down loops or chases. Survivors are now disconnecting and/or killing themselves the moment they get caught by the killer at alarming rates. Practically every single game there's a disconnect or somebody kills themselves. Once a survivor does either of those things, the game is practically already over if there are 3+ generators left. \n\nOn top of nerfing part of the survivors base kit, they also fundamentally changed what is considered to be the biggest survivor crutch perk in the game: \"Dead Hard\". Before, if you were injured and not exhausted, you could press \"E\" for a slight dash forward and invulnerability for half a second. BHVR has removed the dash forward element and the perk no longer grants invulnerability, instead granting endurance for 0.5 seconds. This perk is practically worthless now as it pretty much has to be timed perfectly which is way to inconsistent on even a good connection, let alone a bad one.\n\nPlaying Killer right now is easier than it's ever been. Even the most mediocre killers can 4k most games now as all it takes is to down one person and the game starts to crawl to a halt from there. It's not fun for most killers either, there's very little challenge going up against three survivors with five generators left after one of them inevitably kills themselves.\n\nEven if you have a team of four and you know nobody is a weak link, the games in this patch are all horrifically boring. Increasing the generator repair time from 80 seconds to 90 seconds is such a band-aid programmer fix to balance the game. Facing Thanataphobia Legion/Plague slows the game down even more. It's so eye gaugingly bad that survivors will instantly DC when they see it. Right now the meta is disconnecting.\n\nThis update was not healthy for the game. Killer queue times have increased because people don't want to play survivor anymore. We play games to have fun. Not to watch that Meg kill herself on first hook because she couldn't loop the killer like she used to. It's not uncommon for survivors to not even be able to do two generators as pretty much every killer is using 2+ perks that slow down the game significantly.\n\nThe developers stated that the reason they made these changes is because the global kill rate was not high enough. Despite the fact that the global kill rate average was above 52% for every single killer except some of the more mechanically advanced killers (who are already top tier, they are just hard to master). I might be missing something but a quote-unquote draw on average every game is fairly balanced, no? I really think this patch needed more time in the oven.\n\nAs of 7/29/2022, BHVR has made a statement saying that they do not want to make any knee-jerk reactions which is fair from a developer perspective, but is such non-answer to many people's problems with the update. I love this game, but so many games on this patch have been insanely frustrating to the point where I can only play one before I want to stop playing. I'm curious to see what the developers actual response is to this situation.","timestamp_created":1659143448,"timestamp_updated":1659143448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548192799091339111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119732552","author":{"steamid":"76561199110300440","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":810,"playtime_at_review":37104,"last_played":1660360154},"language":"english","review":"This game makes me rage yet I still come back.","timestamp_created":1659143152,"timestamp_updated":1659143152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119732525","author":{"steamid":"76561198871152998","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1495,"last_played":1659314900},"language":"brazilian","review":"Brabo\n","timestamp_created":1659143103,"timestamp_updated":1659143103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119732460","author":{"steamid":"76561198870336836","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1108,"playtime_at_review":3827,"last_played":1660190956},"language":"english","review":"This game can make me laugh, cry, and rage at the same time.
