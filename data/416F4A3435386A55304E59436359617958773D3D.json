Some of the reasons I recommended against purchasing Dead by Daylight have been resolved or are in the middle of being resolved. Again, I still play the game, my concern was for newcomers joining at an unfortunate time half a year ago.\n\n- 2529 hours (26 February 2020): Currently not recommending to buy the game due to severe issues with match-making, ranking issues, and balancing.\n\nDo not get me wrong, I obviously still play the game, since as a Veteran DbD player, I can deal with these issues, but they are unacceptable for a new player coming to the game. I currently would not tell any of my friends to get the game, even on sale, as I believe they would get frustrated with the issues quite quickly and quit it.\n\nI'd rather have them step into The Fog during a time when these issues are resolved and they can enjoy the game. Once the issues are addressed, my review is likely to change back to recommended.\n\n- 1908 hours in (25 July 2018): The best sign of the game FINALLY starting to go back towards a balanced state is the Survivor mains review-bombing Patch 2.1.0 (even though, they only got minor nerfs, I don't want to imagine how petty they'll be once their beloved crutch Perk Decisive Strike is nerfed). Killer mains and Players who play both sides could finally rechoice with 2.1.0. The devs seem to have gotten the message and I'm thankful for that. As an impartial player of both sides from day one, I'm so happy to be able to recommend the game again.\n\n- 1727 hours in (15 April 2018): The game seems to be taking the first few cautious steps in the direction of some balance again, but it's still way too soon to really tell what the devs will break next (yes, a running gag that's all too true). The new Emblem System took some pressure off of Killers and punishes Survivors playing the game for shits and giggles, trying to bully the Killer. However, none of that addresses the broken core mechanics of the game, that hugely favour Survivor if they simply focus on doing their objective instead of clowning about, so I'm still not going to recommend it until further changes take place.\n\n- 1430 hours in (7 November 2017): It's been a long time since my last update to this review. Sadly, once again I cannot recommend to buy Dead by Daylight and thus support the Developers anymore. The game is riddled with problems the devs ignore or are blatantly not willing to address and fix. The game becomes a clown fiesta for the Killer from mid-ranks upwards. Survivors disconnect to save their crutch items and generally, the game is more toxic than ever. People have lost all sense of manners and sportsmanlike conduct. IF there's anything to be abused, it will be.\n\nAlso, the developers have just recently acknowledged that they will from now on balance the game for the lowest ranks, meaning newcomer and low-skilled casual players :steamfacepalm:\n\nNone, literally no competitive game, even if it still tries to be that, balances around the end of spectrum, especially not the low-end. Small changes there have immense balance impacts on high ranks with experienced players.\n\nThey should fire their statistics guy in all honesty as I have rarily seen such incompetence in creating and interpreting statistics. Most high schoolers would do a better job at that.\n\n- 906 hours in: I think I can finally recommend it again and I'm happy to do so. Patch 1.5. has brought some much needed changes and after adapting a bit to the new mechanics, the game finally again feels like it has originally been envisioned by the developers. Killer feels like a powerful killing machine again and playing Survivor is now challenging again across the board, something I missed. Unlike many crybabies on the forums (people who exploited and didn't learn how to properly play the game) I know that the game is going in the right direction now and I couldn't be happier. I would have felt really sad to give up a game I've now played for so, so long because it was no longer the game I fell in love with almost a year ago. I'm so glad that things changed.\n\n- Now 757 hours in. Haven't played nearly as much as I used to, because the game is going in the wrong direction, I can't recommend it anymore and I'm so sad about that. At least not in the current state it is in. Killers get treated as the personal fuck toy of mid to higher ranked Survivors, the game is heavily unbalanced and the devs seem to do everything in their might to make it even more so. With the newest update, they added 2 perks that once they become the new meta, they will make Survivors more or less invincible. Killer mains are leaving the game in heaps now. I don't want to see this game die, but the developers are completely clueless about the problems they have and have no idea of their own game in mid/high ranks as they are all low ranked players, catering to the need of low ranked Survivors, not realising that they give experienced players more and more tools to fuck with Killers.\n\n- 735 hours by now, can't believe that I haven't gotten tired of the game yet, although I'm feeling a bit burnt-out as Killer, you need to be a masochist to play the high ranked games as one, but thankfully, that is about to change.\n\n- Still going strong after 566 hours. I can't get enough of this game, it's almost like a drug. Absolutely love it. Sure there are bugs and annoying things, but most of the time, they are minor and the devs are (contrary to popular belief) constantly working on fixing them and keeping the game alive.\n\n- Alright, 373 hours in, I'm going to back up my own review. Still love this game ^^\n\n\"ORIGINAL REVIEW from 19 August 2016: [i]Absolutely love this game, I'm now over 200 hours in and it still doesn't get boring as no two games are the same, also there is a big diversity of areas and maps and there will be even more in the future. I recommend it to anyone that likes the horror genre and the Survivors-get-chased-by-a-Killer theme.\n\nP.S. Don't get discouraged by all the negative reviews. 85% of them are by people with very low gameplay time. This game takes several hours to \"git gud\" as you need to learn how to play against each of the four Killers and counter each of their specific abilities and unique play styles. Practice really makes perfect in this game. Same thing applies when you play as Killer, you need to learn how all the game mechanics work.[/i]\"","timestamp_created":1471602408,"timestamp_updated":1599582840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.453586488962173462","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25009414","author":{"steamid":"76561198321147822","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1054,"last_played":1470539936},"language":"russian","review":"в эту игро долго не поиграеш. начинает надоедать. можно сказать это игра 1 сезона","timestamp_created":1471601694,"timestamp_updated":1471601694,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.429724276065826416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25009408","author":{"steamid":"76561198079223034","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1474719362},"language":"english","review":"I love this game to the bottom of my heart, in my opinion everything is perfect.

You can either play as a survivor, or a killer. There are multiple killers and each have their own rait, the Trapper, the Hillbilly, the Wraith and in the new update:The Nurse! For each killer there is a map, the Nurse is set in an asylum, the Hillbilly, Wraith and Trapper meanwhilst have all their own outside worlds. The aim of the game is to simply activate all the generators around the map if you are a survivor, you can play as four survivors, Claudette, Dwight, Med and Jake. And in the new update: Nea. If all generators are reactivated the survivors must open the exit, at the same time however the killer has to sabotage you, if you hear a racing heart beat or bells he is close to you and you must hide. If you panic then it makes it easier for the killer to find you. However you can hide yourself in Lockers. If found the killer will put you on a hook which counts down to your death, your team mates however can help you by unhooking you. If your are left on a hook too long you die and you are out. If you are injured you can heal one another. \n\nMY OPINION\nAlthough it is a new game, me and my friends couldn't find a way as to how to play with another without the full party total of five, and we thought that we had to get our other friends to buy the game so we can all play as one. When doing research i realised that alot of other people had the same problem. We fixed this when one of us is a killer, they select \"Kill Your Friends\" and then invite others. The game is very fast paced and frightnening. Even the sound of the killers heartbeat makes you feel chilly. Me and my friends personally love this game and play it together when we can. It is a good multiplayer horror game :)  If i had to say anything negative is that it is annoying trying to join a lobby, it doesn't join yu straight away. I've seen people write about how they have had to wait like 30 minutes to join one. I didn't have this problem, if you don't get into a lobby just try again, it may take a while but barely even 2 minutes. Overall this is my favourite multiplayer horror game. If i had to rate it i would give it 10 out of 10 and 5 stars. It is BRILLIANT and worth the money.

for menu navigation, which is annoying but not prohibitive, the actual gameplay works great.\n\nThe main thing that I think this game could benifit from is skill/rank-based matchmaking.\nFor all I know this already exists and my local community is just to small but I feel that the learning curve is vastly steepened when half your opponents are very high-ranking and 'exploit' limitations in the game/physics.\nIt's not an illegitimate tactic, it's not even metagaming but it does make it difficult to learn when you're up against rank 10 or better every other game and therefore get to observe less mistakes.\n\nNone the less I would recommend the game, and say that it's best played and started together with

If you play killer with a controller you will also be at a disadvantage because the mouse people can turn on a dime.\n\nThe gameplay feels the same everygame. One of the best strats while playing survivor is to loop around pallets until you need them. The gameplay at that point for the killer and survivor is nothing more than looping.
