I wish they added new economic system to the game which let us exchange our items and addons and offering from blood web for half of its price to blood points\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 1: I really dislike thumbs down this game now and I don't think the game overall doesn't deserve it too. but besides the situation for killers in this game was kinda before this, now after the MMR system they are forced to the game it's just turned into having 30% fun and 70% sweat. in my opinion, it was a waste of money and human resources from Bhvr.\n\nAt the end of the day what we could say when their player's number is growing !!\n\nso if you are new to this game and have a good amount of energy for that and you like to mostly play survivor I still recommend it.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 2: devs changed the MMR system it's now a little less sweaty and I think it is. but still don't think in the long term it made a big impact MMR is just like an amplifier in this game, its amplitude problems. \nthings like maps and gens and swf need to be considered, some maps are insanely bad designed ( Gideon Meat Plant has huge amount of pallets) which means after years of development they have massive flaws in basic things like number of pallets and by the time iam writing of this update there is no change!\nthey wanna rework perks like 40 of them which is good but I don't think this is the main problem of the game their core gameplay needs changes but like most of the times they tried to fix their game problems based on perks! (for example: bringing Ds and bt to the game for counter tunneling and etc...)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------","timestamp_created":1626617120,"timestamp_updated":1655738804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95963629","author":{"steamid":"76561198314402261","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1500219273},"language":"russian","review":"нудная хуета блять нахуй не заходите","timestamp_created":1626617098,"timestamp_updated":1626617098,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.180570617318153381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95963495","author":{"steamid":"76561199179414975","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":45155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2794,"playtime_at_review":3305,"last_played":1660573846},"language":"schinese","review":"nubility","timestamp_created":1626616955,"timestamp_updated":1626616955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95963477","author":{"steamid":"76561198318417654","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":9664,"last_played":1660057302},"language":"tchinese","review":"周年慶時一直出現錯誤，吃我好幾把血點，都是一堆蛋糕加乘的那種，課服詢問後的方法也無法解決。","timestamp_created":1626616934,"timestamp_updated":1626616934,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512195110321044922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95963346","author":{"steamid":"76561199073328773","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":82,"playtime_at_review":3522,"last_played":1660419462},"language":"russian","review":"топ игра\n","timestamp_created":1626616779,"timestamp_updated":1626616779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95963245","author":{"steamid":"76561199128276840","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":3673,"last_played":1660603574},"language":"english","review":"its cool\n","timestamp_created":1626616672,"timestamp_updated":1626616672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95963006","author":{"steamid":"76561198358940829","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1128,"last_played":1657381623},"language":"english","review":"pog u","timestamp_created":1626616383,"timestamp_updated":1626616383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95962883","author":{"steamid":"76561198424888138","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":5749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1660212904},"language":"english","review":"Killing People is a breeze when you've got perks a' many","timestamp_created":1626616255,"timestamp_updated":1626616255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95962739","author":{"steamid":"76561198851028721","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1641663083},"language":"polish","review":"miła","timestamp_created":1626616115,"timestamp_updated":1626616115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95962693","author":{"steamid":"76561198866468087","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1560,"last_played":1630877400},"language":"english","review":"The game is good, really good. \n\nOnly thing I would make is different ways to play.

you want to play Dead by Daylight. Let me tell you my final answer first, I'd recommend you DO NOT or at least not for the time being. Now here is my breakdown;\n\nThe good:\n\nDBD is a beautifully crafted world with captivating story and concepts. Each map, killer, survivor has some kind of information about them, and you can grind in something called the \"Tomes\" where you can get extra information on certain things. \n\nThe Baseline gameplay is genius and super fun to play in (for a while). \n\nBecause of the variety, you will be able to constantly rinse and repeat the game over and over.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nPerks are really out of hand these days. There are hundred of perks but only about 5% of them are used because of how light and day some perks are. One will make you walk slightly faster and another will straight up make you invincible. Not only that, but these perks are so strong they can significantly make a survivor team that may be weak to actually able to compete with skilled players because how grossly hard they can be carried by some perks.\n\nMap design is terrible. Though alot of  maps look good, they're usually bad. Not only are most too big, they can be disorienting, and some killers literally cannot defend a generator if 2 people spawn on it at the start of the game. Coordinated teams can make almost any map feel unwinnable, and pallets are also badly designed. On certain maps against certain killers, pre-dropping every pallet can win you the game with the amount of time you waste for the killer.\n\nThe grind is outrageous. Because of the overwhelming amount of perks, items, offerings, the grind is astronomically long, and it's a part time job just progressing. People with thousands of hours still don't have freedom in every character having many perks, and it's so crazy you might be turned off the game just realising the amount of dedication you need to even be comfortable in playing with certain loud-outs.\n\nThe community is the worst I've ever encountered. Playing as killer can make you feel powerful, and being skilled against a killer can also feel nice, but alot of people rub it in other peoples face, bully and harass for no good reason. Everyone complains, everyone is against each-other, every forum post is a dumpster fire, and the devs couldn't care less.\n\nSurvivors are the power role. In a horror game of survivors vs killers, the killers are actually the ones at the mercy to survivors. Perks have become too strong for survivors and validation is now super favourable towards survivors. Pallets are invincible shields and they will have extra health states as perks to ensure you have to sweat harder than a league player to win as a killer. \n\nThe developers are distant and bias. It's been showed many times that dbd devs will stay completely silent for years on end about consistent major problems, but anytime money is involved you can be sure the whole company will pause to fix it. Any and every update to fix something takes far too long and by the time it's fixed the damage is done. Every new chapter is feeling half baked, and cosmetics still come every other week to cash in on easy money. The player count is dropping and I can definitely see why. \n\nThe game has many many problems, but should you not play it? No. DBD is a very fun and engaging game. One of the most realistic horror experiences out there! But where the game stands right now is not going to make it last, and I recommend you don't divulge in this game when everyone hates each-other at the moment. If somehow BHVR can fix these detrimental problems, I'm sure I'll be happy to give this game a big thumbs up, but right now? No. It's quite painful to play the game. \n","timestamp_created":1626593582,"timestamp_updated":1655101605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95946504","author":{"steamid":"76561198139471188","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":7149,"last_played":1660130201},"language":"hungarian","review":"nemesis fukin pay to win","timestamp_created":1626593249,"timestamp_updated":1626593249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95946392","author":{"steamid":"76561199172437406","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":6844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1368,"last_played":1653295328},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игра, но без нормального баланса","timestamp_created":1626593078,"timestamp_updated":1626593078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95946328","author":{"steamid":"76561199040449270","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1179,"last_played":1637229834},"language":"russian","review":"Класс маньяки","timestamp_created":1626592970,"timestamp_updated":1626592970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95946236","author":{"steamid":"76561198214622697","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":9962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":88,"playtime_at_review":3920,"last_played":1660510703},"language":"english","review":"If you're a horror fan, get this game.

After 500 hours, I still can't get over the excitement and suspense as a killer is chasing me. That is what keeps me coming back.\n- I haven't played other games in the same genre, but watching gameplay footage, you're not going to get something with as much depth and polish (more on the polish later).\n- A large cast of killers, all of which play differently from each other.\n- Very cool licensed killers from franchises such as Halloween, Stranger Things and Resident Evil.\n- The game is not dead. There's a very active community, and the developers are actively introducing new content and rolling out fixes (more on bugs later). Some in the community are amazing, putting out videos that are literally hours-long to teach players how to improve at the game.\n\nCons:\n- Survivors have a system called Teachable Perks where you unlock perks for all other survivors. As a result, there is little reason to play a particular survivor beyond cosmetics. \n- There is a VERY clear meta because of wonky game balance. To put things into perspective, there are 179 perks in the game right now, but I estimate less than 50 of them are strong enough to be commonly used. It almost feels like most of the perks are there to make getting the strong perks more difficult, which brings us to the grind.\n- The grind is insane, especially for survivors. At 500 hours, I have most of the perks I need, but for a beginner, having strong perks locked behind a character (some of which require you to grind even more or pay money to unlock) is very shitty. You're unlikely to get a meta-strong loadout until you're dozens of hours in. The community has been calling for changes to the grind but nothing has been done yet.\n- The matchmaking is wonky. Getting to the top rank (rank 1) is a function of player skill and time played in a season. Generally speaking, somebody at rank 1 will play better than those at a lower rank. However, it is also VERY commonplace to find unskilled players in that bracket simply because they play for ungodly amounts of time.\n- The game is somewhat buggy. Most recently, Nemesis (from the Resident Evil franchise) had a bug where it would cause certain players to crash at the start of the game. Fortunately, such gamebreaking bugs are rare and usually quickly patched out. What is more commonplace are minor bugs, such as the rare generator on certain variations of a map not being able to repaired from a certain position.\n- The community is toxic. This is somewhat alleviated by the fact that there is no chat until after the match is over, but certain behaviours are very grating. Having said that, this is all in your head. If you don't let it get to you, then this is a moot point. \n- The developers do not seem to listen to or address feedback. I am a fairly new player (started only a few years ago), but I understand it used to be a very tight community where the developers would address feedback. Many players have lamented certain aspects of the game, such as how both types of challenges (which grant currency, so it is in your interest to tackle them) actively require you to throw the game to complete them, or how the difficulty of the challenges vary wildly. However, nothing is done, which makes it seem as though the developers do not care, or they do not play the game themselves and realize these are pain points.\n\nOverall:\n- More needs to be done about the grind, because it is extremely beginner-unfriendly. However, as this problem affects both survivors and killers equally, I think improving the grind is more a quality-of-life adjustment than fixing a critical problem.\n- There are bugs, and there are balance issues, but the polish of the game far outstrips any other game in the genre,\n- If you like horror and exciting gameplay, this is a hard recommend. If you don't like grindy games or horror, don't bother with the game.","timestamp_created":1626592549,"timestamp_updated":1626592669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95946042","author":{"steamid":"76561198042552249","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1626594290},"language":"english","review":"Constantly crashing and it makes me sad :(","timestamp_created":1626592487,"timestamp_updated":1626592487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95945978","author":{"steamid":"76561199154026460","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":171836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1658,"playtime_at_review":71954,"last_played":1660595959},"language":"german","review":"Nerf spirit","timestamp_created":1626592375,"timestamp_updated":1626592375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482954531908035278","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95945815","author":{"steamid":"76561199173527280","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15456,"last_played":1627328784},"language":"english","review":"its so shit","timestamp_created":1626592062,"timestamp_updated":1626592062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95945741","author":{"steamid":"76561199082810861","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":31912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":690,"playtime_at_review":21620,"last_played":1659937999},"language":"schinese","review":"一点也不恐怖（除了鬼面，迈克尔），就是血腥了点","timestamp_created":1626591920,"timestamp_updated":1626591920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95945703","author":{"steamid":"76561198010931780","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13841,"last_played":1655628769},"language":"tchinese","review":"超好玩","timestamp_created":1626591848,"timestamp_updated":1626591848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95945689","author":{"steamid":"76561198805950215","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8873,"last_played":1628016849},"language":"russian","review":"пофиксите блять доктора","timestamp_created":1626591829,"timestamp_updated":1626591829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wLOb3PoCeb2A7gI="}
