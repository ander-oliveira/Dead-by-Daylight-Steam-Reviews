Now with over 550 hours of playtime, I've seen this game through its ups and downs, all of its events, all of its new killers, and all of the metas. I keep coming back to Dead by Daylight because of its incredible replayability. No two matches are the same, and with new content coming out so frequently, the meta doesn't get stale anymore like it would for the first year of the game. Everything is constantly evolving, making each new chapter a new experience. I'm still genuinely scared of Michael Meyers and the Oni killer even after playing dozens of games with them. I still find players who use new and interesting tactics to fool me every game. It's still thrilling to pick a friend up off the ground with just moments to go before the killer gets back. This is my second most played game behind CSGO, and they're both alike in that you can play casually and just hang out with your friends, or you can go really hard and get to the top levels with all the streamers. The learning curve isn't too brutal, but there are still high-skill techs you can use to outwit killers. There are dozens of viable builds now, and this is my favorite action game for its variety.
