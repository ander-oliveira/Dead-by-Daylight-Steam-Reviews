However, this new update is really a double slap in the face by the devs to the community. The hit box is absolutely garbage right now like they didn't even test run it nor did they ask the players beforehand. Some of the map reworks are highly questionable. The new UI is a step in the wrong direction in my opinion. If anything, the UI should be an option. When you're playing this game for a long time, this just blocks the view of survivors in my opinion. Besides the newest updates, I feel the couple past ones punish newer survivors too much and give way too much power to the killer. I see too many new survivor players just quit the game due to the devs still not punishing killer hard camping behavior in 2021 coupled with the recent updates to benefit killers on some maps. I mean for real, the hit box has been kinda bad lately tbh before this update even with low ping.\n\nThe community can be really toxic too for new players to be honest. A lot of friends I used to play this with have already quit. I can consistently get rank 1 or 2 every update, but it takes a toxic killer player to ruin the game by literally face camping even at high ranks.

O jogo é bugado pra caralho, sempre que sai uma patch novo, bugs novos aparecem e antigos ressurgem. Isso acontece muito provavelmente porque quando o jogo foi feito em 2016, eles usavam uma linguagem de programação muito ultrapassada (Blueprints). Eventualmente, eles passaram a programar em C++, mas fizeram isso em cima da bagunça que era (ainda é) o código em Blueprints.\n\nPortanto, o que você mais vai encontrar nesse jogo são bugs, por mais que eles façam patch notes, que nem são tão regulares assim. Direto um sobrevivente fica sem fazer barulhos quando tá machucado, você fica preso numa parede invisível que não deveria estar lá, sem falar dos bugs específicos de cada assassino (Victor ficando preso em estruturas, Nurse não conseguindo teleportar, armadilhas do Trapper spawnando em lugares que não dá pra pegar, e assim em diante...).\n\nE não são apenas os bugs que fazem desse jogo um circo. Os desenvolvedores são MUITO teimosos. Se eles têm algo na cabeça que querem colocar no jogo, não tem o que impeça. Quando eles proporam uma reformulação da interface e animações dos personagens do jogo na atualização 4.5.0, tiveram 1 mês pra coletar feedback antes que a atualização viesse ao live. NINGUÉM gostou de nada, e todo mundo meteu a lenha na interface que ficou parecendo de um jogo mobile. Mas quando chegou o dia do lançamento, eles tacaram o foda-se pra comunidade inteira e implementaram a atualização mesmo assim. E detalhe que com essa atualização, veio um bug que quebrou o jogo, mas que ficou sem solução por quase um mês. A hitbox dos sobreviventes estava dessincronizada com o ponto de vista do assassino, fazendo parecer que você estava mais longe dele, sendo que você estava logo à frente. Isso rendeu semanas e semanas de hits levados a 10 metros de distância.\n\nFelizmente, depois que viram a cagada que fizeram e as reviews da Steam despencaram, fizeram algumas mudanças e o jogo passou a ficar suportável novamente. Ajustaram um pouquinho a interface também, mas não chega nem perto da antiga, que nunca teve problema nenhum e nenhuma necessidade de ser alterada. \n\nOutro problema é que o meta do jogo não é nada flexível. Quando você pega o ritmo do jogo e alcança certo skill cap, espere ver apenas 10 perks dentre as 170 disponibilizadas no jogo sendo usadas em TODA PARTIDA. Tanto do lado dos sobreviventes quanto do assassino. Se os desenvolvedores mudam alguma coisa, são no máximo 5 perks a cada 6 meses. Boa sorte tendo que usar sempre as mesmas habilidades o tempo todo.\n\nEnfim, o jogo tem MUITOS lados negativos mas não é de todo mau, senão eu provavelmente não estaria viciado nele. Você tem basicamente dois jogos em um só: jogando sozinho de assassino, tentando matar os 4 sobreviventes e impedindo que elas fujam. Ou entrando em uma equipe com mais 3 pessoas, de sobrevivente, para reparar geradores, evadir o assassino e tentar escapar vivo. A experiência é ainda mais divertida quando se está com amigos em call. \n\nO jogo tem uma premissa maravilhosa, mas a execução não é das melhores. DBD seria 10 vezes melhor se os desenvolvedores não fossem tão cabeça dura e preguiçosos, a ponto de escutar feedback dos seus jogadores e tentar reformular o meta de vez em quando.\n\n7/10.

Přes všechny bugy jsem tu hru milovala jako žádnou jinou online hru. Čím více ale developeři ukazovali svou pravou tvář, tím méně mě tato hra dokázala držet ve svých bezohledných pařátech. Ze hry, kde jste kdysi měli pocit, že musíte něco umět a být schopni kooperovat, abyste vyhráli se stala noob friendly hra, kde vlastně nepotřebujete nic, než si pořádně někoho vycampit nebo se celou hru velmi prospěšně krčit v křoví a čekat, až zbytek týmu vymře.

I really like how the game has glowed over the years with updates. I mean, back then the target hook box was so fucking shitty. Overall, this game has improved a lot with the graphics. I want to talk about the killers, bc the most recent one that they added 'The Twins' is not my favorite one. I really do think they could have gone with a much refreshing approach with the killer. The Twins is like another mini huntress, ngl. I feel like the devs of the game really had no new ideas on how to make a new killer that they just used huntress' template. The Twins could have really been a good killer if it was made properly. This game is fun with friends, although, I feel like the community can be a bit toxic. Overall, I enjoy playing the game. However, I dont like how i have to keep playing OVER and OVER again to keep my rank the same.","timestamp_created":1613009873,"timestamp_updated":1613009873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371640","author":{"steamid":"76561198118572816","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":162831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":95090,"last_played":1659522746},"language":"japanese","review":"4.5.0のアップデートでゴミになりました。\nテストプレイ時のユーザーの声を無視しアップデートを強行した結果ひとつのゲームが死にました。","timestamp_created":1613009830,"timestamp_updated":1613009830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612924396991729736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371569","author":{"steamid":"76561199040692933","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9611,"last_played":1657925778},"language":"turkish","review":"O'nunla birlikte oynarken çok güzel oyundu, artık değil...","timestamp_created":1613009710,"timestamp_updated":1613009710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":11,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70856243371963501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371334","author":{"steamid":"76561198153841671","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2293,"last_played":1614989350},"language":"english","review":"yeet","timestamp_created":1613009302,"timestamp_updated":1613009302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371280","author":{"steamid":"76561198934542633","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":142254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":133,"playtime_at_review":49750,"last_played":1659841471},"language":"japanese","review":"2021/2/11に書いたレビューではオススメできないと書きましたが、依然としてバグの問題は多くありながらも、楽しくプレイできる状況になったのでオススメに戻します。\n\n今後もプレイヤー目線で楽しくなるようなアップデートをお願いします。","timestamp_created":1613009208,"timestamp_updated":1616753066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371242","author":{"steamid":"76561198097243709","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":51635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1226,"playtime_at_review":6171,"last_played":1660572770},"language":"schinese","review":"买bug送游戏","timestamp_created":1613009146,"timestamp_updated":1613009146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371163","author":{"steamid":"76561198064144776","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":59569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13258,"last_played":1658688001},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo bom, pena que a ultima atualização acabou com ele, ja tive 3 avc's tentando jogar essa merda toda bugada, acabou com as hitboxes do jogo e HUD nem um pouco intuitiva, não recomendo a não ser que arrumem essa porra...","timestamp_created":1613009010,"timestamp_updated":1613009010,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517986118793487549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371117","author":{"steamid":"76561198282153518","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":195,"playtime_at_review":62151,"last_played":1660560415},"language":"koreana","review":"This update version 4.5.0 is really the worst \nUI rollback required","timestamp_created":1613008948,"timestamp_updated":1613008948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86371115","author":{"steamid":"76561198044641675","num_games_owned":453,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":28408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":3510,"last_played":1659840295},"language":"english","review":"Play with some friends as survivor.
