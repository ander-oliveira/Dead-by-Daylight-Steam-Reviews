At my boyfriends house i play dead by daylight all the time and have little errors but i can play multiple times without glitches or issues...But it honestly has to be steam that sucks to be honest.\nI remember downloading another game from them and it constanly glitched and i would always die because of how glitchy the game was, and that was when i had my expensive macbook.\nSo if you dont want your time wasted, do not purchase dead by daylight from steam, they will literally rip you off without any help what so ever, it is so hard to even speak to customer service to resolve an issue, so dont even bother downloading this crap","timestamp_created":1572215073,"timestamp_updated":1572215073,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55846163","author":{"steamid":"76561198216600880","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":18136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9723,"last_played":1610555655},"language":"english","review":"very fun, only for groups of 2-4\n","timestamp_created":1572214744,"timestamp_updated":1572214744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55846024","author":{"steamid":"76561198116866825","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1370,"last_played":1653601851},"language":"brazilian","review":"vai se fude jogo merdakkkkkkkkkk ovo fugi do asasino kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ativ a geardor porraakkkkkkkkkkkk sou fodaaaaaaaaaaa pqp eu jogo demais viu como eu dei olé nele kakakakak puta merda ovo vira pro plei 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🤞🤷‍♀️🙌😢👀😎😎","timestamp_created":1572214305,"timestamp_updated":1572214305,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55845680","author":{"steamid":"76561198320733143","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":48066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18643,"last_played":1617886198},"language":"russian","review":"данная игра стоит того чтобы обасратся, но не от того, что страшно, а от огромного кол-ва багов и чудесного пинга","timestamp_created":1572213235,"timestamp_updated":1572213235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55845511","author":{"steamid":"76561198138839059","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1042,"last_played":1621369030},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun atmosferi güzel ama bugları düzeltmeniz lazım artık.","timestamp_created":1572212713,"timestamp_updated":1572212713,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55845444","author":{"steamid":"76561198983659883","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1642002966},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo otimo para jogar com os amigos otimas mecanicas muitas possibilidades","timestamp_created":1572212566,"timestamp_updated":1601294632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55845193","author":{"steamid":"76561198015918242","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":86893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65154,"last_played":1639143608},"language":"german","review":"Ich kenne dieses Spiel nun schon einige Jahre, um genau zu sein seit dem ersten Tage. Es macht einfach nur Spaß!\nIch möchte mit euch nun Kurz auf das Spiel eingehen....\n\n[h1] .... Worum geht es Überhaupt? [/h1]\nNun, das ist im Grunde ganz Simpel... Es gibt 4 Überlebende und 1 Killer. Die 4 Überlebenden müssen Zusammen 5 Generatoren Reparieren und das Ausgangstor zu öffnen um dem Killer zu Entkommen. Das ist mal leichter und mal Schwerer, je nachdem wie gut der Killer ist.... Und das war es eigentlich auch im ganz groben.\n\n[h1] .... Klingt langweilig? Ist es aber nicht! [/h1]\nProbiert es aus! Es mag auch grade in den ersten Runden Schwer und Frustrierend sein, und letzen endes den anschein Erwecken keinen Spaß zu machen. Aber den schein Trügt! Je mehr man spielt, desto besser lernt man die verschiedenen Spielweise und Arten der Killer kennen. \n\n[h1] .... Was bietet das spiel denn nun alles? [/h1]\nIn diesem Punkt muss ich etwas mehr ausholen. Also zuerst bietet das Spiel in der Grundversion (Ohne DLCs) 4 Überlebende und 3 Killer an die man Spielen kann. Mit Diversen DLCs die man teilweise kaufen muss aber auch teilweise Kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt wurden kann man Aktuell zwischen 19 Überlebenden und 17 Killern wählen. Das bietet Vorallem bei den Killern viel Abwechslung. Jeder Überlebende und jeder Killer bringt Unterschiedliche Perks mit sich. Und jeder Killer hat dazu noch seine ganz eigenen Fähigkeiten. Die Perks sind sogesehen kleine Vorteile die man sich neben Items und Opfergaben Ausrüsten kann. Am Ende einer Runde bekommt man je nach Leistung Blutpunkte, Rangfortschritt und Spielfortschritt. Durch den Spielfortschritt bekommt man bei jedem Level Aufstieg Schillernde scherben, von denen man sich dann im Schrein Perks kaufen kann, oder im Shop Kleidung für Killer und Überlebende. Der Rangfortschritt wird 1x im Monat zurückgestuft. Die Blutpunkte werden dann im Blutnetz verwendet. Dieses Blutnetzt hat jeder Charakter in dem Spiel. Über dieses bezieht ihr eure Items Perks und Opfergaben. Ausserdem werden darüber auf Rang 30, 35, und 40 die Lehrbaren Perks Freigeschaltet. Danach sind diese dann auch in anderen Blutnetzen zu finden! \n\nUm es kurz und knapp zu sagen, es gibt eine Menge zu tun in diesem Spiel.\n\n[h1] ... Wie sieht es mit Achievement Jägern aus? [/h1]\nSehr gut! Es gibt viele und immer wieder neue. Man hat schon gut dran zu nagen um alle zu bekommen.\n\nIch denke nun habe ich alles gesagt was mit grad so eingefallen ist, letzten endes kann ich eine klare Kauf Empfehlung dafür aussprechen....\n-------------------------------------\n[i] Euch hat das Review gefallen, und Interessiert euch für weitere?

W większości są to retardy osoby, które jak tylko zostaną ograne (gdy grasz jako killer) lub zobaczą, że nie poszedłeś zdejmować ich z haka (bo np. wisiałeś już dwa razy, jesteś ranny i nie chcesz zginąć), wykorzystują bardzo przydatną funkcję przejścia na Twój profil Steam do napisania w komentarzu na Twoim profilu kilku wulgarnych i/lub karalnych bardzo miłych zwrotów typu \"zabij się\", \"umrzyj\", \"zgiń na raka\", \"spędziłem miłe chwile z Twoją mamą\". Zdarzają się oczywiście również słowa uznania od graczy, natomiast mam wrażenie że znacznie rzadziej - i mówię ogólnie, a nie tylko opierając się o własne doświadczenia. Trzeba się po prostu do tego przyzwyczaić.\n\n[h1]Zaczynamy grę[/h1]\nW Dead by Daylight rozgrywamy krótkie \"mecze\", w których udział bierze czterech ocalałych (zwanych również survivorami, survami) lub mniej, bo któremuś akurat mama wyłączyła internet w trakcie ładowania rozgrywki i jeden morderca, mordulec, killer, zwał jak zwał. Gra może się skończyć zanim się zacznie jeżeli zabójca się rozłączy... i zgadnij kto wtedy leci z rankingiem w dół... killer ocalały! No dobra, mordercy też ranking spadnie, ale karanie ocalałego za wyjście z gry z której wyszedł przymusowo, ponieważ host (czyli zabójca - btw. serwerem meczu jest toster komputer zabójcy, więc oczekuj pingu na poziomie 20ms 150ms i wcale nie bagatelizuję) się rozłączył jest conajmniej zje*ciach* pomysłem niezgodne z fair-play. W grze nie ma natomiast nierankingowego trybu matchmade, co dolewa oliwy do ognia, ale cóż, przemilczę. Gdy już przebrniemy przez ekran ładowania modląc się, żeby gra zaczęła się tak jak powinna, czyli w pełnym składzie, rozpoczyna się mecz.\n\n[h1]Perspektywa mordercy[/h1]\nZ perspektywy mordercy gra jest w teorii prosta - zabić wszystkich pozostałych. I jeżeli myślałeś, że będziesz niczym wkur*ciach* zdenerwowany nadczłowiek chodzić i kłaść wszystkich na ziemie jednym puknięciem młotka w łeb, to nic z tych rzeczy. Gra zabójcą w uproszczeniu sprowadza się do bycia szukającym w grze w chowanego, a jak już kogoś znajdziesz to musisz go uderzyć, potem pobiegać za nim przez pół mapy od czasu do czasu obrywając paletami w ryj aż w końcu skurczybyka dopadniesz, położysz na ziemie, podniesiesz albo jeżeli team survów jest ogarnięty to dostaniesz teraz (albo już wcześniej) paletą lub latarką w ryj i zabawa w chowanego zacznie się od początku i zawiesisz na haku, bo przecież jesteś seryjnym zabójcą i nie potrafisz zabijać (chyba, że dasz odpowiedni dar dla Bytu [pseudobóstwa tej gry] i będziesz mógł wykonać coś na wzór Fatality z Mortal Kombat, ale (a) jako nowy gracz nie wiesz, że coś takiego istnieje (b) i tak żeby móc takie coś wykonać nasza szanowna ofiara musi raz zawisnąć). Na tymże haku ofiara musi sobie trochę powisieć, ewentualnie może zginąć w ułamek sekundy jeżeli ma IQ 0 nie ma przyjaciół, albo jej nie kochają, albo jeśli będzie chciała pokazać, że jest idiotą dziś wygrała główną kumulację i zaryzykuje kilka prób samodzielnego zejścia z haka (z szansą 4%). Oczywiście jeżeli będziesz campił pilnował tego przepięknego rytuału śmierci zostaniesz, jak już wcześniej wspomniałem, zlinczowany na swoim profilu (więc nie zapomnij ustawić go jako prywatny). Reasumując, najlepiej będzie jeśli po prostu dasz innym uratować kolegę z haka, bo wtedy będziesz przecież dobrą mordą i napiszą Ci \"GG\"... no problem tylko w tym, że będziesz musiał bawić się w chowanego dwanaście razy, a nawet nie, bo zanim uda Ci się powiesić kogoś drugi raz, gra zakończy się ucieczką wszystkich czterech osób.\n\n[h1]Perspektywa ocalałego[/h1]\nI tutaj znowu w teorii wszystko wydaje się proste - musisz przeżyć, ale problem polega na tym, że morderca i czasem również reszta ocalałych będzie robić wszystko żebyś umarł. Aby zakończyć mecz z zadowalającym rezultatem musisz wraz ze swoim teamem naprawić 5 lub mniej, jeżeli jeden z kolegów się nie połączył generatorów (zwanych również silnikami), otworzyć bramę i uciec przez nią albo ewentualnie poczekać aż wszyscy pozostali zginą i wskoczyć do klapy w podłodze, która pojawia się w losowym miejscu na mapie. Przez większość gry musisz więc dobrze się chować, wychodzić gdy nikt nie patrzy i \"robić swoje\", no chyba że jakimś pierdo*ciach* cudem zrespisz się zaraz obok zabójcy i się na Ciebie uwieźmie, wtedy masz drogi kolego przeje*ciach* przewalone, i Twoja gra zamiast przypominać chowanego, zamieni się w coś na rodzaj berka. To samo się stanie również jeżeli morderca nie jest idiotą ślepy/głuchy i (a) w trakcie naprawy silniczek, który naprawiasz Ty lub jeden z Twoich przyjaciół współocalałych przypadkiem zrobi *bum* (b) przeskoczysz szybko przez przeszkodę (c) Ty lub ktoś w trakcie leczenia Cię skaleczy. Jeżeli grasz z przyjaciółmi i o ile tylko Twoi przyjaciele nie są debilami trollami, komunikacja z nimi powinna znacząco zwiększyć Twoje szanse na przeżycie. Gra sama w sobie podczas rozgrywki nie umożliwia głosowej komunikacji, ba, nie ma nawet zwykłego czatu. I nawet jeżeli ma to swoje plusy - nie musimy słuchać darcia ryja niewychowanych dwunastolatków pięknych głosów młodego pokolenia ani czytać obraz komplementów na czacie w trakcie gry (co pozwala się lepiej skupić na grze), to niestety nie możemy również uzyskać od naszego teamu informacji dla nas kluczowych (gdzie znajdują się pozostali ocalali, co aktualnie robią, gdzie jest morderca, etc.).\n\n[h1]System progresji[/h1]\nTeraz czas na trochę poważniejszą część - progresja. Po każdym ukończonym meczu dostajemy \"punkty krwi\" (ang. bloodpoints), które możemy spożytkować na levelowanie dowolnej postaci (nasz \"stan konta\" jest współdzielony pomiędzy wszystkimi postaciami, czyli punkty zdobyte np. grając mordercą możemy użyć do rozwoju jednego z ocalałych). Aby podnieść poziom wybranego bohatera, należy przejść w jego \"drzewko krwi\" (ang. \"bloodweb\") i muszę przyznać, że system progresji jest bardzo dobry, a jedyne co boli w oczy to - przyspieszone w ostatniej aktualizacji, zupełnie niepotrzebnie - animacje. Wbicie maksymalnego (50) poziomu na jednym bohaterze nie zajmuje wcale długo, dlatego twórcy wprowadzili system prestiżu - po wbiciu maksymalnego poziomu, możemy go zresetować i w zamian otrzymujemy jedną z 3 części ekskluzywnego skina. Podsumowując, jest co \"maksować\" więc grinderzy będą w siódmym niebie.\n\n[h1]Jak zepsuć grę od strony programisty[/h1]\n*HOSTUJ SERWER GRY NA KOMPUTERZE GRACZA! ZAPISZ PROGRESS POSTACI NA DYSKU KLIENTA! CO MOŻE PÓJŚĆ NIE TAK??!?!?!?!!* W ciągu 90 godzin gry dwa razy zdarzyło mi się, że na mapie nie pojawiły się generatory i po delikatnym researchu w internecie okazało się, że to niestety wina miłego pana mordercy, który użył haksów Nieautoryzowanego Oprogramowania (trademark), które spowodowało, że mapa wyglądała jak wyglądała. Było też kilka przypadków, gdzie osoba mająca kilka godzin w grze miała niedostępne ciuchy i perki 3 poziomu. Nie jest to oczywiście plaga i problem występuje dosyć rzadko, ale to niezwykle frustrujące doświadczenie sprawia, że ma się ochotę grę rzucić i do niej nie wrócić. Jako software developer i security engineer jestem zażenowany jak można tak spier*ciach* postąpić.\n\n[h1]Zaskakujące podsumowanie[/h1]\nMimo wszystko polecam Dead by Daylight. Jest to całkiem dobry i oryginalny tytuł, a cała ta recenzja jest tylko półserio. Jeżeli nie doszukałeś się w niej ironii, przeczytaj ją jeszcze raz.

Spiel, dass sehr viel Spaß macht, aber noch viel besser sein kann und hoffentlich sein Potenzial nutzt. Es sollte außerdem die Möglichkeit geben, dass in einer Gruppe von Freunden einer der Killer sein kann und die anderen Überlebende oder eines Zufall Modus, der dann die 5 Spielern jeden zufällig einen Charakter bzw. gleichzeitig den Killer auswählt, damit könnten auch Freunde untereinander Killer und Überlebende zusammen/gegen einander spielen, ohne Benutzerdefiniertes Spiel. Das wäre so der größte Punkt. Ein anderer kleinerer Punkt, aber ein sehr guter ist der, dass man als Überlebender die Möglichkeit haben sollte den Killer, wenn dieser einen Freund aufgehoben hat, ihn durch Kleinigkeiten (z.B kleine schubster) den Weg zum Hacken zu erschweren, aber der Killer hat die Chance die Überlebenden, wenn sie ihn versuchen zu manipulieren, die anzugreifen.\nMein letzter Punkt ist, dass man irgendwie anders die Überlebenden und Killer freischalten kann, weil nur durch In-Game-Käufe andere Charaktere spielen zu können verlieren viele Spieler nur nach kurzer Zeit die Lust. Mein Vorschlag, In-Game-Käufe für die Spieler, die keine Lust haben solange zu warten, aber sie kriegen beim Kopf paar andere Kleidungsstile dazu und die anderen können durch z.B Level, spezielle Aufgaben, Rank oder durch viele Blut Punkte die Charaktere freischalten.\nIch persönlich würde mir unbedingt Pennywise (IT) als weiteren Killer wünschen, da es mega cool wäre den Kinderfresser mal in einem Videospiel zu sehen, aber bitte das neue Design oder beide Designs als Outfits. \n\nIch hoffe mal auf mögliche Veränderungen, Danke","timestamp_created":1572181258,"timestamp_updated":1572181258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55833445","author":{"steamid":"76561198387031978","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":150439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1867,"playtime_at_review":9222,"last_played":1660552815},"language":"english","review":"Game has it's problems but that doesn't stop me from living the game.
