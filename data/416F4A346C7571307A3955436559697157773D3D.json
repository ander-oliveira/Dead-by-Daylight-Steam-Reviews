I will start with the most glareing reasons. I am sad to say this though because I love the concept and really tried to like the game.  \n\nSo to start off with we will do Cons since I don't reccomend the game:\n\nFirst Glaringly unplayable due to lots of issues with glitches. I have about 10 friends who play this game of those 10 atleast 3 experince glitches that range from weird and annoying to game breaking. I have videos on my stream of the gamebreaking glitches happening lots of times while I am live. I can go into details but most glitches include character models tripping out or worse broken game client that doesn't work/crashes entirely kicking you from the match.\n\nThere is a little box that comes up saying when did this happen? I wrote in a few times but quickly gave up and waited a few weeks for a patch. Most might say (oh it's on your end something isn't installed properly but I have done all the appropriate things to make sure the game should have no issues. I have a brand new I5-6600K processor 16 gigs of ram a gtx 980ti etc. etc. You  get the point it was proffessionally built and less than 2 months old. No issues with any other game I play and verified intergritty of the files in steam. These glitches happen 1 out of 3 games and leave me relaunching with no points and a loss for the match. \n\nOutside of that matchmaking is REALLY REALLY BAD. By this I mean the times are huge considering  everyone is playing this game, the ranks are so spread out bottom ranks playing agasint top ranked players etc. one or the other would be meh fine. But I have an average of 3-5 minutes at least for queues and then I will have a rank or level that has atleast 10 times as much time in the game as I do. This coupled with the crashing make the game really hard to play in the first place.\n\nThose are out of game issues or playability. So how is the game when it is running properyly? It is fun definitely fun. I'd probably change this to a reccomend but not a 10/10 OMG get this reccomendation. as it stands. The game has a fun concept solo tough guy vs 4 weak guys trying to escape. Think mario party but a bit more complicated.\n\nWith that being said it isn't super duper complicated. The concept is simple and easy enough to figure out after a match or two making the learning curve not too steep. However with perks and items there is enough to keep you invested for quite a while perfecting your master plans. I give it a 100 or 200 play hours before I would find myself bored or craving something new. However I can't do it with all the issues. With that being said 100 hours on a game that's only 20 bucks? totally worth it!!! I think this is a great game that should have had more polish and a cleaner launch. Worst launch ever?? No blizzard holds that record in my book. but blizzard also cleaned up a lot faster this is 2 or 3 weeks out and I still see people having issues no one can solve. \n\nAll in all do you loovvvveee the concept and you're willing to take the risk? If so buy it. but if you're going to be frustrated by mechanics not being polished, random crashes, and horrible matchmaking? stay away!!","timestamp_created":1467273013,"timestamp_updated":1467273013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23948031","author":{"steamid":"76561198247684748","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2560,"last_played":1568054847},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая в своем роде!!!!10 Join a Lobby из 10!!!","timestamp_created":1467272963,"timestamp_updated":1467272963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23948026","author":{"steamid":"76561198083933652","num_games_owned":389,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2013,"last_played":1526902571},"language":"russian","review":"Сразу скажу, что \"бомбануло\" после патча.\n\nНачнем с начала. \nИгра со старта много всего обещала, но вышла \"сырой\", как будто это бетка, не оптимизированной, с кучей багов, маньяками хостами (которые абузят пинг, чтобы у вас все лагало) и без обещанных карточек (2 недели прошло и решили таки добавить).\n\nАх да, забыл про читеров!! пару раз встречался с маньяками, которые телепортировались по генераторам, один раз маньяк был с явным ВХ, и КУЧА людей наигравших менее 10 часов, но уже с 50ым уровнем и несколькими престижами на выживших и маньяка со всеми вытекающими из этого бонусами. Их кстати, все еще не забанили, они, как играли, так и играют и вполне возможно,что в следующей игре они попадутся вам и вы сольете ранг.\n\nНо это можно было терпеть, потому, что задумка игры просто офигенная, чтобы не тормозила игра, я даже поставил Low настройки и играл при 30 фпс, хотя имею конфигурацию компа на которой топ игры идут на высоких с 50+ фпс.\n\nШло время, я долго сидел на 20ом ранге, пока не начал играть за Мэг, с ее спринтом, который хоть как то уравнивал шансы побега. И вот тогда игра пошла, я набирался опыта, научился выживать и с переменным успехом я получал в 2 из 3 игр каплю и повышал свой ранг. \n\nИ вот вышло обновление, испортившее перки, которое меньше всего затронуло тех, против кого оно и было выпущено! Пытались пофиксить опытных выживающих, которых единицы, а в итоге испортили игру всем остальным. Потому, что опытные и с этими ограничениями затащат, а вот новички и те, у кого уровень перка маленький, теперь вообще не могут играть и повышать ранг.\nЕсли раньше ливали из игры единицы выживающих, то теперь, почти в каждой игре, кто нибудь да ливнет, что усложняет выживание остальных.\n\nКонечно, зачем заниматься оптимизацией игры, фиксом багов и введением лобби с другом, если можно выпустить гавно - патч, который испортит игру!\n\nDC (это кароче ливание) теперь наказывается только со стороны выживающих (хотя, повторюсь, после патча, ливеров стало толпы), ведь теперь, за это дают еще и очки маньяку.\nЕсли же обиженка маньяк ливнет, после того, как вы открыли ворота, чтобы вы не получили 5000 за побег, то все нормально, разработчикам на это пофигу.

This game has so many amazing moments and in my opinion this game has one of the best \"Chase\" mechanics. Yet they repeatedly fall short due to the survivors ability to undermine all your efforts by \"juking\" you by using infinite loops that take advantage of the killers inability to get through objects at any speed faster than turtles doing it. At this point you are stuck in a strugle of the HARDEST game of stareing. You begin to wonder who is going to go which way. It doesn't matter even if you did. The outcome is always the same. Ends up wasting all of your time. The best part of this whole thing is... that when you finally catch them. they decide to deny you the honor of the kill. You surprisingly get a CONSOLATION prize at the end if enough people leave in stupid ways. Two left my previous game which probably stole 500 - 1750 (+ xp boosts) from me by the cowardice of the whole situation. I fairly caught you after you destroyed my psyche and you ******* leave??? \n\nTL:DR: The game is great (8/10 -- arbitrary), survivors are fun, Hella custimization, overall fun gameplay from both sides but falls short due to the balancing issues.","timestamp_created":1467264886,"timestamp_updated":1467264886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23945685","author":{"steamid":"76561198047343903","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":54222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":38,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1660099758},"language":"english","review":"I liked this game, but there needs to have a voice chat option, because this game would be more fun if you could communicate with random strangers while in a public lobby and outside of any chat rooms like skype.","timestamp_created":1467264480,"timestamp_updated":1467264480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23945578","author":{"steamid":"76561198113675203","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":1030,"last_played":1660458452},"language":"english","review":"Great game, please revoke my ban?","timestamp_created":1467264095,"timestamp_updated":1596094061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23945448","author":{"steamid":"76561197985060906","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2854,"last_played":1476157441},"language":"french","review":"With the coop online now... i can put Yes Buy it!!!

For example you could be halfway through the game but then all of a sudden usernames just start popping up as if more people are joining the game, but you can't join in the middle of a match so it just crashes to desktop because it doesn't know how to respond to that.

I have so far been bugged out on a hill as of today, the torch just doesnt work at all, or if it does its so difficult to use it's just not worth it. I have been in games where I cannot interact with any obstacles. There seems to be a serious issue in game with players leaving half way through the match. This is incredibly annoying if the killer leaves as you miss out on a lot of XP especially if you have a clean line of escaping, there should be a punishment toll thats put in place to also play with unreliable rage quit players. And not only that, but even after this long a core mechanic that should have been in place since the get go has not been implemented yet... the ability to join friends and join a lobby as a two or three or even four. You are left having to scout lobby after lobby to try and randomly bump into your mate to play in a match with them, which I can imagine is annoying for the rest in the lobby waiting. Also whilst trying to join it would often say 'Failed to join lobby' countless times, or bug out to go back to the waiting menu. These things need to be fixed, they are essential for the game to work smoothly. \n\nThat being said, this game is great fun when it does work and it gives you a great adrenaline rush with the killer trying to find you/chase you. The addition of more characters both survivor and killer will always be welcome, likewise more maps, and even different game modes. This game has a lot of potential and it's a fair price as well, look forward to the fixes. Buy it if you have money to spare, but if you want to have a smooth experience, just download after a month or so, hopefully it's sorted by then...","timestamp_created":1467251349,"timestamp_updated":1467251349,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23942009","author":{"steamid":"76561197992659304","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":78695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53151,"last_played":1645269562},"language":"russian","review":"Просто могу сказать, что игрушка веселая, местами страшная, интересная и захватывает с первых минут, что потом не можешь оторваться, за свою цену очень годная мультиплеерная игра.
