To win, the Survivors must not sacrificed by the Killer, and repair 5 generators to power the escape gates. If they manage to open the gates and escape, that survivor wins--an unlucky soul may be caught before they can get out. The Killer must, at least, sacrifice 2 Survivors for a 'draw', and 3 or more for a 'win'. 1 or less is a loss.\n\nWith a quasi-realistic artstyle, DBD focuses on gritty details and horrifying elements to deliver on its horror themes. Players can expect to see a lot of staple horror icons, like characters and locations, even from licensed franchises that have given permission for DBD to utilize them. Some examples are: Sadako (Ringu), Pinhead (Hellraiser), Pyramid Head (Silent Hill), Nemesis, alongside Leon Kennedy + Jill Valentine (Resident Evil), etc. DBD also features original characters, with two notable examples being the Huntress and the Trapper.\n\nThe audio design as a whole serves to feature tension, suspense, as well as classic horror deliveries like jump scare cues and disturbing sound bites. This is an important part of the gameplay itself, as the audio system conveys important information like possible locations, being spotted, being chased, etc. The presence, or lack, of sound is an appreciably important thing to observe, and it is generally quite pleasing to my ear.\n\nThere is functionally little narrative to DBD itself, featuring a very loose framework to justify its own existence. A transdimensional being called 'The Entity' hungers for the psychic juice of terror those being hunted down exude. It reaches across realities, kidnapping or luring people and killers to pit them in a death game. What other narrative exists is mostly for tie-ins and pop culture nods; so it is fun and engaging to read, but should be taken at face value.\n\nNow, as to the gameplay itself ... Well.\n\nThere's some problems. Hopefully I don't run out of space here.\n\nSurvivors are all played the same, but with a different appearance and audio design thrown ontop. Survivor in-game abilities are defined by items and perks, which are eventually shared when unlocked. Killers, however, are defined by their iconic abilities and perks. A Killer's abilities is what makes each Killer unique, while their perks can be interchanged as desired. Hence, picking a Survivor is largely a cosmetic choice, but a Killer choice has tangible gameplay impact.\n\nItems and Perks are unlocked through the Blood Web, a tortuous mini-game akin to a hamster wheel. You spend Blood Points, a freely gained currency, to unlock items and perks for your chosen character. Items are expendable, meaning you can eventually 'run out' and have to spend more Blood Points in the Blood Web to *maybe* unlock some more. Perks are, thankfully, once unlocked, permanent for that character.\n\nHowever, the Blood Web system is the first grave sin of DBD. Items have varying impacts to a character's playstyle, both Survivor and Killer. Items come in rarity tiers, with more rare items being tangibly more powerful or unique in their offerings. Using these items means you will eventually run out, and must use others or farm the Blood Web. It also means certain items are just garbage, clogging up the Blood Web to dilute more useful ones from appearing.\n\nItems are especially important for Killers as they can radically change their playstyles. Sadako, the Killer I'm most familiar with, can flex between roaming stealth, rapid speed from her TVs, Survivor sensory blinding, and more. These items can create very different behaviors even in the same Killer, but oh well, you ran out of items and so your play style is locked out ... for some reason?\n\nThe common argument is 'rarity promotes more powerful, limited options', but this is a fallacious argument. The game would adjust its design, not simply let overpowered items remain so. Limited items encourage peaks and valleys that, ultimately, punish the player by eventually not allowing them to play how they want to. A carrot on a stick, as it were.\n\nWhile this isn't a sin, an endemic problem to DBD is the gameplay loop itself.\n\nSurvivors want to fix generators, Killers must stop those generators and sacrifice survivors. However, there is one Killer, and four Survivors. If you thought \"have 2 people repair a generator while the others get chased by the Killer\", you have identified 95% of DBD's gameplay. Generators are how Survivors win, so the only acceptable perks for Killers are ones that all stop generators. Survivors will generally take information denying, kill evading, and time wasting perks to frustrate the Killer.\n\nSo, it is less a horror game and more a game of constant tagging.\n\nOn the surface this does work, but it linearizes DBD into 'generators matter the most'. I found this state of affairs particularly frustrating as the Killer, as higher level teams learned to do the '2 by 2' split (2-3 doing generators, 1-2 being chased by me) as the defacto method. It trapped me in a dilemma of being unable to chase for long (and thus get no kills), or chase too long and they repair generators. As a survivor, it essentially meant holding to that same pattern of behavior without being caught.\n\nYou might see there's a strange, warped tilt to the game where Killers do not (often) have the fundamental tools to compensate for 4 skilled, fully aware human opponents. It fell to the Survivors to lose the game by playing badly, not the Killer to win for playing skillfully. This created a divide among Killers: those who could still force wins on their own, and everyone else.\n\nYeah.\n\nSurvivors have many options to choose from, but there are definitively 'bad' and 'good' Killers. Depending on which side you play as, and who you like, this will have dire ramifications for your growth. As a Killer main player, I do not like the state of Killer balance, nor the singular focus on generator regression as the only viable play style. While the upcoming balance patch may address some of this pain, it is a fundamental game design. Whether or not DBD will attempt to change that, to me, sounds like an impossible question.\n\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nAs a Survivor player, you can enjoy up to 4 player co-op with random people or your friends to outwit a human Killer opponent. As a Killer, you must hunt down and kill as many Survivors as you can, using a wide arrange of terrifying tools to do so. At its heart, I do like DBD and its ideas, but I've run headfirst into the wall of deeply flawed problems in how it works. The inherent lopsidedness of the 4 vs 1 arrangement poses some hard questions about game design and viable balance. It only becomes much worse at 'higher levels of play' against increasingly skilled opponents using optimized strategies and 'best in slot' items and perks.\n\nSo, I can recommend playing Dead By Daylight with an eye toward a casual party experience, rather than a competitive high-stakes engagement. You will generally know how the game works within a few hours if you're looking to test it before refunding.\n\nI'll be up front in that the characters I do like to play are considered 'bottom tier', or essentially bad and terrible to win with. It is a harsh penalty I willfully chose as I liked those characters and not others. Those who prefer characters that are high tier may walk away with a much different experience than me.\n\nI also cannot overstate how much I hate the Blood Web system, and how it distorts game balance around itself. It is a pointlessly frustrating thing that only harms the game by existing, and I hope it's removed at some point. The only redeeming quality is that it has no microtransactions tied to it, so it is not a financially predatory system; it's just a tortuous hamster wheel instead.","timestamp_created":1657412595,"timestamp_updated":1657412595,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118541724","author":{"steamid":"76561198977032755","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2322,"playtime_at_review":31386,"last_played":1660481757},"language":"english","review":"I do recommend it, but you will sell yourself out for the DLC.
