gonna just leave the worst parts of buying this game straight off the bat,\n\n1. The devs are all cringy Vtubers, furries, or both.\n\n2. New updates don't actually add much to the game and just \"balance it,\" even though the balances or new updates always end with either the originally op thing being more op, the same amount of op, or completely dog water.\n\n3. The community is worse than Rust's, Tarkov's, and LoL's (League of Legends), combined, because atleast in those games you find people you enjoy playing with, here in DBD you're more likely to win that $1 billion mega millions jackpot thrice over than find someone you don't want to strangle, every game I find people who spam flashlights, camp pallets, rush gens, and then tbag at the end despite not actually playing the game and just using a map and key to open hatch early.\n\n4. The game is grindy as shit, with the new update they make you prestiege 3 times just to get a higher level ability, while i do prefer this way and it is for every character, I'd prefer if it didn't cost roughly 1.6 MILLION BLOODPOINTS PER PRESTIEGE (bloodpoints are the currency in the game, ik, very clever name), it makes it even worse when only in a GOOD GAME where I don't find all those toxic and abusive players as I mentioned before where I get even slightly above 80k bloodpoints, and when you do find those garbage players and aren't fucking 300000 hour, god tier, top rank players that you see on youtube all the time then you're going to be playing poorly, because you're just a normal players, that's what 99% of the playerbase are, they're normal, casual players who will make 40k or less in a bad game, and at most 80-120k per game.\n\n5. The dlc issue, I don't know if many people have this issue, but to make 1-3 new characters every 3 months IS IMPRESSIVE, but the way they went about it I just don't agree on, they went the EA route and made you pay for each new pack, when i first got this game a year ago, (yes, I know it's not a very long time I've owned this game) I bought the very tip top version, now, what I expect before I buy is, \"Oh it must have some copyrighted characters that cost more to make, I'll buy the slightly more expensive version so I can get more out of it,\" but to my surprise, despite getting the \"expansion packs\" I didn't even get all of the killers, ALL OF THE KILLERS that were copyrighted were left out, they made you PAY EXTRA MONEY, (looking at the pricetags now they make you PAY 50 EXTRA DOLLARS), FOR 11 KILLERS THAT AREN'T EVEN COPYRIGHTED, just for example, that's the price of these, MUCH, MUCH better games: Tiny Tina's wonderland, Sea of thieves, Dying light the definitive edition, or God of war. They charge a full AAA price for 11 characters, all of which they already own, (for anyone that might be confused why I keep bringing up the \"No copyright,\" and \"Already own,\" parts of these characters is that it makes it much easier to obtain these characters, you take fans ideas or make your own, make the character and think of some lore, and boom, you can release it, for characters like the onryo (the ring), ghostface, nemesis, etc, the people who market and develop the game have to do so much more work, extra money put into getting the license, figuring out just exactly what their power might be as killers like ghostface are just normal killers, and what the lore of the killers will be, as what I mean is to figure how to learn to mix their own spice into original lore of the killer.) what doesn't help is when I hear \"ULTIMATE EDITION\" I think i'm getting ALL THE SHIT, ALL THE DLC, not the shit I expect to get in the base version of the game, so when I first bought this game I was pretty pissed at the fact I had to spend even more money just to get one killer that I wanted and a survivor of which I would never. Fucking. Play. \n\n6. Anticheat just not fuckin existent, while you don't always see hackers, they're the most obvious shit, instant gens, heals, and wiggles, can't die, super speed, and LITERAL FUCKING FLIGHT, like, having a bad anticheat is one thing, but when it works but only when it can detect the client is just fuckin flawed.\n\nHonestly, I feel my review may be flawed, but just don't fucking waste your money on this game, $20 can get you borderlands: the handsome edition, the devs are shit, the game is shit, EA ass marketing, shittiest community imaginable, overall, one of the worst games I can think of despite it being so huge. buy a different game, if you wanna buy the better editions, spend that money elsewhere, Tarkov, rust, the newest shittier version of COD, whatever you want other than this actual garbage excuse of a game.","timestamp_created":1660099745,"timestamp_updated":1660099745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507414281368255615","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120369091","author":{"steamid":"76561198274232637","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":54761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1760,"playtime_at_review":53072,"last_played":1660537545},"language":"english","review":"its ok","timestamp_created":1660099567,"timestamp_updated":1660099567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120368536","author":{"steamid":"76561198159317477","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1018,"playtime_at_review":973,"last_played":1660438076},"language":"english","review":"At first I was skeptical but then woah... amazing game to play with friends and ♥♥♥♥ yourself while making some good laughs.

OP Killers early on can keep you in matches to rank up blood-points whether you want to or not. Survivors who just stand there or hide in closets. People leaving matches. Wraith and Mike Myers abilities in particular keep new players totally frustrated, there should be a better tutorial system and bot matches. Players throwing matches, ugh. Just a mess.\n\nEnvironments/Gameplay: The randomly generated environments are cool, but need more stuff in the way of both detail and interactive items. They are so empty feeling. Just more stuff you can knock over, hide behind, etc. I like the idea of weapons. Not to kill the killer but to slow them, shoot out a window in order to jump through it, use as a distraction, damage totems or Killer traps etc. Or finding a walkie-talkie allowing you to talk to another player if they have one as well! The environments are too \"nice\" More fog, more darkness, more shadows, more reflections, MORE! The animation for most things could be a bit more diverse. animation for hugging walls, flailing at plant life as you run through it etc, would all help the experience to feel more real and to give each character a bit more personality and individualism. Whats the point of even having so many characters if they can eventually all use the same abilities and have the same animation for everything?\n\nMusic: The music and sound effects work very well. My only gripe here is that the music is too muffled. I guess it makes sense for players to hear sound cues in match, but even the main menus the music sounds like there's a pillow over the speaker.\n\nMoney: I get that a new, small, indy studio needs to make money, and Day By Daylight's system is no worse or better than others out there except for one thing... THIS GAME SHOULD BE A FREE TO PLAY. Sorry not sorry, you get a handful of characters and then have to grind hard or spend money to get anything else. You shouldn't have to play for the base game on any platform. \n\nMenus: The menus, item systems, lore, etc are some of the best aspects of this game. I just wish you could see the offerings for a moment longer before they are burned for the match.\n\nIf you enjoy multiplayer games and don't mind being either singled out for repeat punishment, forced to farm, forced to wait or stuck in a match you know you cannot win after the first two minutes, this is the game for you lol It has amazing potential and a great concept with beautiful menus (PC) but it needs work in almost every category.  I will stick with it to at least get one survivor to 50 and then I'll revisit this review.","timestamp_created":1660098297,"timestamp_updated":1660098297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120368312","author":{"steamid":"76561198269058647","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1478,"playtime_at_review":1338,"last_played":1660572916},"language":"japanese","review":"saikou","timestamp_created":1660098254,"timestamp_updated":1660098254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120368112","author":{"steamid":"76561198869177530","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":33805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":588,"playtime_at_review":33805,"last_played":1660097556},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo favorece DEMAIS o assassino ao ponto de 5 pessoas estarem em desvantagem no mapa.

I recommend this game to anyone and everyone, now that people are no longer relying on dead hard after the newest update I feel that the ranking system is more accurate as the survivors actually have to know how to kite properly instead of relying on handicaps. 5 stars keep it up","timestamp_created":1660091246,"timestamp_updated":1660091246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120363907","author":{"steamid":"76561199140208383","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2243,"playtime_at_review":1338,"last_played":1660597269},"language":"brazilian","review":"eu recomendo muito esse jogo, ainda é bem melhor jogar com os amigos tem muita mais zueria k","timestamp_created":1660091090,"timestamp_updated":1660091090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120363796","author":{"steamid":"76561198150923187","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":42584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":792,"playtime_at_review":42060,"last_played":1660595684},"language":"brazilian","review":"top","timestamp_created":1660090853,"timestamp_updated":1660090853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120363764","author":{"steamid":"76561198141404281","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":452,"playtime_at_review":20924,"last_played":1660268577},"language":"english","review":"I keep getting tunneled. 8/10","timestamp_created":1660090811,"timestamp_updated":1660090811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120363446","author":{"steamid":"76561199346003606","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":95,"playtime_at_review":7090,"last_played":1660095825},"language":"english","review":"yes.","timestamp_created":1660090243,"timestamp_updated":1660090243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120363219","author":{"steamid":"76561198365070236","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1652,"playtime_at_review":13337,"last_played":1660542080},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fun when I play with friends!
