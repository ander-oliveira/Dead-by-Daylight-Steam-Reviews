Сама идея создать игру с таким геймплеем заслуживает похвалы, но реализация просто на дне. У меня в жизни уже была такая ситуация. На районе открыли шаурмечную в которой делают офигенную шавуху и не только. Каждый день к ним приходит куча народу, но есть там просто невозможно, так как места попросту мало, вот и получается, что вроде бы золотая жила не может нормально себя реализовать. С ДБД тоже самое, разработчики - иноваторы, придумали хорошую идею с маньяком и 4 жертвами. Ни где такого не было, проект встретили одобрением, деньги потекли в карман. И, кажется, вот она гора денег и отличная игра, которая может стать чем то сродни доты, только в другом жанре. Но хуй там плавал. Разработчики видимо кодят на тетрисе, при чем ногами. Оптимизация на ноле. Имея дома комп, которым я хакал американские выборы, на котором я смог запустить нового гульмэна, я все равно не могу играть нормально, все вечно лагает, зависает, фризит. Про эпичнейшие баги в стиле, застрянь у геника или поубегай сразу от 2 маньяков я и говорить не буду, ЭТО ПИЗДЕЦ. Плюс инноваций за последнее время и действительно годных патчей ноль. Все те же 5 геников и 2 двери.

by Daylight - A game i love\nGreetings Killer and Survivor and (maybe) devs,\n\ni want to write a little review about the game. I only see totally negative posts and thats annoys me. But now i'm coming with a review that is (mostly) positive!\n\nFirst of all i will write things i like about the game and after that i write things what they could improve and maybe ideas for the game.\n\nThe positive aspect of the game: \n\nFirst: The idea of the game. Really, i like the idea playing survivor and killers. First of all it is a new idea. I dont know a game what is similar. And thats awesome. \n\nSecond: The different aspects of the killers (they are unique) and the aspect of the survivors. I like it that each killer is totally different, and the survivors are almost \"the same\". With \"the same\" i mean, every survivor you play you really feel like you are \"just\" a survivor. And thats awesome. \n\nThird: The feeling when playing the game. I totally like the graphics even if they are not over 9000 HD. It fits TOTALLY to the style of the game. The atmosphere is totaly awesome. \nI want to see the game when it gets 4k Textures but it can still stay on this graphic style. Its just fits the atmosphere.\n\nFourthly: That DLC style. I like the way how the game handle DLC's. If you want to play the new survivor you have to pay for it. If you want to play the killer 100% of the time, you can pay. BUT! you dont have to pay for the killer, you can play him for free if you get the shard on another killer. Thats totally awesome (maybe the price is a bit off but its alright). \n\nFifth: That the game is still in works and the weekly stream. I really like how the devs (yes, you there, who (maybe) reading this and programming the game) stay in contact with the community. And yes, at the holidays there was a bug that killers got other abilitys from other killers, but the devs had holidays and there are only humans too. It wasnt a bug that crashed all games or deleted all players. And the users who use it at ranked games will get punished ( do they?) So its fine. \n\nSixth: The time that the game needs to update. Yeah, fast updates are great but i like it when you have time to learn the new things before there are new content released. Sometimes its to much in short time. \n\nNow i'm going to say some things that i dont like about the game. \n\nFirst: The holy damn community. Yes. It's annoying to read every second or even 1.5 comment that this game is ♥♥♥♥ and stuff like that. Yeah, bugs happen, in every game. Stop complaining and post them on the Bug Report forum. Thanks. And maybe give good information instead of \"How ♥♥♥♥ing stupid ♥♥♥♥ motha... is this game\". Thats just totally annoying (most of the time even funny). \n\nSecond: Some bugs. But yeah. They are in every game. \n\nThird: The potential not used. This game has so much capabilities that arent used. I hope it will be updated with all of his capabilities. Like the survivor can stun the killer with hand and such things. \n\nFourth: The community. Oh, did i say that before? Thats the most im annoyied about. \n\nFifth: Not much maps. And not much free customasation(Sorry dont know how to write this word) or customisation at all. They are few, but i want more. (:3)\n\nThat was all about the things i wanted to say. And yes, i dont have much points for the bad things. I really like this game so much, it makes so much fun. I dont know what is all planned for the game so maybe even some points can be deleted.\n\nGreetings\nStrichcode 92\naka\nbarcode 92 \n","timestamp_created":1484210666,"timestamp_updated":1484210666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456056982278823853","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29199172","author":{"steamid":"76561198111272106","num_games_owned":1470,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":11127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9017,"last_played":1559017582},"language":"english","review":"Just too buggy in its current stage. Devs are more concerned about releasing unbalanced DLCs than actually fixing the game. Rank 4 Survivor and face a HUGE amount of face campers. The game is insanely unbalanced and the Devs seem to only care about making the killers even more deadly. Right now, many high ranked killers just machine because the Devs decided it would be a great idea to give the killers a perk that last 2 MINUTES (once all generators are completed) where the killer can instantly down a survivor. \n\nI would say wait for patches but every update just seems to break the game even more. Bugs from infinite loading screens, long queue time and exploits (from infinites to killers using survivor perks, which basically highlights their victim).

The new emblem system is garbage and it costs you $10 for ONE new outfit, really are you kidding me.  Oh well tried it again and still have to recommend not buying it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nJust deleted game, tried to get achievement by getting down to rank 5 survivor and made it to level six and than the monthly reset.  I went back to rank 17 so I have to win (10000 or more blood points in a game) 50 to 55 matches.  What a load of crap.  A reset every month is moronic.  I know people are leaving this game in droves to play Friday the 13, well this game probably needs to DIE.\n\n\nAnother update, (still don't bother buying this game)\n\nThe good news, there are a lot few crashes but they still happen but it is tollerable.\n\nThe bad news, it took me a number of hours to become somewhat good at survivor and so I decided to work my way down the rankings and I made it down to level 10 (achievement expert survivor).  Now I didn't really know how the pim system reset but after the reset i went from level 10 to level 17.  Now I find you get one pim for every level you have so I started with 10 pims which put me at level 17.  The reason I wanted to get better at survivor is to play with better teammates and killers.  The problem is you almost have to start over again EVERY MONTH when they do the reset.  WTF why a reset every month, why not every quarter.  Now I have to get 25 to 30 wins in order to get back to level 10 which I was and try to get better from there.  This bleeping game is not worth it and it is time to wash my hands of it.  There has be at least a million games better than this.\n\nOnce again DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nUpdated review\n\nYes I have played over a hundred hours in this game because of the game play but there are so many flaws in this game I just can't recommend it.  You also have to remeber that probably 20 plus hours of the time spent on this game is spent in lobbies and recovering constantly from crashes.\n\nI am going to assume that since there a release for Valentines Day that their are still developers working on this game but they are working on the wrong things.  The following is a list of bugs and crashes that I have noticed some major and some minor.\n\nThe Survivor Lobby Problem\n\n1.  The failed lobby as survivor which happens often when you try and enter a survior lobby and the failed message appears.  Minor problem just click Join Lobby again button, but this is signifying you are going to get the next problem.\n\n2.  The most annoying problem which is the survivor join lobby menu loop.  You get stuck in the loading screen and there is no key you can hit to get out.  This is a major problem because you have to shut down the game through the task manager and restart it.  My record is five times in a row this has happened which included full steam restarts.  How the development team has not concentrated on this fix is beyond me.\n\n3.  Also had the problem a few times when a error message comes up that says you are doing something to cheat which I don't understand (error code 2, sorry but I dont hack it is your system screwing up).  Once again this is a major problem because you have to go out and shut down steam and restart.\n\nThe In game problems\n\n1. Have had toolboxes I have picked up in the level not work, also traps that can't be set along with a host of other attachments that dont work for some reason. Minor problem.\n\n2. Unexplained in game crashes.  The killer has not left the game but somehow the game goes down.  Minor problem\n\nThe PIM system\n\nIf a killer leave the game right near the beggining as a survivor you should not lose a pim because you did not get enough points.  This is an easy coding fix and would save people from having to regain their rank.\n\nCampers\n\nEverybody hates these guys.  Come on and do something about it.  All you need is an area of effect penatly around people on hooks say 25 percent slower movement penatly withing 5 meters of the hook.  This would stop camping and make the game better for all involved.\n\nMatch Balancing\n\nI have no idea what if anything you are doing with respect to balancing.  I just played a match recently where the killer and the 3 survivors were ranked 1 and I am a 20th ranker survivor.  What was I doing there?  As you would expect I got my butt kicked.  Also played matches as killer where I am usually ranked 15 to 18 at times and I end up with all 1 - 3 level survivors.  Maybe kill 1 or 2 but usually at least half escape.  Really frustrating when you don't play all the time like some people and you get slaughtered by them.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nI first played this on the free weekend a while ago and found it frustrating sometimes because of the game play but most of the time because this game is full of bugs.\n\nThe Pros\n\nAs survivor it can be quite exhilirating and fun trying to get engines going and tring to rescue and heal other surviors.  I probalby play 70 percent survivor and find it good to great at times.  However no on likes a killer who is a camper but the fact is if you got rid of all the campers this game would not exist.  So you have to find a way around the campers.\n\nThe killer is a lot of fun so far I have really only played trapper and  it is great hunting down survivors and punishing for their sins.\n\nSo overall I really liked the game play and that is why I have a number of hours on the game.\n\nOn the other the hand THE CONS are numerous and do not seem to be looked at or resolved by the developer.  \n\nHere we go,\n\nHope you like waiting around 15 - 20 percent of your total time in game will be spent waiting to get into lobbies, waiting for lobbies to fill and waiting for the game to load.\n\nThe \"Waiting\" Screen crash.  As a survivor you try and enter a lobby and are stuck in a perpetual waiting screen.  Time to shut down and restart the game.\n\nSince there are no dedicated game servers the latency or ping that you have on the game is dictated by the person playing killer.  If their internet sucks or they are trying to log in from the other side of the world welcome to a nice lag match.\n\nThe in match crashes which I can not explain.  Sometimes I am just frozen.\n\nThere is a pim system that determines ranking.  As survivor if you care about your ranking and you go into a match and the killer decides to quit right away, too bad you lose a pim and move down on the ranking.  This would be such an easy programming fix.\n\nIn conclusion I like the game play but there is way too much time wasted because of bugs and bad programming.\n\nExtra Note: Here is an easy programming note put in an area of effect of say 10 meters around hooks killers move at half speed.  Look if you need a programmer let me know.","timestamp_created":1484186104,"timestamp_updated":1537569765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29194749","author":{"steamid":"76561198339472502","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10047,"last_played":1652198319},"language":"schinese","review":"非常有意思的游戏","timestamp_created":1484184470,"timestamp_updated":1484184470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514705896377563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29194666","author":{"steamid":"76561198122422334","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":1174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1082,"last_played":1558993068},"language":"english","review":"this game is cool \ni like it","timestamp_created":1484184052,"timestamp_updated":1484184558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528846144676208496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29194358","author":{"steamid":"76561198299822503","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1595398421},"language":"thai","review":"Fun","timestamp_created":1484182584,"timestamp_updated":1484182584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29194178","author":{"steamid":"76561198091510645","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":34172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6964,"last_played":1622491764},"language":"english","review":"There's a game in this bug...\n\nNeeds some sort of reward for reaching rank 1.

I have met some awesome people playing this game aswell.","timestamp_created":1484161006,"timestamp_updated":1485174690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622209489345550537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29188504","author":{"steamid":"76561198006298677","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":11980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11402,"last_played":1528406793},"language":"french","review":"Sur ce jeu j'ai eu une expérience en deux temps.\nD'abord la découverte et le coté horreur, stress au maximum. Ce moment a été mon préféré.\nPuis ensuite le coté grind, on s'habitue à l'ambiance, on a plus peur, donc ça devient \"compététif\" sauf que le rank ne signifie pas grand chose.\nDonc finalement c'est mitigés, car je ne ressens pas l'envie ou le besoin de jouer en continu sur ce jeu.\nUne partie de temps en temps est appréciable. Malheureusement il y a encore beaucoup de problème vis à vis du lobby, du matchmaking qui charge infiniment.\nSi seulement ils prennaient la décision d'acheter des serveurs dédiés..... (avec l'argent qu'ils engendrent ils pourraient et devraient).\n\nJe le recommande cependant, les nouvelles cartes et tueurs sont très intéréssants.","timestamp_created":1484159989,"timestamp_updated":1484159989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29188494","author":{"steamid":"76561198163535842","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11397,"last_played":1484253721},"language":"romanian","review":"\nwhy I got banned","timestamp_created":1484159942,"timestamp_updated":1484159942,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29188221","author":{"steamid":"76561198358211147","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":159701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33943,"last_played":1659122333},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, не смотря на баги, которые довольно быстро исправляют, очень веселая, все так же благодаря этим багам. Хотя, моментами она заставляет попотеть, немного испугаться и при этом, лично для меня дает, хоть и не большой, но заряд адреналина. И добавление маньков из известных и культовых ужастиков, дает ей еще один плюс. Так что, рекомендую эту игру, как в соло, так и с друзьями, будет точно весело..","timestamp_created":1484159011,"timestamp_updated":1637791814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i6mxx9kCfYesbw=="}
