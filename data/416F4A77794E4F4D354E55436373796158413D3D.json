Man joined in ein Spiel und weiss nicht wo man ist, man weiss nicht wo die Generatoren sind welche repariert werden müssen und das Schlimmste ist: Man weiss nicht wo der Killer ist. Die Entwickler haben ein extrem ausgeglichenes Spiel für beide Rollen (Killer und Überlebender) geschaffen. Als Überlebender darf man in der 3rd-Person Ansicht spielen während man als Killer nur eine 1st-Person Sicht hat. \n\nDer Killer:\nIch selbst bin nicht gerne der Killer. Denoch hab ich mir einen Einblick verschafft und gemerkt das beide Rollen eine komplett andere Spielweise erfahren. Als Killer möchte ich zum Beispiel Bärenfallen stellen, an Orte von welchen ich glaube das sie nützen. Man geht jedem Geräusch nach das man hört nur um die Überlebenden zu finden. Sollte man einen gefangen haben und an einen Opfer-Haken gehängt haben, möchte man selbst da warten und hoffen das niemand ihn retten kommt. In dieser Zeit können von anderen Überlebenden Generatoren repariert werden und dies setzt den Killer unter Druck.\n\nDer Überlebende:\nIns Spiel getappt und komplett ahnungslos wo meine Aufgaben sind muss ich mir als Überlebender erst einmal einen Überblick verschaffen. Ich laufe schmalen Wegen entlang, klettere über Fenster und schleiche durchs hohe Gras. Auf einmal höre ich einen lauten Herzschlag. Dies ist das Zeichen das der Killer sich mir nähert. Ich versuche ruhig zu bleiben doch der Herzschlag wird lauter. Ich werde nervös. Ich verstecke mich im hohen Gras. Auf einmal kommt zu dem leuten Herzschlag noch eine schreckliche Musik. Nun steht er neben mir. Ich sehe ihn an und möchte rennen doch im selben Augenblick zieht er weiter. Er hat mich nicht entdeckt. Noch muss ich nicht flüchten.\n\n\nWas das Spiel spannend macht:\n\n+ Faire Rollen. (Keine Rolle ist zu schwer)\n+ Schöner Gruselfaktor\n+ Verschiedene Maps mit verschiedenen Umgebungen (Viele Häuser oder ein Maisfeld)\n+ Verschiedene Überlebende\n+ Verschiedene Killer\n\nWas sich noch bessern könnte:\n\n- Kein Onlinespiel mit Freunden nur Lokal und ohne Charakter-Forschritte\n- Kleinere Bugs im Menü\n- Nur einen Spielmodus\n- Keine oder nur sehr wenige individuelle Anpassmöglichkeiten des Charakters\n\n\nFür jeden Freund der Horrorspiele kann ich Dead by Daylight bestens empfehlen. Es macht einfach mega Spass ständig unter Druck Aufgaben zu erledigen und auf Mitspieler zu achten.\n\nIch gebe Dead by Daylight eine 7/10","timestamp_created":1467991334,"timestamp_updated":1467991334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488981425762176514","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24183912","author":{"steamid":"76561198077849925","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1524507400},"language":"czech","review":"Hledáte spoluhráče ?

Werkzeugkasten), Opfergaben (z.B. ihr erhaltet nach bestimmten Aktionen 25% mehr Punkte) und Addons für die Gegenstände ( z.B. wenn ihr ein Werkzeugkasten ausgerüstet habt, könnt ihr zusätzliche Bonis hinzufügen) freischalten könnt.\n\nEs gibt momentan [b]vier Überlebende[/b], diese unterscheiden sich nur in ihrem Aussehen sowie Bekleidung (je dunkler die Bekleidung desto besser)  und [b]drei Killer[/b] mit jeweils verschiedenen einzigartigen Fähigkeiten (z.B. der Fallensteller, kann Bärenfallen aufstellen)\n\nDie Grafik ist sehr düster, dunkel gestaltet wie es in einem Horrorgame eben so ist - mir gefällt sie sehr.\nEs gibt jedoch noch einige Bugs die manchmal ärgerlich sind (z.B.

It's a lot of fun, however you'll notice if you're a survivor that right now the state of the game isn't too great: There's a TON of wallhackers that play the killer, and they can see EVERYONE and EVERYTHING on the maps. It's ridiculous. 9 of my last 15 games were wallhacking killers who killed everyone within 3 minutes. That's just awful. There needs to be a solid anti-cheat if this game wants to compete with the upcoming Friday the 13th game. Speaking of Friday the 13th game, hopefully they are paying attention to the exploits and go hardcore Blizzard style on cheaters and name and shame them all on the forum, as well as perma-ban the steam account. The game is so irresponsibly broken with wallhacks, that it needs a solid system in place to deal with these kinds of losers. \n\n\nGREAT CONCEPT. GREAT GRAPHICS (I run a 1080 GTX), fun when playing with legit players. Not fun when you die at the start of every game. Wouldn't recommend until they fix with a SOLID anti-cheat system in place, that detects these bots. It's awful... so as much as I LOVE this breath of fresh air for a concept and game, it's so overshadowed with the TONS and TONS of cheaters. On top of that, killers are highly unbalanced anways. Iron Grip makes it impossible to escape, and the fact that throwing up an obstacle doesn't do much really tilts the game in massive favor of the killer. Add wallhacks to that, and the game isn't even fun to play.\n\n5/10. Great concept. I'll play when these guys announce a much better anti-cheat system in place.\n","timestamp_created":1467954759,"timestamp_updated":1467954759,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24174233","author":{"steamid":"76561198309000530","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":41862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69,"last_played":1645986498},"language":"spanish","review":"nose pero desde q lo compre no me deja jugarlo\n","timestamp_created":1467954084,"timestamp_updated":1467954084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24174178","author":{"steamid":"76561197967844955","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":57293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36211,"last_played":1626843029},"language":"english","review":"No matter how many issues there are, there is always something I find that makes this game fun again.

Although, it is a game you should play with friends because when playing solo, it can be difficult to communicate with your teammates. There is no mic in-game sadly so you can not talk to anyone, which makes me kind of sad, but other than that, I think it is a great game.

This may include re-examining the initial goal of what this game is supposed to accomplish. Focus on gameplay that heavily rewards those who assist their team rather than selfish gameplay would increase the player base and make this game more rewarding for all parties.\n\nupdate 2:\nWould reccomend this for players who game in groups. If you prefer to lone wolf this game (without chatting) it will seem cruel for newcomers. Most players will not be able to take on or avoid the killer single-handedly unless the killer is atrocious. Personally even with all the downsides the game is quite fun. If your not ready to suffer for enjoyment you might want to holdout until the game is fixed.\n\nupdate 3:\nAs per 1.1 - 1.1.1 the game is quite balanced and I can notice alot more survivors ranking up. Players are rewarded for playing intelligently such as distracting the killer and assisting team mates. This actually gets you more points than rushing the objective 100% of the time. I'm looking forward to more updates to see if they can keep this happy medium or advance it further.","timestamp_created":1467951548,"timestamp_updated":1473729070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24173555","author":{"steamid":"76561198079093200","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":93930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31655,"last_played":1659116479},"language":"english","review":"yea i mean its okay ig","timestamp_created":1467951066,"timestamp_updated":1615951276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518867909908294678","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24173386","author":{"steamid":"76561198088055034","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1485664313},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏模式很新颖，但确很单一，适合每天玩几把，BGM不错，游戏的恐怖气氛渲染的也很好，美中不足的是没有中文。","timestamp_created":1467950332,"timestamp_updated":1467950332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24173330","author":{"steamid":"76561198104364414","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1128,"last_played":1561268056},"language":"english","review":"Fun ass game.\n\nNo partying atm.\n\nReally fun to play with friends; if you have 4 other friends to play with.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1467950058,"timestamp_updated":1467950058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24173013","author":{"steamid":"76561198052632825","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":25270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4476,"last_played":1641809700},"language":"english","review":"Dont waste your money on this trash game.
