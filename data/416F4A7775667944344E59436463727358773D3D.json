This game use to be and somewhat still is my go too game but it's becoming harder and harder for me to hit that play button because I know how upset i'm going to be within a few minutes. There are a lot of people giving this game a good review but they don't have that many hours in and that's very misleading. You'll notice the people that's been here for a long while are all changing our reviews to negative, and for a good reason. This game use to be all about the game play and it was one of a kind, but that was also the problem, it's the only game of it's kind. Over the past year they have created cross-platform to include consoles and... mobile. That's right, mobile. Oh, and switch. Now, one might be wondering how can you compete with someone on PC if you are playing from a switch or your phone. Well, the answer to that will be in why everyone is leaving this game. The devs keep coming out with the worst updates that no one is asking for. They have created a store and are constantly pushing out new cosmetics and updating different looks instead of fixing the issues people are upset about. Yes, you can disable crossplay but be ready to wait 30 minutes for one game, just to have a killer camp you and teammates that don't know what they are doing so you just die. When you do play crossplatform you can notice huge lag spikes. When you are looking at the forms of what players are upset about it's mostly the lag issues from crossplatform servers. How did they fix this? They made the hitboxs huge for the killers, and changed the hud? They also changed up camera angles and other things no one has ever asked for in the game. I truly feel bad for new players coming into this game, playing it and getting scared, and having fun because they are enjoying the worst period of this game. Oh how I wish they could of played it in the past, when it was all about the mind games, and tricking each other and having to really work for the win. I hope to revisit this review in the future and change it back to a thumbs up, but as of right now it's a hard thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1472105569,"timestamp_updated":1613539601,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126726","author":{"steamid":"76561198070409519","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1034,"last_played":1528991285},"language":"english","review":"This is not a bad game. The concept is original and, when the stars align, fun. What irritates me is the whole character progression system, un-fun options being the best options, and the infrequency of bug fixes.\n\nPersonally, I think this game would have been better without the \"growing characters\". Every survivor is the same starting out, you have to spend hours upon hours in-game to get anything that makes them unique. New players have no tools outside of fundamental gameplay that lets them contribute meaningfully.\n\nKillers, on the other hand, can either be a joke or a terror, based entirely on how much time the player has invested.\n\nAs far as I have been able to tell, camping a survivor as the killer is your best strategy, especially as the game's best killer, Trapper. Survivors have no way of offensively threatening the Killer or communicating with random players, so incoming help usually does little but change who's dying. Conversely, the best strategy for a survivor is to leave the dying player alone due to the above. There is no being a hero unless your killer also wants to have fun.\n\nThe dev team doesn't seem particularly interested in fixing the multitude of bugs plaguing DbD, many of which have no reason to exist. One example springs to mind, where a killer's facial model will clip into first person view, interfering with vision based on which killer is dealing with it. This has been an issue for months.\n\nIf you must get this, find it on sale. Otherwise, look elsewhere until this gets cleaned up.","timestamp_created":1472105341,"timestamp_updated":1472105341,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126629","author":{"steamid":"76561198092007488","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5177,"last_played":1608006994},"language":"english","review":"game was great until one of the recent updates, game is buggy and glitchy and ive lost items and ranks that are hard enough to get as it is. fix this bs game that ive sunk 90+ hours in please","timestamp_created":1472104691,"timestamp_updated":1472104691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126419","author":{"steamid":"76561198302280421","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":26519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":2171,"last_played":1659931409},"language":"english","review":"is ok","timestamp_created":1472103405,"timestamp_updated":1572633938,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126392","author":{"steamid":"76561198053167360","num_games_owned":444,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":20484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11775,"last_played":1658259057},"language":"english","review":"The devs dont care and will not fix i game they admit is unbalanced and say it is supposed to be th at way a real shame cuz the game has potiental and is good devs just play dumb","timestamp_created":1472103279,"timestamp_updated":1522461161,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126338","author":{"steamid":"76561198187608289","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":26449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1645868341},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏本生不错，期待之后的更新","timestamp_created":1472102906,"timestamp_updated":1472102906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126176","author":{"steamid":"76561198314552085","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":56407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25394,"last_played":1639663006},"language":"schinese","review":"看直播喜欢上这游戏，从一个人玩的萌新到现在带队开黑，从一个树皇慢慢变成一个人皇也是不简单。游戏内容确实吸引人，但是每次游戏的改动总有些不满，比如一些BUG的修复。","timestamp_created":1472101845,"timestamp_updated":1472101845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25126113","author":{"steamid":"76561198312673552","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2446,"last_played":1472139368},"language":"koreana","review":"장난하는 것도 아니고 매칭 시스템 엄청 구리네. 나는 이제 6레벨 18랭크 살인만데 어떻게 50레벨 만렙 환생  생존자들 1랭 네명이랑 큐를 붙여주냐. 한판도 아니고 무려 3판 내리연속 ㅋㅋ 짜증나서 게임 못해먹겠네. 게임 큐 시스템이나 고쳐라.\n\nI recently staretd this game after watching some streamers' playing through Twitch and Afreeca TV.
