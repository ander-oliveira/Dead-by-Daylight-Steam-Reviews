I've played this game for a while now, and I used to love it. This is one of those games that would challenge you, and put you up against all odds making the smallest victories feel massive. The perks and variety of characters and monsters kept me coming back and still do to this day. It was unforgiving, but just challenging enough to be a fun time for masochists. ENTER THE LATEST UPDATE. If you haven't seen it yet, they changed... a few things.... and definitely not for the better. Ill spare you the mass content, cause you can literally see the thousands of negative reviews out there as of late to see what the issues are. But really read ANY of the negative reviews as of late. They're all correct, and as a fan of what this game used to be, it hurts to see. Its literally like watching your favourite nephew grow up with a promising career, then turn suddenly into a hardcore drug addict that gets into fist fights with their dad over family seating arrangements. Then one day a year later you just see them washed up on a street corner offering free sex to strangers, just to feel something. And in that moment, you remind yourself of who they used to be. You're reminded of all the times you'd hang out and play video games, the birthday celebrations, the family holidays, actually being exited to see them... and now... its not fun, its some taxing emotional obligation to check up on them and make sure they don't end up in prison next week.\nI wish I was wrong. I wish I was the only one who felt this way, and above all else I wish I could recommend this game to friends. I cant. I care about this game. I care about this game's community. I still do play this game on occasion (albeit more than often just to play with friends who don't have other multiplayer games).

This is my personal opinion based solely on the game (I'm not going to go into the system requirements or anything technical or similar), so if there are certain points you don't agree with or something I wrote that seems wrong, I'm sorry. These are based on my feelings about the game and the experiences I've had. \n(For the record I had the game on the Xbox for about a year and recently bought it on my PC. I have maybe equal or double my playtime on the Xbox than on PC) \n\nPros:\nThe atmosphere is amazing. I genuinely feel a sense of fear, stress, and anxiety from all of the killers on every map, and I love the immersion I get from it.\nThe music overall is very well done. From the lobby music to killer chase music, you can tell a lot of work has gone into it. I could get the theme stuck in my head for hours. It is very catchy.\nThe gameplay itself is unique and stands out among other horror games.\nThe survivor, killer, and graphics overall are very well done. The detail that has gone into certain killers, survivors, and map structures is amazing. \nThe cinematics are beautiful. The current opening cinematic is incredibly well done. \nThe lore is pretty interesting. Certain character backstories are less in-depth than others (looking at you Dwight), but I love that every original killer and survivor has their own unique backstory. \nIf you disconnect from a public game, you get locked out of joining another for a certain amount of time. I like this because it prevents dodgy people from constantly avoiding games with killers they don't like. The consequences for disconnecting are relatively good, in my opinion. \n\nCons:\nThe devs DO NOT listen to the community, and the game has suffered because of it. Examples would be the community asking them to nerf The Doctor or the No One Escapes Death hex, of which neither has been done.\nWith the new update, hitboxes for survivors have gotten bigger. In my experience, this means that when I'm in a chase and the killer isn't directly behind me (I can't see the red stain that shows where they're looking), I still get hit. I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it was because of a charged attack or lag but I'm assuming it isn't just me after what I've seen from the community and from what I've heard from friends. \nThe wait times are sometimes absolutely atrocious, and this has been an issue for years. I find around 6:00 pm CST the wait times for survivor matches are incredibly long (even if you have a full party of four survivors). \nIt seems more work has gone into DLC killers gameplay-wise (Ghostface, The Shape, The Pig, etc.) This is a small nit-picky thing that doesn't bother me, but it seems as though players who only have base game killers are put at a relatively significant disadvantage. \nIn general, the reporting system in DBD is useless. Any harassment you get from toxic survivors or killers or camping/tunneling killers is essentially ignored. \n\nTL;DR:\nAll in all, this game is done very well in a broad view, and I do think it's fun, but the details are what is killing it. I didn't touch on everything I liked or everything that I had a problem with, but I believe I got the point across. I do recommend it but certainly do not buy it for the full price, wait for a discount if possible. (At the time of this review, it's on discount from its original price at 19.99 to 11.99).","timestamp_created":1613074553,"timestamp_updated":1613074876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86419612","author":{"steamid":"76561199138735953","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1659226342},"language":"english","review":"Ive played this game for 4 years and ive enjoyed nearly every minute of it.

Now, this game is nowhere near perfect in it's current state, but with some of the recent reworkings and perk changes, I believe this game has become fairly balanced. When I say balanced, I mean that the playing survivor doesn't guarantee you an escape as it did many years ago. But once you get to the higher ranks, it tends to become easier with more skilled teammates. However, I only have one current standing issue in this game. Toxicity. This game is by far the most toxic and unappealing game I have ever seen. From the basics of sandbagging and face-camping, to the complexities of gen-rushing and 4-man SWFs. I tend to stay away from playing killer due to these toxic mannerisms that have unfortunately become normalized, although the killer can be toxic in many ways as well. \n\nAll in all, I can't stay away from this game.
