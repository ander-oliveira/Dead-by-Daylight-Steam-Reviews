Ich liebe die Charaktere, das Spielprinzip und auch die Grafik. Allerdings - und das ist das, was für mich den Ausschlag gibt, dem Spiel einen Daumen runter zu geben - gibt es dort einige Menschen und Survivor, die für Punkte alles tun. Und mit alles mein ich alles: \n\n- Stundenlanges Rumprobieren, bis man mit dem befreundeten Killer in eine Runde kommt, sodass man die zwei anderen Teammates verraten kann um mit dem \"Killer\" später in aller Ruhe alleine Punkte farmen zu können (Wurden mal von zwei Survs daran gehindert die Kellertreppe wieder hinauf zu kommen, in dem sie sich so in den Weg stellten. Als der Killer kam machten sie Platz, er an ihnen vorbei und ich kam irgendwie noch vorbei. Eine 2 Minütige Jagd folgte, in der der Killer mich verlor, die Survs aber nicht. Schnell mal eben neben mir, währemd der Heilung laut über zwei Paletten rutschen und da kam der Killer auch wieder).\n- Speedhacker (Ein Geist, der sich in weniger als einer Sekunde sichtbar macht und ebenfalls innerhalb einer Sekunde zwei bis drei Mal zuschlagen kann, innerhalb von 26 Sekunden alle vier Survs zu Boden streckt, obwohl alle an unterschiedlichen Orten zu finden sind).\n- Killer, die dem (tatsächlich erlaubten (🤦‍♂️)) Camping nachgehen und nicht von deiner Seite weichen, bis du beim ersten Mal hängen schon stirbst.\n-Ragequitter die mit drei Hex Perks ins Rennen gehen und nach dem die ersten zwei Hex ohne Kill vernichtet wurden einfach aus dem Spiel gehen. Pip Verlust incomming 🤷🏼‍♂️\n-Tunnler und Opportunisten. (das betrifft vllt nur mich aber mich kotzt so etwas an). Du wirst gehangen als Surv. Ein Random erscheint. Hebt dich im Terrorradius des Killers ab. Was macht der Killer? Kommt zurück streckt mich nieder, ich häng zum zweiten Mal 🤷🏼‍♂️.\n\nDas ist für den ein oder Anderen vllt ein bisschen viel Mimimi aber mir nimmt das persönlich sehr sehr viel an Spielfreude und risikobereitschaft andere Survs zu retten. Da die Devs das bannen im großen Stile auch eingestellt haben (so wurde mir berichtet) meide ich dieses Spiel aktuell, weil es für mich keinen Sinn mehr ergibt unter diesen Umständen mein Glück zu versuchen. Sehr schade, aber sollte irgendwann die Zeit wieder kommen, dass Cheater, Hacker und Antimates mit Hilfe vom Reportingsystem (gerne auch mit Clip), einen Permabann bekommen können, werde ich mich sicherlich wieder hinreißen lassen, dieses Spiel zu spielen. Ansonsten rate ich (zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt): Finger weg!\n","timestamp_created":1530434370,"timestamp_updated":1530434370,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":68,"votes_funny":19,"weighted_vote_score":"0.715151369571685791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43210067","author":{"steamid":"76561198371331640","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":9477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7446,"last_played":1617782811},"language":"english","review":"This game is the ultimate fantasy of every horror fan out there. I just can't wait for the Dead by Daylight film and hope they don't muck it up--that's how good this game is. It 100% deserves a movie.\n\nTraditional, run-of-the-mill games (random example, Skyrim) will have me gritting my teeth because some areas are just creepy (What a wuss, right?)--but Dead by Daylight has me eagerly putting my best 'offering' forward, running for the next generator, anxiously wondering who the killer is, and whether he's gonna GIT me or not. \n\nIt's all a rollercoaster of excitement, even for someone who's as chicken as I always was, before this game conditioned me into thoroughly enjoying the thrill of horror.\n\nWell fleshed-out characters with just the right amount of information you'd like for each survivor. Each killer unique to DbD has their own well-written story as well, with the right amount of depth provided.\n\nAesthetically, everything in this game looks beautiful, actually--it's not all grit and gore. The Entity can actually be beautfiul and poetic-looking (as angsty as that sounds), and the writing isn't cheesy or over-the-top. The characters look like everyday, normal people and are given options that enforce their own personal style.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and filled with heart-pounding anticipation. It does have bugs and a rare glitch or two--getting stuck between trees on Lampkin Lane is never fun, but you may have a killer or teammates that may recognize and help, or hinder. It's all in the sport of it, and it's fun either way. There are times where campers can be cringey (hey, it's a strategy...I guess), or that skip-lag is working in someone's favor...but as far as mp/co games are concerned, you'll definitely spend more time having fun than being tilted.\n\nThe DLC they release is always innovative, I always find myself surprised with each release, and it entices users to play. Their updates are usually filled with bug fixes or improvements/new features/aesthetic additions, which is great for the gameplay and visuals alike.\n\nThe community is mostly good. I've run into some poor sports--some jerks--but that's unavoidable, nowadays. Nothing you can't report, and nothing the next great match with potentially fun players can't fix. :)\n\nI could go on and on about this game. Get it! Totally worth it.","timestamp_created":1530434253,"timestamp_updated":1530434253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43210000","author":{"steamid":"76561198305460339","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1531714927},"language":"schinese","review":"初始化游戏失败怎么办","timestamp_created":1530434071,"timestamp_updated":1530434071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43209847","author":{"steamid":"76561198374286804","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":25,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1530277306},"language":"english","review":"This game comes with a programm called EAC (Easy Anti Cheat).\nLong story short: I bought the game and some DLCs but this\nEAC garbage didn't allowed me to start the game.\nI could watch the intro, but on the title screen i got this:\n\"EAC client cannot be instantiated\" message.\nI asked for help in the forum and did some research myself.\nThere are MANY players out there who got the same or a similar\nproblem with EAC.\nTBH i tried EVERY \"solution\" out there but without luck.\n(Firewall, anti virus, integrity check, un-reinstall, repair etc.)\nI also mssg. the game devs PLUS the devs of EAC, still NO LUCK.\nIt's a shame but i had to ask for a refund and this p i s s e s me off!\nAt least i gained the experience, that i will never ever buy a game\nwich comes with EAC...","timestamp_created":1530433648,"timestamp_updated":1530433648,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43209579","author":{"steamid":"76561198367984332","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":66930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63719,"last_played":1658461348},"language":"russian","review":"Игра класс, рекомендую всем Никитам","timestamp_created":1530432853,"timestamp_updated":1606362281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43209410","author":{"steamid":"76561198815367052","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1975,"last_played":1656447790},"language":"portuguese","review":"Melhor do que a tua mãe","timestamp_created":1530432297,"timestamp_updated":1530432297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43209302","author":{"steamid":"76561198001807848","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":74304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16109,"last_played":1637619592},"language":"french","review":"Edit : Je recommande.\nFranchement, une fois maîtrisé, j'adore ce jeu.

                                                                                                      \n  下面就要谈到不推荐的原因咯。                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                   \n   这款游戏的匹配系统真的是烂透了。从20段到1段的路，我走过很多遍了，那么先让我以来说说段位罢。白段有炸鱼车队、纯萌新、佛系玩家；绿段鱼龙混杂，有一般路人、素质极差的主播、车队；紫段有主播、上分路人、车队，水平一般较高；红段人不多，有水平较高、圈子里有名气的主播 、高水平路人。在红段排来排去就那几个ID了。为什么我要一堆废话介绍这些段位？也恰是因为我走过这些段位，才认为这款游戏的匹配系统烂。首先这款游戏的段位是和匹配绑定的，无论是谁，只要你对局，都会影响到积分点，类似于LOL的排位，但这款游戏只有“排位”了。但在LOL里，系统会匹配给你水平相近的玩家，所以LOL最低的段位里面玩家水平是相近的。但这款游戏不一样，这款游戏匹配[strike]唯一标准\t[/strike]即是你当前的段位，谁知道我是红段来的呢，是罢？[spoiler] 这匹配系统是像某些主播一样的双重标准没有底线的玩意。为什么我在白段会排到紫段的呢？是你认为我太强了，该挑战点厉害的，还是认为我太弱了，想劝退我？\t[/spoiler]降段太简单了，进游戏即退出，上千小时水平的玩家都可以待在白段吊打新手。你们能想象一个0技能屠夫碰到4技能手电车队吗？你们能想象4个萌新人类碰到顶配红处屠夫吗？很久以前这款游戏没有新手教程，我们也都是那样过来。可如今加入新手教程，新手的体验更差了。并且最近人类被大削，新手一来更是被打的找不到北。新来的小萌新玩屠夫，玩人类，都打不过。即使有屠夫在恐怖的炸鱼下坚持过来了，在绿段也会被大量低素质主播、车队劝退。被虐杀：好，你是菜鸡；虐杀了：好，我举报了，开始轰炸令慈。                                                              阻止新血液的涌入，让老玩家厌离，是这个匹配系统最大的问题。                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n  我自诩心态好，却一头栽倒在这个匹配系统上。得益于这个匹配系统，我在段位重置前无法玩屠夫。在[b] 单一\t[/b]的游戏玩法下，挑战人类是这个游戏给我的唯一快乐。但我在红段排 不 到 人 了。你想掉段？掉不了。想继续和高段人类切磋？没有。离重置段位还有很久呢，受不了？那就去玩人类罢。我的人类水平不高，但是和绿段屠夫周旋个5分钟是绰绰有余的。但是人类在白段的我，完 全 没 办 法。等我溜了往往10分钟后，全场板子没了，电机仍然还有5台。愤怒上钩，愤怒松手，愤怒观战。A人类：德怀特，拆图腾 B人类：托马斯，在地下室柜子里 C人类：大张伟，在地图边缘蹲着走。好了下一局。进游戏，直接修电机去，5分钟后，队友上钩，被救，被处决，30秒快速完成，继续修，3分钟后，只剩1个残血的队友了。愤怒拔线。屠夫：顶配处决，私密资料 A人类：0技能 B人类：同族 C人类 常规4技能。最后一局，进去，3个骚ID，稳了，2分钟，3台，摸个宝，拆个图腾，门开了。屠夫：0技能夹子 A人类 常规四技能+顶配紫手电 B人类 常规四技能+顶配医疗包 C人类 常规四技能+顶配工具箱。观战。A人类：三蹲 B人类：三蹲 C人类：三蹲。这些就是很经典的例子。全部是这个匹配系统造就的。                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n  这款游戏平衡性也很差。正常水平的屠夫，是拿车队没办法的。夹子碰上车队就没架子。语音报点拆夹，放下即“啪”。人类互通有无，全方位监视，就是你在地图边缘抽泣，人类也能在你身边点头，接着你想跑到地下室大哭一场，发现地下室门口已经有人在等你了。人类的削弱，使得一般路人欲哭无泪。前有秒举兔，1秒丢斧，翻窗即死，后有双红夹，摸夹受伤，自动封点。现在已经出到女祭司了罢，我也不清楚新屠夫的强度。但秒举兔和双红夹能让我铭记如此深刻，杀鸡平衡性的低劣，可见一斑。各种技能，能上场的永远是那几个。我听说现在打击废了。但是谁又能想到之前一个屠夫面对4个打击时的情景呢？\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n   外挂、改档、刷血点等等的作弊行为满天星。10个3红火衣夹子10个刷血点，还有大量“法外狂徒”在体验光的速度。有些屠夫没有光的速度，但是他可以让我这人类没有速度，没有脾气，没有网络连接；防作弊系统封的作弊玩家少之又少，只能是老实人玩家受难：有一些主播堂而皇之的全屠夫3转满级，红处道具一大堆；老实人玩家上了白配都会被人举报刷血点。\n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n  说到底，这款游戏的反作弊，平衡性，匹配系统。做的是极其差劲。                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n  我曾不止一次在一次次的更新中盼望着新玩法，我的希望一次次地在新屠夫的推出中落空。新屠夫一直在推出，我最专情的屠夫The hiilbilly的BUG却保留了下来——我就那样震惊、气愤地看着电锯锯空，我的希望，也空了。我对这款游戏的爱，也像是撞到空气墙上的电锯那样，停下来了。                                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                 \n     [h1] 我对这个游戏哪有那么多建设性的意见啊。只是在批判这个靠出新皮肤和新屠夫骗钱的游戏罢了。但是，我不能不说，这款游戏是矛盾的，它缺点数不胜数，但它的魅力却如同恶灵那黝黑的魔爪一般紧紧地包绕着我，让我之流的老玩家深陷其中，不断走过去，走过来，使我穿透那迷雾、那篝火而看见了温情、欢乐，看见过狭隘、愚钝。也许是和朋友的谈笑，也许是疲劳后的沉睡，抑或是安静的阅读时光，都闪回着这些回忆，令我欢欣，令我寂寞，令我精神的丝缕还牵着已逝的寂寞时光，而我却偏苦于不能全忘却，这不能全忘的一部分，如今便成了我对一个屏幕前的旅者的牢骚。              \t[/h1]                                                                                      \n   如果你想购买这款游戏，但心里有些矛盾，或者说你现在就是矛盾重重在翻看无数玩家们的评测——然后你看到了我的牢骚（我想这应该算不上测评罢）那么，权衡利弊，如果你愿意忍受我以上所说的目前关于这个游戏的种种缺点，或许——你可以体会到[i] Dead By Daylight\t[/i]——这款劣迹斑斑而又极具矛盾性的作品的矛盾之美。那时，我也不知道一款售价是82人民币的作品能带给我上千小时的乐趣。                                                                                                                                        \n

                                    \n   对，我说的。黎明杀机现在就是在靠出新屠夫和新皮肤骗钱，这些新屠夫的技能都没什么创意[u] 没有什么乐趣\t[/u]，远程攻击的，冲刺的，就这几种了。黎明杀机的制作组拥有好创意，但是不加改进。至今（2020年2月28日），我离开有一年了，但是我回来看了看[spoiler] 我就是不能不以鲨人为乐[/spoiler]，但是痛苦地发现，车库的巴士让冲刺的电锯杀手撞墙的这个模型BUG依然没有修复。制作组就是不给力不思进取，只想着骗钱，没有新模式新的乐趣，[b] 算了\t[/b][spoiler] 我要拿电锯鲨人。看罢，这就是这个游戏的魅力，真香！\t[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1530423032,"timestamp_updated":1583160336,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43206879","author":{"steamid":"76561198343482598","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":24804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6545,"last_played":1627585863},"language":"thai","review":"จนถึงตอนนี้ก็ยังมีบัค

you buy this game, answer this?\nAre you sure you are going to be playing with your friends majority of the time in swf? Or are you going to fly solo. This game with friends is indeed the better choice as you can have laugh, rage all together about the killer camping majority of the time.  If you decide to play survivor majority of the time, get ready for salty killers? And if you intend to fly solo as a killer, its the same thing.  There is salt everywhere in this game. But with the power of teamwork you can overcome with even greater salt.  However, this game is all about grinding at the moment.  \n\nYou would see YouTubers who have tier 3 perks in all 4 slots. But when you play you're gonna be starting. (unless you do kyf but im talking about grinding).  It should maybe take two or three days tops to get your suitable perks but damn it takes forever. I'm still trying to get two more characters to level 50 and i havent even gotten to any killer (except trapper, yeah i know survivor main here).  \n\nIf you play salty games like League of Legends (this is just an example) then be prepared for the worst because it ain't very different. If you fly solo everyone is more or less is fending for themselves. \n\n\"oh but wait shiro what about flashlight saves and op medkits plays (ex: syringe or stypic which is not op).\"\n\nThey are farming you. Getting points so they can \"help\" you out when in reality they are just trying to rank up. \n\nIn conclusion, if you start, you better grind...hard. Because this game can be horrible when it comes to grinding and it becomes scary at first but just remember when you play over the course of the game your not gonna be scared like, \"OH SHIT ITS A WRAITH!!!! RUN!!!!!\" Instead you are going to be like, \"uh-oh guys its the wraith easy match\" or \"ugh im getting tunneled again stupid baby killer\".  You will hate this game at some point because devs are still fixing these issues but goodness it can be one-sided these days.\n\nAnyways thats all i wanted to say, thank you for reading and have a wonderful day or night :)","timestamp_created":1530422633,"timestamp_updated":1530422633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43206551","author":{"steamid":"76561198045084604","num_games_owned":578,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":114207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":180,"playtime_at_review":22693,"last_played":1660527444},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS AWESOME!
