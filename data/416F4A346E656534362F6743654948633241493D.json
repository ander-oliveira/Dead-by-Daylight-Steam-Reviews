Many times, the game ends with all four or often 3/4 survivors dying. You will be lucky if you play as a survivor and actually have any decent success at this game. Many killers have unfair advantages that quickly swing the game in their favor. The chainsaw is an example of such a trait. This game is all kinds of frustrating as a survivor and even if you play the game skillfully, the game mechanisms often don't work in your favor. For example, dropping a crate on a killer should stun them temporarily, but many times when I drop the crate, I still get hit or the crate never drops at all. Other times, using the flashlight item is supposed to temporarily blind killers however, this mechanism also fails much of the time. Jumping through windows is an escape for survivors, but often a killer will reach through a window to hit you after you have already performed the action. Also, while falling from heights, survivors naturally stumble and take a few seconds to recover before running again. Killers however, can carry a survivor over their shoulder and drop from the same height and not stumble even slightly. All killers also are significantly faster than survivors (no matter their size or items they carry) which means most chases end in survivor demise. In addition, a recent update has decreased the effectiveness of some survivor perks. In summary, this game is unbalanced, seriously flawed, and not worth your time or money.","timestamp_created":1618531900,"timestamp_updated":1618531900,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190507411956787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90377227","author":{"steamid":"76561199059109534","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":19126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1660405347},"language":"english","review":"who you calling pin head?","timestamp_created":1618530889,"timestamp_updated":1647136161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90377219","author":{"steamid":"76561198090357492","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1644167873},"language":"english","review":"Actually a great game for teambuilding","timestamp_created":1618530869,"timestamp_updated":1618530869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90377171","author":{"steamid":"76561198084964329","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1897,"last_played":1619055279},"language":"english","review":"cool game with friends.

Less fluff, more to the point discussion on pertinent issues within the game/culture.\n\nAfter a bit over 800 hours on Xbox, and over 500 on PC, I can confidently recommend this game to anyone playing on PC, or the new gen consoles (Xbox Series X/PS5). I would not recommend purchasing this game on older consoles, due to the lack of FPS and overall performance, though I played the game on them for well over 2 years before upgrading. I cannot speak to Stadia, and as far as Switch is concerned, I'm certain its playable, but the rest of the community sort of snorts at Switch players due to their low FPS and therefore, lesser performance during matches. \n\n*PROS*\n\n~ This game, is great for both horror fans, and those who just want to play with their friends, and don't mind a horror setting. Though, after so many hours of game play, the frightening aspect of the game goes away, with the exception of silent killers who can jump scare you. \n\n~ The game OFTEN goes on sale, especially during holidays, including the many various DLCs that generally decrease to a manageable 2.99-4.99 USD.\n\n~ The Devs are very active in communicating through twitter, their forums, and twitch. The game is always being updated, and is in a far better place than it ever has been. Despite what twitter may tell you, the game is mostly balanced, and any killer can do well if they get good enough, and though there are absolutely worse killers than others, you can find enjoyment through varying builds and play styles. Recently, the developers have been doing a wonderful job of taking feedback, and incorporating changes in a relatively fast manor. \n\n~ This game is cross-platform between Windows Store, Stadia, Switch, Xbox, PS, and PC. There is very minimal advantage to playing survivor with a mouse vs controller. (There is however, a significant advantage to playing some killers with a mouse, however they are not game breaking by any means.) You can play with 3 of your friends in public matches, or create customs matches with a party of 4 survivors and 1 killer, all who you may invite. \n\n~ The art team for Dead by Daylight is absolutely on point in almost every scenario. There are very few \"meh\" skins in this game. They do go on sale, and while the usual price of a skin for one character is anywhere from the 10$ price point, to 20$ for legendary skins, they almost always feel worth it, especially if it's for a character you main. Additionally, paying 10$(Auric Cells) for the Rift (aka battlepass) you are able to earn skins, as well as gain back the Auric Cells you used to pay for the Rift, allowing you to use that same money for the next one in the future. \n\n~ This game is absolutely rich with lore. There are licensed killers from the movies you know and love, and there are original killers with unique looks and powers. There is a challenge system, in which you do tasks in the game, and unlock in game currency, and additional lore that you can collect and archive for forever, so you are able to go back and read it. There is new lore, mini lore videos that come out all the time. This world building is so good, and has improved a lot since the launch of the game. You can really get to know your favorite characters better, and it makes them that much better to play.\n\n*Cons*\n\n~ Once you reach Red Ranks (Rank 1-4) you begin to truly feel just how weak some killers are when going against the right survivors, on the right map, with the right perks/items. The game can and probably will begin to become a bit frustrating, if you are a high rank, and just want to try out a new killer you aren't familiar with. The Matchmaking system, needs work, and while it generally places you with similar ranks, rank in Dead by Daylight, is not always an indication of skill. I would argue it rarely is, and is much more an indication of playtime/grinding games. \n\n~ The community in this game is quite split. You have half of the community who are friendly, just want to hang out with their friends and get killed by monsters and murderers, but the other half are honestly just really mean sometimes. Generally you will find these people on the internet, yelling at everyone about how terrible the game is, yet they will continue to play. Ignore these people, they are loud, but do not represent the DBD community. \n\n~ In matches, if a killer does not perform well, survivors tend to become quite toxic. Toxic, meaning doing things in game that would seem disrespectful to the killer such as, but not limited to teabagging, excessive flashlight blinding, running around you in circles, continually jumping in and out of lockers to make loud notifications for the killer, etc. \nI implore you NOT to take these things personally. When you're playing Dead by daylight, survivors tend to sort of disassociate the killer character, from the actual player. They aren't trying to hurt your feelings on purpose, but it definitely can feel like that sometimes. So, if you're playing survivor, I urge you to consider the feelings of the killer. you can win, and win hard, but you can do it gracefully, and without making the other player feel bad. You will understand later. \n\n~ This game really does require at least 60 FPS for it to feel good. Hence, the recommendation of any platform that can achieve this.  (Obviously it still plays at lower, and old gen consoles are capped at 30)\n\n~ Though the devs are generally pretty good at finding bugs, thanks to the help of the player base and their access to the public test server for new content, bugs slip through the cracks often. In my opinion, there are far too many of them every new patch, and some of them can be game breaking. Those are usually fixed the fastest, but for how many players test this game during new patches, there should be a better understanding of the bugs and much less that make it through to live servers.","timestamp_created":1618519727,"timestamp_updated":1618521206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90370456","author":{"steamid":"76561198329327154","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":29418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29020,"last_played":1658364678},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1618519582,"timestamp_updated":1618519582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90370345","author":{"steamid":"76561199033684491","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1648399351},"language":"russian","review":"Оаоао.
