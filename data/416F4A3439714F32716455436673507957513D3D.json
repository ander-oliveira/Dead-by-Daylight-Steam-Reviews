Обе игры очень похожи, но отличаються лишь управлением и скорее геймплеем за маньяка. Вместо собирания часов или \"Продержиться N минут\". Мы должны включить генераторы на карте и сбежать через один из двух выходов. Маньяк же должен нам помешать, что делать геймплей за него вовсе не страшным, а скорее однообразным. Отыграв около 6 игр за всех маньяков (их 3), понимаешь, что всё идёт по одному и тому же сценарию. За жертву наоборот геймплей будет интереснее, ибо можно заниматься троллингом маньяка или троллингом команды всячески создавая им шум. Баги в игре присутствуют и даже бета не помогла их исправить. Например, кусок текстуры, который мило торчал из шкафа и позволил мне найти жертву сразу же или непонятный телепорт меня в стену на краю карты, что опять же не очень приятно, или попытка поймать выжевшего при прыжке в люк, которая не увенчалась успехом, ибо \"Не сработала, как надо\".

But when you successfully survive against him, it's the greatest feeling in the world. (ProTip: Use Teamwork to GTFO, <-- not from a real pro).\n\n2) There are mass amounts of people just joining the lobby and leaving because they want to play with friends, but 15 minute for one game just to que? that's extreme and kinda exaggerated.

They don't happen everytime, but you're bound to run into them. I'm actually gonna \"go out there and make a difference\" and summarize the ones I (me, myself and I alone!) have encountered, feel free to add on.\n-A) Falling through the world, your character will yell and fall through the gound repeatively. along with the glitch in (C). {Edit}: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=703987045\n-B) You gain the ability to hover above the ground, It's not a T pose, its like a contorted Y pose used for the falling animation. You can still take damage, run, and die, but your screen will be distorted as hell and crouching isn't a thing, neither is interacting with the world. {Edit}: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=703986336\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=703987070\n-C) Unable to interact with the enviroment, self-explanitory, this means EVERYTHING. People, items, objectives. This particular glitch pairs with the first glitch above. Vise Versa, people can interact with you though.\n-D) i don't really think this is a glitch, just a game mechanic, but there is a delay in the little mini game (skill tester) that pops up when you heal someone or repair an engine/motor. You get use to it real fast, you have no choice but to, with all the adrenaline flowing through your veins, it becomes the last of your worries.

It's intense, thrilling, challenging, and sorta cliche but the good kind, the kind you reminisce about. Try it yourself, and expect more to come, this game clearly has potential and good fortune coming it's way. Let's all support the Dev's and pray to the gods of video game heaven that this doesn't become a Pay to Win cause i notice it is possible, unlikely but possible. Second prayer for the Dev's to listen to the community's feedback, not saying they don't, fingers cross that they do. Unlike some devs (those who shall not be named), because there is always room for improvement, and i would hate for this game to fall before reaching glory, or fall at all, it has good momentum. \n{Edit}: After reviewing my post, i notice i didn't mention anything over the top in the  \"Good\" department, mostly the bad. One, when you buy a game you want to know the catches first, what random bullshit to expect, i'm saying it how it is, the game isnt perfect (none are),  but it's enjoyable. Second, if i can tell you all the bad AND STILL say this game is glorious, then theres some kind of element i cannot spoil for you that overrides everything else, it's an experience you must have on your own terms. Besides what do you want? The Game description? it's a freaking survival horror man!
