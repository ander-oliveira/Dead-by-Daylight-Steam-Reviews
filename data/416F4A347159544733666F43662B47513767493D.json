There are 100's of complicated mechanics and character specific perks and effects, that in order to fully understand how to play against, you will have to learn. Also followed by a few bullshit mechanics where you did nothing wrong, you were just unlucky. It is a grueling experience being hooked first by pure unluckiness and then getting camped by the killer until you are completely out of the game. This will really offput new players, until the game hits. When you start to better understand the mechanics and what each hero does it is an incredibly rewarding experience. The game rewards time spent in it, which is bad when you're new, but really fun when you've gotten some experience in it. The grinding elements are a bit too much for a paid game, but as the game came out 5 years ago, it can be excused.  But what can't be excused is the pay to win nature of the game, some characters have perks that are extremely powerful, but requires you to own that character. This would've been fine if you could unlock these characters by playing, but many of the best perks are locked behind a pay wall, which isn't exceptable in 2021. \n\nTLDR: Game is fun after you've put many hours in, put suffers from a pay-to-win business model.  \n7/10","timestamp_created":1626651102,"timestamp_updated":1626651102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95988631","author":{"steamid":"76561198070210052","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":13266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12715,"last_played":1655434219},"language":"english","review":"4V1 horror multi-player done right.

Also make more indoor maps survivor  friendly also nerf ghost face he is very overused also even if you look at him it won't snap him out so its hard to counter his insta. Also nerf doctor  add on being able to shock half of some maps is way to powerful. But a up side to this game is the farming is fun and some perks for survivor can be very fun to use. Playing with friends and making builds to go with each other and keep everyone from dying is fun same goes for fun killer builds. The achievements are fairly easy to get just play the game the cosmetics look cool for the most better  dlc characters are awesome and well made design wise and most perks. Also the game is pretty active so you don't have to wait very long for match. Also the currency like bloodpoints and shards are very fun to earn and i love how you can't buy them forcing normies to grind lol. Don't need to take my word but atleast try it like when there is a free weekend very fun on pc coming from someone who has also played on console which pc is just better with this game. Also its exciting to guess whats next for this game events add more excitement to game and makes you grind for free cosmetic and getting more bloodpoints also with a good random team you can go far but thats it for my review definitely   worth the money.

the time of writing this review, I have over 500 hours of this game, which is not too much, but is enough to warrant a well detailed review. When you start the game for the first time, you can not be well prepared for what you are about to face, regardless of how many videos you watch and how many experiences your friends tell you, as Dead by Daylight is a unique experience. When you first start playing this game, you will definitely be scared, especially playing against some killers like Ghostface or the Shape, but as you play more the scare factor kind of dissappears, although there are still instances of Jumpscares if you are not ready. One of the major critiques I have for this game is the lag/servers. Often times you will be left questioning whether or not it is your internet holding you back or the game itself, and more often than not it is the latter. This can lead to rage quits and frustration in general, but thankfully the situation has improved significantly since release. Another major critique I have is the vast selection of characters, perks, items and skins. Although not a problem for experienced players who understand how everything works, newer players will get overwhelmed by all the different aspects of the game as well as the different perks and powers each survivor and killer has. One final thought: this game is not great for casual players who do not take this game seriously and only occasionally hop on to play with friends. Although still fun, the lack of knowledge and perks you have ultimately hurts you in game, which is not a problem for experienced players who grind for the best perks and add-ons for their respective character. Overall: a fun and unique game which will leave an impression on you.","timestamp_created":1626645809,"timestamp_updated":1626655318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95985247","author":{"steamid":"76561198188192459","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1800,"last_played":1656388705},"language":"brazilian","review":"mto
