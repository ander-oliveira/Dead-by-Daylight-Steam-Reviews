fun until you play killer against a 4-stack of survivors who all use Feng Min and are in a discord call and have meme names like \"PPSlayer\" or \"Ligma\" who burn an offering to put you in Haddonfield (a terrible map for killers) to loop you for 3 hours in the same building or jungle gym that's impossible for you to actually chase and hit them unless you play mind games and trick them that way, that same person will take you through like 4 of them and drop 7 palettes on you, (which all stun you), and then they'll shine the flashlight in your eyes while stunned (to blind you) every single time and sometimes twice in a row, only for you to finally down someone (if you're lucky the slugged person didn't crawl under a palette for their friend to drop on you when you pick them up to stun you and they get off your shoulder) their buddies bodyblock you from going to the hook only for them to sabotage and destroy the hook right in front of you, making the survivor get off your shoulder and run (Which stuns you), while they finish the last 2 generators to exit. And then when they open the exit gate you get lucky and down someone only for them to decisive strike off your shoulder (which stuns you) and make it, teabagging and rapidly flickering their light at the exit which makes you derank cause you got entity displeased.\n\nAnd no i'm not over exaggerating, that's how most games are for killers, and it gets worse the more you climb ranks. The game is balanced strictly to be a casual arcade game for survivors. Anything above that, toxic survivors take advantage of the unbalanced mechanics and take joy in your suffering. If you're anything more than just a loosely casual player, you will really have miserable games and wish the game could be balanced, but they don't play on balancing the game either. So expect for some toxic survivors to take advantage of things and point and laugh at you after. \n\nAside from the basement dwellers who take joy in your pain and misery, the game is fun enough for you to keep playing after terrible games, but it's still miserable to play.  \n\nMost maps are survivor-centric, their are infinite loops that you can't outplay them in unless they mess up or you mind game them, there are glitches they try to abuse, and the survivor has too many things they can use against you and abuse on you. The best part is, they don't really care and wanna fix it, cause the devs don't care to balance the game for a more competitive experience.\n\nOut of the 23 killers, there like 3-4 who are broken enough to be able to 4k even the strongest of these toxic survivors, by doing things like teleporting through these broken loops for example. Yep, the 3 killers are S tier cause they can just blatantly bypass through those loops that survivors abuse. Then the other 19 killers just struggle cause of these imbalances. It doesn't matter if you put 100 hours in Oni for example, if the game puts you on Lery's memorial or Hawkin's lab, sorry champ. Your ability is rendered almost useless and you will have to try your best to even just kill 1-2 survivors without using your ability, just walking around and hitting them. Oh you're playing Leatherface? The survivor will just circle the same car in Badham for 2 hours as the rest of the team finishes gens and since you have no mobility you can't do anything about it, only for them to drop the palette on you and they run away. They'll also just hug the walls tightly so you can accidentally hit the wall with your saw for your very large stun penalty. Then what's rich is that they'll denounce you for camping hooks as him. The hypocrisy and the audacity, am I right? \n\nShoutout to the devs for ruining a game that has such potential, and shoutout to the clown survs who abuse it for fun, you guys are just as cool","timestamp_created":1618922184,"timestamp_updated":1618922184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90625987","author":{"steamid":"76561198064944218","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":635,"playtime_at_review":982,"last_played":1660174775},"language":"spanish","review":"Os lo recomiendo, el juego es de 10s\n\nLo unico malo, que como te toque alguien con mucho ping, pues bueno es lo que toca, ver golpes que en realidad no lo son por el lag que lleva.\n\nPor lo demas me flipa mucho","timestamp_created":1618921907,"timestamp_updated":1618921907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90625595","author":{"steamid":"76561199067425145","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42511,"last_played":1657503642},"language":"brazilian","review":"topkkk","timestamp_created":1618921298,"timestamp_updated":1618921298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90625357","author":{"steamid":"76561198152293223","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1594369529},"language":"english","review":"Simultaneously the best and most disappointing game youve ever played,\nit's cheaper than meth but will ruin your life just the same.","timestamp_created":1618920976,"timestamp_updated":1618920976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90625215","author":{"steamid":"76561198219693619","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1021,"last_played":1645447274},"language":"english","review":"First of all, this game is awesome. It's hide and seek meets 80s slasher horror. After a first week of gaming I must say I'm impressed, although currently I'm playing as a survivor exclusively (I know I'm missing out, but baby steps). So after athe first week how things are going:\n\n1. It's still scary and makes you jump.\n2. Helping out teammates is incredibly rewarding, I don't mean Bloodpoints but it actually feels good. Just yesterday we were chased by The Plague and after I fixed three generators and opened the gate, I came back to heal two of my team mates so they could reach exit with me. To make things even better, the killer was constantl patrolling between them. 4th player didn't make it unfortunately :(\n3. Killers are still able to get me. Too easily sometimes and that's great because it shows it will take time to master the game.\n4. There is still so much to explore and I love that Lovecraftian touch to the lore.\n\nBefore you begin playing a fair warning for you. This game is merciless and will punish you often. You will feel alone, frustrated and abandoned by other team mates sometimes. But surviving and flipping the middle finger to the killers is incredibly fun and you will come back for more.

game has been around for a good while, and it does a lot of things right. Unfortunately, one of the things it does wrong is one of the biggest things they could do wrong; Matchmaking. The matchmaking in this game is so bad that it'll have you refunding it 3-4 games in.\n\nAdditionally, the community is toxic. Mostly toxic in-game (albeit some toxicity post-game chat if people are particularly salty), wherein killers will purposely face-camp and \"slug\" survivors, and survivors will consistently taunt killers in various, unnecessary, ways.\n\nAs for the matchmaking, as a killer and a new player--just don't. You will get nothing but SWF (Survive With Friends; i.e. players playing together and most likely in some sort of voice-chat), and/or much higher ranked survivors than you are intended to be playing with--and more often than not, these two things go hand-in-hand, resulting in a particularly horrible experience.\n\nAs a survivor, you are less likely to get killers of higher ranking (although it still happens), but you are more likely to be lobbied with other survivors who do not know what they are doing and/or are intentionally throwing the game in an attempt to de-rank in order to play with higher skill at lower rank (see \"matchmaking\").\n\nThe game itself, at its core, is a good game and a great party game--provided that you have 5 players/friends to fill 4 survivor roles and 1 killer role in a Custom Game. However, if you picked up (or are planning to pick up) this game because you saw some YouTuber or Twitch Streamer playing it and it looked fun and you want to play \"online\", just run the other way. These YouTubers and Twitch streamers are likely much better than you at this game and have been playing for a long time, which can skew many new players views of the skill it takes to play this game.\n\nThis game is good if you are already skilled at the game, but the \"new player experience\" is atrocious and needs to be addressed if they intend to retain new players.\n\nIf you have friends and are planning to just do custom games, more power to you. I recommend this game for that. But stay away from the online until they fix their horrible matchmaking and start banning players who are purposely abusing the game and its ranking system as I stated above.\n\nThe game isn't bad, it's just flawed in an integral way.

Как двуликий Янус. Её разработчики очень хороши в плане визуальной составляющей, дизайна персонажей и карт, атмосферы (особенно с последними главами), наполнения, анимаций действий и убийств, истории мира и его лора (тут вообще одна из лучших идей за всё время с Сущностью, возрождением после смерти, жертвоприношениями, безвыходностью и прочими вкусняшками). И эти же разработчики плохи в технической части (баги, лаги, глюки, бесконечные загрузки и легендарные хиты, достающие тебя через окно, когда ты уже отбежал на 4 метра, либо топоры, прилетающие в спину, когда ты уже давно завернул за угол) и просто ужасны в плане игрового баланса. Причем речь даже не о вечном споре о том, кто слишком бафнутый: выжившие или киллеры. Тут дело в ином: разработчики придумали механику игры, а потом сами же как-то взяли и махнули на нее рукой, позволив группам сурвов в голосе участвовать в рейтинге наравне с рандомами, никак не выделяя и не оповещая Киллера о том, что против него команда. А дальше стали \"балансировать\" сломанную игру. В итоге получился бред, потому что четыре рандома и команда в голосе - это, как говорится, две большие разницы, и эффект разных патчей, изменений и нововведений на эти две группы кардинально различается. Подкрутив что-то у сурвов, разрабы сильно усиливают команды, киллеры начинают возмущаться, их резко бафают или меняют (или \"нерфят\" сурвов), жизнь у обычных рандомных игроков становится печальной, они тоже начинают плакать, и процесс идёт по бесконечному кругу, бессмысленному и беспощадному. Выход, казалось бы, элементарный: разделите эти две группы. Киллер просто-напросто должен получать оповещение, если против него команда, и иметь возможность подготовиться (я уже молчу про какие-то баффы к его перкам). А разделив, уже балансируйте себе на здоровье, тут хоть будет смысл. Но вряд ли это когда-либо реализуют...\nОтдельно доставляет \"логика\" определённых действий. К примеру, разработчики ввели наказание за дисконнект из матча (намеренный или случайный), мотивируя это тем, что подобные действия сказываются на игровом опыте других игроков и мешают тем наслаждаться игрой, снижая шансы на победу (или типа того). Вроде хорошо. Однако как насчёт, к примеру, тиммейтов, которые фармят тебя по-чёрному, снимая с крюка под носом у киллера без одолженного времени или, что еще хуже, вообще специально привлекая внимание уходящего маньяка перед тем, как зафармить твою тушку (да-да, иммерсивные Клодетты, это в первую очередь к вам относится)? Что насчёт киллеров, которые всю игру валяют тебя на земле, пока ты просто не помрешь согласно таймеру? Как насчёт вышеупомянутых групп в войсе, которые тусят на невысоких рангах, тибэггают и издеваются над новенькими неопытными еще киллерами, которые еще только учатся играть? Я не буду упоминать кемпинг крюков и дальнейший туннелинг с красным мори (тут еще можно скрипя зубами сослаться на игровую механику или наличие у киллера ритуала или достижения). Как насчёт всего этого? Это каким-то образом должно меня веселить и способствовать получению приятного игрового опыта? Это не мешает мне наслаждаться игрой? Почему это не банится и не наказывается? Вы реально считаете, что дисконнект портит игру намного сильнее, чем фармомрази (давайте называть вещи своими именами), кемперящий в кустах киллер с красным мори, три минуты валяния на земле лицом в грязи или фул команда в голосе, что ты поймешь уже тогда, кода будет поздно? Ну правда?\nВ-общем, что я хочу сказать: игра никогда не была бы куплена, знай я всё это заранее. Как ни парадоксально, ибо мне она очень сильно нравится (в первых предложениях сказано, почему). Вот такие дела. Если вы еще не играли, найдите что-то более адекватное, чтобы не приходилось потом разбивать себе лицо фэйспалмами, глядя на очередные \"балансирования\" многострадальной сломанной игровой механики или на очередной \"бесконечный\" загрузочный экран...","timestamp_created":1618902813,"timestamp_updated":1627493256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90615202","author":{"steamid":"76561198313223014","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14679,"last_played":1649796287},"language":"english","review":"scary gaem","timestamp_created":1618902699,"timestamp_updated":1618902699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90614836","author":{"steamid":"76561198871769050","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1628364259},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра.
