Surely by now the survivors know that if the killer camps they get less blood points, alot less. Yes it may make the game alot harder for the the survivor, however, if thats how that particular killer wants to play you have two choices. QUIT that match or PLAY and stop being little bitches about it THE END.\n\nNow you have the killer who likes to hook them and hunt (my play style) which gets you loads of blood points.

That was enough for me. lol The game plays very well and it is very fast paced. I am on edge every single time I play it. It is designed in such a way you have to work with the other survivors in order to survive obviously. It is the first of it's kind and probably the best if I were to be totally honest. The dev team from what I have seen tries their best to work with the community. Also when there are issues they handle them very professionally.\n\nNow I don't normally reference another game in my reviews for a game, but today I am doing so to emphasize what exactly it is your buying here. There is only one other slasher game currently to date similar to this one. That is Friday The 13th.. Now I Beta tested this game and it was fun even if it was abit graphic for my taste and I was just about to buy it until I caught wind of a review here and seen how poorly the developers of that game handled that situation.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/yourwaifuisshitdesu/recommended/438740/\nNow I will not get all in to it on this review. This video will explain pretty much the situation in a nutshell for those of you interested.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3mI0Ic8n-M\n\nMy purpose for referencing it merely is this. You are not only buying a quality game, but you are buying a quality development team who handles their customer base with professionalism. That is what you are purchasing for your money. After having seen that it made be appreciate our devs. of this game so much more. I can't even begin to tell you.

ONでキャラクターを底上げする要素もあり、様々な遊び方をたのしめますが、本来エッセンスであるPARKが破壊的に(しかも特定のものだけが)強力で、生存者も殺人鬼も最終的には同じPARK構成になりがち。\n\n生存者側に無敵ポイントと呼ばれる箇所が、様々なマップに当たり前のように点在しているのも評価できません。しかも場所さえ覚えてしまえば、ただ単調にぐるぐる回るだけ、タイミング良くボタンを押すだけ…非常にスリルのない方法で時間稼ぎをすることができます。\n\n殺人鬼側が強力なPARKを搭載して参加している、自分の嫌いな殺人鬼を使用しているとわかった瞬間に接続を切る生存者も稀におり、ゲームのプログラムに現れない殺人鬼側への負荷が酷いです。\n殺人鬼の旨味はコンスタントに成長の為のポイントが稼げるくらい、でしょうか？ 現verではそれも怪しいのですが…。\n\nその為か、ホストである殺人鬼が少なく生存者側でスタートする場合、非常に長い時間待機しなければならない場合もあります。\n\nまた、ボイスチャットの要素がありません、あるのはロビーでの文字チャットのみ、現状を見る限り、運営側の正しい選択と言えます。このゲームにおいて、ボイスチャット導入は飛躍的に生存者側を有利にしますので、ソフトウェアチートと言っても差し支えがないでしょう。殺人鬼側でやってみるとわかりますが、明らかに連携のスムーズさが異なります。\n\nまた、こう言った複数対戦型ゲームのマナーが悪さはどのゲームでも共通ですが、生存者側の遅延行為や煽りなど、ホストである殺人鬼側をうんざりさせる様な状況が頻繁しています。(あまりにも居ないので)殺人鬼側をメインにプレイしていますが、3回に2回は屈伸運動&出口前待機、いつまでも脱出しない方の何れかに出くわします(笑)\n\n殺人鬼側の一存でゲームを終了する事ができるのも致命的、殺人鬼はランクが下がる程度で特にマイナス要素はありませんが、せっかく参加出来たゲームでも我慢強い殺人鬼(笑)でないと、マナーの悪い生存者（上記のマップによるハメ行為や煽りなど）が一人居ただけで、強制終了する場合もあります。(数少ない生存者プレイで切断を体験しています)\n\n生存者と殺人鬼がマナーを守らないと、ゲームが成り立たない要素を含んでいますが、それはゲームの開発側に関係がありませんのでゲーム評価には含めません。\n\n上記PARKの強力さもあり、殺人鬼側では100〜200時間程、経験値を稼ぎPARKを揃えてからが本番なんだろう、と感じています。\n気軽に楽しむなら生存者側がオススメなのでしょうか…？自分は待ち時間がもったいないので殺人鬼側をオススメします。\n\n色々と思う所を書き出しましたが、簡単に俺TUEEEが出来るほどヌルゲーではありません、この点は高評価です。\n\nゲームコンセプトや雰囲気など、非常に良い部分も多いのですが、現ver1.53は明らかに生存者側有利とのこと。それを差し引いても自分は殺人鬼側メインで楽しめています！\n今後のアップデートで現段階よりも、お互いにスリリングで刺激的な仕様に変更される事を願います。","timestamp_created":1499596974,"timestamp_updated":1499793135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33400477","author":{"steamid":"76561198388098609","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":179,"playtime_at_review":1260,"last_played":1659960046},"language":"spanish","review":"no

by Shitlight... hra, která bývala zábavou. No, nyní podstatou hry je loopování (běhání okolo jednoho místa pořád dokola). Naprosto miluju, jak mají devs této hry potřebu stále něco měnit, hlavně věci, které fungovaly naprosto v pořádku. Například časté a nepotřebné změny UI. Balancování hry byl v posledním půlroce velký problém, jelikož se hráči naučili jak se tato hra má správně hrát, ještě s kombinací, že BHVR svoji hru ani netestují. V podstatě jediný aktivní a zkušený člen teamu BHVR je not_Queen, která však ale je pouze manager komunity. Zpátky v roce 2016/začátek roku 2017 byla hra opravdu zábavná hrát, ovšem hra se změnila takovým způsobem, že už stojí za pěknou píču. Stejného názoru je i většina streamerů/YTberů (zahraničních) například No0b3 to skvěle vysvlětluje v jeho videu \"1.9.2 Update Gone Wrong - Dead by Daylight\". Dalším příkladem je 72hrs, Logan, Swe a mnoho dalších. Bohužel hra už nikdy nebude tak dobrá jako byla dříve, ale několik věcí se změnit k lepšímu může. Pro nově příchozí hráče je hraní s kamarády peckou a hra je ze začátku i celkem spooky. Později ale pro vás začně bát spíše frustrující, když vás hitne něco, co nemá etc.\n\n\nSmíšené pocity ale asi bych hru pro nové hráče doporučil.","timestamp_created":1499592981,"timestamp_updated":1519327589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33398874","author":{"steamid":"76561198073293187","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":49126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34522,"last_played":1654893015},"language":"russian","review":"хуйня","timestamp_created":1499592584,"timestamp_updated":1631399916,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519774019718170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33398769","author":{"steamid":"76561198229866832","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":72010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6114,"last_played":1646139024},"language":"schinese","review":"BUG杀鸡 牛逼 ！！！","timestamp_created":1499592255,"timestamp_updated":1610967146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33398398","author":{"steamid":"76561198086988331","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3382,"last_played":1619466584},"language":"schinese","review":"这个卡bug，翻板子，还有开大门，满了都不开，板子翻各种人被卡到鬼面前，还有这个弱智的steam各种103，不推荐玩这个游戏，非常不推荐，各种人皇，bug，玩到你生气伤肝，远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！远离傻鸡，健康生活！！！！！！！！！！！！！","timestamp_created":1499590973,"timestamp_updated":1499590973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466101676225662231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33398331","author":{"steamid":"76561198165611105","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1908,"last_played":1519209807},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกๆ ซื้อมาเล่นกัน\n","timestamp_created":1499590719,"timestamp_updated":1511604427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33398323","author":{"steamid":"76561198050626078","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":14842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5645,"last_played":1636921037},"language":"english","review":"NEW REVIEW AND NEW THOUGHTS, This game is finally better now I remeber first seeing it with my friends and it looked like a game to pass the time so we got it and it was amazing sure you couldnt really connect to other people but the custom matches were awsome and there was that stage where it looked dead but since its been updated im playing this game more then I am F13 and I am satisfied with my purchase the dlcs are good some useless some good cant wait to see what new killer theyll make next the wide variety of killers instead of one killer with different parts and a variety of characters Im gunna recommend this game to everyone buy it twice cus its that fucking good wut ya say its not worth it?

Have had mine and friends rank reset twice.  So going from rank 9 back down to 20 in matter of seconds when connecting to a new game is just annoying.

I'd rank this game up there with Friday the 13th seeing as the developers don't care to fix a buggy game, which is sad because DBD has been out for an entire year.
