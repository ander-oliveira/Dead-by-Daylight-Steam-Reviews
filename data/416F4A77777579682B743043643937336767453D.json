They push out new content so consistently that they continuously break their game patch-after-patch. They fix one thing, only to break three others in its place. It's glitchy and buggy, hit boxes suck and their killers are unbalanced. Granted, you can't help how players play the killer, but the devs do absolutely nothing about it. It's one of the most toxic communities you'll ever have the pleasure of dealing with, and they make no attempt to correct it, seeing they encourage players, based on perks and abilities, to play that way. And while it may sound like I play survivor only... I don't.\n\nTHE KILLER:\nIs broken. They're easy to play, and 90% of the time I kill all four survivors, or at least three (if one is lucky enough to find the hatch). While there are some survivor groups (play with friends) that are good, and they can give you a really nice challenge, most of the time, matches are in your favor and pretty easy to win.\n\nSURVIVOR:\nYou sneak, work on gens and run from the killer. Your only form of defense are pallets scattered around the map and windows to vault, giving yourself some distance from the killer during a chase. There are some fancier way to throw off the killer, but you'll primarily depend on these objects.\n\nThe issue. There's no form of in-game voice chat. While the devs will argue it's to immerse the player into the game more, third party voice systems break this and give those survivor team's an edge. So if you have a group of friends, that know what they're doing, it's a pretty fun time. However, if you play with random survivors, it's one of the most frustrating experiences you'll ever face.\n\nDLC & UPDATES:\n\nThey put 0 effort into changing the actual game play, which is where veteran players, like myself, start to lose interest. You sneak (or run) around, find a gen, work on the gen and possibly get chased by the killer. If you fire up enough gens, you escape. That's it. That's what this game has been since launch, with a few added features, but nothing that's game changing. Their focus on DLC is introducing new killers and survivors. \n\nThe killers are pretty interesting, because they each get a new ability, but that can get stale really quick. Survivors are a waste of money. They each get their own perks, but you can eventually teach them to other survivors, making them purely cosmetic. You do have to ask yourself, though... when will it end? Are we, literally, going to have a game with 1000 killers and survivors but the same game mode over the rest of this games life cycle?\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI don't want to encourage anyone to not play this game, but I'd recommend waiting on a sale, and play for a bit before you throw your money at them in the form of DLC or cosmetics. Most killers aren't worth buying, and the survivors are even more pointless. Save your money. They do tend to run quite a few events, but even then, after several years, you start to realize they do the exact same events, as well. This explains why we've had the same game mode the entire time. The devs lack creative, new ideas. They had one great idea, ran with it... but it's getting boring and stale at this point.\n\nBTW-this is one of the most rage inducing games you'll ever play. NOT because it's challenging... but because it's broken. It's extremely easy for killers to play like cheap garbage in the form of camping and tunneling. You can wait a while for a match, load in and then be found, camped and tunneled by a cheap killer... only to play for 30 seconds. And death is permanent. When you die, you have to find a new lobby and group to play with. Combine that with all their bugs, glitches and horrible hit boxes... and it's one of the most frustrating experiences you'll ever deal with.\n\nGood luck if you buy this game.","timestamp_created":1503125214,"timestamp_updated":1587527234,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34343899","author":{"steamid":"76561198107932707","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3891,"last_played":1639274829},"language":"english","review":"One

У меня слетали сейвы, место того что бы как-то их найти дали просто 5кк бладпоинтов на прокачку. \n Если вы хотите играть спокойно и без бомбежки у вас наверно не получится. Вас будут кемперить, команда будет чинить сраные генераторы и вас спасать не будут пока не починят, вам будут мешать тиммейты, вы будете делить одну доску на 2, фонарик вам не поможет а так, игра хорошая, хоть она и не с доработками побегать от маньяка, прокачка и остальное веселье вот что помогает в этой игре. Гайд для новичков что бы с нами были в доску, не бойтесь маньяка, то что вы проиграет ничего не значит, максимум капля пропадет. Не воспринимайте игру как хоррор, это вовсе не хоррор, а просто немножечко пообсиратся от майкла который резко вышел из стенки.
