Начну пожалуй с плюсов игры:\n1. Атмосфера, музыкальное составляющее, жуткие звуки, мрачные локации; все это держит игрока в напряжении.Даже отыграв в эту игру , я получаю порцию адреналина заходя поиграть в данный онлайн хоррор.\n2. Персонажи. Я сейчас буду говорить исключительно о маньяках, так как они являются украшением игры. Все как на подбор, жуткие твари, проработанные до мельчайших подробностей, а это дыхание в меню при выборе персонажа(особенно у \"медсестры\"). Все они жуткие, и если они гонятся за вами, это вызывает непередаваемые эмоции.\n3.Игра не привередлива в машине на которой вы ее запустите, даже интернет не так сильно влияет на ваш успех.\n4. Геймплей за выживших. Да, здесь я пожалуй начну говорить более конкретно. Игра за выжившего, дарит вам непередаваемые эмоции, первые часы игры, вам даже страшно, вы просто начинаете прятаться, боясь всего окружающего. Но и наиграв много часов, игра награждает вас эмоциями уж поверьте.\n5. Возможность играть с друзьями. Тут пожалуй описывать не чего.\nИтак, настало время минусов:\n1. Я о игроках. К примеру: в игре есть ранги, что бы более опытные и сильные игроки не играли с слабыми, так некоторые игроки, которые играют на высоких рангах, специально сбрасывают этот ранг, и начинаю \"насиловать\" игроков \"новичков\", а после игры пишут в чате оскорбления. Чаше такие индивидуумы встречаются на \"выживших\", издеваясь на \"маньяками\" низкого ранга. \n2. Игра за \"маньяка\".Чаще выступает в роли жертвы. Да \"выжившие\" не могут вас ударить или убить, но они на столько усилены перками. Плюс, фонари которыми они слепят вас... Игра за \"маньяка\" требует очень много терпения и стальных нервов.\n3.Пожалуй на этом все, я не буду затрагивать тему.Я описал в общих чертах. Игра хороша и я в нее играю с удовольствием.","timestamp_created":1560882514,"timestamp_updated":1562348331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471369773149490356","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51293703","author":{"steamid":"76561198135991470","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":32676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":58,"playtime_at_review":6085,"last_played":1659993640},"language":"russian","review":"Найс вылеты","timestamp_created":1560881001,"timestamp_updated":1560881001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521990954875946045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51293657","author":{"steamid":"76561198325863022","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":31983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":961,"playtime_at_review":8924,"last_played":1660594617},"language":"polish","review":"super gierka","timestamp_created":1560880808,"timestamp_updated":1560880808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51293446","author":{"steamid":"76561198440926794","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":140421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79099,"last_played":1655722921},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game, a lot to do.

A constant barrage of people basically shit talking each other. There is not a single game in which the end-game chat is not filled with insults or other dumb stuff. No matter how \"hard\" you win or lose a game you will rarley see a simple gg. Next I want to talk about huge discrepancies in killer balancing. There are 2 Killers in the game that, even if you are only half way decend at playing them, will crush almost any survivor. Since the game basically revolts around which killer you are up against and which side brings the stronger perk or add-ons there is a huge risk factor to not bring the meta perks. This creates a huge problem because people are scarred what the other side might bring along. Since the killers are scarred they will bring a mori which brings me to the next point. Moris. They have been a total game changer since the launch of the game and they were even stronger back then. They give you the ability to kill a survivor after the first hook which cuts chaces in half. Since I have been talking a lot about the game I want to mention the second worst thing about this game, the consistency. Nothing and I mean nothing in this game works out the same way just beacuse you do it the exact same. Hitboxes are by far the worst contender. A lot of killers sadly have to deal with these catastrophic hitboxes. A good example for this is the comparison between Huntress  and Deathslinger. If Huntress thorws a hatchet in the same dimension you are in there is a 100% chance that you will get hit by it. On the other hand if Deathslinger even dares to shot while he is even the slightest pixel of he will miss you entirely resulting in teabagging from the survivor. Blight sadly has to deal with this aswell because his ability revolts around bumping into things, sound easy. It isnt. A lot of surfaces look like you could bump into them but they are way to smooth so you just glide across them resulting in yet an other teabag from the survivors. Something that makes all of this even worst is the free movment suvivors have while running. I dont reacall being able to do full 360 degree cyricls while running without losing any momentum. This of course only applies to the survivors because killes who move faster have a significant turning speed penalty. I basically could go on forever because every match I play I discover some new bug. The last thing I want to mention are the developers.

The person who got off the hook leaves scott free, the body blocker leaves scott free and you are left with very little points and a lobby full of exploiters who regard themselves as god's gift to gaming and proceed to tell you to \"kill yourself camper/tunneler.\"  They even use the same tactic to try and block you from getting to a hook.  Not even even in World Of Warcraft did players have this level of elitist, exploitative attitude.  In every game I have played thus far people regard themselves as skilled players based on their level of skill.  This game's players gauge their level of skill based on how well they can exploit game mechanics to their favor.  I would love to see how good they are if the developers would remove clipping between survivors and killers.  Then lets see how skilled these dip shits are.  Now I do have to say that not all players are like that.  There are plenty of players who are nice and good sports whether they win or lose.  Or there are players like me who know about the exploit but choose not to use it.  I go above and beyond to not be a dick to any opposing player, whether I am the killer or survivor.  I will even carry the last survivor to the escape hatch and let them get extra points.  I wish I could give this game a neutral rating because it is definitely fun when you don't get pieces of shit in your lobby or if you are playing with friends.  If you are just playing with friends then I do recommend it but because of the absolute POS level of players out there and the lack of effort put forth to deal with them I will be giving a thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1560800768,"timestamp_updated":1560800768,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51278541","author":{"steamid":"76561198807083241","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1592698673},"language":"spanish","review":"muy guen juego muy gueno","timestamp_created":1560800493,"timestamp_updated":1560800493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51278422","author":{"steamid":"76561198831435870","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":900,"last_played":1655308354},"language":"english","review":"good game agar fat-ti ni h to","timestamp_created":1560799993,"timestamp_updated":1560799993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51278316","author":{"steamid":"76561198125844315","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1235,"last_played":1563153712},"language":"english","review":"(I've been watching youtube content from dead by daylight for about 2 years now I don't have many hours cause I don't really enjoy playing the game)\nFirst of all the community has no idea what actions are toxic and what actions aren't to the point where actively trying to survive and not get hit by killers is deemed \"toxic\" and is worth a facecamp. To be fair everything the killers do short of letting the survivors live is considered toxic as well. The developers have no idea how to balance a game and its very apparent. When they release a something broken it feels like their solution is instead of fixing the problem, release something equally as broken for the other side. This obviously leads to a fuck load of broken stuff for both sides and makes a lot of games unenjoyable. The devs also decide to fix a problem with another problem with bugs whereas instead of patching the bugs quickly, they ban people for shedding bugs to light. This may dissuade some people from using bugs but it doesn't fix the initial problem of the bug being in the game in the first place. The game itself has fundamental flaws that I'm pretty sure can never be fixed, for example if you're a survivor you have a large chance of having a shit game. Let me explain in DBD you will go down in a game it happens 95% of the time, now if the killer is a dick they can kill you right then and there by putting you on a hook and face camping. Unless one of your random teammates has borrowed time thats end game for you and your team is just gonna do gens. Now on the killer side 4 people running flashlights, instaheal medkits, and adrenaline is pretty much a loss unless you are using the most OP things imaginable. I'm rambling but there are so many problems with this game I could go on and on but, I'll stop here.","timestamp_created":1560799568,"timestamp_updated":1562198229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51278006","author":{"steamid":"76561198147851060","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18968,"last_played":1622922125},"language":"polish","review":"Zajebista gra, super spędzone 300 godzin.

I have enjoyed playing the bit that I have and will probably continue to play some. The problems I have with the game are from the party system and the lack of a causal mode that I can play with friends and one of us can be the killer. The current mode that lets you play with friends just unlocks everything which is great for fun but kinda takes away from the experience of playing the game when you can level up your character.  Similar to Moba's a causal and ranked mode would not go a miss or at least have more options for the under the match settings. The biggest issue myself and friends had when playing as survivors together (which resulted in most of them not getting the game) was the party system dropping the group after ever game and having to reform to play again. The fact that you can't make the party in game and have to use steam to invite and join makes it all the worse. I personally enjoy the game but it would have been nice and a much better game if I could have played with friends. 3/5","timestamp_created":1560794120,"timestamp_updated":1560794120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51276669","author":{"steamid":"76561198268110229","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":228659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84259,"last_played":1651207013},"language":"english","review":"Despite having it's many issues, It's pretty ok.","timestamp_created":1560792301,"timestamp_updated":1560792301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569110214710235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51276449","author":{"steamid":"76561198149348302","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":24231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":3109,"last_played":1660563653},"language":"russian","review":"я ненавижу ету игру","timestamp_created":1560791304,"timestamp_updated":1622559886,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51276347","author":{"steamid":"76561198355297168","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":78,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1537994938},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольная штука","timestamp_created":1560790896,"timestamp_updated":1560790896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51276264","author":{"steamid":"76561198410538464","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5158,"last_played":1638558128},"language":"english","review":"Toxic? yes, do i hate the game? yes, do i love the game? yes, do i recommend? probably yes","timestamp_created":1560790577,"timestamp_updated":1560790577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505141377449035645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51276258","author":{"steamid":"76561198076698843","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":62444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57496,"last_played":1650316254},"language":"german","review":"i love this game","timestamp_created":1560790561,"timestamp_updated":1560790561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508004903793334961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51275808","author":{"steamid":"76561198970117105","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1225,"last_played":1640628721},"language":"russian","review":"очень классная игра в стиле маньяк/выживший лучше чем пятница 13","timestamp_created":1560788704,"timestamp_updated":1560788704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51275614","author":{"steamid":"76561198240886592","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1920,"last_played":1643416352},"language":"english","review":"Although most of this damn game is just paying a lot for DLC, it is still a fun experience.
