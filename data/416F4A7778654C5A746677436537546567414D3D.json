I'm on the fence about recommending this game honestly, but at the end of the day it's a yes for me. I've met many of my closest friends from playing this game, and it's also been a great way for my brothers and I to spend time with each other since two of us live on our own and our little brother still lives at home. the game sure as hell isn't perfect, but it's definitely a good, exciting and addicting game! even so, all of that pales in comparison to what the devs have accomplished for creating a game that forges and strengthens such amazing connections for me and hundreds of thousands of other people, especially during a time like today. props to you, devs!","timestamp_created":1633919875,"timestamp_updated":1633919875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100874937","author":{"steamid":"76561198974216998","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3170,"last_played":1659353540},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1633919674,"timestamp_updated":1633919674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100874915","author":{"steamid":"76561199059189826","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2765,"last_played":1659209899},"language":"english","review":"bing bong","timestamp_created":1633919635,"timestamp_updated":1650419352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100874904","author":{"steamid":"76561198131688184","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":12671,"last_played":1660272242},"language":"brazilian","review":"simplesmente chave","timestamp_created":1633919621,"timestamp_updated":1633919621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100874676","author":{"steamid":"76561198103571553","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1642331833},"language":"russian","review":"Парад духоты за ваши деньги\n11 проверок за 1/4 прогресса генератора.

Die Spiel Idee ist Super und macht Spaß wenn man richtig gematcht wird.\nMatchmaking:\nDamit komm ich zu meinem ersten punkt dem Matchmaking, für die Leute die nicht wissen wie es funktioniert können sich in der guide Kategorie einlesen. Ich finde Persönlich das man das Matchmaking noch ausbauen kann, denn in den Runden die ich mit meinem Freund oder auch ohne gespielt habe ist mir eines Besonders aufgefallen: Als Überlebender oder Killer hatte ich immer wieder viel zu gute Spieler für mich oder extrem schlechte. War natürlich nicht jedes Game so aber es ist oft.\nStärken Unterschied:\nMein 2. Punkt betrifft der Stärken unterschied zwischen Überlebender und Killer, es ist klar das der Killer schneller und mehr vorteile haben muss um gegen 4 Überlebende zu gewinnen aber manchmal kam es mir so vor als ob der Killer besonders bevorzugt wurde und man selbst mit 4 max. Perks keine Chance hatte. \nKiller:\nWozu ich zum nächsten Thema komme die Verschieden Killer und Fähigkeiten. Jeder Killer hat seine eigenen Fähigkeiten und Eigenschaften was cool ist und doch muss bei bestimmten Killern Kritisiert werden. Manche Killer sind nicht komplett gebalanced so z.B. The Trickster er ist nicht der einzige der Neben Nahkampf noch Fernkampf Attacken hat aber bei ihm ist es besonders. Wer sich vielleicht auskennt weiss das Huntress oder Nemesis auch Fernkampf haben. Huntress wirft Äxte und diesen kann man ausweichen da es gut gebalanced ist aber beim Trickster ist es eher weniger so. Wer es nicht weiss die Äxte bringen dich bei einem Hit in den Injured state oder Dying state, was jetzt zuerst unfair erscheint lost sich wenn ich erwähne das sie diese Relativ langsam hintereinander wirft. Der Trickster wirft (kann es nicht genau sagen) shards oder kleine Messer diese nach 4 oder 5-fachen treffen bringen dich dann in den Injured oder Dying state. Was jetzt zuerst fair kling muss noch bedenken das es diese Shards perfekt geradeaus werfen kann und dazu noch extrem schnell wodurch am einfach getroffen wird. Nicht noch zu vergessen ist das Huntress 5 Äxte z.B. mitnehmen kann und The Trickster hat 44 Shards am Anfang einer Runde! Naja das war ein Killer von Vielen. Es gibt noch weitere Killer bei den ich sagen würde das man das noch einmal bearbeiten kann im Positiven und Negativen. \nÜberlebende:\nZu den Überlebenden hab ich eigentlich nicht etwas beizutragen da diese sowieso meistens im Nachteil sind. Das einzige was ich da noch sagen könnte würde über die Taschenlampe gehen die etwas treffsicherer sein könnte in einigen Momenten da der Killer auch einfach Rückwärts auf die Überleben zu gehen kann ohne Gefahr zu haben. \nFazit:\nAm ende muss ich aber auf jeden Falls sagen das man Spaßige runden und schlechte Runden hat wie in jedem Game. Ich weiss nicht ob das allein ein Grund ist das Spiel zu entfehlen aber neben Schlechten und Guten Gegnern gibt es noch welche die nur Spaß haben wollen und nicht ernst Spielen. So wie ich es bisher erlebt habe macht das Spiel trotz einigen Punkten die man besser machen könnte Spaß als Killer oder Überlebender!\n\nSeit kein Hookcamper meine Freunde.\n\nNach ein Paar weiteren Spielstunden ändere ich viele Jedoch nicht alle Gedanken zu diesem Game. Ich wurde besser, auch wenn man selbst nach den Längsten Hunts am Ende gehookt und gefacecampt wird. Ich lasse meine Vorherige bewertung stehen um selbst einmal zurück zu blicken wie ich es gemeint habe. Ab höherem Skill level wird vieles auch von Perks entschieden da es Starke wie auch Schwach gibt. Das Einzig neue Negative das mir einfallen würde ist der Toombstone von Micheal der es einem Erlaubt jemanden in Stufe drei, ob nun vorher 1-mal 2-mal oder gar nicht gehookt, Per Handgriff im Lauf oder sonst wie zu nehmen und zu Instakillen was wesentlich unfair ist erst recht weil dieser nicht allzu starke negative Effekte hat. Gefallen neu tut mir allerdings nicht wirklich etwas. Vielleicht scheint dies ein bisschen kurz zum Vorherigen aber man soll es ja auch nicht zu lang ziehen.\n\nNach weiteren Stunden frage ich mich WTF ist falsch mit dem Matchmaking system???\nIch hab 5 Runden gespielt alleine und keiner der KIller war am Campen oder Tunnel und dann spiele ich 2 Matches mit meinem Freund und in beiden werde ich direkt getunnelt und gecampet und ich bin 3 mal von meinem 5 Matches gestorben also WTF??","timestamp_created":1633890202,"timestamp_updated":1639594076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100857027","author":{"steamid":"76561199049455307","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":30,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1659478598},"language":"english","review":"fun game many killers but u have to pay to get the really good ones but they r cheap scary sometimes","timestamp_created":1633889952,"timestamp_updated":1633889952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100856651","author":{"steamid":"76561199213707488","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1656788456},"language":"russian","review":"игра топ,не убивайте нервы)","timestamp_created":1633889490,"timestamp_updated":1633889490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxeLZtfwCe7TegAM="}
