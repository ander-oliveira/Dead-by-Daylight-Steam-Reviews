Definitely not fun for newbie, or newer players (you get the idea), going against red, gold or just high ranks. Especially, playing Killers, survivors have the upper hand to the point, where it's not as fun anymore. (Aside from rlly painful perks to deal with such as borrowed time, Decisive strike, but sure, fine these perks can be dealt with), but the main concern is with 4-man teams, which renders some Killer perks as kinda useless, the body blocking which makes it just embarrassing/shameful and barely enough time to go to a different hook. (T-bagging at the gate to keep the killers hostage in game, its just annoying, not rlly game affecting but still....annoying). Prob someone will try to suggest some stuff like Blood warden (Sure, IF you don't get body blocked), NOED? (no one escapes death), sure works....if hex totems are still up by the end game) . Keep watch of totems then? Sure, oh but gens are all almost done if not half of em, and if you include survivors looping, blinding and everything, time-wise, very risky. Get perks/ hex totems that slow/regress gen progress? Then wheres the space for NOED, blood warden, and some other perks? So, basically it's just a very meta kind of game, where unless you goin against low lvl survivors, or just lucky in general, then I guess its more of a Survivors vs Clown, rather than Survivors vs Killer. (Sure, there might be some counters to what I've said, but I don't suppose players who don't have all the teach-able perks nor the perks from DLC killers, will prob have a very difficult time). Aside from the complaints, the game is very intriguing, interesting designs, lore, killer abilities, perks and the like. \n\nFrom the survivor Perspective, sure it can sometimes be difficult to escape from the killer, due to their abilities, Add-ons etc. However, the killer is supposed to have a bit of an upper hand, when hunting down survivors, (1 v 4), even with skill, it's not as easy as it looks. For the survivor-side, its less of a meta type of game play (Not saying there is none), but it allows for many different combinations of perks which can't be removed (sure sometimes be rendered useless/less effective due to killer perks, but remember its a 1 v 4), and it just depends on your luck, if the killer has perks against you or not I guess. Coop play in survivors is fun, but only when the killer gets bullied, which just makes the Killer just seem less intimidating and just more pitiful.\n\nEdit: I don't get the point of Pig anymore, like she was point blank nerfed, making her essentially not very good, if not bad in the endgame, and she only has 4 Reverse bear traps, which are easily disabled, or survivors can just simply run out the exit when they aren't activated. Heck, even I have had a few games (idk if its a bug or something I'm missing), where even if the trap is activated, it won't kill the survivor when they leave the exit. (Yes, sure just chase or whatev advice, but when you going against a 4-man.....it just becomes real difficult to actually get em to die by trap, even if you chase that one single trapped survivor, all the gens will prob be done....and not even a confirmed kill, but by luck if they even die to trap due to the bug stated previously.\n\nAnother problem, I've had toxic players (ofc I'm aware of how toxic ppl can get and such, but some are just way over the line), that had insults both their team mates and the killer that goes way over the line with toxicity, such as death-threats towards me or those I know, and nothing has been done against them. Steam Player tags that gave death-threats and constant insults in-game  \"이걸 못잡노? ㅋ\" and \"124시간 데린이\". Maybe I'm going overboard but still.","timestamp_created":1633787384,"timestamp_updated":1635607709,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485960245132446289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100783001","author":{"steamid":"76561199179037288","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1635809956},"language":"russian","review":"Игра говно не покупайте имбаланс ебаный","timestamp_created":1633786956,"timestamp_updated":1634306034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497547328472137451","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782940","author":{"steamid":"76561198203772452","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1635736261},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo bom do garaio","timestamp_created":1633786893,"timestamp_updated":1633786893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782864","author":{"steamid":"76561198375353831","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":77384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66433,"last_played":1658657845},"language":"schinese","review":"我要和迈叔做爱","timestamp_created":1633786809,"timestamp_updated":1633786809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597701132297515869","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782825","author":{"steamid":"76561198967797782","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":32303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16750,"last_played":1646884424},"language":"english","review":"makes me want to throw myself onto a highway sometimes but i love it","timestamp_created":1633786763,"timestamp_updated":1633786763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782749","author":{"steamid":"76561198162325046","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2755,"playtime_at_review":25298,"last_played":1660466252},"language":"schinese","review":"逛gai游戏罢了","timestamp_created":1633786661,"timestamp_updated":1633786661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782735","author":{"steamid":"76561198802184234","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1656450872},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito Muito Bom","timestamp_created":1633786647,"timestamp_updated":1633786647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782091","author":{"steamid":"76561198071520473","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2245,"last_played":1642865092},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1633785830,"timestamp_updated":1633785830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100782073","author":{"steamid":"76561198175976629","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16932,"last_played":1655909445},"language":"russian","review":"Игра довольно-таки веселая даже если не с кем играть.\nЯ рекомендую эту игру, играйте и не жалейте себя и свое время.\nВ игре есть нормальная система наказания читеров и игроков специально сливающих катку.

Но и тут все не однозначно поскольку в игре есть баланс! Новеньким игрокам никогда не поставят опытного или турнирного мана и вы ничего с этим не сделаете. Весь опыт и удовольствие от игры будет только положительным.\nВ игре вообще почти нет проблем.\nВ игре не встречаются баги. Такие баги, как получения удара от убийцы находясь от того в метрах 6-10, неработающие квесты и награды за их выполнение, вечно лагающие карты не зависимо от качества вашего интернета, это все бредни хейтеров.\nНовая система рангов с обновлением Hellraiser по началу казалась на удивление хорошей и 13 числа мы увидели настоящий прорыв в ранговой системе!\nДелать сброс ранга целенаправленным каждый месяц на начальный - это лучшее что могли придумать.

There's three basic types of toxicity.\n\nNew players who are uninformed (not your fault) who do things the community considers bad manners.\nExperienced perfectionists.\nPeople who enjoy other's suffering.\n\nHigher learning curve than some expect.\n\nLearning survivor and killer perks is important regardless of what you main.\nCommon tactics to avoid getting downed or looped.\nPrioritization/situational awareness. Where is everyone, what are they doing, what should you be doing?.\nCommunity slang.\n\nMatchmaking leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nInexperienced paired with experienced... but in a \"one gets dunked on\" arrangement, not teaching.\nSometimes (often) seems to be under the influence when making lobbies.\nwait.... ...... .............. .......................................... ....... times............................. ....... ............. ........ .... .....\n\nHOWEVER, there's some pretty nifty things....\n\nDLC characters can be unlocked through gameplay.\n\nIt takes 9000 iridescent shards, which are gained through leveling one's account up.\nThe Shrine of Secrets changes every week, and potentially has perks from DLC characters available.\nFolks who can't afford DLC can still get the characters & perks.\n\nFriends not required but make experience better.\n\nNo in-game voice chat for survivors, some use Discord instead.\nIn-game emotes used to communicate, as well as crouching.\nRelatively easy to find new friends if you're nice, most people who play survivor want full SWF crews.\n\nReplayable\n\nWide variety of maps, characters, perks.\nOpportunity for a wide variety of play styles.\nPrivate or public matches for whatever your purpose, including goofing off.\n\nLots of shenanigans\n\nGet waterboarded by puke\nThrow a flashlight rave\nThiccness knows no morals or gender\n\nOverall, I'd recommend. Probably about a 8.5/10. Have not pooped my pants due to this game but have come close a time or two. Thanks, Ghost Face.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE (May 28 2021):\n\nNew content is still being released!\n\nMore mechanics are being added to the game, which changes how survivors play. Ex: Zombies being added in the R.E. chapter (in Player Test Build at the time of this update).\nSome cosmetics can be purchased with shards, unlocked through game-play, or redeemed via codes released by BHVR.\nPeriodic events. Currently, there's an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are powered.\n\nMap and graphical updates.\n\nThe game generally looks a lot better now.\nMultiple variants of maps.\nMaps tend to be smaller now, which can be both good and bad. Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks.\n\nThe Rift\n\nA battle pass has been added to the game.\nAuric cells (paid currency) are part of the reward system- if you complete the Rift you actually get your money back!\nPlayers are rewarded with cosmetics, lore (The Archives), and various forms of in-game currency.\nChallenges from the Rift add an extra layer of fun (or psychological distress and anguish) to matches.\n\nMatchmaking... Again\n\nQueue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon/evening.\nI'm a filthy survivor main heathen, so I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon/evening.\nStill occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair, but it's better than it used to be.\nThere's a lot more player consistency in terms of skill, but also toxicity, in higher ranks.\nIf you want to meme and enjoy, the higher ranks tend to be very serious...\n\nHIT BOXES MAKE ME CRY.\n\nThis is just a game.\nPlease, self... It's just a game...\nSobbing intensifies.\nIn all seriousness though, the hit boxes need some improvement. Lag, frame-perfect timing, and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face.\nI may be a survivor main, but if a Huntress nails me across the map, I'm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer's behalf if it doesn't register.\n\nWhat accessibility options?\n\nChanging the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences.\nAn option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful. A fade-in, solid color, then fade-out screen aura might be a good option for this? It would preserve visual information without giving an 'unfair advantage' to players.\nFor the record, players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else. If your primary concern is giving players an 'unfair advantage,' please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set-back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field.\n\nI'd say that the changes boost my rating to a 9/10, but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2/10.\n\nTo BHVR, if they ever stumble their way into this review:\nThe new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes. Accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated and it would increase audience reach and profitability. Keep up the good work.","timestamp_created":1633777633,"timestamp_updated":1633777633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100775710","author":{"steamid":"76561199058045777","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14770,"last_played":1656769851},"language":"schinese","review":"手电使用改装百科，维修改装工具大全，刀人不会被抓攻略，SM匹配机制大哥大","timestamp_created":1633777410,"timestamp_updated":1633777410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100775595","author":{"steamid":"76561199068970452","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":718,"last_played":1654364281},"language":"thai","review":"เกมดี","timestamp_created":1633777217,"timestamp_updated":1633777217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100775378","author":{"steamid":"76561198874764132","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1142,"last_played":1634924101},"language":"english","review":"This game is awful, it's killer sided game.

Ai você junta outros 3 amigos e fala \"pô, vencemo na vida\", para logo em seguida tomar um assassino que joga do jeito mais boring imaginável, como o povo campando, para ser carregado pelo NOED depois.\n\nSe você for assassino, se prepara para 415343151 loops infinitos e god pallets, aonde ou você usa perks de desacelerar geradores ou todos os geradores são feitos em meros segundos. Nisso, você ainda vai presenciar a diversão que é o meta dos mesmos 4 perks de sobreviventes que só existem para te encher o saco, como dead hard e decisive strike, que TODO MUNDO usa, uma verdadeira mentalidade coletiva. Para, no final, ter 4 pessoas no portão clickando a lanterna na sua cara e depois te escaralhando no chat pós-jogo.\n\nMesmo com esses problemas, o jogo é bom? a resposta é: acho bom, de verdade. Tem muita variedade de assassinos e sobreviventes, assim como perks que mudam bastante o jogo, só não ficar estacionado nos mesmos perks de sempre que dá para se divertir.\n\nConclusão: Tem paciência o bastante para aguentar toxicidade? vai com tudo.","timestamp_created":1633753838,"timestamp_updated":1633754015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100762383","author":{"steamid":"76561199079004090","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18047,"last_played":1637413964},"language":"english","review":"Good.","timestamp_created":1633753385,"timestamp_updated":1633753385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100762094","author":{"steamid":"76561198421801702","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":23814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":550,"playtime_at_review":23584,"last_played":1660392541},"language":"schinese","review":"不要买了，这游戏平衡瞎做不说，还要闪退，还要死机。我准备退游了","timestamp_created":1633752819,"timestamp_updated":1659857864,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100761754","author":{"steamid":"76561199209653278","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":135358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5922,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1660593629},"language":"schinese","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1633752130,"timestamp_updated":1633752130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501231491565704346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100761400","author":{"steamid":"76561199115654715","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":173,"playtime_at_review":4287,"last_played":1660523753},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom!
