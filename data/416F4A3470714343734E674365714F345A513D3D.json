war ein gutes spiel aber die Entwickler bringen bei jedem update nur vorteile für den möreder früher oder später macht das spiel keinen spaß mehr weil sehr viele killer campen. Es ist eine gute idee so ein spiel zu erstellen es macht spaß keine frage doch bei manchen sachen versteh ich die welt nicht mehr. es kann doch nicht sein das man wenn man am hacken hängt vorher die falle nicht entschärfen kann. genau so das es zu viele hacken gibt wenn der mörder einmal das Purg hat wo er den festen grief hat dann kann der mörder dich über die halbe map tragen ohne das man eine chance hat sich zu befreien. Das spiel hat hohes potenzial aber ist meiner meinung nach noch sehr ausbaufehig. Das Hallowen DLC ist Interesant aber wenn man sich alles gut durchliest merkt man das auch das unfair aufgeteilt ist die Killer bekommen einen killer der drei Phasen hat wo er in der letzten Pfase One hittet und die Klasse die Entkommen muss bekommt einen Charakter ( den man wie ich bettonenn muss erst mal auf 40 oder 50 hoch spielen muss um die Purges zu nutzen die wirklich sinvoll sind) die schwester von dem killer ist eine gute idee aber das hilft dem Team überhaupt nicht weil sie nur Purgs für sich selber hat. Das bedeutet das der einzige Conter so zu sagen die Schwester ist von dem Karakter den man dann aber erst mal in umgerechnet 100 spielstunden auf level 40 spielen muss der dann nur sich selber und nicht dem Team helfen kann das ist wirklich traurig ich hoffe die nächsten Paches sind besser sonst wird das spiel immer einseitiger für den killer. Was ich aber an einer sdtelle lobend erwähnen darf ist das sie das lobby system wirklich verbessert haben fürher hat man fast ne halbe stunde einen lobby gesucht wenn man 3 freunde dabei hatten das ist heute nicht mehr so. Ich hoffe sie können mit der kritik umgehen und sehen das genau so weil das spiel geht aufdauer echt daran kaputt sehe ich so.

But they usually consist of killer campers but I'm starting to see not as many as when I first started playing the game a couple months ago. Overall, it's actually a fun game to play with friends and solo. I would recommend this game to you if you like going for challenges since each killer is unique in their own way. Another warning though would be lag, just like any other game and some glitches that may happen. A glitch I've encountered more than once would be when I'm getting something out of a chest and the item is in my hand but I cannot use it as if the game didn't register me grabbing it. (Usually happens with a toolbox or medkit from my experience). \nSo, yes, I recommend this game if you are into challenges, getting chased, and if you are into Michael Myers (since he is the newest killer from the Halloween DLC if you somehow didn't know that by now.) The game is filled with surprises and always kinda encourages you to take risks with helping others or trying out new items, offerings, and/or perks. \nHope this review has been at least a little bit helpful on helping you decide on if you want to buy this game and try it out or not! Have fun and good luck on winning as a survivor or killer! \n\n(Piece of advice (Killer): If you get the game and play as any one of the killers, no matter which one, PLEASE DO NOT CAMP. Also, if it ends up just being you and one other person in the game and it's a ranked game, help the other (the survivor) out because not only is it a nice thing to do but if you are a killer and just catch and kill the person, you'll go down in your rank from lack of bloodpoints. Just a bit of advice for you. \n\nPiece of advice (Survivor): Take chances such as saving others from a hook or if you even want to take a bigger risk, distract the killer from someone else. Or if you are on a generator and mess up a skill check, causing it to kinda explode on you, stay on it. Don't hide for too long, don't always bring in an item because if you die in the game, you lose it. Especially if it's a really good item. Try to always bring in your best perk(s) as well. The more you do in the game (by taking risks) the more bloodpoints you'll get and the higher in rank you'll get. Plus, it'll teach you how to get away from the killers and their tricks.)\n\nTry to go inbetween of playing as killer and survivor because if you play as the killers you'll learn more about them and it'll help you learn ways of getting away from them easier and making it easier to survive when you play as survivor.

Il compito di queste pecore è di attivare quattro generatori e aprire il portone per poter fuggire. Quando sei di queste hai la visuale in terza persona e quando s'avvicina il predatore senti il cuore che aumenta di battito tanto quanto più si avvicina il killer ( a parte alcuni che non puoi sentirli subito ma solo vederli), il lupo cattivo ha la visuale in prima persona il che rende più difficile individuare le pecore, inoltre ognuno di essi ha abilità diverse (lo spettro diventa invisibile, il trapper piazza trappole, l'infermiera si teletrasporta, il mandriano ti oneshotta con la motosega e myers ti stalkera).\n\n- Le mappe: sono poche ma belle, tuttavia ritengo che in alcuni punti bisognerebbe mettere più assi o mura per rendere la vita più difficile al killer.\n\n- I killer : Myers (o come si chiama) è troppo OP, dopo averti stalkerato ti butta giù in un colpo, (normalmente un killer con l'attacco base non ci riesce), per quanto riguarda gli altri ognuno è sgravo se usato correttamente.\n\n- Le competenze : Ogni killer o sopravvissuto può essere equipaggiato con oggetti che prendi con i punti fatti in partita e con competenze che anch'esse prendi nel medesimo modo. Queste ultime aiutano molto e secondo me visto che già il killer è OP di suo dovrebbero mettergli competenze un po' meno sgrave. (Magari sono solo io nabbo per questo la vedo cosi).\n\n- Il matchmaking : Qua ci ho cristonato sopra, le partite le trova subito, ma le squadre... non sono bilanciate, sono  totalmente casuali. Puoi essere un killer di rank 20 e trovarti contro sopravvissuti con le peggio skill/competenze  di rank 1 e viceversa da sopravvissuto puoi trovare i peggio killer.\n\n- Gli host: Poichè le partite sono hostate dai killer, se lagga l'intera sessione andrà a scatti ed è possibile che si disconnetta dalla partita. Nel peggiore dei casi scendi di rank e vieni fatto fuori perchè non riesci a scappare da quanto scatta.\n\nIn conclusione dico che è un gioco simpatico da prendere durante gli sconti per poi giocarci con amici, mette la giusta tensione quando sei sopravvissuto poichè ti senti una preda e ovviamente quando sei predatore ti diverti a sgozzare le persone ☺.\n\nVOTO: 7/10","timestamp_created":1479129052,"timestamp_updated":1479155336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26599177","author":{"steamid":"76561198215119920","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":36331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17710,"last_played":1658628636},"language":"english","review":"Game has vastly improved since launch, with nearly all the kinks out of the way. The game is still unbalanced in the survivors favor at high ranks, while the killer has no problem killing absolutely everyone at low ranks. I couldn't suggest a fix for that, but it's better than how it used to be when Meyers came out and killers reigned supreme. \n\nI wish people wouldn't call me a hacker for having less than 300 hours and having legacy, as though time played has some correlation to when you played, but that's just another way to show the toxic community. I'm a killer main, and nothing warms my heart more than getting survivors that will actually talk at the end of the match instead of claiming that I'm a shit killer because they died.\n\nEven with the toxic community though, it's a fun game. Find a killer you like, and play them. Find a survivor you think looks cool, and main them. You'll get everyone's perks eventually through shrine and just leveling them. Leveling is much easier now that survivor pudding and party streamers exist, and BBQ & Chili is a staple on every killer for those sweet sweet points. \n\nI used to not reccommend the game, but now I'd say it's worth a shot. It goes on sale pretty often for 10 bucks, and I'd bet my ass that there's a Halloween discount, so grab it when it's convenient and give it a shot. Just prepare for the harsh learning curve ahead of you.\n\nIf you use NOED or DS, you deserve to never play the game again.","timestamp_created":1479128367,"timestamp_updated":1538877142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26598892","author":{"steamid":"76561198196759101","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":12463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1653924890},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра про маньяка, но с множеством багов.

Which makes this game more of a grindfest than anything else and that annoys me because I have a group of friends i use to play this with but because it was so grindy they all just stopped playing and when they were playing they would never wanna play custom matches because they didnt get any points to grind up. \n\nOverall i think the game is pretty fun and worth the money but if you are a new player a fair warning: YOU ARE GONNA NEED TO GRIND ALOT.
