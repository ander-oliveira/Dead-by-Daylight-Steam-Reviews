If you want to know why? Then please read the rest.\n\n(also when you're reading this I'm under the impression that you've seen game-play and have a rough understanding of the mechanics, so for the most part I'm going to talk about the simple parts of the game the vast majority will experience and what I think is good/bad about them)\n\nside (SIDE) note: This review is less of a debate/fact of the matter, and 100% opinion so feel free to browse around if you disagree or don't feel the same about the topic.\n\nWhy should you get this game?:\nThe game itself (or in concept) is unique and quite interesting, not many games have done something like this before. Considering many games have copied the idea that dead by daylight made popular. Maybe BHVR wasn't the first to draw their gun in the \"killer vs survivor\" type game, but damn did they shoot straighter than anyone else. The graphics look great (and honestly isn't hard to run on MAX with bad hardware) considering the lowest recommended to run this is a GTX 470. Though most of all, the game-play. This is what you want to know about; is the game-play good? Yes, 100% and no somewhat. I'm here to be honest, not biased. \n\nWhat's good about the game-play?:\n[The GOOD]\na. (The Killer) As the killer; you have a lot of options to toy with, it all comes down to what you pick and what playstyle you want to adopt. Do you like surprising/scaring people with your killer? Pick the Pig or Ghost Face. Want to punish those who try and rescue their fellow survivors? Pick Trapper to stop them from looping you around pallets/windows and saves from hooks, or pick Hag/Demo-gorgon to pop up/teleport to choke points and punish others for saving their teammates. I could go on forever about what play-styles and characters you can adopt because it is pretty lengthy and they've pretty much narrowed down every niche play-style you may want to play. All of this may sound good as is but there's plenty of more to choose from as the killer; for example, the perks! Perks are basically like a selective buff to your killer. They'll make or define how you play with them. Some perks are amazing for certain killers, some are pretty bad. It all boils down to how you like to play and what YOU think will assist in killing the survivors. Good at getting kills but can't find them? Go with perks that give you information/locations on where the survivors are. Bad at getting kills but good at locating survivors? Go with perks that will buff your killer into getting 1 hit K/O's when certain requirements are met or a perk that makes the game take longer so you have more time to slug people and hook them. The possibilities (like I've said) are quite endless, it's just what you tailor to your needs.\n\n[The BAD]\na(b). (The Killer, still) To keep everything unbiased I will be telling you the bad parts of being a killer as well so you can choose to buy this game or not. With the killer (even among your perks and abilities) you'll find yourself in situations where you get out-played, or it becomes harder to fight the survivors [Although as a side-note I do think this is what makes Dead by Daylight great is you're forced to adapt and become a better killer as you climb higher in the ranks and become more challenged with greater players and that only goes to improve how you think and play the game; okay now back to the bad] As a survivor they may not have a lot in terms of pressure to a killer but they can sure make your life hell if they please (but good killers don't have to let this happen; adapt) Players (in an attempt to not get hit/killed in the game.) will perform many actions to avoid the killer since (normally) the killer is slightly faster and also can kill you if you're put on a hook enough times. Survivors will A. Loop you [walking around a building or object making you walk around with them so they can eventually vault a window (faster than you) or drop a pallet (stunning you or blocking you from chasing them] This will often lead to bad situations where you get looped for a long time (wasting time) and allow survivors to repair the gens and escape, or you'll run into situations where you've knocked someone down and other survivors will go for a save by either dropping a pallet over your head OR using a flashlight to blind you as a killer making you drop the person you just picked and allowing them to get away. Though a high enough ranked killer will be able to fight these tactics to a degree by mind-gaming/trapping & building against certain pitfalls of their character. Though this is altogether just as applicable to survivors, someone with more experience might be able to juke you even if you're a solid killer.\n\n[The GOOD]\nb. (The Survivor) As a survivor your goal is to simply not die, repair generators placed around the map. That's it. Once the 5 needed generators have been powered by the survivors in the game this will give power to the exit gates; Once you get over to a gate and open it (and walk through it) you win that game. It is a simple concept at its core but there is a WHOLE lot more that goes into being a survivor and that's what I think is so great about this game. The game itself is as simple or complex as you make it. Sometimes you'll run into a situation where you'll have to be more co-operative or more objective focused (and as discussed in the killer section a) there are hundreds of ways you can suit your play-style; maybe you like a stealthy kind of build that will allow you to sabotage the killer's ability to fight the survivors, You can do that! Maybe you like an aggressive play-style; you can run items and perks to harass the killer and force them into wasting time on you or make your build objective focused so you complete objectives like saving survivors or completing generators faster/easier, you can do this as well! The game itself is whatever you make it!\n\n[The BAD]\nb(a). (The Survivor, still) Now in a game where the Main objective (against you) is to kill you, it's hard to be mad about this but I'll still go into it. Some killers are hard to fight against, and some of the play-styles that people choose to back aren't fun because they've worked hard to understand the play-style and are solid killers making them annoying to fight/play against. Some killers have abilities to hit through walls/torture you and prevent you from doing tasks or making it hard to do so. Some killers are just generally toxic people so after hooking you they'll sit at your hook and camp it waiting for a survivor to come to save you so they can down them as well. This of course is not fun but is something that is fight-able. With more experience in the game, I'm sure you'll understand ways to combat it but it is there nonetheless and I can only leave it up to you to play and see if you enjoy it or not.\n\nWith all being said there are some broken mechanics and some amazing mechanics. A steam review is too much to try and cram every piece of advice into or strategy so there's a lot left out but if you are curious about it; watch a few videos figure out if it's for you but in my honest opinion. Yes, it is 100% worth the money spent.\n\na review by,\nWicked. 2021","timestamp_created":1614316856,"timestamp_updated":1614316856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87457583","author":{"steamid":"76561198990885773","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1658519470},"language":"spanish","review":"tremenda kk","timestamp_created":1614316574,"timestamp_updated":1614316574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87457234","author":{"steamid":"76561198366713584","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":9521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1658986309},"language":"spanish","review":"JAVIER PRINGAO DE LOS COJONES","timestamp_created":1614316101,"timestamp_updated":1622361431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87457203","author":{"steamid":"76561198401687818","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":74420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34094,"last_played":1657242342},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾游戏，没有国服，每天顶着延迟打，开加速器延迟也不低，偶尔因为延迟掉线，然后就是惩罚时间，我越来越对这游戏失望了。屠夫拔线我掉段，人类掉线，我惩罚。这破游戏不建议入手，我建议这个游戏直接steam下架！谢谢！别在这里恶心玩家了。","timestamp_created":1614316044,"timestamp_updated":1614316044,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461231261491775513","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87456471","author":{"steamid":"76561198331675304","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1387,"last_played":1633931165},"language":"spanish","review":"muy buen juego, me encanta, me entretiene demasiado.","timestamp_created":1614314740,"timestamp_updated":1614314740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87456357","author":{"steamid":"76561199020483560","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60196,"last_played":1635429854},"language":"schinese","review":"\n..\n.\n.\n","timestamp_created":1614314571,"timestamp_updated":1614314571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87456227","author":{"steamid":"76561198325810299","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10608,"last_played":1622413177},"language":"english","review":"This game sucks and I hate it with a burning passion","timestamp_created":1614314410,"timestamp_updated":1614314410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87455885","author":{"steamid":"76561198198165433","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4529,"last_played":1618533805},"language":"english","review":"after 7pm PST its a 30 min wait time","timestamp_created":1614313873,"timestamp_updated":1614313873,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87455838","author":{"steamid":"76561198046497329","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1660414513},"language":"english","review":"Fun -
