После того, как онлайн упал, пользователи уронили рейтинги игры, а у разработчиков кончились запасы алкоголя, наркотиков и куртизанок, они смогли невозможное, выкатили патч, который решил большинство проблем в игре, прежде всего, технического характера. Максимум, что я встречаю - редкие подлагивания (возможно траблы с моим оператором) и такие же редкие подвисания при поборе команды (возможно виноват скатившийся онлайн). \n\nИз геймплея: добавили деда и 4 необходимых навыка для борьбы с кемперами-маньяками (да-да, наконец-то ведьмы сосо). Осталась проблема с фейскемперами, но разрабы, вроде, знают о проблемах. \n\nОднако баланс был снова перекошен. Теперь страдают рукожопые маньяки, привыкшие подсасывать у крюков.

Возможно крокодильи слезы маньяков будут услышаны, и разрабы выкатят очередной патч, который на этот раз вызовет бугурт и жопаболь у выживших.\n\nupd2: как и думал, плач манов был услышан и разрабы поэтапно вытащили сразу два кошмара для рандомных выживающих - Кожаное Лицо aka прокаченный Билясик, и Крюгера aka апнутый до безумия Коля-Колоколя. Крюгер кста довольно прикольный, хотя анальный зуд вызывал почти неделю у 20 рангов, да такой, что уже на вторую неделю его существования разрабы быстро накатали план нерфа. Главное фишка его в том, что за него нереально кемпить (поэтому топ-про-маны уже не играют за него) и можно тоннами вывозить очки альтруизма, играя за выжившего.

New killers, New maps, New Survivors etc.\nThen there are two things the Devs really cant do much about:\n1. Camping killers, Basically it's the killers job to get a survivor on a hook and then the survivor will slowly die, but you can be saved by your fellow survivors (and they generally try to save you) UNLESS the killer will just stand right infront of you and wait till you pass 'to the other side'. Or they partol the area way to close to the hook (mostly done by newer killers i think).\n2. When you're a killer and you're actually any good, you're gonna get a sh*tload of hate, salt, rage, toxic coming your way. But I guess you need to deal with that or, the best thing in my opinion, just ignore it and have fun hunting.\nThat said, I think the game is lots of fun and, especially when you're new, it will get your heart pumping.

Dead By Daylight has been my go-to game for the past 2 years. With the variety of killers and playstyles, it's overly addicting. With the constant updates and consistent addition to the killer roster and Perks list, no longer is it Glitch by Daylight. The bugs are mostly fixed, loading times have stabilized, the game works as it is intended to, and with more and more killers each \"Chapter.\"\n\nYou can already see how to play in other reviews so  to put it simply it is an adrenaline rush that I can't get enough of. And if you play with some friends over Discord, it gets even better.\n\nHell I'm probably going to go play it again now.\n\n[1-7-17]\nThe gameplay is great, but get ready for load screens. Sometimes when you attempt to \"Join a Lobby,\" the game leaves you in a Loading Loop for minutes on end. I've left it running for around 15 minutes before and still be loading, though tbf it generally exits to the main menu after awhile. While there are buttons for \"Back [esc]\" left in the top left corner for use in just such a time, they prove to be utterly futile and redundant as no matter how many times I press [esc] or the \"Back\" text, it does nothing more than make an input sound to show that yes, it sees I'm attempting to use that feature but no, it isn't working. \nI've resorted to getting out the Task Manager just to close the game so that i can turn it back on, go through the menu and \"Join a Lobby\" once again. This generally happens 2-3 times before I actually get connected, but once I'm connected it usually connects fine for a few rounds before I have to close it out again.\n\nTLDR: Great game when it works, but you'll prolly have to close it a few times before it actually connects you to a game.

I only wish there would be a bit more consistent communication from developers regarding issues such as hackers, balance, and future planning, but I understand why transparency may not always be feasible.\n\nOverall, the game is a bit pricey, especially with all the DLC's, but the amount of content and entertainment time I receive from these DLC's and the game itself is worth it to me.

The match-making system is completely broken, there are numerous bugs that have been in the game since launch, new updates have created numerous exploits, each update seems to nerf Killers, and the most recent Hag DLC gave everyone a new weakling killer no one plays (and includes a map I've seen multiple streamers call a \"survivor's dream map\").\n\nBut the most game-breaking addition to the game, however, was the devs adding matches where four survivors can 'play with friends' and use voice chat to coordinate across the map against the killer. This confers such a huge disadvantage against the Killer that the only current advice is \"if you think it is a SWF (Surviving with friends) group, disconnect from the matchmaking lobby by unplugging your internet\". Apparently the devs said the game was never designed for survivors to communicate in this way and it shows.\n\nAlso, if you think this game will maintain any of the atmosphere of horror, you'd be wrong - especially the endgame. Imagine being Michael Myers and carrying a stabbed survivor to a hook only to have the other three survivors forming a defensive line to block you until the survivor you are carrying breaks free. Scary right? Really gives the impression Michael is an unstoppable force of evil right? Now imagine the endgame where suvivors are so overpowered that they decide when to 'give' you hits on them as they escape the map. Captures the slasher-movie vibe right? Now imagine Killers who actually 'work' with survivors to farm points because they know they won't get legitimate kills but want to get something for their time. It's a joke at this point.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, watch any popular Twitch streamer play survivor and you'll see how ridiculous the game has become. Too bad too, it was better at launch than it is today.\n\nOriginal review was from when the game released.\n---This is basic 4 survivors versus 1 killer multiplayer. Survivors must hide from killer long enough to power up 5 generators so escape gates will open. Killer must hunt, cripple and then hang survivors from sacrificial hooks before they escape.\n\nIt's a fun PvP horror game for $20 (as of 08/29/16) and you'll get many hours of play out of it.","timestamp_created":1483756730,"timestamp_updated":1483757276,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591692805290222168","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29076139","author":{"steamid":"76561198318678243","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":150071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108294,"last_played":1633028985},"language":"english","review":"Devs, theres a game in your bug!","timestamp_created":1483755704,"timestamp_updated":1510664077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29075976","author":{"steamid":"76561198059082081","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":72141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47817,"last_played":1593966632},"language":"brazilian","review":"Top","timestamp_created":1483755205,"timestamp_updated":1574793930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29075897","author":{"steamid":"76561198025009610","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":10192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5454,"last_played":1595132942},"language":"english","review":"I truly love the game but cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone in its current state.

The devs have it hard.  In low tier killers are broken but in high tier they are too weak.  The number of killers and their diversity also make it hard to balance because there is no \"expected\" way to play survivors.  Certain strategies are not viable vs certain killers... hope everyone has the right perks for their random encounters :D\n\nPro's\n- fun with conditions\n- teamwork and coordination essential\n- challenging\n- relatively short games\n- strategies (more and more impossible to figure out as more killers and perks are released.\n- unpredicability, every game will be very different\n\nCon's\n- less and less of a horror game\n- killers are over powered if they have ever played where's waldo\n- being the first person killed\n- HUGE, STEEP learning curve for survivors (If you start this game expect to die the first 20-30 games you play often within a few minutes of play.  You will constantly make mistakes that will get you killed early which will feed your frustration as you lose over and over with little feedback on what you're doing wrong but if you get gud then you will survive low tear killers without being seen)\n- killers who decide to camp (clarification this only sucks for the person being camped, because essentially they don't get to play that game, or if you have a daily challenge that requires you to save or heal people.  Technically this is the best thing that can happen for survivors as a whole, if only it was fun to abandon your friends...)\n- Survivors killing every hook while you are too low level to have perks that help you deal with a lack of hooks (This has been taken to the opposite extreme sabo perk is all but useless now due to an increased number of hooks on smaller maps, instead of giving a more balanced solution.)\n- painful daily challenges that somtimes are literally impossible unless you have a high level killer/have once off items... hope you pull it off this match\n- LAG, annoying for killer, game breaking for survivors.  If you have lag issues DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE.\n- Salty players who can't take a hit for the team and struggle while everyone gets generators.\n- The realization that if you aren't feeling like a duche while playing it you willl probably lose.\n\nTo clarify I play both survivor and killer.  4/5 games as the killer I get 4 executes. I've only completely lost 1 game and in most games (as survivor or killer) only 1 survivor gets out alive from my experience if any do.\n\nWhy I just can't recommend the game and its inherent problems that can't be fixed.\n I've come and gone from this game many times but recently I've been thinking about the game and why I don't like it from a non-player view.  There are several issues with this game but the biggest struggle with this game, in my oppinion, is the learning curves.  The issue arrises with the fact that the survivor learning curve is very steep for several reasons.  A great survivor will never been seen making the game annoying and bad for killers so survivors need to constantly be nerfed to avoid this which makes new survivors struggle more and more.  Killers need to be Very strong to deal with high level survivors.  Do you see the vicious cycle?\n\nNow lets talk about \"Camping\" this ruins \"A\" survivors game.  It essentially says you don't get to play.  Now as soon as the survivors know the killer is a camper the good strategy is to let them die and finish 3+ gens while he is on the hook.  Having said that you feel like a dush and its not fun.  Devs know this and they want everyone to have fun so they have to nerf this but you can't... not really anyway the only solution is to make it a bad strategy but doing so gives the survivors buffs for the most part.  This is why survivors can complete gens quickly add the fact that every minute the game lasts it becomes easier for killers, less palets to go around.\n\nThe devs of this game have it really really hard because you can't balance for high level and low level game play, like any other game, but for this game the difference between these 2 types of players is so high that the game just can't be balanced until it becomes more homogenous.  Hopefully the new tutorial will help but that is asking a lot.  Also I know you need to release new content to keep people interested but maybe just add maps for the next bit while everything gets figured out.","timestamp_created":1483741496,"timestamp_updated":1522351645,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4850444495677948","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29071691","author":{"steamid":"76561198121859446","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":62888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1660092114},"language":"english","review":"Constantly freezes during the simplest things (finding lobby, load screen).

Unless you're Dwight. He spends his time hanging around screaming in pain and dying within the first minute.\n\nThis game is quite honestly one of my favorite co-op experiences. The rush of being chased by one of the six available killers is amazing, and the joy of bamboozling said blind morons is even better.\n\nPlaying as a killer is a ton of fun, unless you camp like a piece of garbage and everyone let's you know how much they dislike you after the end of the game. But that's okay! Because they are all morons and they should know that it's easy to cheese camping noob killers. You litterally just take one hit AND THEN take your friend off the hook. I know.

Meaning you have the disadvantage within the first second of playing. It can get pretty ridiculous. Especially when people fire up their ancient Aztec routers to host these games.\n\nAll in all, it's one of my favorite games, it's a ton of fun to play with friends or without. Don't watch the popular youtubers play it because they're mostly noobs that are doing annoying roleplay crap. Watch someone that takes the game seriously. Like anybody except the popular youtubers. Anybody.\nConnecting to games can take years if you count by the way you feel but once you're in a game its tons of fun. The survivor community is awesome. Everyone will risk their life trying to save you. It's great. A lot of killers are camping noobs and suck giant donkey hair balls. But most are top class killers and some will even take the time to faf about with you and wave good bye as you skip to my lou towards your escape.\n\nBuy the game, don't bother with the dlc.

Also pick up some headsets with surround sound, trust me it helps for both killer and survivor.","timestamp_created":1483739846,"timestamp_updated":1483739846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29071196","author":{"steamid":"76561198303031349","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":18624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7541,"last_played":1597412899},"language":"czech","review":"Je trochu poslední době zabugovaná ale je pořád pro mně nejlepší hra .","timestamp_created":1483739201,"timestamp_updated":1504366389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29070773","author":{"steamid":"76561198003920300","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3448,"last_played":1597967089},"language":"english","review":"I paid for this game and I wish, that I did not.\n\n1) It is not a first release, they have few DLC's already, but the game  is FULL WITH BUGS!  Some abiblities may cause your character (e.g. Nurse's Blink) to stuck into textures, and fall underground for eternity. Some actions do not work as they were supposed to be, instead of grabbing the victim, killer just hit it or hit already hooked victim, etc.\n\n2) VERY UNSTABLE MATCHMAKING!!!\nIt is almost always \"Failed to connect the game\" , when you try to find a game. And it is not the worst. After few \"Failed to connect the game\" errors, the game simply crashes and stop reacting to anything, with a black screen of download. So you have to restart the game. \nJust for you know, if I want to play as a survivor I have to restart the game 3-7 times, to be able find a game!\n\n3)VERY UNSTABLE CONNECTION!!!\nSometimes you are happy, that after few restarts you have finally found a game. So you wait, wait some more time and again some more time, luckily it is ready and your character is on a screen. And then, guess what? \nYou appear ALONE on map. 1vs1 killer and victim. All other players \"have disconnected\".  \nTo ones, who do not know the game mechanics , you have to activate at least 2 generators in order to hatch (dark lock) appear (it is almost impossible to win or do something, because power of player roles are too unequal and it supposed to be 4 survivors instead of 1) . \nSometimes it freezes, sometimes players disconnect right away. Eh!!!\n\nI do reccomend you not to buy this game, cause dev's are intrested in making DLC's (green\\cash\\bucks\\chips\\dough\\gravy\\loot\\pesos) instead of fixing goddamn problems.\nOh, I wish I had a chance to get my money back...\nDo not make my mistake.","timestamp_created":1483738084,"timestamp_updated":1483738084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29070737","author":{"steamid":"76561198224892224","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1654305034},"language":"russian","review":"игра топчик,нужно больше маньяков с фильмов,будет огонь!!!\n","timestamp_created":1483737998,"timestamp_updated":1483737998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46802818775177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29070665","author":{"steamid":"76561198056811804","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":731,"last_played":1546392566},"language":"brazilian","review":"campping simulator and best loading bug 10/10","timestamp_created":1483737819,"timestamp_updated":1483737819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570103168487548828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29070515","author":{"steamid":"76561198122263062","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3974,"last_played":1510066160},"language":"italian","review":"non so che dire ...... questo gioco mi piace tanto ma con l'ultima patch (aggiornamento) hanno risolto molti bug ma ne hanno creati altri tipo che basta un albero per non sentire un sopravissuto FERITO !!!!o pure se sei dietro un muro non si sente se stanno facendo i generatori !!! roba assurda RISOLVERE SUBITO !","timestamp_created":1483737413,"timestamp_updated":1487187238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42IbputkCc8vybg=="}
