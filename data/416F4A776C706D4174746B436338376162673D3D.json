So i guess....I'll recommend it?? But it just wasn't for me because of one simple yet deal-braking problem:\n\nXBOX ONE CONTROLLER ISSUE. I had to unfortunately get a refund on this game because it refuses to work with my XBOX ONE Controller. I have looked this up on Steam and a dev mentioned something about it being a Microsoft problem and/or that the issues been fixed with a game update...but this was dated back sometime in 2015 lol Apparently it HASN'T been resolved, at least not on my end. I am also aware that whatever bug this is also happens on some other games like Ori, but sorry, this is the first time I've experienced this unresponsive controller bug. Controller works fine during gameplay, but unresponsive when in the menus. Microsoft issue or not, I can't play a game that won't properly acknowledge my controller. Also, I feel this SHOULD be noted and warned in the game description somewhere. Before I get yelled at, I play *most* games on my 60inch TV from the sofa. So yeah...this isn't a \"OMG I CAN'T PLAY MOUSE/KEYBOARD GAMES WAAAAAAHHH!!!\" complaint, no LOL\n\nPositives: The idea of this game is what lured me in. The fact that some other player out there is hunting me, or I can chose to be a killer myself n see how demented my head really is, was...tempting to me XD. I also liked the sense of fear I got being thrown into some completely random place with other survivors being left to figure out where to go, what to do, and how to prevent being caught. It gets the heart racing! SO I respect the devs for that and the passion they seem to have for this project. Eh, graphics aren't too bad either. Gets the job of immersion done.\n\nOverall: If you like horror thrills and got no problem using mouse/keyboard or use a controller other than Xbox One, I would say this game is worth a try. \n\n","timestamp_created":1483630968,"timestamp_updated":1483630968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29036803","author":{"steamid":"76561198096512868","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":36829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36359,"last_played":1657217007},"language":"english","review":"I have 600 hours as of writing this review. \n\nWith the new emblem system, I just can't be arsed anymore.\n\nThis game started off extremely well, infact it was the best assymetrical game of its time....until looping started.\nHaving played both sides, it is so easy to loop as a survivor, and killer? It's so fucking bullshit. It's nigh impossible to have fun as a killer when every survivor abuses every trick in the book. I have nothing against DS,DH,SC OR BT. They are perks, you can use them. Simple.\n\nBut after 600 hours, I've had it with the devs' incompetence. No dev is actually good at this game, which is fucking pathetic. They take 5-8 months to fix dumb issues and can never balance something, with every fucking update, something else. Survivors cry because of killers, killers cry because of survivors, it's a general shitfest. \n\nNice work on the emblem system btw. Encourage more camping and more looping, well played Devs.\n\nYou want to play a good assymetrical game? Wait for Last Year to come out.

I know no other game that still has so many bugs/connectivity issues this long after release. The community is by far the most toxic of any game I have played too which really brings it down. Games are no longer fun because as a killer survivor abuse broken game mechanics and team up, not to mention insulting you for any kind of playstyle that does not benefit them. As a survivor the game has gotten a bit stale, loading screen freezes often, if you play on your own you are likely to get put with new people as the matchmaking is broken. Plus connection relies on killer hosts which is often very poor.\n\nThere are just so many issues and my desire to continue playing this game has waned entirely.\n\nRecently have switched to Rocket League with dedicated servers and perfect seamless gameplay.

Игра отличнейшая, задумка классная, но! Все впечатление от игры портят баги и читеры... Поэтому отзыв отрицательный. Опишу все, что видел:\n1. Застревание, при попытке спрыгнуть с холма например, просто застреваешь между камнями.\n2. Лагающие хосты, бежишь и перса постоянно дергает, на 5-6 метров вперед, при чем это заметно не только тебе, но и всем остальным.\n3. Читеры мешают перки маньяков и сурвов...например трапер с бензопилой и чтением аур выживших, естейственно перерезает всех сурвов за пару минут, потом ходит и развешивает по крюкам.\n4. Система подбора вообще отвратная, бывает убийца первого ранга, а сурвы все 20, или наоборот убийца без единого перка 15-20 ранг, а ему суют пачку первых рангов с топовыми перками.\n5. Бывает маньяк ходит и у него видно только голову, пару раз наблюдал такой баг с Майклом Майерсом.\n6. Экран загрузки может висеть бесконечно, приходится закрывать игру принудительно.\n7. Кемперство, маньяк стоит и ждет пока ты сгниешь на крюке.\n8. От репортов никакого толку, что кинул, что не кинул, на них по моему разрабы вообще не смотрят.\nЗа все время игры не исправили ни один из багов, про которые я писал выше, что очень удручает... Но даже при всем этом игра очень атмосферная и крутая, надеюсь разрботчики начнут устранять баги в ближайшем будущем.\nКакая бы ни была крутая игра, проигрывать из-за багов со временем надоест любому.\nЗ.Ы.

I absolutely love it; it is incredibly entertaining. However, if you have major problems with lag, be warned. It is nearly impossible to play with lag due to quick-time events. I also wish they had been more upfront about the fact that you have to buy packs to gain certain content.

There are no work arounds, there are no fixes, and there is no acknowledgement from the Dev's saying \"we are working on it.\" I've yet to get a single game to work when queueing with 4 friends, if I queue with 3 it usually takes roughly 15-20 minutes of sitting in a lobby to find a single game, then the load times are insane. If the killer leaves/DC's while loading, you spend another 15-20 minutes in the lobby. However, if you play Quick Match by yourself, you get an INSTANT game every time.

Joining a game as a Survivor is almost impossible as you will get stuck on waiting screens until you have to force quit the game about 90% of the time, however starting a lobby as a killer usually goes smoothly. Still, this game is *not* ready for production and the developers should know better. If it weren't for that very debilitating bug, I would highly recommend this.\n\nThe gameplay is wonderful and the different strategy between Survivors and Killers is fantastic.
