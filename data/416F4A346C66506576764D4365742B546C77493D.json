Wash rinse repeat.\n- Lack of third person, what's the point of having these unique horror characters if you cant see them and their awesome animations when they slay their prey? The devs will never add this and there's no Workshop support for modders to make it a reality.\n- If enjoyed in the movies how Michael nailed to the wall his victims with his chef knife or how Freddy in the dream world turns into weird creatures and can change to area into a whole new location, well you won't see this in the game. You won't see many of the amazing abilities of characters that you see in the movies.\n- The community is completely shutdown to any new ideas that can improve the game, the community are close minded fanboys that will keep this lackluster game buried from ever improving.\n\nDon't buy this game! it's not the horror all stars game that you imagine it is, it's dull and uninspired.

Dead by Daylight, to its credit, eschews these in favor of real horror--a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakable sense of impending doom. That it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what is truly impressive about it.\n\nDead by Daylight features two teams--four survivors and one killer--and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles: The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors, knock them down, put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to the Entity. The odds are skewed heavily in favor of the invincible killer, and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve-rattling, sweat-inducing, terrifying experience.\n\nAfter queuing into a game with three other survivors, Dead by Daylight puts you in one of several eerie horror environments and tells you, very simply, to fix the generators to escape. When you find the generators, you then need to repair them--a painstakingly slow process, where you hold the left mouse button down while crouching in front of it. If you're alone, repairing the generator can take more than a minute. As you crouch next to the very noisy generator, the game will throw skill-tests at you by way of a rotating bar--if you fail the QTE, the generator will backfire. This creates a noisy explosion, and the killer is visually alerted to the location of the backfire, turning you into a target.\n\nIf the killer does find you (and he probably will) your options are limited. If you have a flashlight you can blind him temporarily, but your best bet is to run away. The killer moves faster than you can run, maintaining the traditional horror movie 'ominous walk', but you can slow him down by leaping through windows, or pushing down pallets to block his path. You want to put as many of these obstacles in between the two of you as possible as you flee for your life.\n\nFortunately for the survivors, a sixth sense mechanic alerts them to the presence of a nearby killer--the closer the killer is, the faster your survivor's heart beats. Unfortunately the sound is obscured by generator revving as you repair it. When 90% repaired, the generator nearly drowns out the heartbeat entirely, forcing you to rely solely on your eyes to see the killer.\n\nWhen you play as the killer, you're able to see all the map's generators at all times, allowing you to patrol them. If any of them are making noise, you know at least one survivor has been working on it, and you can hunt for signs that the others are nearby. Panicked survivors will sprint away, leaving scratches on nearby walls and breaks in the grass, and you can follow these markings to find your prey. Once you find your prey you chop them down, pick them up and put them on a hook, sacrificing them to your god after 60 seconds.\n\nThe scoring system initially encourages players to create exciting game play opportunities by rewarding risky play. Survivors who engage in lengthy, drawn out chases escaping the killer will earn more points for their boldness, and you can rack up the points by rescuing other survivors who have been captured but not yet sacrificed. As a killer you're rewarded for killing more of the survivors, although a single sacrifice is counted as a victory. Inevitably though, this scoring system leads to immersion-breaking actions like exploiting the killer's slow movement past obstacles, as survivors earn huge points by taunting their hunter.\n\nDead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well. As players become more familiar with both roles, the horror dissipates and they begin to play for the competitive element alone. The matchmaking and game play have stayed significantly incredible and it is a fantastic game for friends to work together to accomplish a goal. It is a completely original concept for a game and it is executed incredibly well. I give this game a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1595542903,"timestamp_updated":1595542903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73181010","author":{"steamid":"76561198096309468","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1480,"last_played":1644044383},"language":"english","review":"This game has a lot of issues, but its a great time nonetheless.
