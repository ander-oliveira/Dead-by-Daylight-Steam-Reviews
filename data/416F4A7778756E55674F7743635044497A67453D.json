Dbd has the potential to be good but its ruined by extreme unbalancing in favor of survivors, annoyingly long queue times for killers, a shop system with everything being overpriced af, and tons of content locked behind paywalls. Don't buy this game if you aren't prepared to spend near or over 100 dollars in dlc killers and survivors, spend massive amounts of time grinding to get good enough perks and add ons to be viable, sit on obscenely long match queue times, and after all that rage about how unbalanced the game is when survivors get all 5 gens done in 3 min and you haven't even hooked a single survivor. \n\nOh btw, the insane unbalance of this game affects dlc too.

Specials range from slightly useful to downright useless.\nNever truly feel satisfied, only very stressed.\nSurvivors feel more like annoying flies you're trying to swat than actual helpless people looking to escape.\nPlaying as a survivor is unsatisfying, which is usually why its easier to get a match as a survivor.\nKillers never feel like an actual threat and playing as a killer just feels... artificial and bland.\nMaps get either boring, confusing or both.\nMore stressful than enjoyable.\nSurvivors barely change physically, almost all look like clones.\nPowerups are onetime and either worthless or overpowered.\nNo single player or bots. Once the game dies, it's not coming back.\nDevelopers have an EA mentality of marketing.\n\nBut there are some good things, but none are really about gameplay.\n\nPros:\nKillers are very unique and have amazing backstories.\nCosmetics, despite being pay to obtain, are impressive.\nKillers make for excellent drawing and story material.\nFandom is more civilized than the community (that's telling)\n\nAll in all, the game has potential and the Killers are what bring color and life to the game (not just red). The gaming community is as toxic as Chernobyl but since the game is so bland and frustrating, just join the fandom and don't get the game.","timestamp_created":1563477012,"timestamp_updated":1563477012,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54167012","author":{"steamid":"76561198855899817","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":114,"last_played":1541916592},"language":"english","review":"DEAD BY DAYLIGHT is the best game i have ever seen with unique game mechanics combined team work for survivors but planned strategy for killer the game has unique and realistic gameplay to offer and the one good thing about game is that it is very fun to play with friends hope this game get success and replace  BR's from throne","timestamp_created":1563475788,"timestamp_updated":1563475788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54166809","author":{"steamid":"76561198977522286","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1563474811},"language":"russian","review":"Топ игра) Советую","timestamp_created":1563474890,"timestamp_updated":1563474890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54166496","author":{"steamid":"76561198962855827","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":408,"last_played":1636201279},"language":"russian","review":"Топ игра !

The amount of killers and survivors with perks and add ons makes it the most diverse horror game i've played. There are so many different styles to play! You can sneak around the map slowly avoiding the killer or you can just go as aggressive as you can and distract the killer while everyone else completes the objectives. It is an experience that you HAVE to at least try. Getting to the game though is sometimes the hard part. When playing as a survivor finding a game is never too bad. When you play killer however, expect to wait quite a bit longer for a game (because there is only one killer per game) BUT it's worth the wait because in my opinion playing killer is the most fun part of the game! It has a very unique level up system and there is a prestige mechanic so you never run out of items and can try all the characters if you wanted too. Overall this game is awesome, but due to some minor bugs and the lack of more game modes it can get stale for people who aren't fully into it. Still, i highly recommend it to any fan of horror!","timestamp_created":1563468674,"timestamp_updated":1563468674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54165249","author":{"steamid":"76561198842083531","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":34526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1327,"playtime_at_review":6609,"last_played":1660584949},"language":"schinese","review":"烦","timestamp_created":1563467839,"timestamp_updated":1575516554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497737526893615723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54165162","author":{"steamid":"76561198155379763","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":79262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5611,"last_played":1657397634},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo é bom, apesar de que nas partidas os killers são os hosts oque dificulta pra achar partida de killer e as vezes interfere muito no ping dos sobreviventes e de que também a tela de carregamento da partida  pelo menos pra mim buga algumas vezes tendo assim que reiniciar o jogo.","timestamp_created":1563467421,"timestamp_updated":1563467694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54164919","author":{"steamid":"76561198058947408","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":74098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1391,"playtime_at_review":2877,"last_played":1660527761},"language":"english","review":"game sucks i go to bed -rep","timestamp_created":1563466271,"timestamp_updated":1656551833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54164697","author":{"steamid":"76561198056472836","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":396481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":146,"playtime_at_review":92503,"last_played":1660267983},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo Divertido,Mas Altamente Irritante ao mesmo tempo ,dependendo do tipo de pessoas que vc joga, caso sejam pessoas com problemas mentais, vc vai querer desinstalar o jogo na mesma hora\nmas quando você joga com pessoas normais ou joga com amigos é um jogo bastante divertido por sinal ,vai te prender por varias horas.","timestamp_created":1563465369,"timestamp_updated":1563465369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577464818954467773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54164691","author":{"steamid":"76561198885629275","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":113908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1758,"playtime_at_review":39002,"last_played":1660604821},"language":"brazilian","review":"Pretty good  job so far","timestamp_created":1563465339,"timestamp_updated":1563465339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54164398","author":{"steamid":"76561198192719493","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":50878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4940,"last_played":1658828297},"language":"romanian","review":"The worst game, the servers are down and you need 7-10 min to enter in game.

So kann der Killer hin- und herspazieren und aufpassen, dass die nicht geöffnet werden. Die Luke kann man auch nicht mehr öffnen. Somit kann man sich nur noch mit Absicht vom Killer killen lassen oder man wartet, bis der Timer abläuft und stirbt so. Super. Man stirbt meistens also eh immer. Warum spielt man dann noch? Mittlerweile bereue ich es so viel Geld für das Spiel ausgegeben zu haben.","timestamp_created":1563400245,"timestamp_updated":1563400245,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509210944175720215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54152815","author":{"steamid":"76561198006314347","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":4725,"last_played":1660072039},"language":"english","review":"game is okay when you get to play. and that is the problem i spend hours wating for a match and never get a game.","timestamp_created":1563398802,"timestamp_updated":1563398802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54152508","author":{"steamid":"76561198958975035","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21588,"last_played":1640191595},"language":"norwegian","review":"Good game fun to play with friends","timestamp_created":1563397315,"timestamp_updated":1563397315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54152440","author":{"steamid":"76561198839273884","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":74448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1658549328},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo para jogar com os amigos.","timestamp_created":1563397010,"timestamp_updated":1563397010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54152276","author":{"steamid":"76561198318353977","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":11768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3040,"last_played":1648053189},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo maravilhoso, porém, os assassinos são muito fortes e na maioria das vezes é muito dificil fugir deles causando um certo desequilibrio","timestamp_created":1563396187,"timestamp_updated":1563396187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54152137","author":{"steamid":"76561198397706880","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1616870552},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏总体还是很不错的就是匹配时间问题吧希望多出点角色也可自创","timestamp_created":1563395589,"timestamp_updated":1563395589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54152026","author":{"steamid":"76561198367587011","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":13642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4938,"last_played":1653468491},"language":"russian","review":"классная игра если ты получил ее бесплатно","timestamp_created":1563395127,"timestamp_updated":1563395127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54151808","author":{"steamid":"76561198218740720","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":61737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21231,"last_played":1637936931},"language":"english","review":"Game with a lot of bugs and problems.

I have sub minimum requirements on my current PC but was able to at least launch this thing when I first got this item.  After Plague update, Behaviour gave me the \"sucks to be poor, go get a good computer\" and made the game un-launchable even after several hours of research and fixes to no avail.\nDuring my time with this game I experienced so many bugs and issues that took too long to be fixed for me to be content with.  Majority of the community/fanbase is very flavored, I would highly recommend if you suffer from hyponatremia. Matchmaking is atrocious with high ping, connection issues, and stability hiccups being just a common occurence whenever I played with my friends. Balance? Pft, non-existent but that's the core of the game so that's well developed. Gameplay is exciting if you're here for a spooky scary skeleton ambiance but felt hollow personally. I totally love games where my win condition is based upon how well I can hold down a button and occasionally press a second button OR how well I can avoid any confrontation or objectives and let my team lose while I secure a lone victory. As a killer, yeah I just suck but connection issues surely don't help.\n\nTL;DR played the game until updates made it unlaunchable for me. Experienced a lot of issues during my time with this game mainly with connection. Personally not fun and would not recommend to people suffering from high blood pressure or high sodium. \n\nReally wished I used my money to wipe my ass instead of buying this game; I would've felt cleaner in the end at least\n\nEdit: oh those 16 hrs is the time i spent trying to just launch this game. wasted time, Thank you Behaviour","timestamp_created":1563393211,"timestamp_updated":1563393332,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54151307","author":{"steamid":"76561198347459448","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2115,"last_played":1626615107},"language":"turkish","review":"brez Dbd","timestamp_created":1563392007,"timestamp_updated":1580853264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54150989","author":{"steamid":"76561198178988558","num_games_owned":612,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":60851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":744,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1660602922},"language":"english","review":"Recommended for fun but it has annoying bugs","timestamp_created":1563390641,"timestamp_updated":1641639139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54150912","author":{"steamid":"76561198126148897","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":74965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":64946,"last_played":1660130936},"language":"english","review":"im a killer main this game blows but its fun with friends if u have any i do not","timestamp_created":1563390332,"timestamp_updated":1654822981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51822507381439209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxunUgOwCcPDIzgE="}
