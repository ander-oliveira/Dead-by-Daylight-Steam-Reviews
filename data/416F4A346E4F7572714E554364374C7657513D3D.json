Здесь и мясницкие крюки, и починка генераторов, и прятки в кукурузном поле.\nИгр с ассиметричным геймплеем очень не много, а хороших - и того меньше. И этот образец едва успев появиться уже занимает верхнююю строчку в их списке.\n\nПлюсы:\n+ геймплей;\n+ отличная система прокачки;\n+ реиграбельность - ни один матч не похож на предыдущий: рандомно генерируемые карты (задачи, лут, \"погодные\" условия), ваша компания тиммейтов (их стиль игры, их снаряжение, предметы), вы никогда не знаете изначально против какого маньяка играете (против каждого абсолютно разный стиль игры), и за каждого маньяка стиль игры кардинально различается;\n+ оригинальность;\n+ ассиметричный балланс - абсолютно разные ощущения от игры за разные стороны;\n+ саундтрек.\n\nМинусы: их нет. Серьёзно, для игры вышедшей пару часов назад - их нет. Но, чтобы вы не заподозрили меня в необъективности, всё же замечу:\n- матчмейкинг кидает тебя только в твой регион, т.е. играть будешь только с русскими, а это значит, что в основном тиммейты будут тупить и, конечно, никогда вам не помогут, киллеры всегда будут кемперить возле крюка с жертвой, а заполнения лобби вы будете ждать вечность, т.к. эти дауны будут прыгать по лобби в поисках своих даунских друзей в игре, которая не предназначена для игры в пати (пойти с ними в приват интеллект не позволяет).\n- со временем могут надоесть постоянные задания по включению генераторов, нужно что-то ещё (найти ключи от машины и т.д.);\n- периодические баги, глюки;\n- не слишком разнообразная кастомизация\n- отсутствие среди персов блондинки с огромными сиськами.\nНо думаю со временем это всё исправится, так что за минусы не считаю.\n\nКому рекомендую эту игру? Всем.\nВ особенности:\n- любителям второсортных ужастиков - дух и каноны жанра соблюдены безукоризненно;\n- тем у кого есть четверо друзей - бегать впятером в привате, со связью - это отдельно удовольствие и огромное веселье;\n- любителям ассиметричного геймплея - переиграл во все представители этой ниши, и это жемчужина (бросайте унылый депт, л4д и бегом сюда), это как Эволв, только наоборот, с оптимизацией и пока не убитый издателем.\n\n10 чинящих генераторы тиммейтов, пока ты подыхаешь на крюке из 10.\n\nP.S. За считаные дни до релиза выкатили геймплейное видео плагиаторы делающие игру по лицензии \"пятница 13-е\". И этот геймплей крайне, до отупения убог. Но это игра по лицензии и её уже начинают неистово пиарить. Я вас уверяю - не ведитесь.

The main game play loop is enjoyable on both sides. Killers are frightening and scary for survivors to fight against, and surviving is hard and rewarding when you escape.\n\nFor the first 50 hours of the game at least...\n\nLet me preface this that I play killer about 40% of the time and survivor probably 60% of the time. When I queue for survivor it's with at least 1 friend 80% of the time. And let me tell anyone looking for validation in their one side of the game they main that both sides have valid complaints and neither side is balanced. I have gotten to rank 1 on both sides (not that that means skill) and know the pains of both.\n\nThis game suffers from a never ending cycle of poor development and game play changes that continually make the game worse over time. You can tell from playing this game for a longer amount of time that there is no communication between each department working on this game. The artists do a (mostly) good job. The coders are monkeys who somehow manage by a god given miracle to put out something that resembles working every couple of MONTHS. The game balance team obvious play at a low skill level and make \"interesting\" decisions and will constantly put their foot in their mouths (Almo). This is all wrapped up into a surprisingly good community management team that knows how to talk to it's community (unless you're on the forums). But none of them know which way the game is moving and will all say something different.\n\nThis is all because at the end of the day Dead by Daylight struck gold with it's formula and no other startup in the same \"dbd genre\" can get off the ground. This allows for this game to continually get away with 4 different monetization strategies and laziness that end up being consumer unfriendly in every regard.\n\nThis would be all \"ok\" if the game was at least satisfying to play and with good balance. But this game on it's current trajectory will never reach it. Between the refusal to shift up the meta that has existed sense launch and has maybe changed majorly 2 times to my remembrance (That's only 2 major shifts in 5+ years). Mix that with major game breaking bugs that will show up and be in game for 3-6 months or longer and be replaced with others as quickly as they are removed means that this game will never be competitive.\n\nAnd while we are on the topic of competitiveness there is no \"win\" state to either side. The game arbitrarily tells you whether you have done well or not on arbitrary 4 categories. As a survivor you can play extremely well constantly outplaying the killer and the game will end too quick and you will regress in rank. As a killer you can win too quick by killing everyone and lose rank. So making a win state is completely arbitrary and based on how you think you did. This will clash with the other 4 peoples idea of a \"win\" in their mind and end up with conflicts in post game.\n\nLet me give you an examples to illustrate this point:\n\nThe game loads in and the killer is a sweaty spirit player playing against a 3 man swf (survive with friends) and a solo survivor. The solo survivor wants to loot all the chests and meme around bringing them all as a offering to the killer, and the 3 man wants to escape at by any means. The killer wants all 4 kills by any means and to increase their rank. The swf all bring extremely good items and  quickly try to complete the generators (the main goal of survivors). The spirit is good and manages to get a hook by the time the first 2 gens pop and the solo survivor is messing around in the basement. The spirit is able to snowball off of the one survivor messing around and win by slugging in the next 2 minutes ignoring the items from the memer. The spirit is happy as she got 4 kills and depips decreasing their rank. The meming survivor is upset because the killer didn't care, and the 3 man is all upset that they died. The whole surivor team is mad at the spirit for \"being boring and slugging\" and the 3 man is mad at the solo for \"throwing\". The spirit flaunts how they are baby survivors to make them more angry in the post, but is upset to themselves that they depiped.\n\nThis leads to everyone being dissatisfied. And this would be ok if it were a rare occurrence, but it will be your experience 60% of the time.\n\nThis review might have become a bit of a ramble. But it has become a ramble because I love this game so much. I just want to see it improve instead of become worse almost every patch (as is the case for this UI update).\n\nPlease do not buy this game until it gets better. And please behavior make a better product.","timestamp_created":1465939365,"timestamp_updated":1612915619,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23559405","author":{"steamid":"76561198034505650","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":48829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20494,"last_played":1656355389},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo 100% humano, sem IA, ou seja, a cada partida que se joga há uma surpresa, pois aqui a sua índole é testada em campo, seja altruísta ou egoísta, corajoso ou medroso, todos dependem de todos e cada um por si.","timestamp_created":1465939314,"timestamp_updated":1479943683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23559368","author":{"steamid":"76561198048500275","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1203,"last_played":1659165155},"language":"english","review":"Fun game just needs a party mode for online","timestamp_created":1465939178,"timestamp_updated":1465939178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523119747638702393","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23559358","author":{"steamid":"76561198072872582","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1659315162},"language":"english","review":"Love this game, cant wait for the inv system to come so i can play with friends!\n","timestamp_created":1465939142,"timestamp_updated":1465939142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525314688682556152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23559341","author":{"steamid":"76561198058532212","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1022,"last_played":1644911645},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fun by yourself, but you can't bring friends along with you so good luck on that. \nAnd try being the killer, because you can't.

In each of those games you faced other players whilst placing as the bad guy. They were extremely fun, but eventually abandoned by the developers leading to their slow, but brutal deaths. \n\nGame seems extremely one dimensional with gameplay that will grow stale fast. \n\nCan't play with friends in a public match.\n\nMechanics are easily abused.\n\nThere's zero tension in this game - possibly due to its poor animations. There's a heartbeat mechanic that plays when the killer is near you (not even in your line of sight, but just near you.) I don't feel afraid, so this game misses on its biggest mark of being a survival horror.\n\nFor all the qualms of Damned at least it made you feel helpless as a survivor and the tension was real despite the terrible graphics.\n\nIt takes two seconds for the survivor to rescue another survivor from the hook, forcing the serial killer to camp hooked survivors, instead of hunting others.\n\nDay 1: Takes me around 20-30 minutes to find a lobby - not even a game just a lobby. It's ALREADY suffering from a low playerbase, so I can only imagine what the game will be like three months from now.\n\nMy recommendation?
