But the more you play the more you learn how bad this game actually is, bugs occur so often it's unacceptable, perks don't work the way they are supposed to *cough cough* Dead hard! Indoor maps are extremely boring to play on for both killer and survivor. Killers such as deathslinger, trickster, twins, nemesis, freddy, hag and some others are poorly designed (which is a large portion of all the killers) and very boring to go against in chase. The servers suck which is why people complain about bad hits all the time, but the hits are fine, they are bad when connection issues occur and the dedicated servers don't work well. I will not even get into the matchmaking and how bad it is regularly. I am a valid source I would say, I'm not a veteran but I've been playing on Xbox since June 2019 and ended in April 2021 with just over 2k hours, I now have 600 hours here on PC in August. I used to love this game, but ever since they released deathslinger things just kept going downhill more and more, except for Blight hes strong and balanced and fun for both sides. I really wish this game had competition, maybe the devs would actually put a lot of effort into this game and make it better. \nWith all that said, do I recommend this game? Yes, but definitely play with friends and start learning it, but just know what you are getting into.","timestamp_created":1629619754,"timestamp_updated":1629619754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98022718","author":{"steamid":"76561198996568278","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":11928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1692,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1660602162},"language":"russian","review":"топ","timestamp_created":1629619742,"timestamp_updated":1629619742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98022457","author":{"steamid":"76561198968864760","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":19029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4905,"last_played":1650375735},"language":"schinese","review":"一般","timestamp_created":1629619307,"timestamp_updated":1629619307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98021743","author":{"steamid":"76561198974565457","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":188,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":1660309716},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏是好游戏，但是这匹配机制是真的恶心，我一个萌新，天天匹配高段选手，基本毫无游戏体验。","timestamp_created":1629618011,"timestamp_updated":1629618011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98021272","author":{"steamid":"76561199031330460","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14822,"last_played":1659074145},"language":"japanese","review":"God

The game could be more difficult depending on the size of the map also if you cant make bigger maps i would like to see at least 5 survivors instead of 4.","timestamp_created":1629609457,"timestamp_updated":1629609457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98016431","author":{"steamid":"76561198079563685","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":74537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67445,"last_played":1654620433},"language":"english","review":"Game is still ridiculously ass","timestamp_created":1629609047,"timestamp_updated":1642670986,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.453986883163452148","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98016225","author":{"steamid":"76561198079434834","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":50177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25417,"last_played":1658626147},"language":"spanish","review":"esto es una reseña","timestamp_created":1629608708,"timestamp_updated":1629608708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98016138","author":{"steamid":"76561198799424885","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":66,"playtime_at_review":2917,"last_played":1660521720},"language":"english","review":"fun lol","timestamp_created":1629608545,"timestamp_updated":1629608545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98016072","author":{"steamid":"76561199110718650","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1683,"last_played":1656989544},"language":"english","review":"The suspense\n","timestamp_created":1629608426,"timestamp_updated":1629608426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98015966","author":{"steamid":"76561198046263366","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":9704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":862,"last_played":1655081259},"language":"brazilian","review":"que ódio\nme da mais","timestamp_created":1629608236,"timestamp_updated":1629608236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98015363","author":{"steamid":"76561199152990308","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4097,"last_played":1637906458},"language":"english","review":"trash unbalanced broken killers with broken perks devs do not care about the game so many bugs and ping issues game is trash and can be trash because there is really no games to compete with it all the devs care about is making a buck and not fixing the issues with this game the core of the game is really good but it is the things outside of that could be fixed that makes this game a lot of the time unplayable and irritating","timestamp_created":1629607237,"timestamp_updated":1629607237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497382223606109619","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98015310","author":{"steamid":"76561198876239397","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11976,"last_played":1651936001},"language":"tchinese","review":"玩喇","timestamp_created":1629607150,"timestamp_updated":1629607150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98015301","author":{"steamid":"76561198413503794","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":42223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":150,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1660229331},"language":"english","review":"Update: This game makes me sick mentally\n\nPLEASE DO NOT PLAY IF YOU HAVE DEPRESSION.\n\n\nThis game is not like any ordinary game.

You are fucked if you chose hillbilly and it puts you on raccoon police station map cause of how small the hallways are and cause of that level being a maze. The starting killers should not be able to go to the newer maps that are for them. The reason why is cause then you'll be very handicapped if you chose a killer to later find out that the map is either too big, bright, small, and claustrophobic for said killers in the game. Out of all the places in the resident evil game i dont know why they chose the police station over the actual city instead. That way you will have more room to run through and instead of tiny halls, they can have alley ways. All the maps are good except for the raccoon police station because of how small and maze like everything is in it. The other map that has a huge issue is the snow one. Your killer will stick out like a sore thumb cause the entire map is white and your killer is covered in blood and has red glowing eyes. The trapper has the hardest time in this map because no matter where you place the traps, they stick out like a sore thumb cause they are black in white terrain. Instead the trappers bear traps should be hidden better when placing them, instead only in the tall grass for the best location. The reason why this is stupid is cause you won't be able to make choke points as the trapper. NO BODY walks through tall grass that much and when they do they are most likely crouched, which makes it easier to find the traps. Them finding the traps easier while crouched is not the problem, the real problem is how the trapper can't place them in better choke points, do to them sticking out like a blister if its anywhere but tall grass. The traps should instead be partially covered by the terrain when placing them. All the starting killers are under powered, except for the wraith. The wraith in my opinion is the actual one that is the easiest to play. The reason for that is, because he is able to move faster while cloaked, you'll have an easier time trying to find the survivors and being cloaked would also hide the red light from your eyes. In the end the game gets too stupid because as you progress up within its own ranks, you'll be going after people with better perks and they would spawn with items instead of having to find them at first like when this game was first released. Most of the time now you will see survivors running tool boxes or medics. This is very annoying cause you need 2 hits to down and hook them 3 times most likely. The other alternative is to hook someone, then puppy guard them, but if you do that you will miss out on the other survivors whom are already popping generators.","timestamp_created":1629606597,"timestamp_updated":1629606597,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542857170104980469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98014896","author":{"steamid":"76561199135601451","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1631455064},"language":"russian","review":"da.\n","timestamp_created":1629606399,"timestamp_updated":1629606399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98014648","author":{"steamid":"76561198415550965","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1630810945},"language":"schinese","review":"刺激","timestamp_created":1629605981,"timestamp_updated":1629605981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98014530","author":{"steamid":"76561199120839743","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8501,"last_played":1657667433},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sobre

Playing solo-queue on survivor is a complete mess, and going up against survivors on comms is almost impossible. Playing solo-queue will have you going up against a killer with a rag-tag team of survivors that will most likely not have any idea what anyone else is doing, leading to wasted time that will allow the killer more opportunities to win. On top of that, you will have no way to counter the shear amount of camping you will go up against. without that crucial communication, there really isn't a way to free teammates from the hook without Borrowed Time. IT leads to this cycle where as a survivor you just bring the same META perks into the game, but get bullied in the end-game chat for relying on crutch perks.\nAs a Killer, I get it, things always feel like they're stacked against you because the survivors get multiple second chances, like Adrenaline, DS, Unbreakable, Dead Hard, etc. The whole game feels rigged. And again, when teams are on comms, they can pick you apart. They always know where you are, where you place traps/portals, and you can't get away from them. It starts to feel like they're the real killers (Nea). So you resort to proxy-camping, and maybe even face-camping- standing in front of the hooked survivor. But that's not fun; it's just a way for you to keep control of the game.\nIt's all a cycle that leads into this loop that makes the game less and less fun over time. I'll continue to play the game, sure, but only with friends, because the solo-queue experience is so terrible. But the fact that we play in a group will mean more frustration and less fun for killers because we will inevitably bully them. I really want to recommenced this game, but it's so hard because of that spiral. I love that we get more killers, but I would really love it if we could have a few things fixed here and there. Especially the camping and NoEd. Even Otz accidentally showed how effective camping was when he was tried showing how broken NoEd was. Teams couldn't even get to the last gen because camping allowed him to kill them so quickly. And why would we expect killers to not camp when it's so effective? It's just not fun at that point and puts everyone into a losing situation. The killer isn't having fun; they're just tired of losing, and there is really no way for survivors to have fun because it ensures they can't win.","timestamp_created":1629600523,"timestamp_updated":1629600523,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490071147680282593","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98011144","author":{"steamid":"76561198345504212","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":135100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":87917,"last_played":1660087157},"language":"english","review":"do you ever hate something so much but you still find yourself coming back to that thing? well thats what this game is.","timestamp_created":1629600362,"timestamp_updated":1634873288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98010738","author":{"steamid":"76561199021225596","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":47284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29250,"last_played":1642990355},"language":"english","review":"10/10 game in every aspect !!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1629599667,"timestamp_updated":1629599667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98010662","author":{"steamid":"76561198248760034","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":269,"playtime_at_review":3130,"last_played":1660536246},"language":"english","review":"game is usually fun but you occasionally get bullied by bad matchmaking and my game crashed and i got a 15 min ban","timestamp_created":1629599549,"timestamp_updated":1629599549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98010521","author":{"steamid":"76561198162585914","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1597,"playtime_at_review":13024,"last_played":1660535167},"language":"english","review":"from cs:go to rainbow six siege to cod lobbys this game is in the ranks to how toxic you can be this is the best and worst game i have ever played i would recommend it to no one and everyone at the same time please for the love of god never not ever play this game","timestamp_created":1629599293,"timestamp_updated":1629599293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98010364","author":{"steamid":"76561198398898926","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":538,"playtime_at_review":5685,"last_played":1660587207},"language":"english","review":"Great game i think it might need to balance better but its a fun game","timestamp_created":1629599020,"timestamp_updated":1629599020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98010109","author":{"steamid":"76561198048494990","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":56854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44485,"last_played":1658795394},"language":"english","review":"God I gotta admit I hate this game.
