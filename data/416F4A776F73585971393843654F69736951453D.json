Now a little background info. I picked this up whilst it was on early access. I loaded up once got bored of waiting in a lobby and forgot I owned it. Then I saw the Halloween DLC and had to buy it but was playing other stuff and thought I would get around to it and again forgot all about it. Watching Halloween the other day reminded me of this game so I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nI wish I'd tried it a year ago because I am hooked (pun intended). Playing as a killer is exhilarating and super fun as you stalk people around the map. I have mainly played Michael Myers as I love his stalking powers but all the killers I have tried are fun and unique. The upgrade systems for both killers and survivors are deep and very much encourage a \"one more go mentality. The balancing seems good so far but I'm not deep enough to say how it is for high level play. It's not to hard to win as the killer or survivor  if you manage your perks and items well and take the time to practise and stratigise. Really it's two games because the killers and survivors play so differently. As the killer it's all about stalking, ambushing and sacrificing survivors. As a survivor the game really encourages team work because it's based on risk vs reward mechanics. A full team is much easier to win then being on your own so almost always people will try to rescue you if you get hooked unless it's a really dire situation. The game rewards you extra points for altruistic  actions as well and my experience has been really good with the community so far.
