After countless times of trying to give this game a chance, I read a review on the store page that inspired me to also share my opinions on this heap of garbage. If I had to use one word to describe the game, or rather 2, they would be \"broken\" and \"unbalanced\". Allow me to explain:\n\nBroken:\n\nThere are so many aspects to this game they flat out don't work sometimes. Because there are so many of them, I will try to remember to the best of my ability. I have a game that I recorded where Leatherface was chasing me while he had his chainsaw ability active. I was a solid 4-6 feet away from a window that I just vaulted through and he was able to slash me through the window. This was the most egregious case, but there have been plenty others where the killer will be able to land a hit on you through a window or pallet. There are also plenty of cases where the pallet will allow the killer to go through the pallet as it's being dropped and still be able to injure you, while also stunning them. Which is it? Did I just stun the killer or did I get slashed? I play with a group of friends almost every night (sadly) and there have been several times where my friends will get grade progress errors and (in a game they did really well in) and it will count for nothing because the game crashed. I play on PC and they play on console. I have yet to have the issue myself, but one of my friends in particular has had it happen to her atleast 10 times...ATLEAST. Several games we have played also include killers that just have no audio or heartbeat indication before they're stabbing a knife in your chest. And before you say anything, I know that there are some killers that have abilities (i.e. Michael Myers, Ghostface) that disable their audio in an attempt to \"sneak up on\" or \"stalk\" their victims. This doesn't apply to those people. I can't tell you how many times I have looked at the post game report and there have been no item addons or perks that make it so they have no sound, yet that was a consistent problem all game. \n\n\nUnbalanced:\n\nThis game is so one-sided, it's actually almost funny. I have heard some people say that this game is \"caTerEd toWarDs tHe suRviVor\", to which I ask them one question: Have you been playing with your monitor off the entire time? There are so many perks that cater towards the killer and making the killer stronger that it makes the perks they give to the survivors laughable. There are these \"Hex\" totems which latch on to \"dull\" totems at the start of the game. The developers made it so that these OP hexes don't have any limit as to how many you can have on at the same (other than the existing limit of having 4 perks on). There was one game where 1 killer had all of their perks be hexes. Yeah, I'll pass. Not to mention that one hex in particular, NOED (No One Escapes Death) completely rewards a killer at the end of the game who could have had the worst game possible. It makes it so that they could go from not killing 1 person, to killing all of them in a matter of seconds. Yes, survivors have a bevy of perks that make it annoying for the killer to be able to hook them, chase them, see them, etc. The killers, however, have so many perks that just disable the effects of survivor perks that it makes it so one-sided you might as well not run any perks as a survivor. I know that's being hyperbolic, but I'm angry dangit.\n\nIt's also very sad that it seems the developers have no interest in fixing their game. There have been SO many times this has been clear, I can't even remember them all. On a separate note, the steam page for the game had a killer on the profile screen from 2 chapter ago when a new killer had JUST been released...I'm not joking. Does nobody monitor their community page?? LOL. The team also seems so incredibly adverse to criticism that it even makes me wonder why they made the game public. I've seen a bunch of people complain about the game and nothing be done about it. It just makes you wonder why we even waste our breath in the first place.\n\nWell there you have it. This is just a glimpse into the mediocrity that is beHAVIOR Interactive and its monstrosity of a game that they have created. I have created a list of 60+ complaints that I have about this game that I otherwise would have shared in this post, but I'd rather one day be hired by this company and see them burn to the ground from the inside than give that information out for free. I'll admit, I have had fun with this game. If you have a group of friends to play with, please, and I mean PLEASE keep them far away from this trash as possible. The bad in this game has outweighed the fun in every category. I have had to get off a couple nights because the game is just bad for my health. If I've kept anybody from playing this game then my mission was successful. PLEASE don't waste your money on it. In the end, it's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1642486113,"timestamp_updated":1642486113,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520123839378356934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108250644","author":{"steamid":"76561199092364482","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":35122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3103,"playtime_at_review":7568,"last_played":1660600918},"language":"english","review":"this game is sooooo fun to play alone and with friends","timestamp_created":1642485755,"timestamp_updated":1642485755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108250581","author":{"steamid":"76561198235034772","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":53,"playtime_at_review":15606,"last_played":1660173621},"language":"english","review":"Don't play at night.

If you're new to this game and looking to play killer? Don't bother, Killers are in the worst spot they've been in since basically the launch of the game and you will just repeatedly get shit on by the game pairing you with survivor friend stacks running meta perks.\n\nIf you're new and want to play survivor but are doing it solo? Don't bother because any halfway decent killer will immediately notice you're the weak-link and immediately tunnel you out of the match for a quick advantage.\n\nI can only recommend this piece of shit game if you intend to go in with 2 or 3 friends as a survivor group and immediately look up a current meta guide and start grinding together to get those busted survivor perks ASAP.\n\nShame on Behavior, lazy bastards the lot of them.

Скатилась в лютый треш. Баланс абсолютно и полностью повернут в сторону выживших. Все играют в команде со связью. Над маньяками просто занимаются диким угаром. Им не надо спешить, они тупо чилят, выжившие расслабились и обнаглели. Я стал любить играть за выживших, но игра вынуждает ночью играть за маньяков, не давая комфортно искать игру, задерживая меня в меню игры по 10 минут (я играю ночью). Я люблю маньяков и отказываюсь от игры за них. И что бы это говно хоть как- то выживало, либо играешь на маньяках, либо не играешь вообще. Это треш. Я интроверт до мозга костей, друзей не завожу, но то, что в эту пар**у играют 80 процентов сурвов в команде, разработчиков ни как не заботит. Вам ничего не сделать против команды в 8 из 10 случаев, по определению, за пешего маньяка. \nЧитеры в игре как еще одна функция. Разработчикам абсолютно наплевать на эту проблему, они просто сделали раздачу игры бесплатно для всех) \nВ общем я хороню это глубоко в своей голове и постараюсь в это больше не играть. Добрых 2к часов я потратил тут (разные аккаунты), я имею право судить о достоинствах и недостатках. Они кристально видны. 4 сурва и один маньяк. 80%- это выжившие, 20%- маньяки. Я не к тому, что нужно менять баланс в количестве игроков. Я к  тому, что бы вы открыли глаза и поняли, кого разработчикам выгоднее веселить. \nЯ с огромной болью в сердце буду пытаться искать другие проекты и постараюсь веселиться в них.

This game for me is very fun to play, especially with others. I also enjoy solo que so I can play how I want whether the perks be for self preservation or team work. Dead by Daylight is not perfect by any means and it never will be as the game will constantly tilt to survivor favor then to killer. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoy's a game that can be played solo survivor or with a group. You may just want to play as the killer and push yourself against other skilled people. For me the fun in the game is no game is usually the same, different perks can be put together, different builds and you always play with different people. Not every experience will be good though so I recommend having an open mind if playing, My recommendation is to get it, not exceed the two hour limit for steam and if you do not like it then refund it.
