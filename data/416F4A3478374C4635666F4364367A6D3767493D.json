When people are forced to play ranked and rank is imbalanced why would they keep playing the game? The game also punishes you for doing well with one killer and if you are learning on another killer you are forced to play against much better players.

I'll do my best to explain my thoughts.\n\n1. The Grind\n\nThe sheer amount of grinding this game has is insane. Over 20 different killers and survivors, which while giving the game good variety, gives this game an ungodly amount of grinding you have to do to get everything each character has to offer. Say you want to unlock all the perks from everyone, by going from level 1 to level 40. On average, especially later in the grind, it can take around 1 million bloodpoints just to get a character to level 40, already putting your grind at a whopping 40+ million bloodpoints, and given the rate at which you get them in matches, this (if it wasn't obvious by my playtime) can take what feels like forever. Given a perfect scenario, which in Dead by Daylight terms is every player bringing a 100% bonus bloodpoint offering, maxing out your stacks on one of two good bloodpoint perks (David's We're Gonna Live Forever for survivor or Leatherface's Barbeque and Chili for killer) AND a perfect score of 32k, you can get around 192k bloodpoints a match. If by some ungodly amount of luck or skill you can do this every match, you can unlock all the perks in just about 209 perfect matches, but since we're all imperfect (and since you often can't rely on randoms for those good offerings), we'd more likely have to settle for just getting around 20-40k a match. If given those terms, and with a rough average match time of 10-15 minutes (using with 12.5 for math's sake), you're looking at roughly a thousand or two matches, already totaling up to 200-400 hours of playtime, not counting game queue times. Good luck with that.\n\n2. The Game and It's Company\n\nAlthough it can often be a fun experience, there's many minor and sometimes major issues with the game that make it a much less fun experience especially during longer sessions. Many issues range from unusual hitboxes, laggy interactions, to game crashes and game-ruining glitches. While some issues on the ladder end are much more uncommon, they've caused major issues in one of the most recent updates, rendering the new map (Raccoon City Police Department) unplayable for many causing it to be taken off the roster. Given the very stale map rotation (haven't gotten a new map for about a year), this caused a lot of discourse and anger among the community. These types of issues have been plaguing the game for many years, where in some cases brand new killers (most notably The Twins) were riddled with so many bugs in their initial play test and release that they've remained some of the least played killers introduced. Not only does the game have issues, but the company that runs it causes a lot of them. In the past, the community has been incredibly vocal about issues in the game, but the majority of them don't get any attention paid to them, some even going on until they received public criticism for it (previous lack of Colorblind settings). This has gone so far to the point that players on Reddit have planned a boycott of the game's monetization system in order to protest against their poor level of maintenance. Although not everything was directly their fault or decision, they've still been behind a large amount of the things that people complain about.\n\nOne day, it's possible that Behavior will make more big strides in bringing the game to a point where the majority of the people are happy with it's current state. They've made effort into reaching that point, but sometimes they shoot their own foot in the process. Unfortunately, given the past and much more recent events, it seems bleak oftentimes. That being said;\n\nI love this game. But damn, I hope it gets better.","timestamp_created":1626921402,"timestamp_updated":1626923121,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96163829","author":{"steamid":"76561198320272994","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":314,"playtime_at_review":29689,"last_played":1660589045},"language":"english","review":"be a man and run at the killer","timestamp_created":1626921156,"timestamp_updated":1626921156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96163728","author":{"steamid":"76561198059856143","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":92147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1407,"playtime_at_review":35812,"last_played":1660569343},"language":"english","review":"it is very iconic me thinks but sometimes i wanna bash my head against a wall when i play it <3","timestamp_created":1626920980,"timestamp_updated":1626920980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96163556","author":{"steamid":"76561198237367988","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1660508782},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito divertido!

You can repair most of the generators and still not rank up because you don't have enough points in other categories. Hours will be wasted just to go up one rank but it only takes 1 second to rank you back down. You can also get screwed over by OP killers in matches where it's really just out of your control.

Wenn es da nicht die schlechte Community gäbe...\n\nWenn man als Killer spielen möchte, muss man hoffen, dass man in eine vernünftige Lobby kommt, wo Survs dich nicht anklickern, weil sie die Aufmerksamkeit, die sie von ihrer Mutti nicht bekommen, bei Fremden im Internet suchen.\nAußerdem, wollen wohl viele der Survs im Wahren Leben gerne ihren Hintern hinhalten & weil sie dafür entweder zu hässlich oder zu Feige sind, präsentieren sie diesen auch gerne in Ausgängen oder hinter Paletten.\n\nDie Survs Seite sieht auch nicht gerade rosiger aus. Entweder bekommt man totale Schrott Mates, die sich nur in Kellern verkriechen, weil sie wohl in Feuchten Dunklen Räumen an die Gebärmutter ihrer Mutter erinnert werden oder sie wurden von Mutti zum Essen gerufen & stehen AFK auf der Map rum. \nDie Killer haben auch eine Komische Art und Weise sich \"Freunde\" zu suchen. Weil sie Verlust Ängste haben, jagen sie zu 80% den gerade vom Haken geholten Survs hinterher oder sie bleiben, natürlich aus \"Sicherheitsgründen\" vor den Haken stehen & schauen einem Tief in die Augen. VOLL ROMANTISCH!! \n\nDen Entwickler ist das wohl der Community natürlich auch sehr wichtig. So sehr, dass sie anstelle von Bugs fixen lieber Skins für Echt Geld raus hauen.

Please understand that if you want to play with the fun perks, it might take you 1000 hours to just get all the survivor perks, let alone the killer perks.","timestamp_created":1626911411,"timestamp_updated":1626911411,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504958152770996094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96158032","author":{"steamid":"76561198033085307","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":395218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":20091,"playtime_at_review":172711,"last_played":1660603360},"language":"english","review":"not as fun as it use to be","timestamp_created":1626911065,"timestamp_updated":1626911065,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157886","author":{"steamid":"76561199003504931","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1643153051},"language":"russian","review":"играйте оч курто","timestamp_created":1626910788,"timestamp_updated":1626910788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157876","author":{"steamid":"76561198974141336","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8036,"last_played":1642285047},"language":"spanish","review":"hoy dia estuve jugando con un amigo, el hizo 25000 puntos y le dieron +2 pepitas, y yo hice 31000 y de suerte me dieron +1 pepita, yo la verdad que no entiendo este juego poronga pero bueno es muy divertido GOD","timestamp_created":1626910769,"timestamp_updated":1626910769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157875","author":{"steamid":"76561199084847438","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1637355880},"language":"english","review":"good game :)","timestamp_created":1626910768,"timestamp_updated":1626910768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157801","author":{"steamid":"76561198219987367","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":4137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1655666347},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1626910642,"timestamp_updated":1626910642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157676","author":{"steamid":"76561198853010609","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1462,"last_played":1656148706},"language":"english","review":"im looping all the killers","timestamp_created":1626910435,"timestamp_updated":1626910435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157599","author":{"steamid":"76561198280628508","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2123,"last_played":1654166233},"language":"polish","review":"Zarąbista gra fajny klimacik horroru fajnie się gra z przyjaciółmi duża liczba map i postaci","timestamp_created":1626910308,"timestamp_updated":1633367243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96157520","author":{"steamid":"76561198819865707","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1656010724},"language":"english","review":"I have this game on about every console and I have a lot of hours put into my other consoles.
