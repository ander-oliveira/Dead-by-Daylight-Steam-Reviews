a lot of work even after years of it being released, A lot of it is because the game is unbalanced,mechanics of the games seem rough and also in need of a lot of work and more killer oriented.\na few problems i saw in the games i played are :\nthere's no point for the wiggle mechanic(getting out of the killer's arm) you never have enough time to get off since there pretty much hooks around every corners.\nAnother mechanic that is useless are flashlights you have to keep the light on the face of the killers most of the time its undoable since the killer can easily look away or just turn around and hit you since you know they still go the same speed most of the time \nanother mechanic are the hooks even with skills you can't get off since the percentage is so low.\nSome of the killers are OP and people tend to abuse it so you only get to see 3-4 killers. Rarely you will see another THOSE games are fun :)\nIf you ever played league of legends you know their team is incapable of doing proper balance change.Guess what ? so does this game's dev teams they seem to add stuff every patch but nothing actually change.\nfor exemple has of 6.1.0 they buffed 4 perks for hunters and pretty much debuff a lot of survivor perks.in this patch they overly f*cked over the survivor.\nFor killers  i have said earlier they are indeed OP each of them destroys a mechanic or make the game not even fun \nfor exemple: \nThe doctor with his zone attack you cant hide from him and when he does it you cant do an action so you planned on jumping over that window ? think again you are stuck there.\nThere's so much more that could be said about the sorry state this game is.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1658454121,"timestamp_updated":1658454121,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119232730","author":{"steamid":"76561199341339580","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":712,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1660546187},"language":"english","review":"Extremely Fun!","timestamp_created":1658453553,"timestamp_updated":1658453553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119232543","author":{"steamid":"76561198801582639","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":2371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":2319,"last_played":1659399269},"language":"english","review":"guy who made thsi is frecnh","timestamp_created":1658453299,"timestamp_updated":1659310599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119232390","author":{"steamid":"76561199137429545","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6002,"playtime_last_two_weeks":189,"playtime_at_review":4858,"last_played":1660386434},"language":"schinese","review":"削弱人类自保","timestamp_created":1658453035,"timestamp_updated":1658453035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51330798864364624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119231926","author":{"steamid":"76561198861976471","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3855,"playtime_at_review":1653,"last_played":1660469163},"language":"english","review":"ghostface","timestamp_created":1658452267,"timestamp_updated":1658452267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119231730","author":{"steamid":"76561199048311854","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":58305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3646,"playtime_at_review":52240,"last_played":1660600553},"language":"spanish","review":"es un jue go muy divertido y cool  kjasjkf\n\nporfavor no lo arruinen siendo toxicos o insultando :C","timestamp_created":1658451954,"timestamp_updated":1658451954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119231351","author":{"steamid":"76561198220401121","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1660591652},"language":"english","review":"shwag money","timestamp_created":1658451410,"timestamp_updated":1658451410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119231295","author":{"steamid":"76561199083897765","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1463,"playtime_at_review":3304,"last_played":1660531753},"language":"english","review":"yuh","timestamp_created":1658451329,"timestamp_updated":1658451329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119231124","author":{"steamid":"76561198848723955","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":127261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2026,"playtime_at_review":124274,"last_played":1660600005},"language":"english","review":"Dead By Daylight is awesome and it gets better with every update.

The game is beyond Killer heavy and there are four survivors. It's genuinely sad. \n\nMajor things in the game that are supposed to allow survivors to get away and continue on just don't work. The amount of cheating is insane. If you have Barbecue and Chili, or another relatable perk, then I can see how you knew the EXACT location of all of the survivors, but when you have killers that have one perk and they just have the ability to pinpoint all locations it's a little extra sus. \n\nPallets are set in the game so you can utilize them to stun, get around, or get away from a killer. However, if you were what is deemed \"to close\" to the side of the pallets they don't work and you just get hit by the killer. \n\nWindow jumping is essentially useless as you can still be struck by the killer even if they are a distance behind you. Oh, did I mention Lithe, Dance with Me and other helpful vaulting perks don't do a thing to change that? No matter what, the killer CAN reach you after a fully successful vault. \n\nThis game was once enjoyable but is now just a shit show.

bought this game 2-3 years ago... and tbh i prefer the old dead by daylight because it had simple controls and simple movement... not only that... the killers and surivors were pretty balanced... and now in 2022 the game is super unbalanced... the perks to survivors are useless... and for the killers these perks helps them win easier... i havent won a single game where the killers actually plays the game... i have only won the games where killers does absolute nothing.... what i want from this game is to be balanced... perks needs to be effective against killers... and last but not least... mechanics... i loved the old mechanics where u had wiggle out using 2 buttons repeadetly.... but the new wiggle... its strange and completelly useless.... if there is that new wiggle then remove 5 hooks around the game... because i noticed walking around the map... i always ended up knocked out nearby the hook.... which pisses me off the
