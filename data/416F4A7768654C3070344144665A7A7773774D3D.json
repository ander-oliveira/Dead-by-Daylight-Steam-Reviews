Côté tueur on est bien rempli, environs 1 game sur 3 est un campeur qui va vous exploser les noix de cajoux. Ces vilains garnements se justifieront en disant : \"mais si le jeu ne m'y interdit pas, c'est que je peux jouer comme ça.\" Et oui Jamy, ce jeu très mal codé nommé Dead by Daylight ne bloque en AUCUN CAS les vilains garnements qui te feront passer de l'état : \n\"Ma vie est cool.\" \nà : \"Ce mec je vais le DDOS et trouver le nom de tout ses parents afin d'engager un tueur à gage et le faire payer toutes ces longues minutes ou ils m'a empêché de m'amuser.\"\n\nEnsuite parlons des hackeurs, aaa les hackeurs, ces racailles qui ont installés un logiciel malveillant afin de se sentir supérieur virtuellement car dans la vie de tout les jours ils sont rejetés tel des déchets de la société, ont en a pleins, de toutes les sortes (des mecs qui volent, qui ont des tueurs qui n'existent pas genre ghost face qui lance des hachettes, des mecs qui sont invisible, des mecs qui vous tuent tous en 1 coup ou qui vont a une vitesse folle) mais aussi de toutes les types, côté survivants on est aussi bien rempli (des mecs invincibles, qui se tp, qui font tout les gens en 3 secondes, qui volent, qui aveuglent plus que le soleil, qui se transforme en hook et se serve de ça pour body block et qui gueulent sur toute la map en créant des milliards de notifications sonores qui peuvent vous rendre sourd et vous faire perdre quelques neurones, je parle en connaissance de cause).\n\nParlons du MMR qui est inexistant. Il n'y a absolument aucune différence entre Joséphine ma grand mère qui vient d'installer le jeu il y a 20 minutes, et Otzdarva le mec qui a 12k heures et qui est capable de détruire n'importe quel team sans compétences. Le MMR va vous faire péter des câbles, quand vous êtes en train de carry toute vôtre team a avoir loop 45 minutes, fais 3 générateurs et save flash 47 personnes, et que quand vous vous faites accrocher vos mates sont tellement stupides qu'ils préfèrent se barrer alors que le killer camp même pas (pour une fois) croyez moi on a la rage, et pas qu'un peu.\n\nEnsuite la communauté, c'est simple si on s'en servait comme poison, ce serais une arme biochimique militaire capable de décimer l'humanité, que dis-je, l'Univers tout entier. Entre les mecs qui tea bag à chaque palettes, ceux qui font clique clique avec leurs flashlight 12 000 fois dans une seule game, ceux qui spam les emotes en mode pointer du doigt sur le crochet et font oui de la tête parce que c'est drôle de mourir, perdre un objet, respawn au lobby avec 0 points et mettre 100 ans pour retrouver une game sans campers, et les mecs qui bodyblock soit parce qu'ils sont trop stupides pour savoir utiliser ZQSD correctement, soit pour troll, on est servit en tout genre. Et en plus cerise sur le gâteau, les gens seront toxiques dans tout les cas :\n-Vous avez tué tout le monde en jouant fair play \"-rep try hard\"\n-Vous n'avez tué personne en jouant fair play \"lol ez killer noob\"\n-Vous avez facecamp un toxic qui n'arrêtais pas de tea bag et click click et fait 4 kills \"-rep bad killer facecamp noob\"\nEt en plus je parle pas du nombre de menteur, des mecs qui viendront dans vôtre profil pour mentir et critiquer des choses que vous n'avez pas ou n'avez pas faites. EX : Après avoir démonté un toxic en le facecamp car il m'a pt les noix de cajoux en spammant click click avec des macros il m'a mis sur mon profil : \"cringe facecamp so bad using op perks and op add ons u suck kys\" Déjà le mec jouais Dead hard, coup dé, borrow time et indéfectible (des perks super op) et les perks que je jouais ct vrm genre prédateur, chili, tanato et scourge hook de l'artiste sur légion, on est pas sur du Pop + Ruine (perk op de fou). Et mes add ons c'était que des add on marrons. Du coup on a débattu dans mon profil pendant 3 heures et dès qu'il avais plus d'argument il m'a bloqué et signalé pour harcèlement, le culot :I.\nDans tout les cas vous vous ferez insulter, alors je tiens a passer une message 1er degré : Si vous avez des problèmes dans la vie (dépression ou autre) et que les jeux sont toute vôtre vie car vous n'avez que ça, par pitié ne jouer surtout pas a DBD, les gens sur ce jeu veulent que vous passiez une sale journée, leurs but est de vous harceler le plus possible, j'ai connu beaucoup de personnes (majoritairement des russes) qui venaient m'harceler avec leurs amis pour que je me suicide juste parce que je n'avais pas fais un générateur. Et en tant que killer c encore pire tout les survivants sont contre vous dans la majorité des cas. Ce jeu c'est une usine de sel, tout le monde est toxique avec tout le monde et j'imagine pas le nombre de personne qui se sont tué a cause de la communauté. Imaginez, vous avez perdu vôtre taf, vôtre femme vous a quitté, vos jeux sont donc la dernière chose que vous avez, et la vous tombez contre une team qui vous démonte click click tea bag et a la fin \"lol ez noob killer go kill yourself\". Alors pour tout les gens qui disent \"ça va c'est qu'un jeu\" bah figurez vous que non, ce n'est pas qu'un jeu pour certaines personnes. Même aujourd'hui ça me fais mal de faire une game complètement fair, de ne pas tunnel ou camp et que à la fin j'ai 4 russes qui viennent dans mon profil dire \"ez lol noob killer kill yourself uninstall you suck\", car j'ai la rage d'avoir fais passé une bonne game a des gens aussi immatures et immoraux.\n\nMaintenant, parlons des devs. Au lieu d'améliorer leurs jeu défectueux, il préfèrent ajouter des tonnes de DLC payant ou farmable en mode 100 heures de jeu pour 1 killer et 1 survivant. Ils ajoutent aussi énormément de cosmétiques complètement inutiles car beaucoup trop chers, ils coûtent autant qu'un menu maxi best of. \nOui car par exemple : pour buff un killer que tout le monde juge inutile depuis 2018 (la légion, mon main killer) ils ont mis 4 ans avant d'agir, au lieu de ça on avait des cosmétiques toujours plus chers chaque jours mais pas autre chose. Par contre la nurse, qui peut littéralement se tp et briser la seule règle du jeu (les murs et palettes) ça on nerf pas, c'est bien opé comme ça tout le monde la joue et personne n'a de fun. Ce jeu j'ai arrêté d'y jouer tellement de fois car prendre du plaisir est beaucoup trop rare. Se faire camper et tunnel est devenu banal, c'est quelque chose banalisé par la commu dbd. Je ne campe jamais ou ne tunnel jamais, et pourtant je vois plus de killer camper et dire : \"c'est une stratégie comme une autre\" que de killer jouer fair play. A tel point que tout le monde joue sur la réserve (compétence qui permet de prendre un hit supplémentaire avant de tomber pendant 12 secondes après s'être fais déhook) et moi j'ai tellement peur que ma team n'ai pas sur la réserve que je prend tout le temps coup décisif (compétence qui permet d'échapper a la poigne du tueur moins d'1 minute après s'être fais déhook). En plus les perks sont totalement déséquilibrés : Vous préférez avoir une perk qui corrige les QTE raté des autres joueur sur un même gen que le vôtre ce qui est complètement inutile car personne les rate avec un minimum de 30 heures de jeu (mesure de correction perk de Jonah) ou une perk qui vous permet littéralement de vesqui un coup et de prendre un peu de distance en même temps (dead hard perk de david). Moi j'pense la question elle est vite répondu.\n\n[u]Pire jeu, et pourtant si addictif.\n\nUpdate : Merci beaucoup pour toutes les récompenses, si vous voulez du nouveau : rien a changé, y'a même encore plus de bug qu'avant et encore plus de toxiques mais HEY on a un nouveau skin qui coûte 15 balles sur le farceur alors ça efface tout les bugs pas vrai ?

you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but at least I can give you strawberry cheese cake recipe.\n\ningredients:\n\n250g digestive biscuits\n100g butter, melted\n1 vanilla pod\n600g full fat soft cheese\n100g icing sugar\n284ml pot of double cream\nFor the topping\n400g punnet of strawberries, halved\n25g icing sugar\n\nSTEP 1\nTo make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.\n\nSTEP 2\nSlice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife.\n\nSTEP 3\nPour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.\n\nSTEP 4\nBring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top.\n\nvoilà!","timestamp_created":1650641165,"timestamp_updated":1650641165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":230,"votes_funny":73,"weighted_vote_score":"0.799045860767364502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114282644","author":{"steamid":"76561198204220309","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":13645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13224,"last_played":1652970045},"language":"english","review":"I
