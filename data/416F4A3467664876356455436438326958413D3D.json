Normalerweise bin ich ja überhaupt nicht so der Horrospieler (klar, ich hab Outlast in meiner Liste... meinste, ich hätt das lange gespielt? <- Schisser hoch zehn), jedoch war ich schon bei dem Let's Play von Gronkh, Pandorya, TobinatorLP und Herr Currywurst so begeistert, dass ich nach einer Woche grübeln dann schließlich doch das Spiel gekauft habe. \nDie vier haben gezeigt, wie lustig das Spiel sein kann, online jedoch hat man auch negative Seiten erfahren. \n\nKiller die campen sind zum Beispiel (bei mir) ein No-Go und ziemliche Stimmungsdämpfer. Wo ist der Nervenkitzel, wenn du einfach da rumhängst und nicht gerettet werden kannst, weil Spieler Nummer 2 dann ebenfalls sofort dran ist? Natürlich, als Killer hast du dann sichergestellt, dass Überlebender Nummer 1 ganz sicher keine Generatoren mehr zum Laufen kriegt oder die anderen Spieler heilt und hat vielleicht bei einem Befreiungsversuch Spieler Nummer 2 auch noch eingesackt.\nDer Spielspaß beim Spieler, der den Überlebenden gespielt hat, ist dann jedoch erheblich gedämpft, besonders wenn der Killer auch noch schön auf dich draufschlägt, während du langsam am Haken verblutest und das Ganze hat dann auch noch in den ersten drei Minuten des Spiels stattgefunden, weil du zufälligerweise nahe des Killers gespawnt und direkt in seine Arme (Geist; Umhang) gelaufen bist.\n\n\nDie Grafik ist wirklich hervorragend und die Maps sind sehr kreativ gestaltet! Die fauligen Felder ist meine Lieblingsmap und hat auch für den Killer ein paar Herausforderungen - Überlebende sind im Maisfeld nicht so leicht zu sehen, wie ich festgestellt habe :D. Der Rücken vom Fallensteller war wirklich wunderschön!\n\nIch hätte niemals gedacht, dass es so effektiv ist, sich im Gras, hinter den Holzplanken, hinter Bäumen und Steinen oder hinter den Holzwänden zu verstecken. Öfters ist es jetzt schon vorgekommen, dass der Killer einen Meter von mir entfernt war und mich eigentlich hätte sehen müssen, jedoch direkt an mir vorbeigerannt ist und sich dann bei mir aufgeregt hat, wo ich denn wäre :D. Das Katz- und Mausspiel nimmt bei Dead by Daylight ganz neue Dimensionen an und hat definitiv für den Überlebenden eine große Spannung! \nDer Herzschlag, wenn der Killer in der Nähe ist, ist eine super Vorwarnung, bringt jedoch auch viel Nervenkitzel mit rein, wenn du am Generator arbeitest und plötzlich ein 'Bubumm...bubumm... bubumm' hörst. \n\nAlles in allem ist das Spiel ein großer Spaßfaktor, auch wenn man sowohl als Killer als auch als Überlebender manchmal ziemlich frustriert werden kann. Das System mit den Blutpunkten, Opfergaben und Perks bringt noch einmal extra Schwung rein und gestaltet so jede Runde einzigartig verschieden.\n\nUnd zum Abschluss noch ein paar Bugs, die zwar nicht das Spielgeschehen groß beeinflussen, aber trotzdem manchmal ganz schön lustig sein können:\n\nBugs bei Überlebenden: \n- der Killer hat dich niedergeschlagen und kann dich nicht aufheben. Du als Überlebender kannst nicht recovern und dein Mitspieler kann dich nicht heilen. Du bist dazu gezwungen, auf dem Boden zu verbluten\n- die Schränke, in denen du dich verstecken kannst, sind manchmal durchsichtig für den Mörder oder der Killer kann ein Kleidungsstück von dir rauslugen sehen. Uncool, wenn die sichere Zuflucht doch nicht so sicher ist\n\nBugs bei den Killern: \n- spielst du als Killer im privaten Spiel mit deinen Freunden, ist dein Mauszeiger plötzlich weg und hat einen Wackelkontakt! 5 Minuten später hast du es dann endlich geschafft, 'zurück zur Lobby' zu drücken\n- der Fallensteller hat öfters die Texturen seiner eigenen Maske im Bild kleben. Stört zwar nicht unbedingt bei der Sichtung der Überlebenden, ist jedoch mit der Zeit nervig und mega unangenehm\n- Als Killer (egal welcher) hast du manchmal den schönen 'Generatorenbug'. Non-stop gibt es Fehlzündungen an einem Generator, was 1. den Killer irritiert, weil dort überhaupt kein Spieler ist (wir hatten das im privaten Spiel und waren alle nicht an dem Generator) und 2. haben die Überlebenden so leichtes Spiel, wenn der Killer seine Patrouillen auf den fehlzündenden Generator einschränkt","timestamp_created":1468058756,"timestamp_updated":1468058922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24203328","author":{"steamid":"76561198204079667","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":8340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1595,"last_played":1631367662},"language":"thai","review":"เกมดีมากเล่นแล้วหลอนดีเกมนี้บางคนก็เห็นแก่ตัวเกินไปแต่บางคนก็ดีแต่เองรอดแล้วแต่เลือกที่จะช่วยเพื่อน\nก็ทำให้รู้นิสัยคนด้วยละเกมนี้","timestamp_created":1468058663,"timestamp_updated":1468059050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24203294","author":{"steamid":"76561198091722898","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":168330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3126,"playtime_at_review":27435,"last_played":1660602205},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1468058530,"timestamp_updated":1613321396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24202962","author":{"steamid":"76561198051439323","num_games_owned":459,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3469,"last_played":1560853438},"language":"english","review":"Great game, survivors and killers are balanced uniquely.

Wraith is still broken but it can be worked around.\n\nWhat really gets frustrating is when the huge amount of bugs gets in the way.\nWhen starting a match, there's a 50-50% chance you wont get to look around your surroundings before you start playing. If you dont, you get 50-50 of either: having the camera annoyingly misplaced on your weapons viewmodel (as a killer) -- or not being able to control your character at all, thus losing your rank, offerings and addons which will cost you a huge amount of luck to get back.\n\nI've had some matches where I collide with something on the map and my character just phases right though the ground, breaking the game.\n\n\"Survive with friends\" mode doesnt leave you on a queue until it finds a suitable lobby, It searches for 5-10 seconds and then requires you to search for a game again and again. \n\nBut when none of that happens, its a really fun game to play with friends.\nOnce you get the hang of being the killer and learn how survivors try to avoid you, having the power over the other players and catching them feels really rewarding, especially when you get all 4 survivors.\nMaking teams as survivors and being capable to best the killer's plans is really rewarding as well.\nAt some point the game stops being scary, but the suspense lingers a lot more then.\n\nI feel like this game should have stayed a bit more under beta. Some bugs make the game frustrating and even unplayable. But when things work it proves to be a really awesome game.","timestamp_created":1468053091,"timestamp_updated":1468973076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24201594","author":{"steamid":"76561198063232825","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":139553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3312,"playtime_at_review":5247,"last_played":1660452056},"language":"koreana","review":"대박 스릴감 쩔고 재미있어요.\n아쉬운점은 한글판이 없다는게 매우 아쉬워요.","timestamp_created":1468052421,"timestamp_updated":1468052421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24201273","author":{"steamid":"76561198021167610","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1126,"last_played":1658647728},"language":"english","review":"Real horror game, never felt horror feelings since Resident evil 3 on ps1, then it came back now on this game.\n\nI Really Like the game idea which is scary and exciting every single game gets more and more.\n\nthough there is some problems with the game but im sure it will be fixed because it is minor problems.","timestamp_created":1468051143,"timestamp_updated":1543005132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50960838794708252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24201112","author":{"steamid":"76561198063929929","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":26900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1853,"last_played":1639241418},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist mein lieblings Spiel geworden!\n\nDead by Daylight ist ungefähr so wie der Film \"Freitag der 13\".

Not unless you're always playing with exactly four other friends and don't mind not getting any progressing progress.\n\n  The developers have said they plan on adding a \"co-op with friends\" mode, but it's not entirely clear what this entails- only with exactly three friends or with any number?  Progression or no progression?  Until they get around to adding this capability, I'm reviewing the game as-is rather than as I'd wish it was.\n\n  What about any way to communicate with your teammates in game?  Nope.  For a game with random players, this may very well go down as a thematically appropriate design decision to make coordination harder for the survivors, and to this end it's fairly effective.  When you do fight a premade, though- and this happens even now with players repeatedly queue-ing at the same time and leaving if they don't end up in the same lobby- this makes the game somewhat busted because the survivors suddenly are much more coordinated than they are expected to be.  Once \"co-op with friends\" mode gets added, this is only going to be a more frequent problem.\n\n  Assuming you want to take it at face value that these are design decisions rather than the development budget running out you can see where they're going- playing with random players you can't communicate really helps add to the sense of desperation and the \"do I help them or save myself?\" decision that you'll repeatedly be made to make.  Still, these decisions are ultimately very limiting.\n\n  Some other negatives:\n\n  The itemization and progression are weak.  In particular, the consumables are frequently laughable- an item that gives you a slight chance of a particular map being chosen?  It probably won't do anything if used, and even if it does something it's a pretty minor effect.  Wheee.  Many of the perks are additionally rather anemic to the point of being barely worth caring about, although better and higher tier ones can be extremely valuable.  The tools are for the most part meaningful and useful, with an exception or two, but then come with a large swath of tool-specific add-ons that feel like overkill given that you'll suffer a great deal of equipment turnover due to losing items upon death.  \n\n  The game would have been better served to commit to a simpler perk+tool model and focusing on making every perk and item feel like a significant and distinct modification of your capabilities.\n\n The procedurally generated maps are also extremely bland- although I'll still take that over slightly better fixed maps in the interest of keeping strategies and map exploration fresh.\n\n  Lobby queuing barely works.  Expect to try to join a game and have it fail, or appear to work and then semi-silently kick you back to the loading screen on a regular basis.\n\n  The product as a whole is a fairly slight one.  As a point of reference, I'd say it's a slimmer offering than the famously player-base-dropping Evolve.  As a non-AAA title with a third the price tag, I think this is forgivable, but be forewarned.\n\n  There's even game breaking bugs that can render a player trapped or unkillable.  Hopefully these will be fixed, but again I'm reviewing the game as-is.\n\n  Dead by Daylight is on the whole, half-baked, occasionally ill-concieved, and missing some of the basic capabilities you'd expect from a game like this.\n\n  So... why do I recommend it?\n\n  Dead by Daylight is gloriously unique and asymettrical.  It's compelling and addictive.  It does an amazingly good job of creating organic expressions of horror movie trops within the mechanics of the game.  The tension between assisting your teammates and focusing on your survival and escape are fantastic.\n\n  I don't know what sort of legs it will have, but for now I can't stop playing.\n\nEDIT-  Yup, it has legs.  I'm still loving this game many hours later.  Queue times can be a bit obnoxious for the survivors, especially if you use the \"play with friends\" mode they eventually added, but most of the lobby issues and other major bugs are fixed.  Probably my biggest complaint at this time is simply the toxic community; you've got at least 50/50 odds of getting a wave of abuse in the post-game chat if you win as killer, which is disappointing.","timestamp_created":1468035806,"timestamp_updated":1476850070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52124941349029541","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24197774","author":{"steamid":"76561198152010416","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":64964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27813,"last_played":1658273714},"language":"english","review":"So After 200 hours i can say that is Game is AMAZING and even though there is many bugs and glitvhes it is still an Amazing game with lots of potential and i still play it alot.

Playing as the both the killer and survivor adds tremendous value to the game especially if you're bipolar and swing from agressive alpha male to passive bunny rabbit.  \n\nSo far the game is somewhat balanced between the waring factions but a noteworthy difference is that the 4 survivors are not unique in their gameplay until you reach at least Level 15 whereas each killer is completely unique from the launch.\n\nThis game is very much sound based for both the killer and survivors so don't wimp out on the volume in your playing environment.  The maps are \"procedurally generated\" but I and others have found consistency with some of them and of course this removes some of the intended characteristics.  Graphically I would give the game a 7/10 as the player models remind me of an upscaled version of Pixar's first attempt at human rendering in Toy Story; I'm no artist so no...I can't do better.  \n\nNow the bad....\n\nWelcome to the JOIN A LOBBY SIMULATOR game!!!  Many times will you click that button and then zoom into the fire to be brought right back to the same screen or receive the \"Failed to enter lobby\" nonsense.  It's irritating but not terrible.\n\nThe absolute worst part of the game is when the killer rage quits on the game leaving any of your offerings wasted and you without the 5000+ points you were about to earn as you approach the exit.  The devs were supposed to adjust this but it appears only for when a survivor rolls out.\n\nMaybe party making with friends will be here soon but I fear how that will impact the balancing as the game intentionally does not any communications.  \n\n**DEV WISHLIST**\n\nAfter Action Review Chat Room with my party!!!!!!! or while

However, with a few small improvements this game could be one of the best in my libary. \n\nFirstly the pros. The idea and concept of this game is very exciting. There is endless room for new survivors, murderers and maps through updates or dlc. Also, the perk tree which is already a fantastic addition to the game, can also easily be expanded. The game creates the type of fear you enjoy expieriencing and will leave you coming back for more.\n\nHowever, there are many bugs in this game which need to be fixed. Many of the characters (murderers and survivors) and very unbalanced and you often see the same characters every game because they are simply better. Also, survivors can easily exploit the endless loop in which the murderer cannot catch you. Finally, just finding a game seems to be a difficult task in this game. It frequently freezes and as the murderer you can end up waiting 10 minutes for games. \n\n","timestamp_created":1468003089,"timestamp_updated":1468003089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24188462","author":{"steamid":"76561198314221579","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1331,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1660607475},"language":"russian","review":"Directx 11 но игра его не видит.
