i will start i would like to say few things.\n\n1. I Pre-ordered this game and started to play as soon as it was released (Early Access).\n2. I played as both sides and as different killers. I picked killers for Rituals or when I was bored with my main.\n3. I played the game since release and stopped playing it before Plague release. Tried to play again but it was not fun at all. Returned after Plague release to play a bit and stopped again. This time for long or forever. \n4. Review was changed many times. Patches, DLC, new mechanics.\n5. Review is based on my taste but also exist as a warning for newcomers and adequate gamers in general. This game is an example of \"braindead\" game and developers \"balance\" idea is based (at least it looks like it) on entitled and stupid survivors complains. It is very, i repeat, very survivor-sided game. There were stupid things on killer side too. Doctor and Nightmare original design, NOED etc. \nIf you are a player who loves games with variety and deep interesting mechanics, then this game is not for you at all. If you are competitive type, then it is also not for you. Try FPS, FGS whatever. Problem with this game is core mechanics. Metabuilds and nerfs only make it worse.\n\n\n[h1]Lobbies[/h1]\n\nAs killer you have to wait a lot to find 4 survivors. It can vary from 2 minutes to 15. Sometimes it is a problem to find last survivor. Sometimes survivors have high pings (200+).\n\n[h1]Perks[/h1]\n\nThey can be overpowered, weak or average. There are so called \"metabuilds\" with few well known by DbD community perks. Decisive strike, Sprint burst, Self-care for survivor, NOED and RUIN for killer. Players use them too often, and I can't really blame them. At least half of DLC perks are trash. Not to mention default perks like Deja Vu. Wtf will anyone use Deja Vu when you can get better aura-related perk?\n\n[h1]SWF[/h1]\n\n1. Highly toxic in many cases.\n2. Source of some pre-match/loading screen disconnection errors.\n3. In some cases scum that use mics outside game for advantage.\n4. In many cases with low intelligence and therefore they can be suicidal. Pray that you are not solo player. If you are - be prepared that you'll have to fix all gens yourself.\n5. Source of lobby dodges. \n6. Source of fools in high ranks.\n\n[h1]Hatch[/h1]\n\nYou don't need to do anything to use it. If 2 generators are fixed and you are the last person alive - Hatch is opened. You can escape.\nBad design. Lack of any motivation for player to \"work hard\" to escape. It should be opened manually, by survivor. Skill checks and stuff like that.\nAlso it should not appear if survivor was useless whole match. \n\n[h1]Braindead or annoying killers[/h1]\n\n1. Doctor. All you have to do is walk and use your shock therapy power in random places. Ain't that a good description for vocabulary when you search for \"braindead killer\"?\nWith his perks and few others - It's even more braindead. Since he was my main...yeah...I remember when i played as him after release and saw many DC's. I can understand those players. Doctor will destroy stealth even if he is very bad player. Speaking of bad. Many Doctor players i played against were bad. Coincidence?\n\n2. Nightmare. Not very good but...he is invisible. It's hard to spot him. You'll hear a song but it will be a challenge to learn his location. He'll drag you to the dream world. Btw, in Dream World he will see your aura. Cool, aye? \nAt least Wraith is still visible when cloaked. He can't drag you into any world and can't see your aura.\n\n3. Legion. I mentioned why in my DLC review. He is weak but annoying. He can chase you whole match. Time killer should be his name. I wanted to play as him for some time but he's bad =(.\n\nFunny coincidence: Some DLC killers are simplified or braindead versions of original killer. Cannibal can't \"control the map\" like Billy can but he can easily down few survivors at once in close range. \nI already compared Nightmare to Wraith so...\n\nI understand that there should be a choice for not very hardcore killer players,ä but devs went too far with some killers.\n\n[h1]Other[/h1]\n\n1. You can stuck on loading screen. Only solution is to manually close the game. You will lose your offering.\n2. Too many players with high ping.\n3. A lot of disconnections from survivors.\n4. Many survivors press \"Ready\" button in lobby at the last moment. Waste of players time.\n5. A lot of insults post match and fake reports.\n\nFew of my old screenshots. To show you what kind of game it is.\n\n\"Nothing is fair, everything is permitted\"  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1676279397\n\n\"Survivor entitlement or You could have farmed with me\"  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1674235244\n\n\"False report\"  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1676377800\n\nGameplay as killer (last match before i stopped playing it):\n\n1. Found survivor. Chased him for some time (Huntress is slow). Hooked him.\n2. Tried to find another survivor. First one was unhooked. Chased another survivor. Was blinded by flashlight. Dropped the survivor.\n3. Chased first survivor. Tried to hook him. Dropped him because was I blinded by flashlight. It's same player with flashlight btw. The one i sacrificed later.\n4. Chased annoying Meg with flashlight. Wasted a lot of time running around building. Jake was standing near exit, while gates were opened of course. I have tried to find the remaining survivors and found Meg near rock. One fatass survivor appeared and tried to use flashlight on me. Failed and i downed Meg near the exit gate. Survivor ran around circle and escaped. I hooked Meg. Someone posted some classic DbD crap in chat and i left before i could read it.\nOnly one sacrifice. Wasted time for nothing. \n\n01.11.20 - Fixed errors. Logged only to claim free shards.\n\n22.02.20 - Fixed some errors in text. Haven`t played the game since The Plague release. Just want to say few things. \nDevs introduced new mechanics. Reworked Doctor and Nightmare. \nI am not Behavior hater. I understand how much they changed in game since release. Problem is, this game is still very annoying and unbalanced. M1 to win is real thing. Killers are joke. Metabuilds is a thing. It is a hooker simulator. You can be complete idiot and still win as survivor. In the end, i played 95% as survivor, for relaxed matches...\nI haven't received any reward for pre-ordering the game in EA. \nI don't plan to return to DbD unless they will seriously rework metabuilds (or introduce class system), allow killers to be killers and punish those who deserve it, instead of innocent players. Too many years were wasted on DbD. I was a bit younger and less picky.\n\n11.10.19 - After all those years this game is still below average. Still too many mentally unstable players. Still same annoying and repetitive gameplay. Annoying arcade game it is. I tried to return after different patches but i just can`t play it for too long. I guess if you are not mentally unstable and your life is not completely useless, then this type of games is not for you. I can understand why games like CS:Go are popular. Those games require good aiming etc. You are on equal terms with your enemy. Simple and balanced game. In DbD however, you can be shit player and still win. You don`t need to be sharpshooter, good driver, good fighter etc. One button to heal. One button to unhook players. One button to open gates. It`s the same button btw. Indeed braindead gameplay. Not a surprise that many DbD players are complete idiots.\nThis timer thing devs introduced in patch which activates after gates are opened is a joke. Now survivors can`t waste killer time infinitely, but that doesn`t mean that they can`t at all. \nWait for Last Year steam release (if) or find different genre of games. There is no alternative.","timestamp_created":1479575659,"timestamp_updated":1604229158,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26695168","author":{"steamid":"76561198113352846","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":69940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":605,"playtime_at_review":21292,"last_played":1659911746},"language":"english","review":"I love this game, people think you'd get burned out easily of it but you will have a great time","timestamp_created":1479574779,"timestamp_updated":1511716491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26694815","author":{"steamid":"76561198120448089","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3338,"last_played":1560623931},"language":"russian","review":"много недоработок","timestamp_created":1479573677,"timestamp_updated":1479573677,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26694711","author":{"steamid":"76561198013465990","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":50835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29413,"last_played":1574607141},"language":"english","review":"This game is broken.\n\n\"I think we did a pretty good job so far\" -

With more stuff brought to the game, the game gets more buggy, unrealistic hitboxes and a toxic community to join in.\n\n- The killers will tunnel you, will face camp you and later tell you aftermatch what a 'pus-sy' you are for using decisive strike or borrowed time to give the person who just got of the hook a little chance to enjoy this round as well. But you might think it stops, when they have knocked you on the floor, no. Then they slug and write 'gg ez' aftermatch with only 17k from 32k possible points. Honstely I am not even mad at team mates who disconnect anymore cus mostly I can really understand their frustration.\n\n- Sadly the toxic behavior is found on both sides. Most people will not care about you when you are on the hook and more care about their poor gen that needs constant attention. That their team mates are slaughtered is the 'little' price they are happily willing to pay. Sometimes, they will just farm points on unhooking while it's not safe and no borrowed time is used to farm points no matter if the round just started or it's close to the end. Even when trying to be a fair killer, survivor will tea bag you and call you are noob for trying to be fair and nice.\n\n+ The only fun I often find in the game is the few games when people actually play like a team and makes it a funny round and a great killer who leaves the fairness to the game.\n\n+ I can recommend the game if you plan to play it with friends, the sruvivor round will be so much easier if you talk with the people you are playing with and have a good tactic to survive.\n\nI do honstely love this game but sadly it get's less and less fun to play.
