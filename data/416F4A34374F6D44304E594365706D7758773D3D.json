Not all ofc there are some killers who still can \"jump scare you\". \n\n- when you are killer there can be friends who know this game and you as a killer with rank 20 can play against players who were rank 1 or WHO ARE rank 1 .. that means you have chance to get them, but it will be really hard. \n\nNow something what is really bad on this game and thats killer called leatherface .. he is really unbalanced in this game .. how? Well he can get all survivors on dying state .. he can use his chainsaw without cooldown and also there is nothing what can stop him NO NOT EVEN PALLET. And imagine when you are on the hook and he just camp (that means he is waiting till you die.. no thats not how to play this game). Then there is something like misshit with hunteress .. hit hen you are near window. Also when you are trying to stun killer with a pallet, it just \"teleports\" you to killer .. ya that happened to me XYZ times so he got free hit. \n\nThis game is good, its fun .. mostly when you play with someone if you are killer and you play leatherface please DO NOT face camp .. its really annoying .. you will never get 2 rankups when you will play like that and also you will get like 16k bloodpoints as a killer .. \n\nYou can meet friendly killer (sometimes me) that means he is not gonna kill you, he just got mission/quest and wanna get some bloodpoints, thats really nice in this game.. but then you get someone who is facecamping and thats really bad. When you are killer and you wanna play at the morning or at late night you will wait for match 15-35 min :) and if you are lucky enought someone loose connection and you will be in queue again :) \n\nMy personal rating is 7/10 \nMinus for :  Bugs, Leatherface, Long searching for match when you are killer","timestamp_created":1471585224,"timestamp_updated":1593682732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25006160","author":{"steamid":"76561198131356884","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2693,"last_played":1485250607},"language":"schinese","review":"不错 但是匹配系统不是很好","timestamp_created":1471585221,"timestamp_updated":1471585221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511494219303131104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25006158","author":{"steamid":"76561198313961823","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1930,"last_played":1614102214},"language":"schinese","review":"《黎明杀机》作为一个小作坊生产的游戏，它在许多方面是有明显不足的，尤其体现在BUG众多、平衡性较差、内容少易产生疲劳感。不过好在制作组愿意且善于听取玩家的意见，比如响应中国玩家对于汉化的要求、推出新的服装外观、新的人类和屠夫等等，都可以看到官方的诚意。\n对于一家规模小的游戏公司、对于一款要价68（现为82）的游戏来说，作为玩家的我们不应该过于苛刻。从游戏发布至今经过数个版本的更新和修复工作，它正在不断地完善，并且其作为恐怖游戏的核心特色仍在深化，对于DbyD的前景我是看好的，并推荐入手，只要你喜欢该类型的游戏，就一定可以发现它的迷人之处。","timestamp_created":1471585193,"timestamp_updated":1471585193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534246563911437988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25006146","author":{"steamid":"76561198098004675","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1905,"last_played":1593522222},"language":"schinese","review":"非常好玩","timestamp_created":1471585092,"timestamp_updated":1471585092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25006134","author":{"steamid":"76561198098673467","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":44401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6233,"last_played":1598691031},"language":"schinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1471585037,"timestamp_updated":1471585037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25006123","author":{"steamid":"76561198217134976","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4087,"last_played":1572183847},"language":"english","review":"An amazing game, easily one of my favourites.

They managed to absolutely overtune killers and transform the survivor experience from an engaging fun experience to \"cows in slaughterhouse simulator\". This idea that killers should be on a power trip and absolutely slay survivors except for maybe 1 person makes it a terrible experience for anyone to play except the killer. I speak playing as a Rank 1 survivor. You'd think it'd be obvious that in a game that requires a 4-to-1 player ratio that you want to make sure it's actually fun for the side that requires 4 players, not create an environment where it's every man for himself. Fueled by the lack of quality of life changes for the long queue times, the fact that if you queue with friends you'll just spend 10 minutes repeatedly pressing \"Ready\" every 2-3 seconds until you find a lobby for the killer to instantly dodge just makes this the most mundane experience ever. \n\nI considered this game fun with its problems before the DLC but until they fix all the issues in this new recent change, I would say to AVOID THIS MESS.","timestamp_created":1471580699,"timestamp_updated":1471580799,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565780401229858398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005414","author":{"steamid":"76561198281059823","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2187,"last_played":1496025502},"language":"english","review":"This game is super addictive and awesome.

Well. I have no clue how to feel about this one. Sometimes some people are jerks and can ruin a game sometimes you find people that just make it all the better. The community itself isn't a super bad thing I actually find some decent people but the devs really do need to fix camping or nerf it in some way as most of the time it benefits literally nobody ( so why do you killers do it ) and it's really just kind of annoying. \n- The devs. For all the shit they get they actually do listen to fans on things like twitter and aren't that terrible I actually like the devs for once and I think they are paying attention we just need to tell them what's wrong not just riot against them.\n\n\nAll in all if you're just reading guides to think about getting the game.

The goal of the game depends on the role you take: killer or survivor. I have chosen to dedicate most of my time into the survivors, because to level them up you must put bloodpoints into their bloodweb. So yes, this game does not save the same data on all the charaters . This makes even more time to put countless hours into playing the game. The objective of the game if you are survivor is to escape; as for killer it is to make sure the four survivors don't make it out alive. You will turn on generators, search chests, help each other, and unlock many perks and items. Now it is up to you to figure out how to play well, how to gather new items, and most importantly: not get hooked. No matter how many people complain about bugs, I know the developers are trying to fix them and we just have to be patient. So many reviews say this game has too many bugs, and it may have quite a few, but it is not like the devs aren't trying to fix them while trying to do at least five other things. The devs are only getting better at patching it and making DLC and what not. Sure, they don't get it right every time with each update, but I've seen progess beyond belief.","timestamp_created":1471579014,"timestamp_updated":1511529781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005153","author":{"steamid":"76561198028515425","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":39649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6228,"last_played":1658456824},"language":"english","review":"used to be really fun. all the new changes aren't","timestamp_created":1471578939,"timestamp_updated":1628887310,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500587582588195801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005130","author":{"steamid":"76561198318033558","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1597930365},"language":"schinese","review":"good game ,very nice","timestamp_created":1471578802,"timestamp_updated":1471578802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005112","author":{"steamid":"76561198318513162","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3085,"last_played":1655456237},"language":"schinese","review":"更新以后打了四局，掉出去三局，还莫名其妙掉了段，也是醉了","timestamp_created":1471578710,"timestamp_updated":1471578710,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500531494617462158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005108","author":{"steamid":"76561198085190418","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":20810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":776,"last_played":1608070817},"language":"english","review":"DIS GAME GOOD","timestamp_created":1471578681,"timestamp_updated":1471578681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444859027862548828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005095","author":{"steamid":"76561198318745519","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4576,"last_played":1537308559},"language":"english","review":"new update making my game glitchy it takes forever to join a game also when you try to join a game it sometimes brings you in a middle of someone els is game all you can do is watch and wait for them to finish. but most of the time im clicking join button waitting fail are it resets and i have to go back hitting the join button to see what random thing its going to do","timestamp_created":1471578637,"timestamp_updated":1471578637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467700004577636719","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25005000","author":{"steamid":"76561198011731961","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":7561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4077,"last_played":1642991970},"language":"french","review":"comment detruire un jeu rajouter un tuer qui voit tout !!!! se jeu est rendu une vrai dumpe\nde plus ces bouré de cheater","timestamp_created":1471578012,"timestamp_updated":1478058466,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25004974","author":{"steamid":"76561198228186460","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":41034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1512,"last_played":1658644885},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun.

Почти основная часть перков добавляет каких-то 2-15% к чему-то, да вы эти цифры вообще никак не почувствуете почти в катыче, но это все ради баланса , как я понял спустя 100ч, т к некоторые перки реально доставляют и от них может подгореть.   9/10\n3) Довольно дешевые DLC , которые тебе дают 2х персов, с особыми способностями и перками, это класс( т к --- геймплея на этом меркнет).  10/10  ( ставлю десять из-за нескольких халявных DLC :)  )\n4) Графеееен...это.. п здц, вроде бы и Unreal Engine, но чего-то слабовато, плюс ко всему еще и подфризивает иногда, оптимизации привет. Но все же оптимизация здесь не на самом дне. 6/10\n5) Лобби, х з почему убийца является сервером, это п здц как странно, т к если он качает гай порн, у всех будет дико лагать и т д. Также иногда долго набираются люди ( их всего 4.. 4 сурвов!) 4/10\n6) Баланс, по-моему самое больное место всех онлайн-игр, но здесь после длительного периода( где-то полгода от релиза) баланс реально появляется и работает он неплохо.  10/10\n\nИтог: игра на любителя, такие не всем заходят уж точно, но со скидкой советую взять и поиграть.","timestamp_created":1471577874,"timestamp_updated":1534672009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25004897","author":{"steamid":"76561198050882497","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":23032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18022,"last_played":1548877855},"language":"english","review":"fun times","timestamp_created":1471577457,"timestamp_updated":1511446519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25004840","author":{"steamid":"76561198045244712","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1507686480},"language":"english","review":"I really wish there was a neutral button for the rating system, but since there isn't I'm going to have to say \"No\", and here's why.\n\n First off, this is NOT a survival horror game, at least according to the community. It's a \"competetive\" game that should not be taken lightly... Spite ALL the evidense against it.\n\nMany exploits have been pinned as \"strategys\" by the community, and any attempt to remove them causes a massive uproar in the community. The community refuses to disscuss any form of middle road in this game, and has become a cesspool of j*ck*sses.\n\nThis game COULD be good if the right patches and balences are done, but seeing how the community is hell bent on this game being absolutly perfect as it is, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.\n\nThis game is, however, a MASSIVE BLAST when playing with freinds. It's scary, paced excellently, and can ressult in some really funny moments.. If only the rest of the community didn't ruin the main experience. It's a bit buggy, but I've found most problems were in the mechanics themselves... And you already know what's going on with that.\n\nSo for a score, by it'self, it's a 4/10\n\nFor with freinds, it's a 7/10, given your with the right group of people\n\nAlso yes, all rumors about trying to join a game is buggy as f*ck is true... A good cause of this might be a lower playerbase due to the community being a bunch of rightious pricks, but I have no proof of that, so I'll just assume it's just naturally buggy.\n\n","timestamp_created":1471577120,"timestamp_updated":1471577120,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531300961971282959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25004811","author":{"steamid":"76561197978079404","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6892,"last_played":1536191670},"language":"english","review":"This game has so much potential but the execution is just abysmal.

Firstly, to queue with a friend you have to join a lobby, invite the friend, both have to click ready, then if it says no games found, you have to press ready again. It can even be as bad as kicking you from the lobby to the main menu, where you have to go through the process again. It's such a simple fix, mind you not the finding a game itself, but the having to sit in the lobby waiting for the inevitable ''NO MATCHES FOUND'' so you can click ready again. \n\nNow when you think about it, sure, the devs could be trying to work it out, but they decided to push a free weekend on patch day, where the patch did not include a lobby fix. This goes to show that the developers are more interested in pushing out half-assed content than fixing one of the core things that needs to be fixed. \n\nI have warned my friends off of this game, and will continue doing so if others ask me about it.

The killers are sort of OP, but as a decent survivor you've got a chance as long as the killers aren't campers. What is absolutely killing this game though is the bugs.\n\n-Items will disappear between matches.\n-Matchmaking just wont work period, you will either queue up for days, or get into a match where the killer has got shit ping.\n-Struggle will auto-fail for no specific reason.\n\nThe matchmaking is a fucking joke, they have since fixed it being a complete loss for survivors if the killer disconnects, but the game is still defaulting to the killer hosting, instead of the most reliable host, or even just having dedicated servers.\n\nIf you try to queue up with friends the matchmaking ready up forces you to press ready so many times because the game can't just continue to search like every other game on steam. That or the ready up will bug out and you'll be stuck in a lobby that you can't exit and are forced to close from task manager.\n\nThe inclusion of a new killer and survivor as a separate DLC that is currently free, but not included in the game [i.e. you have to actually add it to your game] convinces me that the Devs are gonna slip one under unattentive players, and end up charging for it eventually, and considering Payday 2, it would surprise no one. I would also not be surprised if these cunts decided to try and release this fucking bug ridden disaster on console, considering the push to add controller support, but not actually fix the game.\n\nAbsolutely, cannot recommend it in its current state, and don't believe the updates about this game being 1.0 or whatever, it is absolutely not ready for full release. The settings menu is a fucking joke with no real customizable options, the game looks like some alpha shit, systems in the gameplay are barely working, and running into bugs is a common occurence. Don't buy this game yet, give it like 6 more months to fix itself, I will update my review when the game is working to a consumer standard.\nEDIT: Holy crap, I called this from ten miles away, not bug fixing but adding button prompts for a console version.\n\nPS: CAN WE GET FUCKING DEDICATED SERVERS, holy shit if you have the killer host the game, it's way too prevalent that in the last few survivors, the host will \"suddenly start having conneciton problems\" that benefit no one except the killer.

Before I started playing this game, I was a depressed loser who would spend all day jerking off in his room to women who would probably never even take a glance at me in real life. I'd spend most of my time playing video games in my room, being envious of the social interactions that my characters would have no matter how minuscule because I knew that I could never achieve such a feat. I would never be able to look another person in the eye due to what damage I have done to myself. I thought my depression was gonna be eternal. I would sit in my room all day, my mother would occasionally come in and tell me I'm a fat c*nt and leave me with a plate of salad and dry chicken as I cried myself to sleep once again, returning to my 18 hour a day hibernation. I couldn't even bare to imagine what it would be like to interact with a woman.\n\nUntil this game appeared in my Store Recommendations. The elegance of it's design, the silky smooth responses of the buttons and the arousing and enticing features drew me in like a moth to a flame. I installed this game immediately and immediately I felt hair grow on my chest. I ignored this funny sensation until I opened the game and started playing it. Before I knew it, I have grown a whole 6 inches in height making me an impressive 6'5 feet tall, My chest was covered in hair like a grizzly bear, I had a cleanly shaven beard and I had lost at least 60% of my body fat. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. In fact I could not put into real words what emotional response this game gave me.\n\nOvertime I realised that the game was giving me much more female attention. Simply muttering the word \"DBD\" near any woman immediately made them look in my direction and bite their lip and my phone would be filled up with numbers of women ranging from their 20's to the h*rny MILFs in my area. Since Dead By Daylight, I have rearranged the internal organs of thousands of women and single handedly started a single mother epidemic in my home country. I cannot leave my house anymore without the mere scent of my presence releasing the hounds after me. I have even become irresistible to men, immediately turning even the strongest and most masculine men into merely catboy twinks, also known as the ideal male body.\n\nDead by Daylight is the reason why I am currently married and have 12 children and live in a mansion build using money I stole from Bezos that he handed me in pure fear of my sheer power and strength.

Jogo desde 2016 e não notei quase nenhuma diferença entre balanceamento e bugs, sim, eu sei que algumas coisas foram nerfadas como os infinites, janelas bloquearem, esse tipo de coisa, mas no geral, não mudou muito, sobreviventes continuam sendo muito roubados após todos esses anos e é muito chato jogar de assassino se você cai em um time de quatro pessoas todas em comunicação e elas te gen-rusham e você não tem o que fazer contra. Não vou dizer que só os assassinos tem problemas, sobreviventes tem, mesmo sendo menos que os dos assassinos, continuam tendo problema, a hitbox é quebrada desde o lançamento do jogo e eles simplesmente não ajeitaram ela em [u]CINCO[/u] anos de jogo e só ficam lançando DLC atrás de DLC para conseguir lucrar ao máximo e não ajeitam isso, além de que não balancear o jogo. Se você for querer comprar isso, se prepare para partidas desbalanceadas quando seu MMR ou ranque ficar alto, isso vai causar muito estresse em você. Minha conclusão: se comprar, não jogue para ser um \"profissional\" de assassino, porque você vai sofrer demais, jogue somente de sobrevivente e fique \"profissional\" lá porque vale mais a pena, e também não se esqueça de trazer mais três pessoas com você usar todos as vantagens META que eles quase nunca nerfam, enquanto nerfam quase todas as vantagens METAS do assassino, mas isso é uma outra história, e o mais importante de tudo, use uma chave e coloque para a escotilha aparecer em um local específico a partir de oferendas para você e seus amigos escaparem da partida faltando um gerador, mas aproveita que isso vai ser mudado logo em!","timestamp_created":1471567859,"timestamp_updated":1632948260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25003097","author":{"steamid":"76561197979959354","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":38812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35828,"last_played":1471497914},"language":"english","review":"First off this game will frustrate you before you even get to play. The matchmaking system does not work 19/20 times. \n\nWhat's more damning is that the developers seem intent on making this game worse with every update they release. Sadly this game will end up going the same route of payday 2 and end up alienating all but the tiniest sliver of their player base. \n\nPlaying a survivor has been nerfed to the point it is no longer fun. The infinite jukes had to go, there is no doubt about that. However, they didn't stop there and it took single drop of fun out of this game. \n\nPlaying as a killer? Remember that matchmaking problem? Yea it's worse as a killer. You can spend half an hour waiting for a game and still not find one because nobody wants to play as a survivor anymore. \n\nIf the developers find a way to undo what they have done this game could be great but again. Unfortunately it looks as though they simply don't care what their player base thinks. \n\nI give this game 3/10 and those 3 points come solely from the fun I had before this game was destroyed by developers that are utterly clueless.

This update came with 3 things a new killer, a new character, and a new map. If this is the plan for future charged dlc than you guys will be losing a very large player base. It seems greedy to me that you guys are going to nickle and dime your player base you wont have one for long. Another thing that also catches my eye is the lack of being able to play when the DLC is not downloaded. What I beleive this means for the player base is that if you do not have the newest DLC you will be UNABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. This alone will make many players, who perhaps dont have large wallets, to lose the game over a paid DLC. This seems to me to be an incredibly greedy move on the devs part. If you plan on making the game a pay to play pay again to play experince than why not just go free to play and make it so you have to unlock killers and survivors but dont nickle and dime your player base. YOU WILL LOSE, dont test it.....Not to mention the game is not complete and you took it off early access on steam. You  guys have shown no regard for what the players want and have shown that through your streams. You refuse to pay attention to the bugs and actually make the game polished before you 'release' it. It seems that the devs have lost focus on what they want and are trying to find away to make as much money as possible before the game dies. We dont want new content we want the match making fixed, things balanced, and most of all for the devs to actually care about the people who play their games.

Every map and character has it's own story that you can read on the website, it's especially interesting to see what made the Killers become what they are\n-Simple gameplay\n-Actually challenging\n-Lots of new patches, Dev's don't abandon the game and add new content, also have Twitch sessions (Kudos to you, Dev's)\n-Cool leveling system\n-Prestige when you reach lvl 50, maximum is Prestige 3 so lots of motivation to keep playing\n\nBad things:\n-Matchmaking takes a while, especially with the Survive with Friends option. But it's not as horrible as a lot of reviews say, it really just depends how many people are online. With around 15k people online, I need alone like 2 minutes to find a lobby and with a friend around 5.\n-Balancing issues due to a lot of patches that try to find that balance\n-Sometimes the game crashes but that's very very rare\n-Toxic community.
