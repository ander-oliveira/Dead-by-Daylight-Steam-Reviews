But overall, it's not bad for a $10 early access game. Oh wait...\n\nFirst off, let me state that no communication in a co-op game is horrible. If you are playing with randoms, good luck. No in-game chat or text chat. \n\nSurvivors are becoming less fun to play with each passing update as they get less useful and monsters are becoming increasingly more powerful. If you get caught, the monster will more often than not place you on a hook and just camp you until you are out of the game and you can easily be the first picked off in multiple matches in a row if you don't memorize the maps. Items are hard to come by, and being able to pick different characters is more of a hindrance due to the fact that characters level up seperately (ie. Dwight levels up on his own path apart from Meg or Claudette). Monsters host and by default get the best latency, which will become obvious as you jump through windows or drop obstacles behind you and the monster will still land hits on you even if you are out of reach.\n\nGameplay as a survivor is simple. You walk around, half hiding and half looking for power generators and performing various quicktime events. Did you expect to experience actual thrills in this game?\n\nThe tree of logical choices to make as a survivor are:\nA.) Are you the last alive?\nIf yes: Hide in a bush or corner somewhere and maybe the monster will get bored of hunting you down and disconnect. This will count as a victory for you because there are no time limits for this game. Finding the trap door as the last alive is almost harder than actually starting the rest of the generators on your own.\nIf no: Find a buddy and stick with them. Both of you are gonna die, but its better to walk around with some disposable bait anyways. Try and get the generators going. Any monster worth their salt will be able to single out and find/dispose of survivors over time, and many of the quick time events will get one or both of you killed by constantly lighting up your location unless every survivor is a quicktime God.\n\nB.) Do you have disposable items and perks yet?\nIf yes: Actually put some effort into trying to escape. If you die you will lose your items. Yes, that ultra rare toolbox you earned after putting in 20 hours into the game can and likely will disappear due to the folly of some random messing up a quick time event.\nIf no: Just go in and try to net some points. Doesn't matter how many times you die, you will always get some blood points to get those items you will lose anyways.\n\nApart from that, survivors are just generally at an all around disadvantage. I've played maybe 30 matches and won only once as a survivor.\n\nMonsters on the other hand have nothing to fear. There is no clock putting pressure on them before the sun rises and they disintegrate to nothing, there is no magic sword in the woods to banish darkness that the survivors can wield against them; they literally just can do as they please. Injuries are easy to get on survivors as it only takes 1 hit, and once injured you can bloody well track them across the world if you need to. Perks for monsters are almost always more favorable than perks for survivors.\n\nRecent updates are finally getting better for the game as a whole though, because now I can finally play the game with my friends without searching for half an hour for a lobby with my friend in it to begin with, but that should have been shipped with the game. Free dlc updates are a plus in my book too, but the game is still overpriced for a quick time event simulator. What this game really needs is a free trial where you can play a match or 2 before deciding if you want to dive into it, but do to the fact that pre-update friend matchmaking took up more than my 2 hours of refund time I couldn't refund it.\n\ntl;dr The scariest part of this game is when you realize you've played too many hours to refund it and find yourself typing up an essay of a review about your experience. Save your money, get this on sale at half off or more.","timestamp_created":1471846596,"timestamp_updated":1471846596,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477958232164382935","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067559","author":{"steamid":"76561198072480869","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":50,"playtime_at_review":1323,"last_played":1659809599},"language":"russian","review":"Затягивает) и не дает уснуть)","timestamp_created":1471846507,"timestamp_updated":1471846507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52902519702911377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067435","author":{"steamid":"76561198109276298","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":24093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":613,"last_played":1653107696},"language":"thai","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1471845676,"timestamp_updated":1471845676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067413","author":{"steamid":"76561198089943203","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1411,"last_played":1637338531},"language":"english","review":"I played this game on the free weekend and the beta and i enjoyed my self both times the game is really buggy but playing with friends in a discord call or skype it is extremely fun and tense. most of the people who are down voting are playing to be competative but i believe the best way to play this game is to have fun with ur friends and work together it is a casual survival horror that i will definatly be buying","timestamp_created":1471845557,"timestamp_updated":1471845557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497175127267837524","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067370","author":{"steamid":"76561197977274082","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":78681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71865,"last_played":1658037492},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty good.","timestamp_created":1471845292,"timestamp_updated":1623229064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067344","author":{"steamid":"76561198275411309","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1433,"last_played":1565257715},"language":"czech","review":"Neumím to.","timestamp_created":1471845131,"timestamp_updated":1481984299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067304","author":{"steamid":"76561198103018453","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1489085827},"language":"english","review":"I had my fun with this game.

Dabei müssen sie aber gegen einen \"Killer\" Spielen, der ihnen das Leben schwer machen kann. Nach jedem Game gibt es dan \"Bloodpoints\" um seinen Charakter zu Leven um Perks und Items freizuschalten.\n\nSo mal das Grundprinzip bei Seite..\n\nMan hat die Auswahl (wenn man die DLC´s gekauft hat) zwischen sehr vielen spielbaren Charakteren. Wo man als Überlebender eher wenig vielfalt erwarten kann da man als Survivor ehh immer das selbe macht, da kommt es eher auf die, Cosmetischen sachen an, ist das bei den Killern ein bisschen anders. Auch wenn sie imgrunde alle die selbe Grundmechanik sich Teilen, haben alle unterscheide Werten und Fähichkeiten. Die Nurse kann sich Teleportieren, der Trapper legt nun ja... \"Traps\", der Wraith kann sich unsichtbar machen und noch vieles mehr.. \n\nState of the Game: \n\nWenn man durch Soziale Netzwerke schaut oder mal Streams zuschaut oder einfach mal in das Steam Forum schaut wird sehr schnell merken das es dort viele Diskussionen über Balancing etc. gibt.\nMomentan ist es nicht gebalanced. SWF (Survive with Friends) ist broken, da man mit Voice coms (aka Discord / Ts3) sich einen enormen vorteil verschaffen kann. Es gibt Probleme mit dem Sound für Killer da man die schritte eines Überlebenden nicht hören kann wenn er rennt. uvm. Ich möchte über Perks wie DS (Decicive Strike) garnicht erst anfangen zu reden. Es ist momentan einfach nur sehr Survivor sided das Game.\n\nSpiele als Survivor: Du bekommst sehr sehr einfach einen pip zum Rang aufstieg alleine wenn du Generatoren machst und entkommst.\n\nSpiele als Killer: Du hast die härteste Zeit deines Lebens. 90% der Spiele ist mindestens einer dabei der DS benutzt was dir sehr viel Zeit nimmt. Wirst durch die ganze Map von Pallete zu Pallete geloopt. Bist gestresst das du einen Pip bekommst und musst dafür sogar am Ende evtl noch einen Campen was kein spaß macht nur damit du deinen Rang nicht verlierst und wirst bei SWF Gruppen vor dem Hacken body blocked uvm. Wenn du das Perk \"Hex: Ruin\" nicht verwendest wirst du gerusht und bekommst evtl sogar garkeine Punkte. Jede Sekunde Zeit die der Killer rausziehen kann ist enorm wichtig.\nSolange diese Probleme bestehen würde ich davon abraten Killer zu spielen.\n\nWenn du mit den sachen klar kommst kann ich dir Dead by Daylight trozdem noch Empfehlen.\nWarum?\nDas Spiel hat sehr viel Potential und die Dev´s sind dahinter das Spiel interessant zu hatlen. Es kommen regelmäßig Bugfixes, Patche´s, neue Killer & Survivor etc. \nMan hat als Horror fan oder als Angsthase eine mege spielspaß\n\nIch hoffe dieser Review hat wenigstens ein bisschen geholfen dir bei deiner entscheidung zu helfen.\n\nWe shell see us ín the Fog ~ \n\nSylar","timestamp_created":1471844671,"timestamp_updated":1522746065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506276190280914307","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067271","author":{"steamid":"76561198104292467","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1628608301},"language":"russian","review":" Атмосфера на вышем уровне\n","timestamp_created":1471844612,"timestamp_updated":1471844612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505747139453887939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067254","author":{"steamid":"76561198099563171","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":166,"playtime_at_review":3261,"last_played":1660551410},"language":"schinese","review":"hello service:\n              I am flank piayers at dawn,i always abide by the rules of the rules of the game and\nwithout any external behavior,EAC without my account,cause l can't normal game,the hope can give an\n explabation","timestamp_created":1471844500,"timestamp_updated":1471844500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067208","author":{"steamid":"76561198159255005","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1696,"last_played":1566878093},"language":"english","review":"Just have to find friends to play with rather than wait for ques","timestamp_created":1471844174,"timestamp_updated":1471844174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067174","author":{"steamid":"76561198084820624","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":40690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":899,"last_played":1649835051},"language":"russian","review":"теперь никупить аплодирую разрабам...просто а ты теперь не поиграешь)","timestamp_created":1471843910,"timestamp_updated":1647242465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505747139453887939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067169","author":{"steamid":"76561198029504809","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1617590855},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1471843882,"timestamp_updated":1471843882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067143","author":{"steamid":"76561198146617387","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1626228299},"language":"schinese","review":"非常 好玩","timestamp_created":1471843769,"timestamp_updated":1471843769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067139","author":{"steamid":"76561198318000396","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1564,"last_played":1517659835},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩  玩得我心惊惊","timestamp_created":1471843734,"timestamp_updated":1471843734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25067115","author":{"steamid":"76561198020604922","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1471843402},"language":"english","review":"Hot garbage. \n\n\nVery glitchy, does not run half the time.

There is a learning curve in order to get good at it which in my opinion is a good thing. The game also has a massive progression system with perks items and addons.

When i logged back in i had a 15 minute DC penalty. In other news, the Public test branch reveals  your IP to other players and people are getting DDOSed and swatted. 10/10 would get kicked and punished again.  \n\nYears later, i am changing this to negative. Why? Devs are running the game into the ground. \nInstead of listening to feedback like in the early days, they now do as they please and you better like it. \n\nPublic test builds are a joke. Bugs and unbalance found in the PTB isnt fixed before release. \n\nGame has become a cash grab with over $100 in DLC, with many of the best perks locked behind DLC. They added a battle pass paid system that recycles cosmetics from the mobile version of the game. \n\nWhile the graphics and cosmetic artists seem to do good work, the teams in charge of game mechanics and bugs seem to be barely staffed. Really tells you where the priorities are. Bugs that have existed in the game for ages dont get fixed. New maps (and old maps for that matter) are still full of bugs and killers such as the nurse, who's power is to teleport through things, get stuck on random object like bushes ruining her power and frustrating the player. Not important enough to get fixed though.\n\nAnother troubling trend that seems to repeat over and over is killers or perks being OP at release then nerfed into the ground later once everyone has spent cash buying them.\n\nI'm sad because this was such a great game with such promise, but the devs fail over and over and over. The only reason this game is still popular is because there really is no competition that has managed to get enough player base to push it out. It does make a good streaming game on platforms like twitch but many of the streamers seem to be on the edge of jumping ship as the game hasnt brought much new in the way of game play since release. Once the spooky factor wears off, people realize quickly the game is best because its so mind numbingly boring, they can talk to chat while playing. \n\nQOL features such as modes for colorblind that people have asked for for literal years only get added to the game when bumbling devs make poor public PR moves. \n\nThey dont care about you or your experience. They only care about that green stuff in your wallet.  \n\n--------------------------------------\nOLD REVIEW\n\nlove this game. scarey and fun. devs hold weekly twitch streams and listen to feedback.\nthey also work hard and fast to fix bugs.\n\ngame will only get better with time and more content.\n\n10/10 would get murdered again.","timestamp_created":1471833151,"timestamp_updated":1636590315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25065403","author":{"steamid":"76561198098758365","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":481,"last_played":1605946608},"language":"russian","review":"Идея игры неплохая, реализация страдает из за множества багов","timestamp_created":1471833059,"timestamp_updated":1471833059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25065378","author":{"steamid":"76561198256982296","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":191453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40594,"last_played":1658551623},"language":"russian","review":"А почему бы и нет?","timestamp_created":1471832963,"timestamp_updated":1549673241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532216489315032959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25065362","author":{"steamid":"76561198135233440","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":69218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1770,"playtime_at_review":24102,"last_played":1660536211},"language":"english","review":"I love it.","timestamp_created":1471832855,"timestamp_updated":1471832855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461121141910552979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25065360","author":{"steamid":"76561198194299949","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13193,"last_played":1578824372},"language":"german","review":"Für das Geld, das beste und unterhaltsahmste Spiel dass ich jemals gekauft habe...

I find that I like Dwight when playing as survivor, and I like to play as The Wraith when playing as killer. Each playthrough is like a new experience; like watching the same movie but with various alternate endings. However, this community leaves a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to playing games that don't run on a dedicated server.\n\nCritical Review:\nThe community abuses the fundamental mechanics around ranking up and obtaining bloodpoints. \n\nSurvivor Example: players playing a survivor that are worried about their rank will intentionally D/C just before the killer places them on a hook. The surivor forfeits their bloodpoints obtained in exchange for maintaining their rank. Hmm, seem fair? This then immediately rewards the killer with the bloodpoints as if they were fully sacrified on the hook.\n\nKiller Example: players playing as the killer will camp you while you're on the hook, making it nearly impossible for others to rescue you. If the game is not going in favor of a killer that's worried about their rank, they will intentionally D/C. This is unfair as the survivors get ZERO bloodpoints for their efforts! There is a glitch where a killer can make it look like they \"lost\" their internet connection, which then rewards them full bloodpoints for each survivor being killed even though they were not.\n\nDoes this seem like a fair system?! This is an example of why online multiplayer games on a non-dedicated server are painful; everyone abuses them for their own personal gain.","timestamp_created":1471825980,"timestamp_updated":1473052385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25064079","author":{"steamid":"76561198155848918","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":142327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27700,"last_played":1643879978},"language":"english","review":"Re-review of game:\nDead By Daylight is meant to be a survival horror game. 4 survivors are trying to escape the hunting grounds of a Killer. Can you survive?\n\nSo I've spent alot of time on this game. I both love it and I hate it at the same time. The development team, I think, want this game to succeed. And they seem to put out patches as soon as they can, if a little too hasty at times. While I understand bugs will run plenty this latest patch is punishing experienced Survivors with incredibly long wait times if they aren't surviving with friends. I started typing this review 5 minutes after I hit the ready button and am still looking for a game. The overall feel of the community has alot of toxicity. That I can't fault the development team for... But why the rank system? They think they might implement season rewards for getting to Rank 1 in a month. I think if they get rid of ranks it would make a less toxic community right now.\n\nGame Balances are always getting skewwed leaning to one side or the other with each patch. So why do I still play this game you ask? At this time I hope my dedication will pay off in the long run. There are times where the development team have the game running wonderfully. And even better when I play against a good opponent that actually has manners. I've had several experiences where in post game chat lobby I compliment the killer for something that happened and they compliment the players for something that happened in game and I'm smiling from ear to ear with being able to share the joys and laughs from the match with the killer. Because at the end of it we are all playing the same game for the same reason hopefully. TO HAVE FUN!\n\nSadly I still can't fully recommend the game in its current state.\n\n\n(First Review Aug 21, 2016)\nAlright my review,\n\nI've spent 360 hours on this game. The concept itself is great and it's a ton of fun... when it's working correctly. I main as a survivor and moonlight as a killer. The game during my first 50 hours was a bit unforgiving. Learning the game mechanics and unfortunately leveling up Dwight (Perhaps the worst perk set ever). Later on my friends and I would lobby up together. During the next 150 hours it was fun. The balancing between characters was a bit skewwed but atleast it was playable. Both sides of the playing field have their Over Powered moments, which the dev's keep trying to balance out and make a fair playing field. However, that being said leads us to the most recent patch. Many new players think the developers are so in-tune with their game because they had 5 patches come out on Friday... That is not the case. The development team overshot their abilities and decided to have a free weekend the day after a major add-on to the game was release. Many bugs, glitches, and problems arose from this. If the dev's really cared about the game they would have not had free weekend after the patch. Instead opting for showing what the game was like and dangling the new chapter to tantalize potential buyers. But they broke so many game mechanics and left it over the weekend for seasoned survivors to suffer and seasoned killers to feel guilty about some kills they themselves know they should not have received. \n\nOverall I love this game but the way it has been going over the weekend I'm hesitant to continue playing this game.","timestamp_created":1471825702,"timestamp_updated":1475289841,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548611104488372803","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25064062","author":{"steamid":"76561198011546276","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1621964056},"language":"english","review":"Fun game to play.","timestamp_created":1471825618,"timestamp_updated":1471825618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25063988","author":{"steamid":"76561198311282565","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1525766299},"language":"english","review":"Was fun for the first hour while playing with friends.
