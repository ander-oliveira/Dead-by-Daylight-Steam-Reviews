  就在不久前，我和其他三个小伙伴去了趟寒风农场，因为我们听说这里住着个长相丑陋而朴实的农场主。我和小伙伴们都觉得来\n\n这里偷电 偷铁 倒腾土特产无疑是最好的选择。果不其然，朴实的农场主被我们兜的团团转，被我们偷走了全部的家当。我依稀记得\n\n那天当我们走向大门时农场主眼中的那份无奈与无助，他只能拿着那把电锯胡乱的挥舞。最后气疯了他甚至把那把陪伴了他多年的\n\n电锯向我们扔了过来没，就这样我带走了他的最后的家当。\n   \n   在那之后，我和小伙伴们决定出发去下一个目的地，那时一片美丽的庄园，听说那里住着个精明的猎人，会用他的捕兽夹来猎捕\n\n过往的猎物，而这次我们决定给他个教训。临走前，我带去了我最好的战利品——那把电锯，我想它能帮我威慑到那名猎人。\n \n   曾着夜色我们潜入了这片庄园。我们决定分头行动，于是我拿着电锯独自朝一台发电机走去，偷个电先，我心里如此说道。突然\n\n一股莫名的紧张感涌上心头，我抬头望去只看到一名升高八尺的大汉带着面狰狞的面具，正在一处草丛中布置他的捕猎夹。望着那\n\n巨大的夹子，我并没有心生恐惧，可能是因为上次的经历，我反而想在搞定一切之后带走一个当作记念。就在此时，那名大汉突然\n\n意识到这边发电机的异常响声，大步走了过来，我小心的规避他的视野，没有让他发现。大汉检查完一圈后，刚想离开，突然把头\n\n看向了我在的地方。我顿时心头一紧，怎么会，他应该发现不了我的。大汉越走越近，我突然意识到是我的电锯暴露了我的位置，\n\n刚想走，可为时已晚，大汉巨大的砍刀落在了我的身上。扑哧~我强忍着疼痛和内心的恐惧飞奔起来。如果我能逃出去，一定不会\n\n再带着电锯去偷电了。突然我的正前方有一个打开的箱子，里面有个医疗包，这一定时汪函留下的，这家伙从来不带走他看不上眼\n\n的土特产，可这刚好救了我。我赶紧扔掉电锯，拿起医疗包继续狂奔起来。几秒种之后，我发现猎人已经不再追我了，回头望去，\n\n看到他停在了那个箱子面前，我心中暗喜：终于根丢了吧。来不及看他了，我刚忙找个地方开始包扎我的伤口。忽然一个熟悉的声\n\n音，响彻庄园，嘶嘶嘶~污~。这不是农场主电锯的声音吗？难道他追到这来了？突然一声惨叫传来，一名队友在我前方不远处倒了\n\n下去，在他身旁站着那名猎人，可他的手中却拿着我刚丢下的电锯。WTF！那是我的电锯，重来只有我拿别人的东西，还没有谁能\n\n拿属于我的东西。我一股怒火涌上心头，朝队友倒下的地方冲去，王八蛋，敢拿我的东西，看我不遛死你。pia叽，愤怒的我并没有\n\n能留意脚边的夹子，刚刚好踩了上去。剧烈的疼痛让我瞬间清新过来，求生的欲望赶走了之前的愤怒的心情。我奋力的掰着夹子，\n\n可这么掰都掰不开，HELP HELP，我发疯的喊道。可，一切都晚了，在我的意识的最后，只有那越来越近越来越近的嘶嘶声。\n\nGAME

The only way to aquire these perks is to play the characters which they are unique to, Sprint Burst is only avaliable to Meg, Self Care is only avaliable to Claudette. The only way you can get these perks onto another character is to level these characters up to beyond level 35 and get the teachable version of their perk. Once you have done that, you are able to find these perks in the other characters bloodweb, bear in mind that you still need to randomly find these perks (And with the amount of perks in the game, it can take you to maximum level and beyond just to see these perks in their basic form). There is one other way you can get teachable perks which is through a shop called  'The Shrine of Secrets' which using a special currency you earn arbitarily within the game, you can buy from a selection of four perks which changes on a weekly basis. Regardless of how many perks you take every 7 days they will change, meaning if you take all the perks within the first 3/4 days by grinding out the currency, then you still need to wait another 4/3 days until any new perks show up.\n\nI could go on but following suit with the way this game is, I will leave this review unfinished.","timestamp_created":1483100377,"timestamp_updated":1483100377,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556877017021179199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28826057","author":{"steamid":"76561198355102178","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1508431443},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกมาก โดนผีแขวน","timestamp_created":1483099926,"timestamp_updated":1483099926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28826036","author":{"steamid":"76561198171475538","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15417,"last_played":1641478546},"language":"polish","review":"Yes :P","timestamp_created":1483099865,"timestamp_updated":1483099865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28825971","author":{"steamid":"76561198096217488","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5541,"last_played":1640905813},"language":"german","review":"Das Matchmaking ist ziemlich schlecht!

Группа выживших от одного до четырёх человек появляется в локации в ночное время суток. Целью выживших является нахождение и включение пяти генераторов на карте и последующий побег за её пределы (через одни из двух ворот или люк, который открывается тогда, когда среди жертв остается один выживший и починены 2 генератора). Другой игрок, являющийся убийцей, должен найти и убить всех выживших путем повешения на крюк или своими руками (если взять подношение Mori). Когда убийца приближается к выжившему, у жертвы учащается пульс (убийца его не слышит). Чем ближе убийца — тем чаще бьется сердце, что даёт возможность выжившему сбежать или спрятаться до прихода убийцы. Выжившие могут использовать некоторые уловки, такие как темные места, шкафы, узкие проемы и различные предметы и навыки, чтобы не попасться убийце. Также во время погони жертва может опрокидывать баррикады, через которые убийца не может пройти, пока не сломает их.

И убийца, и выжившие через всю карту видят, где произошла починка генератора, где висит на крюке пойманный выживший, где лежит раненый выживший (убийца видит его, если у него есть способность «Охотник на оленей»), где открылись ворота для побега. Выжившие могут снимать друг друга с крюка, захлопывать ловушки, ломать капканы и срезать крюки при помощи инструментов или имея навык «Крушитель», вытаскивать жертву из ловушек, лечить раненого без аптечки, а себя либо с аптечкой, либо с особым навыком «Сам себе доктор».","timestamp_created":1483099397,"timestamp_updated":1483099397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28825801","author":{"steamid":"76561198356248786","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":18183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1646631080},"language":"schinese","review":"还是很不错的，就是有时候弹出来作弊","timestamp_created":1483099273,"timestamp_updated":1483099273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28825740","author":{"steamid":"76561198271204405","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1483090524},"language":"russian","review":"Не очень","timestamp_created":1483099118,"timestamp_updated":1483099118,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28825537","author":{"steamid":"76561198272672465","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1593785809},"language":"english","review":"Im a new player to dead by daylight but my first 4 hours in the game and 90% of the time the killer is Mike Miers i never saw a traper or a wraith and its making me really annoying against The Snape because evil within at level 1 its OP it has to be nerfed","timestamp_created":1483098587,"timestamp_updated":1483098587,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28825484","author":{"steamid":"76561198354256971","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1520342451},"language":"russian","review":"Онлайн хоррор","timestamp_created":1483098432,"timestamp_updated":1483098432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49796748161315918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28825449","author":{"steamid":"76561198014056480","num_games_owned":854,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":20366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5015,"last_played":1659013229},"language":"english","review":"#UPDATE:\nOk so several years later. The game has its bugs and weird things, which can make pretty angry everyone. However, the game fixed many a really game breaking BSs that the game had. Game didn't crash single time since I started play recently, no big technical issues (such as save progress, connectivity, game lobbies), rank system finally seems to be working. score board is working as you'd expect (perks, bloodpoints, lost/gained items are showing up, summary screen works as well). Match making is questionable sometimes, but it's not terrible and it seems the game tries to find at least something fair play.\n\nThe game itself got expanded in realms/number of maps, killers and survivors (well, by DLCs). A bit downside of gameplay still seems to be collision, on the other hand, so far it seems to be A LITTLE bit smaller problem then years ago (not sure whether the change had been made or I just didn't play enough to determine that) but overall the system seems to be more consistent the gameplay more fun as a whole and I really DO hope the game will raise its quality in next following years and not otherwise.\n\n============\n\n#ORIGINAL Review:\nI would like to recommend this game but I can't right now.

Estan son las palabras de uno de los desarrolladores del juego que se han convertido en motivo de MEMES en la comunidad DEAD BY DAYLIGHT, en referencia a que el juego esta lleno de bugs, mi perspectiva no varia muchosin embargo una acoptacion muy importante seria que los BUGS aparacen dependiendo de tu ping en el lobby, mientras mas algo sea tu ping mas bugs habra y viceversa. Si piensas comprar el juego pero no sabes por la cantidad de BUGS que otros comentarios mencionan, creeme, he jugado al juego casi desde que salio y al dia de hoy las actualizaciones han mejorado el juego en magnitudes estratosfericas lo cual hara que disfrutes del juego.\n\n- Matchmaking: A la hora de buscar una sala para jugar como superviviente, el tiempo de espera se ha mantenido sin embargo nada garantiza que te vatas a quedar en esa sala una vez encontrada, motivos? \n1: El asesino se agueva (se asusta) osea el asesino al ver un superviviente y juzgarlo por su ropa ensangrentada u objeto (linterna o caja de herramientas) decide retirarse lo cual hace que se te hinchen los huevos.\n2: Tu ping supera la linea roja (150~ + ), lo cierto es que la implementacion de una linea de conexion a lado del boton LISTO ha hecho disminuir los BUGS por el motivo que escribi arriba, y es que si tienes un ping bajo garantizas una mayor reaccion de tu personaje e interaccion con los demas jugadores, nada pero nada garantiza que te quedes ahi ya que si tu ping el alto lo mejor es retirarte para evitar un dolor de cabeza.\n\n- Algo mas con el matchmaking es que a pesar que se haga con niveles o ranking parecidos muchas veces esto se vuelve terrible cuando los niveles se resetean cada 6 semanas, quizas eso no le agrade mucho a los novatos, pero a la vez pueda ser una forma de aprender para ellos.\n\n-DLCs: A pesar que los DLCs no reflejan tanto el PAY TO WIN (Compra para ganar) y es entendible que contenido con copyrightg como Freddy, Cara de cuero y Michael Myers se deba comprar (aproximadamente 5 USD cada uno) a parte del juego base, es una pena que vendan a parte otros asesinos de su autoria asi como la ropa de los personajes. \n\n                                                                     CONCLUSION:\nComo mencione en un punto si tienes en mente comprar el juego pero no sabes porque otros usuarios mencionan el exceso de BUGs ten en mente los puntos que toque sobre ello ya que el juego es en linea y debemos tomar en cuenta los problemas que se pueden presentar para los desarrolladores que han estado haciendo su trabajo. Compralo, es un buen juego y creo quela vas a pasar muy bien, tengo 1000 Horas jugadas y siempre tengo ganas cuando tengo tiempo de jugarlo. Pero algo que si debes tener en cuenta es que no solo vas a comprar el juego base sino comprar el resto de DLCs que comprendo juntos representen una cantidad importante de dinero, son necesarios para disfrutar el juego mas aun.\n\n\nSi quieres leer al principio estuve enamorado y enganchado al juego\nANALISIS LUEGO DE 100 HORAS DICIEMBRE DEL 2016\n\nEste es un analisis breve y personal.  El juego es simplemente una obra maestra, ver los gameplays es diferente a jugarlo, el juego esta bien desarrollado así que hay un equilibrio de habilidades tanto como cuando juegas como superviviente o como asesino.

Почему каждый раз приходится заного создавать его, к тому же с гребанными задержками и зависаниями? Почему в меню игры лагает сильнее чем в самой игре? А от кемперства избавится как раз плюнуть! Просто нужно забрать возможность у маньяков ставить гребанные ловушки прямо под крюки! Пусть ставят вокруг, в кустах, продумывали такутику как загнать тех выживших кто, захочет спасти своего друга попастся в другой капкан, который неожиданно оказался в кусте или под окном? Но нет! Нахуй это нужно если можно просто поставить капкан под крюк и бегать вокруг него? Еще можно сделать, что когда маньяк находится в непосредственной близи к подвешанному жертвоприношение, будет сильно замедлятся. Эти 2 детали помогут избавится от гребанных кемперов! До этого мог додуматься даже мой 10 летний брат! Но не разработчики игры уж точно. Они же лучше выпустят еще одно гребанное платное ДЛС добавив еще одного кемпера в отряд маньяков. В общем, что хочу сказать. Если разработчики и дальше будут так наплевательски относится к игре, то её ждет провал! А так, советую в неё поиграть...

It does so many things right and so few things wrong.\n\nFirst of all the game isn't too expensive, and is reasonablly priced for what it is. This also leads into the fact that all the new maps are free, and the DLC is really cheap, which is surprising considering how expensive some DLC can get for an already heavily DLC saturated market in games. You also don't have to get the DLC to enjoy the new content. You actually have access to the content (for a limited time) through items that you find in the game.\n\nThe devs are heavily invested in the game and it seems very unlikely that a reliable studio like this will fall through or give up on the game. There a fairly frequent updates to the game and alot of time is put into maintaining contact with the community, and asking users what they would like to see in the game. There are a great many things that have caused complications with the game whether it be bugs, glitches, or just unfair mechanics that have been brought up by the community, and the devs have either accurately taken care of the problem, or found the most effective way to take care of said problem if it couldn't be fixed. \n\nThe enviroment of the game is stellar and really flows well with what the game strives to be, which is survival horror. They are introducing new maps and mechanics that keep the game semi-fresh and not the same boring layout. The characters that you have to choose from are original and also memorable (I'm looking at you Myers). There is nothing as of now that is particularly game-breaking or overly frustrating. Overall, it also runs well. They also have added in new mechanics to make obtaining certain items easier and less grindy.\n\nAlthough I really enjoy the game there have been some problems. First of all the game had a pretty slow and rough start. Albeit the game sold really well, it did have a vast amount of bugs, and was missing some core features that the game really needed to succeed for alot of people. For the first several weeks there was no option to create a game/lobby with your friends, and this kind of game is the perfect game to play with friends. It's one of its strongest selling points in fact. Also, for a good amount of months the lobby system itself, and the code and mechanics that made it find other lobbies and games was broken. Not \"essentially\" or \"kinda,\" but very very broken. Trying to match up to find just a single game sometimes took 10-15 minutes depending on whether or not you cancelled the search and restarted it. \n\n[[IMPORTANT] This is fixed by the way and now the code that causes your lobby to search for a game works basically flawlessy.] \n\nTo be honest there isn't a whole lot wrong with the game as it stands, a majority of it's downfalls were only present during launch and several months afterward. Most of these problems have been fixed now. While I had to suffer through these problems, those that are looking into purchasing the game should definitely go ahead and do so because they don't. This is also one of the very few games that I would say wouldn't be necessary to wait for it to go on sale. It's a great game at a great price. The game is in a very good path right now and is making a ton of progress. Can't wait to see what else they do with the game :) \n\nTL;DR\n\nVery good game at good price with alot of problems that have been fixed. \nDon't be deterred, get this game. \n\n \n\n","timestamp_created":1483075092,"timestamp_updated":1483075092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493962705135345459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28816738","author":{"steamid":"76561198340150404","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1535252735},"language":"schinese","review":"还可以  就是经常bug  莫名其妙","timestamp_created":1483074673,"timestamp_updated":1483074673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499998331069946289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28816697","author":{"steamid":"76561198096288840","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":42585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3187,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1660548028},"language":"english","review":"Love it!
