If you are interested in buying this game in the slightest, DO NOT HESITATE!! When you get in just don’t think that you’ll understand how to play it well right off the bat, it takes practice but it is well worth the time spent. This is also a GREAT game to play with friends (there is a option to play with your friends, if you’re wondering about that). Fair warning though this game is very buggy and is still being developed, but bugs can be EASILY overlooked.","timestamp_created":1523325600,"timestamp_updated":1523325600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519020438194274902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41390389","author":{"steamid":"76561198210973765","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":161621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61137,"last_played":1580805391},"language":"russian","review":"ИГРА

so a few years and 80 hours later, I change my mind. Almost every single aspect I had gripes about (apart from survivors bitching, probably) is changed. No more true infinites, odd bulb isn't remotely a pain it was, brand new part nerfed, Freddy reworked and is better than ever, sabbo meta is officially dead... What a time to be alive.\n\n/////old////\nGame dev son is probably playing survivor. \nSurvivors are easy points and easy victories. Killers are easy frustration, and require a significant amount of effort.\nI have played intermittently since beta, but I didn't really have fun at any point since the very beggining. As soon as survivors realised how OP certain perks and builds are(brand new part, odd bulb, decisive strike etc.) game became a shit fest for killers. Worst of all, it seems that game devs only ever listen to survivors.\nPoor Freddy. Somehow they managed to nerf him, despite him being one of worst, if not the worst killers in the game. Just beacuse survivors were whining about him.\nDev's don't really care, and recommend killer players to play survivor or other games. I am not even joking, it is an actual recommendation from a dev stream.\nI think I am just going to take this advice.\nAnd, who could forget, probably the most toxic playerbase ever concieved by maknind.\nI played LoL, Dota and Dota 2, SC 2 ranked, and never have I ever seen people bitch so much. Survivors bitch when they win. Survivors bitch when they loose. And still despite that they still play in most toxic, unfun ways imaginable. \nSurvive with Friends being in the same match making as single player survivors is borderline retarded. What the fuck? Haven't it occured to you to separate solo queue and premade team qeues?

Dead by Daylight is nowhere near perfect, but the friends you make through this game, and the countless scares and laughs this game brings are truly worth it. Yes, there are moments where you question why you still play the game, complain about it's problems etc. But, you will always find yourself coming back to this game. The player base of this game tries to find every negative aspect about it, or ponders why the game isn't perfect. No game IMO is perfect. This game is a great introduction into a co-op game for new players looking for fun with friends. A plentiful group of survivors to choose from, as well as killers. Overall, I personally think this game is great, despite it's problems. I don't regret the time nor money put into this game.","timestamp_created":1523242965,"timestamp_updated":1614262969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41373822","author":{"steamid":"76561198161082469","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4078,"last_played":1605902758},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego!","timestamp_created":1523239833,"timestamp_updated":1523239833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497737526893615723","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41373213","author":{"steamid":"76561198808882820","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5630,"last_played":1644334182},"language":"english","review":"this game is very good","timestamp_created":1523235762,"timestamp_updated":1523235762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41372997","author":{"steamid":"76561198041293266","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":31075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1062,"playtime_at_review":25617,"last_played":1660547739},"language":"english","review":"its vewy scawy i pee pants.","timestamp_created":1523234258,"timestamp_updated":1574539653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41372852","author":{"steamid":"76561198427813475","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1649945573},"language":"schinese","review":"我爱郭松筠 他的steam是Duebass\n","timestamp_created":1523233299,"timestamp_updated":1523233299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.418888062238693237","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41372762","author":{"steamid":"76561198332566120","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":31449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4545,"last_played":1650651705},"language":"russian","review":"The game is complete crap because of the matchmaking system and mainly toxic community, 99% of which consists of completely degraded, lowest in terms of the their disgusting behavior, survivor mainly playing players, whose sole motivation and purpose to play this game seems to be mocking killers and insult them in the post-game chat, regardless of whether they win or lose the match. It is sad and so disappointing, that over many years of existence of this game, so little attention and effort have been dedicated to trying to keep community friendly and healthy. It's such a shame that this game has become a perfect environment for disgusting and ugly from inside people to show their true colors and spread hate, toxicity and apparently enjoy it, to the point that this seems to be their only reason to play it. It is impossible to express, how upsetting this is that no one minds that, and things are left the way they are... Censorship of the post-game chat has changed nothing and are absolutely free to insult in other than English languages.

If you prefer balance and diversity as I do, then I would not recommend this game. This game is not only plagued with a horribly toxic and abusive community but the worst part of all is that the developers seem to just ignore issues. If you are thinking of jumping into this game, be warned that it will be frustrating for quite some time because you don't have the best perks or equipment and will be heavily disadvantaged against more experienced players. Survivors can all learn perks specific to other unique survivors so eventually playing a survivor is just a cosmetic choice vs a playstyle choice. Some Killers are very interesting and fun to play as such as the Hillbilly or Nurse and other Killers tend to get ignored and swept under the rug such as Freddy. \n\nI like to play Survivor and Killer equally but I found that Survivors tend to exploit and abuse certain game mechanics more so in order to win (i.e. Pallet Looping). In summary I would recommend doing your research before buying this game, but if you find enjoyment out of this game by all means play it.","timestamp_created":1523224930,"timestamp_updated":1579303353,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41370110","author":{"steamid":"76561198145608074","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":147205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2759,"playtime_at_review":76659,"last_played":1660474930},"language":"english","review":"Coming from the NA region- New Mexico, USA to be specific. Region wise even on the more \"dead\" times like 2am-6am mountain time you still find people on. I met my boyfriend and some really good friend from this game and that alone, i would give it a positive review. \n\nBut what else do I like about this game? Graphics are decent even on low settings, and very fun to play. High graphic settings just make it better.  Keep in mind you have to earn points to get perks which basically makes it easier to survive or kill, so you have to give it some time. Very fun with friends. Love this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys community games/ team work. Events are usually pretty fun.\n\nThere are down sides- salty killers, survivors, toxic people- but really, you should expect that with any game. Someone ALWAYS thinks their better than another and like to do things like pointing or end-game T-bagging. I'm a survivor main and i think that survivors can be salty little shits.

меня эта игра стала открытием в таком жанре, так как я не очень любила игры в команде, мне казалось, что другие игроки всё портят, но тут не так, игра даже очень сильно зависит от твоих действий (но не всегда, бывают исключения,редиски тоже попадаются в катке ). Довольно большой выбор персонажей для игры, что очень радует, так как это вносит разнообразие в игровой процесс. После покупки этой игы я познакомилась со многими замечательными людьми, с которыми играю и до сих пор, а ещё я как великий гипнотезёр затащила своих дузей из реала в эту игрушку и они не могут оторваться от неё. Сама атмосфера игы даже очень приятненькая, музыкальное сопровождение даже очень годное. Данная игрушка стала моей первой покупкой в Steam, я этому очень рада, не ошиблась в выборе. Обязательно стоит попробовать в неё поиграть, а если у вас ещё и компания хорошая, то это просто потрясющее сочетание для хороших каток.
