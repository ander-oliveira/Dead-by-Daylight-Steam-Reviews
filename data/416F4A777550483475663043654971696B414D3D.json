Anyone playing killer should be forced to do 100 survivor matches minimum before they play a single killer match just to know what being tunneled (repeatedly hooked) or camped (when the killer stays by the hook after hooking someone) feels like & how it kills the fun for players.\n\nA few days ago I played against a Doctor who would camp the hooks and when someone came to unhook, they would not attack but wait for the unhook action so they could pick up the unhooking survivor while the hooked one would remain on hook. I mentioned many times that the killer's ability to pick up unhooking survivors should be removed for this very reason, because as it stands, players who play like that give no reason to unhook anyone, therefore letting them die after just 1 hook. But Behaviour (the developer of DBD) could care less---AND THAT IS THE #1 PROBLEM.\n\nThey keep releasing new DLC without addressing many bugs (like late killer hits through windows that still down vaulting survivors after they have well cleared the window) and without addressing issues that make for unbalanced, unfair, and toxic gameplay that makes this game not fun. The game crashes pretty frequently for me and THEY PENALIZE ME FOR THEIR POORLY CODED GAME by depipping me and giving me temporary match bans DESPITE FILLING OUT A CRASH REPORT. Same thing happens when I get kicked out of a game because due to a server disconnect, without me ever hitting escape and clicking on \"leave match\". They have the technology to know whether someone purposely disconnects or not so as to not punish them, but do they care? No. Hell, with some of the toxic new players who play killer, players who do purposely disconnect in many of these cases should not be penalized just because they don't want to reward trash killers with toxic gameplay, but that's another story.\n\nThey also have been very nonchalant about DDOS issues that many players were affected by and even used an NFT for Pinhead, which is against Steam's rules, yet this game is not removed by Steam for that offense when other games that committed the same offense were.\n\nA few days ago, I was hanging out by an open exit gate to see if other survivors in the match needed help before exiting because I like to play in an unselfish manner. The killer was Pinhead and the player only had 1 perk, which was not Blood Warden. After the other survivor got out without having been hooked for the duration I was hanging at the exit gate, I turned around and tried to escape but was blocked by a Blood Warden barrier WHEN THE KILLER WAS NOT EVEN RUNNING BLOOD WARDEN!!! I don't know if that killer was cheating/hacking or if the game is bugged out or if Behaviour was just targeting me for trashing them in my error reports and reports for killers playing in an unsportsmanlike manner, but things like that should not happen in a game like this. I've had survivors who popped back up immediately after downing them and watching them do a 360 as they fell down. I had another survivor disappear on me despite me hearing his groans of pain on a Yamaoka map who I dropped so I could break a door to access a hook. It was inside the main building so there was nothing blocking my view. I think he bled out and died (not sure if even other survivors could see or get to heal him).\n\nA problem I ran into when playing killer is these new boon totems that can be infinitely reblessed after the killer snuffs them out each time. It ruins the game for killers so that if a killer wastes their time snuffing out a boon totem, it will be for nothing if the survivor or another one with a boon perk re-blesses it. It's very unbalanced because if boon perks were to be done properly, they should've been done with a token system where there is a maximum of say 5 tokens (where each time a totem is blessed it would deplete a token) or a system where each of the 5 totems in a given match on its map could only be blessed once, which would force survivors to find all the totems instead of blessing the same 1-2 totems over & over again. The new boon perk that allows 100% recovery will only exacerbate this problem more and will encourage more tunneling, camping, and the running of the No One Escapes Death (NOED) perk, which is also a trash and toxic perk. Does Behaviour care? Nope. All they did was make a new killer perk that allows killers to rebuild cleansed totems, which doesn't address this issue whatsoever.\n\nOne last thing I wanted to mention is how they have poorly-made challenges that force killers trying to get them to play in toxic ways. An example of this is basement challenges, where the killer has to sacrifice a certain # of survivors on basement hooks and they encourage killers to camp the basement, which is one of the most toxic ways to play DBD. There are also poor achievements such as Michael Myers Evil Incarnate achievement that requires the killer to mori all 4 survivors. I got the achievement, but hated the way I played to get it because mori's are just a disgusting way to play, especially the instant Myers mori using his add-ons where you can kill someone who hasn't even been hooked. What's worse is, it took several tries to get it, so it ended up forcing me to play that disgusting way in all those matches until I finally got it. And even in my quest to get that achievement, I ran into bugs, like a match in one of my early attempts where I mori'd 3 of the 4 survivors, closed the hatch, and my game crashed while patrolling the short distance between the 2 exit gates. There was another attempt where I mori'd 3 of the 4 survivors and there was a Bill who the game would just not let me mori. I could only stab him throughout that match, even when I downed him again later on and went for the ground mori. You have a crappy achievement that forces player to play in ways they'd rather not and glitches along the way that prolong that disgusting style of play that the game's poor coding caused.\n\nSo if you want to throw your hard-earned money out the door and later regret buying it and have a feeling of betrayal, buy this game. Or else stay clear. I have many friends who used to play this game with me in groups of 4 when we did surviving with friends (SWF) sessions and almost all of them have quit playing because they got fed up with the BS. This game really tends to bring the worst out of many players.","timestamp_created":1638334854,"timestamp_updated":1638334854,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575653672218322754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104937614","author":{"steamid":"76561198800081924","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29205,"last_played":1656556111},"language":"english","review":"If you see a bubba just dc. its not worth your time","timestamp_created":1638334598,"timestamp_updated":1638334598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104937569","author":{"steamid":"76561199112187321","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":70925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38224,"last_played":1656096714},"language":"english","review":"yes\n","timestamp_created":1638334556,"timestamp_updated":1638334556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104937387","author":{"steamid":"76561198931240381","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":571,"last_played":1657335682},"language":"english","review":"s","timestamp_created":1638334416,"timestamp_updated":1638334416,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104937308","author":{"steamid":"76561198452115785","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":48028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1229,"playtime_at_review":24134,"last_played":1660602907},"language":"spanish","review":"MEMENTO MORI\n⣿⣿⣷⡁⢆⠈⠕⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢔⢂⢕⢄⠂⣂⠂⠆⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂\n⣿⣿⣿⡷⠊⡢⡹⣦⡑⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⠕⠔⠌⠝⠛⠶⠶⢶⣦⣄⢂⢕⢂⢕\n⣿⣿⠏⣠⣾⣦⡐⢌⢿⣷⣦⣅⡑⠕⠡⠐⢿⠿⣛⠟⠛⠛⠛⠛⠡⢷⡈⢂⢕⢂\n⠟⣡⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣑⠝⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡵⢁⣤⣶⣶⣿⢿⢿⢿⡟⢻⣤⢑⢂\n⣾⣿⣿⡿⢟⣛⣻⣿⣿⣿⣦⣬⣙⣻⣿⣿⣷⣿⣿⢟⢝⢕⢕⢕⢕⢽⣿⣿⣷⣔\n⣿⣿⠵⠚⠉⢀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣗⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⢷⣂⣠⣴⣾⡿⡿⡻⡻⣿⣿⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣵⣵⣵⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿\n⢌⠻⣿⡿⡫⡪⡪⡪⡪⣺⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃\n⠣⡁⠹⡪⡪⡪⡪⣪⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⠋⠐⢉⢍⢄⢌⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠈\n⡣⡘⢄⠙⣾⣾⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢐⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⡘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠠⠈\n⠌⢊⢂⢣⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⢐⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⢅⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢜⠠⠈\n⠄⠁⠕⢝⡢⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣕⣑⣑⣑⣵⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢔⢕⣿⠠⠈\n⠨⡂⡀⢑⢕⡅⠂⠄⠉⠛⠻⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢔⢕⢕⣿⣿⠠⠈\n⠄⠪⣂⠁⢕⠆⠄⠂⠄⠁⡀⠂⡀⠄⢈⠉⢍⢛⢛⢛⢋⢔⢕⢕⢕⣽⣿⣿⠠⠈","timestamp_created":1638334351,"timestamp_updated":1638334428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465116292238235474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104937301","author":{"steamid":"76561198086988064","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":75757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1317,"playtime_at_review":61723,"last_played":1660580970},"language":"english","review":"This game man, I've played it for so long, so here is my review.

Kirjaimellisesti.\n\nPelin DLC-painotteisuus on häirinnyt minua yllättävän vähän, sillä uusia hahmoja saa ostettua myös ilmaiseksi (vaikka siinä meneekin pitkään), eikä minua haittaa heittää kymppiä lisää peliin aina silloin tällöin. Sen sijaan yllättävän ärsyttävänä olen kokenut suurikokoiset päivitykset, jotka todellakin vievät tilaa. \n\nItse pelaaminen on usein turhauttavaa, mutta sitten kun muutaman kerran todella onnistuu pakenemaan viime hetkellä, osumaan täydellisesti jokaisen skill checkin, niittaamaan koko selviytyjäporukan kellariin tai luuppaamaan killeriä pidemmän aikaa, kaikki se vaiva on sen arvoista. Tietysti aina silloin tällöin palaa pinna camppaaviin tappajiin, itsekkäisiin tiimikavereihin ja omaan surkeuteen, jolloin on pakko ottaa peliin vähän etäisyyttä, mutta ainakin toistaiseksi olen aina halunnut palata takaisin pelin pariin viimeistään seuraavana päivänä. Onhan tätä nyt tullut parin kuukauden aikana tahkottua jo se 200+ tuntia, joka ainakin allekirjoittaneelle on ihan massiivinen määrä.

Recomendo comprar as DLC por que o jogo vem com uma quantidade X de sobreviventes e assassinos.

But of course with me friends is preferred. The game can be quite frustrating and piss me off but I always end up going back to it with my friends. The feeling of outplaying the killer is so excellent and absolutely destroying the survivors as a wide variety of different killers is worth the pain sometimes. Of course not being able to play the killers you want without buying them sucks but I enjoy it enough that I have actually put real cash into this game and I never do that with games.
