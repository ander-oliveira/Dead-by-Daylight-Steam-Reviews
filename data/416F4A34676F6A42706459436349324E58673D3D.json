Dopo l'ultima patch l'hanno rovinato, sbilanciamento assurdo.\n2.Ci sono un casino di bug e glitch ovvero:\n-Survivor e killer che muovono gli arti in modo del tutto anormalo (glitch grafici)\n-Il killer che fa la verticale sui muri (Sono d'accordo tenersi in forma ma...no dai!)\n-Il killer incastrato tra il pallet che non può difendersi (diciamo basta al maltrattamento dei killer! sotto la maschera sono persone come noi!)\n-Survivor che avvolte volano a random (letteralmente, i can fly) pallet che rimangono in verticale (anche i pallet hanno una vita sessuale a quanto pare) e non possono essere usati.\n-Animazioni buggate sul gancio, ne vedrete spesso, quando un vostro amico vi libera ma magari comincia il divincolamento sul gancio, (quello dove dovrete premere spazio ripetutamente per intenderci) vedrete voi a terra e a tratti sarete sul gancio a morire totalmente a no sense.\n-Matchmaking fatto a cavolo, avete giocato 2 ore? avete 1 perk? il miglior abbinamento che vi capiterà sarà gente con  300 ore e 4 perk, idem per il killer.\nVi domanderete? ma perche? semplice, perche ti mette in base al rank (1-20) e indovinate un po, il rank si resetta mensilmente ma non leva i perk e abilità guadagnati, quindi se voi cominciate a giocare e siete (20) con 2 ore di gioco, troverete anche gente di 300 ore rank (20) per via del reset e avranno tutte le abilità, indovinate come andrà a finire che siate killer o survivor, sarà sbilanciatissima la partita.\n-Cosa? un oggetto che ti permette di uccidere tutti survivors basta che li prendi e fai \"kill\"? e la partita dove va a finire?\n-Cosa? un oggetto che ti permette di riparare istantaneamente un generatore? e la sfida di ripararli? e se l' oggetto in questione lo prendono 4 survivors il killer che fa apre l'uscita o scappa dalla botola? (Ebbene si ragazzi, anche i killer possono perdere il lavoro, c'è crisi!)\n-La lobby delle volte crasha, altra volte devi provare 10 volte a cercare una partita per trovarne finalmente una (consiglio di fare sopravvivi con amici che ve la trova prima la partita, senza un reale motivo)\n-i caricamenti avvolta si bloccano e per sempre, vedrete il logo di caricamento caricare per l'eternità, la soluzione? Ebbene, un antica leggenda narra di una pressione di tasti sulla tastiera, tale usanza è detta \"altabbare\" e permette di uscire dalla morsa del gioco forzatamente (ALT+F4).\n-Lag e controlag! il killer mi colpisce anche dopo i pallet e delle volte scatto a destra e a sinistra senza motivo, ma perche? la mia connessione và come può essere?\nsemplice, deadbydaylight utilizza connessioni p2p ovvero il killer hosta tutte le partite, se il killer lagga, laggano tutti e indovinate a chi va a sfavore la cosa? esatto ai survivors perche vengono colpiti anche dopo i pallet o finiscono su trappole non volendo o sbagliano i qte per la confusione.\nE ovviamente non esiste un modo per risolvere il problema, niente tacchette stile wi-fi per capirci qualcosa, niente ping, sarebbe stato carino che quando il killer ti scopre ti urla il suo ping dovrebbero aggiungerlo, non perdiamo tempo a risolvere i bug che tanto nessuno lo nota no? Cmq l'unico consiglio che posso darvi è di scrivere sulla chat della lobby mentre siete in attesa che tutti siano pronti, vi darà una mezza e grezza idea della connessione del killer.\n-Se potesse fa una partita senza qualcosa che non funzioni o si bugghi o si glicci.\n-Unreal engine usato male, (dai guardate friday 17 the game e trovatemi le differenze)\n-P.S. (Quando micheal il killer, vi appende ad un gancio, fateci caso la parte del corpo dove dovrebbe stare la cintura gli si restringe senza motivo xD)\n\nPRO\n-L'idea è figa, l'atmosfera alla fine c'è e quando tutto funziona (quasi mai) è divertente, per questo mi incazzo, ha del potenziale il gioco ma è mal sfruttato.\n-Bella la cooperazione tra survivors, il salvarsi il non salvarsi, scappare non scappare, diciamo che l'ansia è presente in certi momenti.\n-Bello il sistema di avanzamento dei singoli killer e survivor, con tanti oggetti, abilità e quantaltro per i singoli, specialmente i killer\n-Il sonoro non sembra male, almeno credo, non sono un esperto ma mi è sembrato direzionale e ben realizzato, fatemi sapere se mi sbaglio.\n\nCi sarebbe molto altro da dire ma penso che basti questo, spero che queste mie esperienze oltre ad avervi dato un idea dello stato del gioco, vi facciano capire che secondo me per ora non vale l'acquisto, troppo sbilanciato, troppi bug e troppo ozio degli sviluppatori.\nRicordo che questa è solo un opinione, saluti!","timestamp_created":1470217285,"timestamp_updated":1495959296,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24686456","author":{"steamid":"76561198101382558","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1624819929},"language":"russian","review":"Игрушка довольно весёлая но со временем может надоесть, графика средняя но можно было и лучше, много багов, самый основной это естественно с поиском игры, нужно часто жать на поиск иначе выдает ошибку, жду фикса, с серверами у меня часто происходит десинхрон (возможно это не только у меня).","timestamp_created":1470217020,"timestamp_updated":1470217020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24686062","author":{"steamid":"76561198100570398","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1658873237},"language":"english","review":"Very average, clunky and unfinished game.

The four survivors try to escape the game map. The killer trys to catch the survivors and sacrifice them to his dark god. I love this game. But it is seriously flawed.\n\n It has glitches that should have been fixed in the beta testing. Sometimes you run into invisible walls which, if you are playing as a survivor, can get you caught and killed and if you are the killer, can make you lose what should have been easy quary. When playing as the killer, sometimes the game won't let you turn, that is, it doesn't register the movement of your mouse and rotate your view accordingly, which can easily prevent you from seeing survivors who are right next to you or let someone who you are chasing get away. One player disconecting can ruin the game for everyone. For the survivors, it means less people to help you complete objectives, distract the killer, or rescue you from them. For the killer, its actually materially beneficial since it counts as a sacrifice, thats 1250 points, for them. So the killer can win the game without actually having to catch and sacrifice anyone, which hardly seems fair. Worst of all, since the killers' have to host the game, the killer quiting means that everyone else gets booted from the game without getting any points. So developers, please create dedicated servors so that the killer dropping out doesn't prevent the survivors from getting credit. The biggest problem with the basic design is the leveling system. The way points are distributed means that you can actually get a better score and more resources for the next map by deliberately ignoring your objectives and stretching the game out for as long as possible to complete tasks that give you leveling points without actually advancing the objectives.\n\n So why do I reccomend this game? Because of its striking originality and presentation. When playing as a survivor, you know that you are being hunted down by a real human being who is capable of sadism and cruelty, and you are unable to fight back in any way. That is scarier than most things in most horror games and movies. As a killer, you get to act out the ultimate violent power fantasy, hunt people down like animals, and kill them in the bloodiest, most drawn out way possible. Most importantly, the mechanics being assymetrical and imposing imperfect information on both sides, means that there is more potential for something unexpected happening than in most games. So you really have to be able to think on your feet, improvise, misdirect your opponent, and read their intentions intuitively to be effective in this game. I have A.D.D. and an intuitive personality type. So this game actually allows me to play to my natural strengths.\n\n In summation, this game has problems. But they are all technical issues, and technical issues can be fixed. The core mechanics are delightfully novel in a way that makes you wonder why we haven't gotten something similar before. As flawed as this game is, get it anyway. There is nothing else like it on the market right now.","timestamp_created":1470198500,"timestamp_updated":1470198500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24683207","author":{"steamid":"76561197996301742","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":17430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2436,"last_played":1646412662},"language":"english","review":"When I got this game, I was pretty excited. One of the coolest concepts I have ever seen, sorta like a mature L4D promising actual adrenaline and the thrill of an invincible murderer. This was also like Amnesia where survivors' hopes in escaping is poisoned with how powerful the killer is.\n\nReality was actually how I thought it would be. There were many chases and scenes, period of times where my (real-life) heart beat as fast avatar's in the game.\n\nI recommend this game because despite the bugs and the current unbalanced state, it's still damn fun.\n\n[b] Now, my warning. [/b] It IS buggy. The game is like a really handsome/sexy individual you wanna date. Only thing is he or she has like an IQ of 80. Perhaps you are just gunning for the looks department here, so I guess you might want to date him or her anyway.\n\nDead by Daylight is like that. There are going to be some of you looking for a fully optimised game like Overwatch. Even if the game has a cool concept, maybe you ain't gonna have fun as long as the game is still buggy. \n\n[i] That's totally fine. [/i]\n\nFor people who haven't yet BOUGHT the game, I am just gonna list the current MAJOR bugs/annoyance. I hope it will help in making your decision.\n\n\n\n[u] PROS [/u]\nIt's sorta like a multiplayer Amnesia. You can't fight off the killer so you escape, you hide. This concept of being in a hopeless horror game IS FUCKING FUN. The thrill is amazing. All the dopamine and adrenaline like a drug that gets me high. And you live and die- then right to the next game where you can do it again. The perks you can get(passive abilities) also really changes the game so it gets really fun when you get them. You feel the significance of it helping you, really aiding and changing YOUR STYLE of escaping the killer.\n\nYou wanna be a team helping aura survivor? Sure. Someone that can sabotaged the killer's stuff? Why not? How about someone more individualistic. You ain't gonna help anyone so your perks are just for you to move faster and quieter? Hell yeah. There are many styles and perks. It's fun to actually experiment with them. \n\nHave the killer caught someone? You have to make a choice now- do you want to risk your live saving the nimcompoop or just try selfishly by yourself to make an escape? It's your life, your choice. And you will be scared while making that choice. \n\n\n\n\n\n[u]CONS[/u] [List]\n[*]It's damn buggy. Some minor, some major. You know how you click a button ONCE in other games to queue? Then you sit back, relax and wait till you enter a game? Ain't like that here. You gotta click it a couple of times. It will still only take you a couple of clicks- but there might be time periods where you gotta click more. So yeah- you click to queue. And then after awhile, you might have to CLICK again. And again.\n\n\n[*] There are exploits to be used- I guess this is a subset of buggyness but I am just gonna explain as another point. You can still win as survivors and killers but there ARE exploits. To me, I feel they ain't being abused that much so it's still alright. Mods are also trying to fix them every patch- and since the game came out, it's WAAAY better. Still, if you hate the very concept and don't have much tolerance for them then yeah okay- maaaaaybe not your thing.\n\n[*] Might feel the game is a tad unbalanced. As every patch nerfs and buffs the killers and survivors, there is a meta. Where a certain killer/survivor is OP and everyone uses them. Yeah this exist. But honestly, most games have this \"meta-complain\".\n\n[/list]\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I still advise you guys to get it. The raw fun I get is too damn great. And I am sure the game will improve into a more optimised state(give the mods some time- they are a pretty small studio).","timestamp_created":1470198147,"timestamp_updated":1470198445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24683048","author":{"steamid":"76561198026134352","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":35696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7404,"last_played":1654145189},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game, very intense and the procedural generation makes the game feel new enough and different that it doesn't get stale fast.

In the last week I have played twice as many hours as I ever have before.   My recommendation for this game is now a confident thumbs up.

It's not quite leage of legends level of salt, and there are good people, too, but the loudest voices are always the ones whining and pointing fingers. \n\n::END EDIT:::\n\nThis is one of those rare times when I wish Steam offered a sideways thumb option on their reviews, and not just thumb up or down. \n\nAfter much deliberation, I decided to give this game a \"recommend\" for one simple reason: I enjoy this game, and will continue to play it.\n\nThat being said, there's plenty not to like.\n\nPros: \n- A refreshing new slant on the asymetrical pvp genre.\n- Recognizable tropes from the horror genre, a compelling soundtrack, and artful level design really capture the feel of the campy slasher films which inspired the game. \n- The three different killers currently available are diverse, and intuitive. Each one is an homage to an iconic slasher pigeonhole, and function as you would expect, having watched a few horror flicks. \n- The objectives are simple to understand, but difficult to master.  You can jump right in and learn to play in just a few short games, and then spend quite some time advancing your characters and practicing different strategies. \n\nCons: \n- A few persistent bugs, performance is greatly improved from a few months ago. \n- Survivors are like cookie-cutter copies of each other at low levels, each one playing exactly the same as the others until you unlock more advanced perks and items. \n\n\nAll of this comes together to create a game experience that, while entertaining, feels like early access, but isn't.","timestamp_created":1470185115,"timestamp_updated":1490079116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479704797267913818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24680377","author":{"steamid":"76561198026806635","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":19257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16574,"last_played":1511579675},"language":"english","review":"Ran through a cornfield dodging a chainsaw weilding maniac, wiggled off a meat-hook, and then I was finally able to get home and play this game.\n\nPros:\n- Creepy horror movie vibe\n- PVP stealth gameplay that's always intense\n- Lots of perks (skills) and builds to keep things fresh\n- Active developers \n- Cool concept\n\nCons:\n- Very grindy.

This has happened 17 times in the last 3 days. Not 1, not 2, not 5, SEVENTEEN. The highlight of the bunch so far is that 9 minutes into a game, with 2 survivors dead, 2 injured and chasing one of those 2 down, player #5 enters the game! Yup. Nine minutes in and another player joined the game, and of course promptly crashed. Got that one recorded on video. This is all over the forums. \n\nBecause this game is Peer-hosted, upwards of 20-30% of the games you enter as a survivor will be met with a killer who is running either a hardware of software lag-switch whereby they selectively raise their ping or interrupt their connection resulting in you, the survivor, being dead or injured or warping around while they go on un-impeded. This is blatantly obvious when everything is fine until you see the killer chasing someone and suddenly like magic, everyone starts warping, running into walls. When that person is dead, oh wow, look, its just fine until you guessed it, killer is on someone else. This is also all over the forums.\n\nIf you want to play with friends, be prepared for the following to happen:\n\nStart the game in your little group, hit ready annnnd. no game found. At this point you have to hit \"ready again\" annnnnd. no game found. You will repeat this for 1-6 minutes, hitting \"ready\" each time and starting the search over again. When you do finally join a game often that will end before it ever starts because either the killer is way too low with zero perks and doesn't want to be juked out by 3 rank 1, prestige 2 survivors with no real hope, or he wants to farm easy groups, or one of the other survivors leaves because they just want to hatch camp and hide in a closet until you do all the work, or they don't want to play with lower (or higher) ranked people. You guessed it, forums are full of posts like this.\n\nIf you make it past the crashes and lost points, the lag-switching hosts, the lost lobbies and the random drop outs, some of the games you get in to will be enjoyable. \n\nThe perks/offerings/maps are interesting and although some maps still have what are called \"infinite loops\" where a survivor can simply run around a long hall and hop through a window long before the killer can get them, they are not as prevalent as early launch.\n\nIn it's current state, this is simply not something I would recommend at this time, it is beyond frustrating.","timestamp_created":1470174252,"timestamp_updated":1470174450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24678008","author":{"steamid":"76561198261094512","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":13739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1611,"last_played":1586347053},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by daylight это хорор , стелс и онлайн игра !

Survive with Friends läuft jetzt eindeutig bugfreier. Man verliert zwar trotzdem noch manchmal die Verbindung zur Lobby aber es ist bei weitem nicht so schlimm wie im Anfangsstadium. Man hat zwar immernoch lange Wartezeiten je nach Downloadregion und Größe der Survive with Friends Lobby aber das ist okay, DBD kann ja nichts dafür wenn gerade keine Lobby die passende Größe für meine Gruppe hat. Auch die Ingame bugs treten kaum noch auf (ich habe leider das Pech momentan das ich die mitgenommenen Gegenstände öfters mal nicht benutzen kann und auch nicht ablegen kann :S aber das ist eigtl okay).\n\nDie paar Bugs sind allerdings nicht störend (ja ich weiß, es gibt leute die heftigere und öfters bugs haben). Was störend ist sind die ganzen Facecamper im game die eine Rettung unmöglich machen oder generell jede Art von Spiel sobald man einmal gefangen wird. Dies resultiert meistens dann in einen Derank, weil nur Generatoren machen nicht immer ausreichend ist.... Zumindest sind das dann die Leute die sich \"cool\" fühlen und dann am Ende der Runde irgendeinen Bullshit labern müssen in den Endchat. Es wäre super wenn DBD noch irgendetwas machen könnte das Facecampen und generelles Campen richtig unlukrativ machen würde. Moment kriegen die Camper ja trotzdem noch nen pip, wenn sie eine einzige Person richtig facecampen...\nEin weiterer negativer Punkt sind die Hosts. Ich weiß ja nicht in welchem Urwald manche Leute leben aber meine Güte, man geht gefühlt einen Schritt vorwärts und portet sich auf einmal quer durch die halbe Map so groß sind die lags manchmal. Richtige Server von DBD könnten dem wahrscheinlich Einhalt gebieten.\n\nAn sich macht das Spiel allerdings sehr viel Spaß. Meine Freunde und ich haben schon viele witzige Momente in diesem Spiel erlebt und spielen es immer wieder gerne. Nur Camper rauben einem dann etwas die Spiel Lust. \n\nDBD kriegt eine 7 / 10 für die guten Momente und die Verbesserungen seit Release. Die restlichen 3 Punkte kriegen sie wenn sie es schaffen das weniger Leute so hart campen das man niemanden mehr helfen kann und wenn sie die restlichen bugs entfernen und irgendwann mal eigene Server erstellen (auch wenn mir das rumlaggen manchmal spaß macht, weil der Killer 10x an einem vorbei schlägt :D )","timestamp_created":1470172719,"timestamp_updated":1485383409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50000232458114624","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24677835","author":{"steamid":"76561198149886876","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":67767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1156,"last_played":1657230394},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok güzel bir oyun fakat oyunu ılk aldıgımda rank 1-2-3 gibi herıflerle aynı maça gırmek zorunda kalıyorsun kötü oluyor özellıkle sen yenı başlamışken katılın rank 1 cıkması FeelsBadMan","timestamp_created":1470172622,"timestamp_updated":1470172622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568627476692199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24677708","author":{"steamid":"76561198250665052","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":96468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25862,"last_played":1655683707},"language":"english","review":"Its pretty good.

Но объясню таким маньяк которые жалуются что сурвы пишут предъявы на счет кемпинга и тунелинга. \n1.Кемпинг. \nЭто когда  ты пасешь повешенного выжившего или лежачего и не даешь его спасти. Это плохо и так не интересно.Так же есть фейскемпинг, думаю понятно что это. Так вот. То что вы думаете что сурвы жалуются что вы должны отходить за край карты это тупо, это сугубо ваше понимание. Вы просто должны повесить и уйти дальше продолжать играть(ломать генеры, ловить другого выжившего, ставить капканы если вы трапер и прочее).Конечно если вы видите в 3-4 метрах от крюка выжившего и бегаете за ним то это не кемпинг. Теперь на счет кемпинга червячков. Даже если у вас нет агитации или граспа, попытайтесь донести сурва до крюка. Потому что кемпить червячков это не круто. Опят же вы лишаете как себя так и сурвов хорошо поиграть и заработать бп очки. \n2. Тунелинг\nЭто когда вы бегаете за одним и тем же выжившим, в особенности если он ранен. Тоесть вы повесили одного, его сняли вы успели подбежать и видите например троих и вы видите раненого и бежите за ним снова бьете и вешаете. Это конечно не сильно вызывает бомбалейло и вроде как логично что легче за раненым бегать, но если вы бегаете почти всю игру за одним и тем же раненым не смотря на окружающих которые пытаются вас блочить, то это тупо и не интересно. Во первых потому что он может размансить вас пока остальные чинят генеры и вы всрете капельку.А во вторых это просто нудно и надоедает.\n\nИгрушка просто классная, выходят новые маньяки и сурвы ,появляются новые тактики и прочее.

Leider überwiegen die negativen Punkte, weshalb ich das Game weiterhin nicht empfehlen kann. Wäre es möglich, würde ich neutral bewerten. Die bisherigen Updates haben kaum Verbesserungen gebracht. Es muss eine Menge Bugfixing betrieben werden!\n\nHier eine Überarbeitung meiner Review, wobei sich einige Kritikpunkte trotz Updates bis heute gehalten haben:\n\n1) Allein findet man leicht eine Lobby. Zu zweit wird es schwieriger. Zu viert ist es eine Geduldsprobe. Es vergehen gut 20 Minuten, in der eine Lobby gesucht wird.\n\n1a) Der Netzwerkfehler, den man als Lobbyführer bekommt, sollte mit dem letzten Update gefixt sein. Er ist jedoch noch immer vorhanden. Gerade haben wir zu dritt innerhlb von 90 Minuten gerade mal drei Spiele machen können. Es ist schlichtweg unspielbar geworden.\n\n1b) Hat man zu viert eine Killer-Lobby gefunden, passiert es nicht selten, dass man während des Match-Makings von seinen Freunden getrennt wurde. Zwei sind in einer Lobby, zwei in einer anderen. Also noch mal von vorn.\n\n2) Bugs noch und nöcher. Man bleibt hinter oder in Haken stecken, auf felsigem Boden oder in einer Palette und kann sich nicht selbst befreien. Erst der Killer kann einen im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes raushauen.\n\n3) Was sich gebessert hat, sind die Perks der Überlebenden. So ist es z. B. möglich, sich mit „Unbeugsam“ von Bill selbst komplett hochzuheilen. Von dem Perk „Geliehene Zeit“ haben andere Mitspieler auch was.\n\n4) Es passiert immer noch, dass man eigentlich jemanden vom Haken holen will und man stattdessen ein Item vom Boden aufhebt. Oder man möchte jemanden heilen und sabotiert stattdessen einen Haken. In den Update-News steht, die Auswahlschwierigkeiten wären gefixt, was leider nicht stimmt.\n\nVerbesserungsvorschläge:\n\n1) Die Lobby-Suche muss dringend überarbeitet werden!\n\n2) Beim Match-Making könnten die bisherige Stundenanzahl des Spielers berücksichtigt werden.\n\n3) Killer sollten nicht sehen dürfen, was Überlebende für Items mitnehmen. Eine Werkzeugkiste per Killer-Lobby wird meist geduldet, jede weitere erhöht jedoch die Gefahr, dass der Killer die Lobby schließt. Probiert es ruhig mal aus!\n\n4) Wenn das Campen eines Killers eine erlaubte Spielweise darstellt, sollte das Verweilen an Ort und Stelle für die Überlebenden ebenfalls eine erlaubte Spielweise sein, die nicht bestraft wird, indem er eine Vogelhandlung aufmachen kann.\n\n5) Für den Killer sollte es nicht ersichtlich sein, dass eine Truppe „Survive with friends“ spielt. Das bedeutet, der Beitritt der einzelnen Spieler in die Killer-Lobby sollte immer in einem Abstand von wenigen Sekunden geschehen, nicht auf einmal. \n\nHabe neulich gelesen, dass die Killer-Spieler im März gestreikt hätten.
