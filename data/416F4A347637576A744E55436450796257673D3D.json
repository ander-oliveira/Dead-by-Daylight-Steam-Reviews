Эта игра где люди, почему то, заходят и выходят из комнаты или же заходят и афкашат, незнаю тролили это, или просто бараны которых впустили в интернет. Что касается самой игры то это невообразимо весело, если у убийцы заоблачный пинг он может тебя бить за 3, а то и 4 метра, или же сокомандники которые почему то афкашет уже в игре, или же просто ходят и ждут пока не останутся одни. Нахрена портить хорошую игру? Несчитая читерского убийцы с инвизом основная проблема состоит в команде баранов.

I supose it should also be noted that no I was not given any free beta keys for this game so what you read is my unfiltered opinion. \n\nThe Good\n-While not completly originally the the 4v1 gameplay in this game is USUALLY satisfying if your the killer or a survivor.\n\n-The game looks pretty good. Although the levels are randomly generated. The assets used for each map stay the same.\n\n-The sounds are good and the heartbeat noise that alerts you when the killer is near adds alot of tension.\n\n-There isn't much of a hud or screen clutter to remind you it's just a game, and what is there is useful.\n\nThe Bad\n-The bad stuff about the game out weighs the things it does well for me at least.\n\n-The game currently will not allow you to join a lobby with your friends. Leaving you with 2 options either make your own lobby and invite 4 of your friends (assuming you have 4 friends that also own this game.) or play pub matches.\n\n-Also because people can't join their friends it creates another issue. Which is people will spam joining and leaving lobbies to try and get into the same one as the person they want to play with. Which makes the wait time for a game to start that much longer.\n\n-If you want to be the killer you have to make your own lobby. Which means you could end up waiting a long time (some times 30mins) just to get a game started. Then after the game is finished you have to start all over because the game doesn't keep the lobby together.\n\n-Even after beta release the game can still be clunky with frame rate drops and genral proformance issues.\n\n-The progression system just seems like an after thought added in so they can try and give you something to keep you playing.\n\n-No way to chat with other players in game. So if you get stuck with people who suck and or don't know what they are doing your almost sure to lose. I should note that if you are the last one alive they allow you to use a trap door that is randomly hidden somewhere in the level to escape which helps keep things more balanced.\n\n-This last one only applies if you were thinking about getting the deluxe edition of the game. The extra stuff that was promised on the games release being the soundtrack and art book have yet to be received. Which I honestly only bought the deluxe edition for the 3 beta keys that it came with which I did receive and they worked fine. So I wouldn't recommend buying the deluxe edition.\n\nFinal Words\nAt this point in time I would say wait to buy the game. With the summer sale right around the corner you might be able to get it really cheap, and at least that way if this game doesn't get it's $hit together and ends up dying you won't have wasted so much money. If you don't like potentially buying a dead game then just avoid this one.","timestamp_created":1466355628,"timestamp_updated":1466355747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654737","author":{"steamid":"76561198032830327","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":331020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":172,"playtime_at_review":1488,"last_played":1660180767},"language":"english","review":"very fun sp00ky game","timestamp_created":1466355261,"timestamp_updated":1466355261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654714","author":{"steamid":"76561198047170309","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1657721964},"language":"schinese","review":"一个苦逼的农场主要四处追赶4个可恶的偷电小贼，必须找到好好教育一下！","timestamp_created":1466355182,"timestamp_updated":1466355182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654671","author":{"steamid":"76561198056700704","num_games_owned":1187,"num_reviews":491,"playtime_forever":1643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1570307217},"language":"japanese","review":"殺人鬼1 vs 逃亡者4 で行うかくれんぼ＆鬼ごっこ。\n\n逃亡者は初心者でも楽しめますが、鬼は若干訓練が必要。\n逃亡者同士の無言の連携がうまくいくとすごく楽しい。\n\n鬼に不意をつかれたときの緊迫感がやばいおもしろい！！","timestamp_created":1466354980,"timestamp_updated":1466426445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466832607984542847","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654643","author":{"steamid":"76561198119256554","num_games_owned":608,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":89466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1656691089},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego con buenos gráficos pero dentro del juego el malo (la bestia) esta demasiado rota y deben bajarla, por lo demas esta muy bien eñ juego","timestamp_created":1466354911,"timestamp_updated":1466354911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540836989879608154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654627","author":{"steamid":"76561198310862285","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":68,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1466357975},"language":"russian","review":"рекомендую","timestamp_created":1466354859,"timestamp_updated":1466354859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482233524322509766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654588","author":{"steamid":"76561198042907373","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":5185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1642807499},"language":"english","review":"Hopefully soon they'll implement party system and then killers will start leaving the games constantly is that what you want\n\nBUT; its a good game nonetheless","timestamp_created":1466354711,"timestamp_updated":1466354711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654564","author":{"steamid":"76561198161066180","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":84,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1660570052},"language":"german","review":"Richtig geiles game D:","timestamp_created":1466354614,"timestamp_updated":1466354614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547976195812225342","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23654503","author":{"steamid":"76561198020027442","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1565797844},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego muuuy divertido, una constante tensión!

These can include: faster healing, silent movement, more difficult to track/detect and perks that allow you to detect killers regardless of distance, cloak (Wraith) or obstructions (trees/walls).\n\n+ Environment favors survivors: While the levls are dynamic (randomly generated) they all feature several elements that grant survivors considerable advantage. Below are some examples:\n\n   - Hipity Hop: Low walls and windows create what are known as \"juke spots\" locations where a survivor repeatedly hops out of/over one ledge and back through the other. Survivors are much faster than the killer and become uncatachable.This tactic serves as both a troll and buys time for the other survivors.\n\n   - Now You See Me: The environment provides abundant concealment for survivors. All maps are shrouded in both a dark light and a miasma of fog. The map itself is populated with limitless tall grass and ruins allowing survivors to hide in plain sight.\n\n+ Clunky Killer: In many horror films the monster is often an un-stoppable, supernatural, omnipotent killing machine who seems to know the survivor's every move. Dead by Daylight forsakes this in favor of a lumbering, clumsy, oblivious bafoon. Examples include:\n\n   - No crosshairs or aiming/range indicator. All killers in Dead by Daylight only have access to two (2) modes of attack. A slow, inacurate melee and a unique secondary power/gadget. However you don't have any way of telling the range of your attack before you encounter an enemy player and are forced to guess if you're close enough, with each missed swing costing you valuable seconds which is more time than even an unexperienced player needs to escape.\n\n   - Slow: Survivors in DbD are insanely agile. Able to run for extended periods and vault objects in less than 3 seconds (yes I timed it) all without getting tired or suffering negative effects from prologed or repeated use. Killers, on the other hand barely manage a brisk walk, have no sprint capability and take in excess of 5 seconds to clear the same obstacles. Add to this that if a killer manages to hit a survivor they recieve an instant speed and manuverability buff that incurs no penalty upon expiration. Survivors freed from hooks also inherit this buff which guarantees escape and leaves the killer with nothing.\n\n   - Ghosts in the Fog: If a survivor is found and chased by a killer they leave orange \"hashes\" on the environment intended to indicate general direction of travel. Survivors have been known to use this vague means of tracking to thier advantage. Instead if fleeing in a a straight line they will often run around objects swamping the area in marks making tracking impossible. These hashes also vanish after a set time leaving no room to get turned around which is exactly what this tactic does.\n\n+ An Easy Escape: The killer's objective is simple; kill all four enemy players. The survivors have it even easier; activate any five of eight generators scattered about the map. This is made easier by the fact that all eight generators are feaseable, meaning that none are duds or traps. Also, any progress made by a survivor on a gen is kept even if they leave before finishing.\n\n+ Short End: Killer perks are often a random miss-mash of benifits. Most do very little or nothing to help you track survivors or find them in the first place. Also consider that each time you complete you \"blood web\" (skill tree) a new, random one is generated and it will, more often than not, contain useless items that don't make you any more effective. Survivors blood webs however, give them early access to detection and evasion perks as well as items such as the flashlight and medkit.\n\n+ No Fear: With all the above advantages playing as a killer rarely feels rewarding. The idea is for the victims to be frightened of the killer not laugh all the way to the bank match after match with thousands of points at a time.","timestamp_created":1466346430,"timestamp_updated":1504741912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23652288","author":{"steamid":"76561198001252555","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1513714960},"language":"english","review":"for whom the bell tolls\n\nCLING CLONG CLING CLONG CLONG CLING CLING CLONG CLING CLONG CLONG CLING\n\nwraiths passing by","timestamp_created":1466346340,"timestamp_updated":1466346340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23652284","author":{"steamid":"76561198041938215","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":4323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1695,"last_played":1531926938},"language":"russian","review":"Спасибо, за игру с друзьями.","timestamp_created":1466346333,"timestamp_updated":1468954216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23652260","author":{"steamid":"76561198013133399","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":52,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1547401008},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo divertido com aquele toque de tensão e medo o tempo todo isso se você jogar como vitima \ncomo assassino encarne Jason em pele osso caçe e mate todos\nno geral um jogo divertido","timestamp_created":1466346255,"timestamp_updated":1466346255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23652223","author":{"steamid":"76561197982895861","num_games_owned":409,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1466322802},"language":"german","review":"Eigentlich gutes Spiel aber die Runden sind viel zu kurz und es gibt keine Langzeitmotivation.

However as the game goes on the flaws become obvious to all.\n\n1. Balance: After the victims reach lvl 15 they start getting extra perk slots. While the Killers also get the same extra slots it does not work out as well. A team with everyone have 2-3 perks will not even be bothered by the killer unless the players are drunk... I mean currently vomiting on the toliet drunk. I have played both sides in this scenario and it is just horribly balanced and honestly not fun.\n\n1. The Community: It is utter garbage. People will do anything to protect their rank. From refusing to play with anyone who is not as high ranked as them to disconnecting (pulling the plug or shutting off wireless) from the game when the Killer actually gets ahold of them. Time and time again as you are about to sacrifice someone who has a high rank poof they are gone. They keep everything since the game considers it äccidental. Worst part the killer ends up losing points and rank because they finished the game.\n\nAlso this game was made to be played with random groups. People are not meant to be able to communicate while the match is ruinning. The Devs made an unranked mode for friends to play. However half the posts you will see on the forums are people who cry about this.

The problem is as usual, the players, and hacking. \n\nThe problem with the players is that like any other video game, they have figured a way to game the system so it ruins the fun of the game. The biggest thing about the premise is that you are supposed to get away, but too many people have figured how to obstacle hop. The will just sit there and wait for you to come for them and hop through a window. You go all the way around, they jump back through. The do it with the crates as well until you breal them. It's so incredibly lame as a killer it makes you want to just quit playing because while one person is obstacle hoping the other players are all targeting generators. Which brings us to problem number two int he premise is that the game is only one mode and it's got boring FAST. Players are supposed to turn on generators to open the escape and get out. That's it. Nothing more. It's really awful in that department because the game never changes for the Killer. You try to catch people, and for the most part you can get a few kills, but anyone who has played more than 10 minutes obstacle hops you to bordome.\n\nThe hacking is not TOO bad, but a lot of people are using some sort of speed cheat and ability to see you and other players. It ruins the game too.\n\nI was really hoping for a survival mode to which there is like a huanted house or something to which the survivors tried to live as long as possible. The generator defense game just ruins the game for me.  \n\nI bought the deluxe on sale, and $30 later I am highly dissatisfied with the game. The content that is supposed to be with the deluxe edition isn't even there. This game is practically in early access and it's listed as a full game. Shameless devcelopers.\n\n It pains me to not reccomend the game because it feels like it's soon to become a DLC wh0re . It's inevitable for that too happen. But more content better come fast or this game will dry up faster than the sahara after a rain storm.","timestamp_created":1466343540,"timestamp_updated":1466343540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487402290105819702","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23651493","author":{"steamid":"76561198143336701","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1590790947},"language":"english","review":"cool game with friends...","timestamp_created":1466343369,"timestamp_updated":1600572870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23651475","author":{"steamid":"76561198291175288","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1530088369},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏质量除了略单调一点肯定不错，有一个问题，拔线不计分对屠夫太不友好了，希望后续能修正这一点","timestamp_created":1466343294,"timestamp_updated":1466343294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23651455","author":{"steamid":"76561198241912854","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1477235295},"language":"english","review":"its a good game, but needs a lot of work. especially with the transitions when hoping in and out of lockers, pulling down objects to obstruct the killers way and the hooking of a player on and off is quite slobby and not in sync.\n\neven with the added patch notes its still quite hard to play properly. \n\nBUT ITS AN AWESOME GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS OR EVEN SOLO AND HELP UR TEAM MATES OUT!
