If things like achievements not working occasional animation bugs, and some items being unbalanced bother you, then wait a little while until they're fixed.\n\nPositives: \n[olist]\n[*] [u]The gameplay is fairly well balanced[/u], although it may not seem like it when you first start out, as some things can only be  learned through experience. But at the end of the day you can complete your goals as either a survivor or killer and have a good chance as either. \n[*]  The [u]random generation[/u] of map and elements means that both sides need to consider the map layout in their actions. Survivors don't automatically know where the generators are, and the killers don't automatically know where survivors are likely to camp items, as chest locations change.\n[*]  [u]All the killers have different playstyles[/u] and all the survivors specialize in different things. A match where the trapper is the killer will be played differently than a match where the wraith is the killer. A match with 3 lvl 15 jakes will be played differently than a match with all 4 characters.\n[*] [u]If you screw up as a survivor, it is not an immediate game over[/u], your friends can save you or you can salvage the situation. This makes it slightly easier on new players.\n[/olist]\n\nNegatives: Gameplay Edition\n[olist]\n[*]  [u]The tutorial teaches the main points and nothing else[/u]. While there is only so much strategy a tutorial can teach in a multiplayer game, some basic elements, like all the uses of items, are only stated on the wiki outside of the game, and not in the tutorials.\n[*] [u]Currently, the game is geared towards the selfish survivor[/u]. You are much more likely to escape if you repair generators while the killer is busy with your friends, than if you risk life and limb to save them.\n[*] [u]Balance issues[/u], most of which are minor: Any new survivor player will have difficulty if the wraith is the killer on enclosed maps, as they won't have the perks to know when he's coming and the enclosed areas mean they can't visually see him. The flashlight is very underpowered, and about as effective as it would be in real life. \n[/olist]\n\nNegatives: Tech Edition\n[olist]\n[*] [u]No queueing with friends[/u] (As of 6/16/2016). You can host private games, but you and 2 friends can't all queue in a group to get the full number of people.\n[*][u] Ranking issues[/u]: Rank is currently not an indication of skill, and there are 2 main categories of players; those who rank up indefinately, and those who don't care about rank and are continuously at rank 20, even as their characters get more and more skills and perks. (I'm not an amazing player, but I have a lot of perks as a crutch, and if ranking was alright, myself and quite a few others would probably be at rank 15-18 instead of at 20, shredding the poor newbies.)\n[*] [u]Minor bugs[/u], some of which are funny, (animation bugs), and some of which are annoying. It is possible for a hatch to be invisible and uninteractive even after the requirements to open it are met. If the trapper places a trap under a hooked player, then their teammates can't disarm it because the \"unhook\" prompt takes priority over the \"disarm\" prompt.\n[/olist]","timestamp_created":1466094176,"timestamp_updated":1467846519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23598529","author":{"steamid":"76561198036845524","num_games_owned":837,"num_reviews":187,"playtime_forever":34893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":462,"playtime_at_review":2521,"last_played":1660586463},"language":"russian","review":"[u]16 июня 2016г:[/u]\n\nПока что нет! Игра совсем сырая, вроде бы релиз, но играл всю бету с 30 мая - 14 июня и ничего не изменилось после релиза игры. Единственное изменение - после релиза игры в игре нет онлайна. Когда была бета, все постоянно играли в нее, поэтому можно было играть за обе стороны(выживший и убийца), а сейчас за убийцу в лобби вообще никто не заходит, а за людей тоже не с первого раза найдешь лобби хотя бы с 1 человеком. В бете было много ошибок и одна из них - ошибка при попытке присоединиться к лобби, пытаясь играть за человека, сейчас она все осталась, также часто выскакивает. В бете было 2 карты, а после релиза игры тоже 2 карты только другие. Но есть и свои плюсы после релиза игры и один из них это то, что увеличили радиус удара игрока, а то раньше надо было прямо в упор в спину подойти, чтобы это сделать. Короче суть в том, что пока вам лучше не тратиться на эту игру, но если у вас есть лишние деньги и вам делать нечего, то свободно покупайте. Deluxe издание ни в коем случае не покупайте! Оно не дает вам никаких преимуществ.\n\n[u]25 июня 2018г:[/u]\n\nЗа 2 года игра претерпела сильные изменения. Dead by Daylight стала одной из самых популярных игр у ютуберов, да и вообще в целом. Улучшили механику игры, добавили множество контента и не прекращают радовать новыми обновлениями и DLC. Но что было тогда, есть и сейчас. Дисбаланс в сторону выживших. Выжившие как были сильнее манька, так и остались.Насколько бы маньяк не был бы вкачан и силен, благодаря недоработкам механики игры настолько же вкачанные выжившие, или дажее слабее, все равно победят, если умеют играть в эту игру. На эту тему можно много написать, что, почему и как так получается, что выживший всегда имеет преимущество, но тем, кто играет, итак это ясно. Раньше хоть можно было побеждать изично за маньяка, когда выпускали новое DLC на него, пока его не пофиксят, но сейчас уже не так, на примере клоуна расскажу: ура, вышло новое DLC - новый маньяк и выживший, я его купил сразу же, пробовал на тесте, было неплохо. После я зашел в игру и сразу же приступил к убийству выживших, первая карта была больница (кстати единственная играбельная карта за клоуна, потому что он медленный и ему нужны узкие пространства где можно замедлить бутылкой выжившего и поймать) я в ней кое-как, но убил всех выживших, это было не очень сложно, но все же они были с аддонами и предметами, дальше мне несколько раз подряд попадались карты с открытой большой местностью, где клоун просто ничего не может сделать, к тому же еще выжившие порядком выше меня на несколько уровней, с сильными предметами и аддонами к ним, а у меня маньяк на этой стадии еще был сырой. И что ты не пытайся делать, ты проигрываешь. Даже если вкачать его сразу на максимум, то против таких же на максимум вкачанных выживших да и даже более слабых, но умеющих играть вы ничего не сможете сделать.\n\n[B]..........\n[URL=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35050278/]Страница Куратора[/URL][/B]","timestamp_created":1466094152,"timestamp_updated":1585768014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":49,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614950895309448242","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23598459","author":{"steamid":"76561197992044719","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":44,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44,"last_played":1466093837},"language":"english","review":"plain to the ass to wait 4 players to get the game started.","timestamp_created":1466093904,"timestamp_updated":1466093904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23598404","author":{"steamid":"76561198124033358","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1643962210},"language":"english","review":"I bought the deluxe edition and got the extra two copies.

И всё там было бы хорошо, но любая ошибка зверя приводила к концу матча, а аж четыре неубиваемых охотника вели себя, как душе угодно. И вот обратная ситуация - четыре жертвы пытаются спастись от маньяка, неуязвимого и очень страшного. И у жертв здесь есть право на ошибку.\nИх задача - открыть двери, включив электрогенераторы, и сбежать. Задача монстра с тесаком же проста и незатейлива - найти и убить всех. Найти поганцев непросто - они пытаются ползать по лесу, стараясь не шуметь, прячутся в траве и некими точками тела ощущают приближение убийцы. Но кто из нас идеален? Одно неосторожное движение - и генератор громко лязгает клапанами. Сидящие рядом на камне вороны шумно вспархивают в небо. Раненые стонут из кустов, привлекая маньяка. Быстрый бег оставляет в мягкой болотистой почве след. Да и против такого чудовища, появившегося поблизости, у выживающих есть лишь один метод - сесть подальше и надеяться, что он пройдёт мимо. Можно даже с минуту сидеть в пяти метрах от охраняемой им точки, пока он наворачивает круги рядом. Но рано или поздно мимо он не пройдёт, и тогда попытается убить.\nДогнать щуплого городского жителя спортивно подготовленному садисту довольно легко, однако габариты не позволяют ему быстро протискиваться через окна и нагромождения досок, а значит, по сильно пересечённой местности жертва может сбежать. Но зато, отследив траекторию и рванув наперерез, вполне можно достать этого надоедливого городского жителя топориком по макушке. Бег здесь - это настоящая дуэль ловкости, находчивости и хладнокровия. Сколько раз я видел, как расчётливый маньяк выходит прямо в лицо студенту, от страха навернувшему полный оборот вокруг сарая. Как девочка-скаут каждый раз, когда убийца пролезает через окно, нагло дразнит его прямо через подоконник уже с другой стороны. Как догадавшийся, где прячется сочное мясо, монстр делает вид, что ничего не заметил, но в последний момент оборачивается и голыми руками хватает подорвавшуюся жертву за одежду. И тут уж кому-то придётся повисеть на крюке для мяса, рассчитывая только на остальных, которые, может быть, придут и спасут его. А может, займутся генераторами, пока мясник сторожит добычу...\nDead By Daylight - это игра уловок, баланс в которой далёк от идеала, но которая может подарить вам массу интересных ощущений. Она сыровата, но на это не хочется обращать внимание. Главное - что она сможет занять вас, и этого времени будет не жалко.","timestamp_created":1466090150,"timestamp_updated":1466090150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23597505","author":{"steamid":"76561197997528910","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":263,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1660082740},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty fun as the killer if people don't dc CAUSE I HIT THEM ONCE LIKE OMG DONT","timestamp_created":1466090115,"timestamp_updated":1466090115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23597477","author":{"steamid":"76561198028037447","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":29534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1934,"last_played":1623543818},"language":"swedish","review":"Great game, fun, cool atmosphere.

Unlike other games that have attempted to move in on the assymmetrical horror game genre that DbD has (ex f13 and the latest DBD clone Soul at Stake), it somehow keeps me coming back to play more and more. It's a lot of fun with friends, and even at the moments of bad experiences with other players, I've had good ones and made a lot of new friends. A lot of funny ones and terrifying ones (looking at you Pig/Myers). \n\nSome of the things that I don't like are the auric cells. I think the cosmetics are super cool, and I've managed to get a lot of them from a gift card. Like, super cool cosmetics for both survs and killers. I happily support the devs, but I feel the prices are too steep. And the \"best\" skins for each character are locked behind these auric cells only. But no lootbox system, so there's that. \n\nAs of the 2.0 update, the pallet vacuum was removed, making it a bit more fair. But looping (a surv running around a pallet multiple, able to bend corners easier because of their smaller hitbox and waste the killer's time) is still a problem. Killers stomp at low ranks and are super weak at high ranks (rip me trying to get to rank 1 killer). SWF is a huge problem and often puts the killer at a huge disadvantage. \n\nPut a killer against a 4 man SWF, who all know how to loop and have Discord or other Voice chat with all meta perks and the killer is lucky if they get even one kill. On top of this, genrushing is a huge issue. Even with the perk Hex:Ruin or Hex: Huntress Lullaby or any gen slowing perks like Overcharge or Pop Goes the Weasel, gens get done most of the time way too quickly. \n\nSWF needs a change, perhaps a notification for the killer of who is grouped and who is solo. In exchange, I don't think the killer should be able to see a surv's profile or information (play time, achievements, etc). It gives way too much away. \n\nBesides those issues, and the occuring hilarious bugs/frustrating glitches, it really is a fun game at heart and I'd recommend it to anyone.","timestamp_created":1466089857,"timestamp_updated":1530889591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486960262060165405","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23597425","author":{"steamid":"76561198166679302","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1638634892},"language":"italian","review":"Bel gioco  peccato  per  l'impossibilita' di settare controlli della tastiera","timestamp_created":1466089829,"timestamp_updated":1466089829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544309794902801514","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23597402","author":{"steamid":"76561198053364110","num_games_owned":646,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":50469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":27731,"last_played":1660007897},"language":"english","review":"This is a game that I wish I could give a netrual for it is fun but it's also not fun.\n\nThis game works by pitting four players against one killer. The goal of the four is to power five generators one exit gate and escape. The goal of the killer is to brutally murder and sacrifice the four survivors.\n\nGames history\n\nGame was so infavor of the survivors at release it was pretty sad. Survivors cried that killers were OP and killers got nerfed.\nSurvivors continued to cry that killers were OP and the devs tried to fix something but broke the game by making killers able to hit through walls and lunge infinite distances. (It was quite humorus nerfed shortly after.)\nDevs finally addressed \"infinites\" for the first time (Infinite: The ability to remain 100% safe in the face of the killer they will never be able to get caught by the killer as long as they run this \"infinite\") by shutting some windows at random. It didn't solve the problem. Survivors still ran infinites the game was still in favor of survivors and survivors still cried Killer OP.\n\nThen the game changer happened. A new killer. The Nurse. Now the Nurse is not fair. As someone who was rank one the entire time I played both survivor and killer. I will say beyond a shadow of a doubt Nurse is broke. The reason for this is the nurse can travel large portions of the map in very short amounts of time. Can go through walls. And has very little down side. Playing as the Nurse stops infinites of every kind and requires innovative play from the survivors. Playing against the Nurse means you have to learn to play the game not just abuse infinites and because people are not willing to learn how to play they just want to abuse exploits the Devs don't fix. They cried killer OP (Not Nurse op Killer OP still.) Shortly after the Nurse released (3-6 weeks) I quit playing the game and quit following it.\n\nIt has now been two years and I have come back to try this game again. And one thing I can say for absolute certain. The game has not changed. Survivors still run infinites. The killer is still at extreme disadvantages. If you win as killer survivor cries Killer OP. If you look at forums Survivor cries killer OP. And if you play Nurse (The only killer that has a chance with the way the game is) people will find every excuse to rage and call you names.\n\nAnd even among all of this I still prefer to play killer. All of the killers I've played are fun to play however, it comes down to the choice of the survivors. Do you want to win? Then you will win. Do you want to just have fun? You probably won't win but you'll enjoy your game.\n\nAs a Survivor if all four survivors start the game immediately start doing generators then before the killer can hook a single person three generators will have been completed. With one person going to save the hook and the other two doing generators the last generators will be completed before the killer finishes sacrificing someone. The game is dicated by the choices the survivors make. Do you cry killer OP? Ok killers get nerfed. Did you want to win? Yes? Ok the game is over in 5 mins and Survivors win. Do you want to abuse infinites and exploits? Yes? Well they'll never be fixed because you're too busy crying killer OP.\n\nFor these reasons I would give this game a Netrual.\nSadly my choices are yes or no.

My current stance on DBD is very conflicted. I enjoy the game alot but recent things done by the developers have just put me off of the game. The wording they used made it seem like they had no part in the creation of NFTs and that the models being used for NFTs were entirely a thing done by the licence holders.\n\nTheir words exactly.\n\n\"When we work with our licensing partners, we provide them with in-game models as well as Chapter keys. They are free to use these however they see fit as the rightful owners of these characters.\"\n\nTonight? They say this\n\n\"Behaviour worked with Boss Protocol over several months to adapt in-game models for use as NFTs and approved them prior to the release of Pinhead in DbD. The NFTs have a chance to grant access to the #Hellraiser chapter of DbD.\"\n\nThey lied. And I just can't get down with that. Any of my good-will or faith in the developers has been shattered. For now, I cannot recommend this game when the developers lie to their player base, ignore them and openly support NTFs that are extremely damaging to the environment.\n\nFor now, avoid this game. If you REALLY want to get Dead by Daylight, get the original content with the earnable Iridescent Shards to get the original DLC content and just avoid licensed content for the time being.\n\nI'm extremely disappointed. Behaviour, this isn't a small hiccup, this is a major issue.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[June 16th 2016 Review]\n\n\nThe game is great.\nEveryone stop bitching about there being no lobby system. So sorry that the developers didn't add a lobby system within the first 2 days of launch. So sorry that they just can make an entire lobby system in 2 days. It's almost like they are developing content for the game. If you don't like the game, don't play it and get a refund. If you have such a huge issue with such a small feature what doesn't change change gameplay at all, then please, dont let me get in your way. Play and enjoy the game, and just stop whining about the one feature what WILL be added. It's enevitable. And atleast change your review from negative to positive when they do add it, because I know that there are SOME people who are just too lazy to chagne a review on steam, what NOONE will ever read after the first 10 hours.

I think one of the reasons this game has gotten so much flack is because it is not user friendly as in, the game is not EASY. There is a learning curve and all the no skill 12 year olds that cant play it and die within 30 seconds of the match rage. The game takes real skill, and requires you to think and pay attention too the entire map.

I must say that after all this time, Dead by Daylight has surpassed my list far beyond. With many more new and iconic characters to play with either from the game's own morbid but alluring lore or from popular horror culture. Each new map is better designed than the one before, and anything that was released before is kept in meta with balance patches and reworks. \n\nThough Micro-Transactions have been added to the game, they were provided to players mostly to enlarge the previously barebones cosmetic options for Survivors and Killers alike. Dead by Daylight is currently at a great spot as it constantly provides worthwhile new content while making sure that the game respects its core values as a grim horror experience. \n\nLast time I had said that Dead by Daylight is my favorite horror game. Though I have played many new possible candidates, that statement has still not changed. This game is an experience that every horror fan should at least give it a try to.","timestamp_created":1466082733,"timestamp_updated":1559450435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513203740119934082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595873","author":{"steamid":"76561198137987537","num_games_owned":457,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1653843663},"language":"english","review":"A mini friday the 13th :)","timestamp_created":1466082661,"timestamp_updated":1466082661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469565212726593018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595737","author":{"steamid":"76561198128312667","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1591888943},"language":"french","review":"super jeu","timestamp_created":1466082033,"timestamp_updated":1466082033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595568","author":{"steamid":"76561198300193248","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1657199347},"language":"russian","review":"ребят игра не запускается пишет ошибка лаунчера помогите","timestamp_created":1466081180,"timestamp_updated":1466081180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595452","author":{"steamid":"76561198063641283","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":86834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1169,"last_played":1659159858},"language":"english","review":"shit game because of my ex\n\ndont buy","timestamp_created":1466080583,"timestamp_updated":1630194099,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542164742946624756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595451","author":{"steamid":"76561198155611391","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1657543817},"language":"schinese","review":"时不时的可以来一局，祝这个系列越办越好。","timestamp_created":1466080576,"timestamp_updated":1657457221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595447","author":{"steamid":"76561198064578190","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1469109593},"language":"english","review":"I LIKE THIS GAME :) \nBUT I WANT TO PLAY WITH FRIEND AND OTHER PEOPLE ;(\n","timestamp_created":1466080548,"timestamp_updated":1466080548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595443","author":{"steamid":"76561198067575256","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":7831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1623940236},"language":"english","review":"fun horror objective game.\none issue though, they need to make a party system so you are able to play with your friends together as the survivours, many may argue their is private mode, but you get no xp and a friend has to play killer. other then that the game is a blast.","timestamp_created":1466080531,"timestamp_updated":1466080531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653792262077331543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595419","author":{"steamid":"76561198055878177","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":2709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1647674481},"language":"english","review":"Ever watch a horror movie, and yell at the characters- \"NO! Don't go in there!\" Or \"It's a trap!\" Or \"leave him, save yourself you idiot!\" Well, now you have to make your own decisions in that very situation.\n\nThis game is like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre simulator. If you are a horror fan, such as myself, I highly recommend this game. It is incredibly atmospheric, intense, and full of dread. Playing as a survivor or as the killer are both fun, but there is a certain primitive thrill that I get from hunting people down and instilling fear in their souls with the revv of my chainsaw!\n\nEach map, while all having a similar feel and similar props, feels unique and very horror-movie-esque (eg- cornfields, abandoned farms, etc). The game is surprisingly balanced I feel. This game isn't without problems, like matchmaking and the graphics being mediocre, but it doesn't take away from it's charm or the fun.\n\nI recommend this game, definitely worth the price :D Especially for horror fans.","timestamp_created":1466080385,"timestamp_updated":1466080460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469845712184906006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595410","author":{"steamid":"76561198135780449","num_games_owned":10165,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":35,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1466079781},"language":"schinese","review":"模拟恋爱养成角色扮演游戏-心跳回忆最新版，特别附赠予约特典-豪华钩子","timestamp_created":1466080352,"timestamp_updated":1466080352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":43,"votes_funny":80,"weighted_vote_score":"0.705320119857788086","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23595388","author":{"steamid":"76561198212946335","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1466364863},"language":"german","review":"So ein dreck ich hab mir das Spiel gekauft und würde das jetzt so gern spielen aber da ich Windows 10 habe geht das nicht.
