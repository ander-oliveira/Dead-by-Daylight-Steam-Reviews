It's my most consistent online game. The characters are a-plenty and the addition of licensed characters is a really cool and big plus. There's not really any other game where you can have characters from Resident Evil, Halloween, Stranger Things, Saw, and Left for Dead all in a match together- and that's not counting the other iconic franchises they under their belt I'm too lazy to add to the list. Their original characters are also very interesting and the lore behind the game is extensive and neat for those who like that sort of thing. You can just as easily play without reading any of it, too. The inability to fight back leads to some truly fun and interesting mind-games and strategies to keep from dying or killing survivors. I love horror and I love the concept and execution of this game. It has its issues, like any game, but honestly in the grand scheme of things I don't mind when I enjoy the game this much. \n\nMy biggest gripe is the lack of cross-progression. I was devotion 3 in my PS4 account with 4 prestige 3 characters and a LOT of things unlocked and purchased (after years of gameplay), and now that I'm on pc I lose all of that and have to start back at square one. It stings and I miss my characters and their skins and perks ;^;\n\nBut yeah! Love this game regardless and at least my best pal is also starting over so I don't have to do it alone

[/b]\n\nbom, vamos lá esse jogo é bem divertido até jogando sozinho, porém se você joga solo eu recomendo mais você jogar de killer do que de sobrevivente, até pq mtas vezes quando você joga de sobrevivente você cai com jogadores que quitam logo no início da partida, ou ficam entrando na janela segurando \"shift\" mesmo que o killer estivesse lá na pqp.

O jogo é bem cooperativo (CO-OP) por isso que é importante envolver comunicação nesse jogo mas como os desenvolvedores sabiam que a comunidade desse jogo já era tóxico por si só, eles decidiram nem colocar chat de voz e chat normal durante a partida. (O que é bom, né?) O problema é q jogando esse jogo solo é uma depressão profunda, o jogo só tem 2 emoticons que não é quase nada, se for pra querer passar alguma call do jogo e ajudar os outros, é mais fácil criarem emoticons novos, pq mds cara... 6 anos de jogo quase e nem isso tem direito. E por causa desse motivo que fica extremamente difícil jogar com os players aleatórios, não é q nem no FPS q não só depende do time, como depende de vc msm tbm pra conseguir ter mais e mais kills, aqui msm vc se esforçando o máximo pra salvar todos e jogando super bem, msm assim vc vai acabar se decepcionando pq ngm te ajuda nem porra nenhuma e tbm acabo jogando mal dps. \n\nEntão, sinceramente... esse jogo tá com falta mto grande de inovação, deviam colocar mais emoticons novos, mais modos e servidor de comunidade, assim como os jogos da Valve tem por exemplo. E tbm ter mais treinos com bots do dbd, de outros mapas e colocar dificuldade dos bots e do killer, pra treinar moonwalk, 360, 180, perseguição e etc. Acredito q se eles fizerem isso, pode ter certeza que esse jogo ficaria mil vezes mais divertido, ent eu espero q eles façam isso. \n\nPq com essa quantidade pequena de opções de modo do jogo e etc, deixa a desejar. Eu não vou reclamar das perks pq eu já me acostumei com as perks q os sobreviventes usam principalmente, pq isso envolve mais estratégia pro killer e pro próprio sobrevivente tbm.

Jugar de superviviente es mas complicado que jugar de asesino, pero, esto pasa solamente en rango bajos estoy hablando de entre 11/20 en los cuales se ponen a prueba que tan bueno eres junto con gente random para poder sobrevivir, a partir de los rangos 10/1 es donde se complica para los asesinos, en estos los jugadores ya tienen una amplia noción del entorno, poseen una multitud de recursos y pueden joderte fácilmente, he tenido partidas como asesino que no llegas a localizar a tu primer sobreviviente e instantáneamente completan 1 generador sin nombrar obviamente la persecución; estoy hablando de gente random, las amigos supervivientes son  peor una dificultad extrema y deja de ser divertido un gen rush asegurado. Esto le quita la gracia al juego el cual los sobrevivientes aprovechan y se burlan del asesino, deberían temer al asesino y no darles tiempo a burlarse.\nNo entiendo la razón por la cual el asesino solamente puede llevar equipadas 4 perks, teniendo en cuenta que te estas enfrentando a 4 supervivientes con 4 cada uno serian un total de 16 teniendo en cuenta que fuesen distintas entre si.\nDeberían implementar otros modos de juegos dependiendo el rango de superviviente/asesino el cual pongan o quiten restricciones, mas o menos dificultad.\n\nEl farm en este juego es excesivo, es muy tedioso hacerlo y te hace querer ir directamente a las perks que mas se usan y nada mas. Parece ser un chiste querer hacer prestigio con un asesino o superviviente no contribuye en nada, solamente un traje que es peor que los que se pueden conseguir en la tienda.\n\nLos supervivientes y asesinos no poseen ninguna característica especial. Los asesino además de su poder base no tienen ramas de habilidades que mejoren dicho poder, lo mismo sucede con los supervivientes no se especializan en las perks que te ofrecen por ej: claudette no tiene mas probabilidades de encontrar botiquines, que sean mas frecuentes en su red de sangre o poder fabricarlos.\n\nLos mapas son muy buenos grafica y estéticamente, pero, no hay mucha variedad entre ellos  MacMilan, granja ColdWind y pantano son los mapas que mas te van a tocar juntos a sus variantes.\nOtra cosa de los mapas en lo personal es que no poseen ninguna característica que beneficie o desfavorezca al asesino/superviviente el entorno no hace nada es simplemente un mapa llano, lo unico que me asusto en un mapa fue en el de silent hill, un cuerpo que cae de un casillero haciendo un ruido fuerte.\n\nEl juego es recomendable mas allá de todos los problemas que tiene.\nSimple, adictivo, partidas rápidas y muchas mecánicas que aprender.\nLamentablemente no creo que mejore mucho mas allá de lo que ya es. Como este juego no tiene competencia alguna pueden aprovecharse de esto.\nNo es un juego 5 estrellas pero como ya dije no tiene competencia.","timestamp_created":1627613894,"timestamp_updated":1627613894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96608999","author":{"steamid":"76561198341801514","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":38449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":848,"playtime_at_review":13743,"last_played":1660549594},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩就是血压高","timestamp_created":1627613770,"timestamp_updated":1627613770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96608768","author":{"steamid":"76561198968975993","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":15084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3725,"last_played":1655429965},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dahora","timestamp_created":1627613417,"timestamp_updated":1627613417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609115481376647949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96608534","author":{"steamid":"76561199100661391","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":51503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30072,"last_played":1654883568},"language":"brazilian","review":"bao dms","timestamp_created":1627613008,"timestamp_updated":1627613008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96608510","author":{"steamid":"76561198218750313","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1659309833},"language":"spanish","review":"nais","timestamp_created":1627612970,"timestamp_updated":1627612970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96607900","author":{"steamid":"76561198203356485","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":7434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":5177,"last_played":1660128211},"language":"english","review":"Pig fun\n\nNemesis wack though \n\nNFT Bad","timestamp_created":1627611940,"timestamp_updated":1634876621,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508670508861541748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96607857","author":{"steamid":"76561198879668231","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10835,"last_played":1640881322},"language":"latam","review":"Talindo, Un punto fuerte, es que, si haces parkour y te gustan las mortales, el nemesis te ayuda a aprender el Backflip.

Easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Theres so many bad things, that I dont even know where to begin with. From horrible game design, to terrible coding and an absolute disgustingly toxic communicty, which rivals a radioactive waste depot. \n\nFirst, the game is riddled with bugs and glitches. Sometimes killers hit you throuh walls and pallets, dead hard doesnt work or my survivor stops making injured sounds without having Iron Will equipped. My personal favorite was the Trickster injured me and instead of getting a movement speed buff like you should, my character slowed down as if being hit by the Clonwn's bottles. The absolute abysmal coding affects both survivors and killers - and its not an occasional occurence, it happens very often. Second, the game is inherently killer sided - unless you play SWF of course. SWF groups can dominate and bully a killer into submission until that killer never wants to play that role anymore. However, if you decide to play solo survivor, then kiss your good mood goodbye. Its one of the most frustrating experiences hands down. The MMR system is so flawed and trash, that you'll get some of the most polarizing games ever. Zou might get 3 decents teammates and escape. But you're infinitely more likely to get 3 dumbasses that only crouch around and not do a single gen. This constant coin flip of MMR is exhausting and even the most resistent mind will start to get annoyed by it. I wish I could get all those 400+ hours back that I invested into this game but I sadly cant. I also wished that there was at least some positive asepct to this game but there truly isnt. It was fun in the beginnig to play with your friends and start learning the game. That quickly faded though when you realize that its basically down to just being lucky if you wanna escape or get a 4k kill. Alternatively, you'd have to play like one of these YouTubers and to be frank I dont even wanna know how time they invested to get to that level. I see no point in trying even more since there is no way to actually get better.\n\nThere is simply no learning curve, only frustration and anger when playing this game. I wholeheartedly hope that one day a decent competition is going to show up and take DBD out. I literally had more joy writing this review than playing this game in the last couple months. 0/10 rating and a defintive uninstall","timestamp_created":1627605092,"timestamp_updated":1643239786,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96603652","author":{"steamid":"76561198091792512","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":35789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3237,"playtime_at_review":16563,"last_played":1660514428},"language":"english","review":"I have a hate and love relationship with this game.
