In game you do the same tasks over and over, match after match. Each match is different in it's own way, maybe the killer if different, or the map, or simply the locations of objects. Dead by Daylight has a very good atmosphere, as long as the game is played properly. Sure, there are those people who are toxic and joke around the whole time, but all games have those people. Even when you lose, most of the time you would have had your thrill and fun before you lost.\nOverall: Pretty good game, takes some time to learn, may get repetitive \nIf you are planning to get Dead by Daylight you should get it on sale. The time you lose waiting would just be spent burning out the game anyways.","timestamp_created":1543089491,"timestamp_updated":1543089491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46825157","author":{"steamid":"76561198363539273","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17873,"last_played":1641757277},"language":"english","review":"buy if you want salty game play camping killers and trash survivors","timestamp_created":1543089490,"timestamp_updated":1543089490,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46824907","author":{"steamid":"76561198063915872","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":15012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5576,"last_played":1581796018},"language":"russian","review":"Топ игра за свои деньги","timestamp_created":1543089353,"timestamp_updated":1543089353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46824838","author":{"steamid":"76561198110322963","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":20261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5948,"last_played":1656151148},"language":"russian","review":"К это игре я отношусь 70/30 в положительную сторону, НО\nКогда я покупал игру, мы играли её полной пачкой, то есть у нас была связь и мы просто рвали почти всех маньяков, но были и следующие:\n1)которые вешают тебя и смотрят в лицо, так называемые фейскемперы, против них ничего не предпримешь.\n2)которые бегают только за тобой, например, он тебя повесил, тебя снимают, а маньяку все равно на твоего спасителя(пока что)  и ман бежит за тобой.\n3)которые включают в себя пункт 2) и добавляют к этому подвал, боже, самое уродское место для выбора крюка.\n4)которые используют интернет соединение как орудие убийства, т.е. вы в лобби, все хорошо пинг 60-80ms, начинается игра, и хост(маньяк) убивает свою скорость... в следствии у всех сурвов пинг 200-300++ там нереально ни убежать, ни начать чинить мотор, ни просто двигаться, это просто верх на горе уродов. \n\nПока что оставим этих \"маньяков\" далее у нас оценка...\nэто просто что то, с чем то...\nэто коннект и интернет соединение. ранее меня все устраивало. сейчас пачку ищет ну оочень долго, и когда находит пати, то у хоста пинг размера оверсайз.. после долгожданного хоста с моего региона(не считаю особой проблемой) ты можешь дооолго грузиться и загрузиться без одного бойца в команде или просто не загрузиться в эту катку, вследтвии вылета хоста ты теряешь подношение, а это уже обидно, смиряешься с этим из-за утешительного приза в 5000 очков крови(а в основном это дырка от бублика и минус подношение) ты смиряешься и идешь искать следующую катку\nитак начинается игра, и когда маньяк на грани поражения, то он просто ливает, а сурвам, которые потели всю игру, дают 15% от среднего выигрыша очков крови, а бывает и такое, что минус ранг, я считаю, что ранг очень важен, ибо выше 12+- ранга играют начинающие, и если ты идешь в соло за сурва, то они тебе не помощники, а если помощники, то плохие, и вот ты потерял подношение, потерял ранг, просто выключаешь игру. game over","timestamp_created":1543089318,"timestamp_updated":1556477217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46824694","author":{"steamid":"76561198342423259","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18601,"last_played":1642505715},"language":"german","review":"All in all its fun ^^ And there are always coming new things in dbd","timestamp_created":1543089248,"timestamp_updated":1575054597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46824661","author":{"steamid":"76561198258028331","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":55222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14015,"last_played":1608742805},"language":"english","review":"I cannot recommend this game anymore.\nIt used to be fun, but now it's just filled with bugs, exploits and glitches with every new update that comes out.

not hard to say why this game is fantastic! You as a player can choose to be either a killer or a survivior. A killers job is to stop the survivors from escaping and vice versa as a survivor. The limited ammount of tools as a survivor makes it difficult to survive as most of the maps you can play on have a 30%ish rate of excape. If you play for a while there is a learning curve plus the bloodweb that you can grind through and as you unlock more abilitys you feel so much stronger. I am 830 hours into this game and I still love every second of it \"Almost\" The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is 4 man groups of survivors as the in game was designed to have a lack of communication to make you feel... More helpless. The jumpscares, the variety of killers and maps, and the tension does dull out after a few hundred hours of gameplay but none the less it is a fantastic buy, If they droped the whole game right now for 60 with all dlc youd be getting a steal.","timestamp_created":1543086750,"timestamp_updated":1543086750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46819365","author":{"steamid":"76561198010140024","num_games_owned":354,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":36526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2084,"last_played":1650834197},"language":"german","review":"einfach mal seine Freunde niedermähen.","timestamp_created":1543086732,"timestamp_updated":1543086732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46818927","author":{"steamid":"76561198193156117","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":69372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22397,"last_played":1658215837},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight хорошо заставляет игрока чувствовать себя и жертвой, и охотником.

Четверка выживших должна избежать объятий маньяка, запустить пять генераторов и поскорее смыться через один из открывшихся выходов. Маньяку же надо выследить бедолаг и нежно насадить на крюки.Маньяков во игре достаточно. Так скажем на вкус любого садиста пойдёт!) И вот она, первая проблема: капканы — единственный реально полезный навык (Охотник). Из невидимости нельзя атаковать, она долго активируется и долго снимается, еще и оповещая выживших звоном (Призрак). Получается жутко, но очень уж непрактично. Бензопила звучит не менее устрашающе, но, схватив ее, маньяк несется вперед, становясь почти неуправляемым: куда чаще просто таранишь стены и углы, нежели разделываешь жертв (Деревенщина). Дальше думаю продолжать не стоит ибо это будет долго, да и мне лень)).\nПоиграл я в сея творение когда оно вышло, и реально зашло, но потом в игре куча всего стало появляться,косметика,юзлесс перки и т.д.\n5 из 10","timestamp_created":1543086527,"timestamp_updated":1646506094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46818892","author":{"steamid":"76561198008653022","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":42115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":125,"playtime_at_review":19706,"last_played":1660399697},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good job","timestamp_created":1543086507,"timestamp_updated":1543086507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46818082","author":{"steamid":"76561198275333605","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8124,"last_played":1639074424},"language":"brazilian","review":"Varios killer camp kkkkk","timestamp_created":1543086138,"timestamp_updated":1543086138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46817727","author":{"steamid":"76561198806696445","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":124762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12150,"last_played":1658610082},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good job so far...\nThe devs have fixed a lot of problems.

original review is at the bottom. The thoughts there are still true even after 2k hours. However, I am changing my recommendation to no because of the current state of the game (April 2022). \n\nEver since the MMR update the game has changed dramatically. Every match feels precisely the same as the previous, only seeing a handful of the over 20 killer roster each match. Every game is an exercise in frustration, whether it be getting camped, getting tunneled, or seeing survivors just holding forward. Not running meta perks leads to \"no fun allowed\" scenarios, resulting in feeling forced to bring specific perks just to mitigate the risk of not being able to play the game.  \n\nI have ZERO hope the devs will fix this fundamental flaw because of the history with balancing patches and feature introduction in this game. Instead of listening to feedback and adjusting things in a healthy way, the devs often double down on terrible fixes or nerfs that don't fix the fundamental issue with the things being adjusted. Whether this be perk changes, killer tweaks, you name it, the developers often miss the mark and would rather behave like children when the fans that love this game offer CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. I do not expect them to produce perfect patch after perfect patch but the current game lacks any kind a variety in builds (ironic considering there is over 100+ perks, over 20 killers, and dozens of maps in the game) and MMR has made every game a sweatfest of epic proportions.\n\nI play this game because it is fun. The current product is everything but that and I cannot recommend jumping aboard this sinking ship. Proper competition may eventually reach the market but as of now this game is becoming a victim of its own success with no hope left in sight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI was hesitant to get this game at first because I couldn't quite understand what makes it so popular. Tried it for the first time on a free weekend and instantly fell in love. The game really captures the essence of being a hopeless survivor (when playing alone) or a brutal killer. Each killer has variety and a unique identity that defines them. Overall, this game is engaging and addicting, even if the community can be toxic at times.","timestamp_created":1543083299,"timestamp_updated":1648926774,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46812005","author":{"steamid":"76561198408868780","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":71633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2614,"last_played":1659155777},"language":"spanish","review":"una locura de adrenalina y risas !","timestamp_created":1543083273,"timestamp_updated":1543083273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46811892","author":{"steamid":"76561198236665898","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":15143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14628,"last_played":1558896042},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Dead by Daylight это: [/h1]\n[list]\n [*]Когда проиграв 250 часов, ты все еще находишь новые нюансы игры \n[*]когда коллективная игра исключает командную игру из-за плохих тиммейтов \n[*]когда на первых рангов все играют исключительно в тунеллинге и кемпинге. \n[*]когда спасая тиммейта он бежит именно в стороне маньяка.\n[*]когда интернет убийцы не позволяет тебе убегать от маньяка, поэтому ты летаешь через всю карту. \n[/list]\n10 поломанных генератор из 10. \n9 кемпинг-убийц из 10\nи конечно, 100 [strike] шикарных [/strike] тиммейтов из 10.","timestamp_created":1543083220,"timestamp_updated":1543083220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46811809","author":{"steamid":"76561198026000101","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":12556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11454,"last_played":1595260732},"language":"english","review":"Surely the most entertaining aftergame chat: From \"Tunneling camper, Unskilled NOED pleb, camping bitch\" etc. to \"you`re such a sweetheart, lovely killer\" etc.\n\nThe game itself is fun.

Till this time no new content is made. Because of this reason my friends gave up playing it. Devs make only new events and payable skins, new charachters - but it is not a content. There are no new modes. There is only one mode in a game, nothing more.\nThere are a lot of unfixed bugs, broken hitboxes. For example, when I play as surv, I always get hit through pallet when I try to srop it, I always get hits from trickster or huntress when I am hiding behind something while pressed CTRL, so the hatchets hit you through obstackles. When I quick (straightly) jump through the window, I get hits from killer all the time. It takes ages to jump through it and killer will hit you with like 80% chance. My chanses to escape as surv are like not more then 10%. Normally I get noob teammates who dont know what to do in a game and ruin it, I get animal killers vs me who tunnel you. So while playing the game I get no fun - only bad mood, angryness, rage and want to kill all my teammates, killer and their families. So the game causes only negative emotions. I recommend to buy the game, play few games, realize that I was wright and the game is trash, uninstall it and refund money back.","timestamp_created":1543081871,"timestamp_updated":1627166285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46808905","author":{"steamid":"76561198041180171","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3071,"last_played":1556985767},"language":"english","review":"One of the most toxic communities I've ever witnessed and this game still in a need of some major re-balancing.","timestamp_created":1543081797,"timestamp_updated":1561922895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46808052","author":{"steamid":"76561198147172315","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19402,"last_played":1596581417},"language":"russian","review":"Игра понравилась","timestamp_created":1543081402,"timestamp_updated":1543081402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46807967","author":{"steamid":"76561198326918021","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2227,"last_played":1603889296},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1543081367,"timestamp_updated":1543081367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46807956","author":{"steamid":"76561198332605194","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":74446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1085,"playtime_at_review":22362,"last_played":1660261059},"language":"polish","review":"gra wspaniala na wspolne granie.","timestamp_created":1543081362,"timestamp_updated":1637796131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46807955","author":{"steamid":"76561198800185623","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1602257984},"language":"russian","review":"топ\n","timestamp_created":1543081362,"timestamp_updated":1543081362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46807780","author":{"steamid":"76561198410168926","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":776,"last_played":1644418536},"language":"english","review":"This game feels so good to play and the game is a ton of fun.\n101% worth the money.","timestamp_created":1543081278,"timestamp_updated":1543081278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46807577","author":{"steamid":"76561198421254145","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":86371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":275,"playtime_at_review":23968,"last_played":1660590200},"language":"german","review":"Geiles Spiel!
