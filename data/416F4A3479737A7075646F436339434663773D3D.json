Yes they are.\nIs the gameplay repetitive in it's nature? Yes it is.\nIs DbD a bad game? Not at all.\n\nThis game, although somewhat repetitive, still pushes me to play it. The gameplay is nice with a multitude of killers and different survivors with their own unique abilities.\n\nThe only problem? Everything is long. From the queue times that I mentionned earlier to the character ranks and levels that take forever to get. Even worse, the only way to unlock stuff for your characters is to level them up.\nThis is probably why I see a lot of high leveled/high ranked players play like scaredy cats and never going in for risky saves and whatnot, they don't want to lose their progress.\n\nAlthough this game WILL make you wait, I think that it is still worth it's price but that you shouldn't sit for massive marathons as it will get boring.","timestamp_created":1488089597,"timestamp_updated":1488089597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479120522737503052","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30187127","author":{"steamid":"76561198094539294","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":153,"playtime_at_review":22831,"last_played":1659415670},"language":"english","review":"As someone who has owned this game since the beginning, I am seriously disappointed coming back to find where this company has gone with this game. The killers have it SO easy now, once they have more than one perk, every game is literally spoon-fed to them. Only people who are new to this game seem to struggle with killing ALL survivors every round.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]DISABLING HOOKS/WIGGLING[/h1] Bring back disabling hooks indefinitely or adjust how close hooks are in each game without an offering. There is almost no chance of wiggling out, especially because now survivors can't wiggle while the killer is recovering? Maybe this was park of a perk but it was very frustrating. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]PUNISH CAMPING[/h1] The fact that you stand by this exploit as a 'valid tactic' is just straight up a mistake. It ruins the game for 4/5 people playing, and is not fun to play against. Make it so that as long as the killer is within the radius of a hooked survivor for (x) time, generators begin to repair (y)% faster, and have it increase incrementally. \nThere are many ways to solve camping, none of which seem to peak any interest from you. It makes me not want to continue to play this game.\n\nSurvivors camp too! It's ridiculous having useless teammates ending the game with more bloodpoints when they just sit and wait at the hatch once it spawns while their team does the rest of the work.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]NERF THESE PERKS; [/h1]\n[b]++Corrupt Intervention -[/b] Why on this planet did you think 120 seconds was a good idea? For TWO MINUTES, three generators are completely irrelevant and they're all in the same area because they're the furthest ones from the killer. If it was random that would make more sense, or if you nerfed the time.\n[b]++Iron Grasp -[/b] What is the point of even having wiggling when you can't wiggle out in between hooks on most maps. Now you also have a perk that can reduce wiggling effects up to 75%?! HELLO?\n[b]++Hex -[/b] Undying: ADD A COOLDOWN\n\n[hr][/hr]\n [h1]NERF THESE KILLERS; [/h1]\n[b]++Doctor -[/b] You can just spam electrocute people until you catch them screaming as they try to climb through a window or knock down a pallet. It's not even tough to catch people.\n[b]++Leatherface -[/b] Quite literally why did you make this character instead of making it a skin for the Hillbilly? It's a character completely designed for camping. Hook one survivor and the game is over because you can just instantly kill anyone that comes to save them. It's actually ridiculous.\n[b]++Deathslinger -[/b] Fix how getting harpooned interacts through windows/walls.\n[b]++The Clown -[/b] Can throw two potions and hit someone within 2 seconds.\n[b]++The Twins -[/b] Victor is way too fast.\n[b]++The Hag -[/b] She can currently place ALL of her traps in a circle around a hooked survivor. It should have a limit of proximity from other traps or a longer cooldown effect.\n[b]++The Legion-[/b] Has basically no negative effects for missing hits. Which wouldn't be an issue if she didn't run 1000 feet per second. It's ridiculous.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]GAME MODES[/h1]\nThere is so much potential for new game modes. Can you imagine a prop hunt styled game mode in DbD? It would be outrageously funny. The custom games that would come from it. Among Us styled where the killer looks like a survivor and has limited abilities? Killer v Killer? Definitely need more here.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]THE HATCH[/h1]\nThe ability for the killer to close the hatch with one survivor left is ridiculous considering how long it takes to open the door. For one survivor, the killer can close the hatch, and check BOTH doors before the survivor can get to a door/look for the hatch and open a door. It should be time enough for a 50/50. If the killer chooses the right door, the survivor is found, if not, they escape.\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to killers than can one hit the survivor (Ghost Face, Mike Meyers, etc). 0 Chance to escape with killers like that, especially since they can openly search for the hatch faster.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]MATCHMAKING[/h1]\nSo you're playing a game as normal. Suddenly, your game crashes, and you have to restart it. You load back into the game to find YOU'RE TEMPORARILY BANNED. Which wouldn't be an issue to stop people from just quitting if your game was stable. So why not make it so that you can RECONNECT TO THE GAME if you're a survivor??? I don't understand who thought the instant ban was the way to go without scanning crash logs or something first.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nTDLR; The game is not balanced. The killers have it EASY. How do I know? I have around 500 hours played. \n\nI'll add/edit more as this goes.","timestamp_created":1488087901,"timestamp_updated":1612036315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30186344","author":{"steamid":"76561198368665895","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1534211853},"language":"schinese","review":"很棒.但是新手非常蛋疼","timestamp_created":1488084961,"timestamp_updated":1488084961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30185957","author":{"steamid":"76561198143881946","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":153006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10908,"last_played":1594243305},"language":"brazilian","review":"Acho o game muito viciante,tanto sendo o killer como o survivor\nmesmo não gostando de terror, esse game é apaixonante\nas vezes ele dá pancadas de lag, alguns bugs.. \nmas tirando isso é um excelente jogo, recomendo !","timestamp_created":1488083590,"timestamp_updated":1488083590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514836370944976807","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30185451","author":{"steamid":"76561198360118819","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":150101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25117,"last_played":1611894069},"language":"thai","review":"nice game but have some bug","timestamp_created":1488082005,"timestamp_updated":1488082005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30185274","author":{"steamid":"76561198343635269","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":15904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1563981120},"language":"schinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1488081426,"timestamp_updated":1488081426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30185186","author":{"steamid":"76561198069203785","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":58309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29878,"last_played":1613081056},"language":"english","review":"I have finally changed my vote from thumbs down to a thumbs up.

Ich spiele Dead By Daylight seit fast 700 Stunden. Also weiß ich wovon ich rede. Das Spiel ist gut! Und das Spiel entwickelt sich ständig. Sei mal dahingestellt in welche Richtung. Ob nun gut oder schlecht... Naja. Aber es entwickelt sich. Leider sieht man das nicht oft bei Spielen. Die Devs sind ständig dabei und machen neue Sachen. Sie probieren sich aus und versuchen es auszubalancieren. Dafür dicke Probs.\n\nDer negativste Askept ist die Community. Einer beschuldigt den anderen. Egal was man macht, es ist falsch. Zur Zeit entwickelt sich so ein kleiner Teufelskreis. Ob die Survivor oder die Killer angefangen haben spielt dabei auch keinerlei Rolle. Aber einer sabotiert nur noch Haken und macht das ganze Spiel lang nichts anderes. Der nächste denkt er sei der Oberprofi und regelt das Spiel alleine. Auf der Killerseite sind fast nur noch Camper (stehen durchgehend beim Haken oder sogar direkt davor) oder Tunnler (Die nur noch den nehmen, der am Haken hing und alle anderen komplett ignoriert). Für beides gibt es natürlich die Oberexperten die meinen, jaaa dann musst du das und das machen. Oder dies und das. Mag ja sein, dass es hilft, aber der Reiz des Spieles ist, dass man mit fremden Leuten zusammengeworfen wird und es möglichst als Team raussschaft. In all den Spielen die ich bis jetzt spielen durfte, kam dies leider viel zu wenig vor. Denn jeder denkt an sich. Und die Killer werden immer mehr gebufft. Ich möchte das auf keinen Fall schlecht reden. Finde ich sogar gut, denn es gab Zeiten, in denen der Killer ein absoluter Witz war, dennoch sind einige Sachen sehr unausgereift.\n\nAber wie anfänglich erwähnt. Sie arbeiten dran ein Balancing zu finden und das möchte ich Ihnen gut schreiben. Die Entwickler können nichts für die Community.\n\nSehr gutes Spiel.

OR you get the laggiest game experience that you ever saw... \n\n3. More bugs and exploits people could use without getting punished or anythign being done against it.\n\n4. Wrong priorities by teh developers: They rate pumping out new PAID DLCS higher than actually takign a step back and fixing stuff the community really tells them to fix for month over and over again.\n\n5. Saltiest Community next to league of legends where no matter how your playstyle as a kilelr is, you will always get shit on by survivors that got killed by you and vicy versa killers will always flame about \"unfair\" survivors... really really not enjoyable.\n\nYes i have over 1200+ hours in this game mainly because i streamed it and had a nice community in my stream, but since the latest \"engine update\" where they wanted to make the game look better and increase the performance they actually made the game even more laggy for a lot of players (and yes my pc specs are more than enough to properly stream and play this game in theory) ... but i guess proper programming isnt their strength. Cant play this game anymore since the update ! nice!\n\nTake your 20+DLC bucks and spend them on a different game, this is a sinking ship\n","timestamp_created":1488066632,"timestamp_updated":1488066632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30181043","author":{"steamid":"76561198084195434","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":33936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10216,"last_played":1651241967},"language":"english","review":"Dont play this game if you want to play with your friends together, cause you are gonna wait for a loooooooooooooooooooooong loooooooooooooong time.

Here are a few points why this is NOT worth buying.\n\n- Toxic Community: Fail to unhook someone, camp someone to win, do anything that's not in the meta and you're bad. After game chats are as toxic as Chrenobyl, with no one actually taking blame or taking responsibility for what they did.\n\n- Unessecary Competitive \"Resets\" and Bad Lower Ranks: Every 13th of each month, you're rank is reset to almost the lowest rank, with mine, 7 (the 7th highest) going to 19, (the second lowest). Rank resets are not only unnecessary, as there is no \"placement matches\" or highly competitive tiering system (where only X amount of people can hold a rank) to warrant a reset, as well as the fact that good players have to play with sub-par or below average teamates in a RANKED TEAM-BASED game. It just ruins the game to have to play with lower skill ranks that do not understand the game.\n\n- Lack of an Unranked Gamemode: Sure, you can play with a party of just friends, but lacking friends to play with causes you to have to play ranked, because there is only ranked. Unranked public online games in Dead by Daylight simply do not exsist. \n\n- Balance Issues in play: Some killers such as: the Nurse and the Doctor both counter key aspects to a Survivor's gameplay. The Nurse has an overpowered blinking ability that allows her to teleport closer to any survivor she's chasing. This also allows her to teleport straight through objects, walls and pallets, the latter being the keystone to a survivor's survival due to the lack of other options presented by the devs. Which brings up my next point, the Doctor. The Doctor has an electrical field that can go through walls and objects and is on at all times that forces the survivor to scream and give away his position while within his terror raidus. These 2 killers take away the Survivor's ability to avoid killers, one being the Nurse and the chase, and the other being the Doctor and hiding.\n\n- In Conclusion: This game is only fun in the high ranks, low ranks suck because most of the people playing are incompetent, trolling, are new or haven't played in a long time. I would not reccomend this game.","timestamp_created":1488051102,"timestamp_updated":1518822745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479166656732559204","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30175432","author":{"steamid":"76561198055337166","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5105,"last_played":1636239908},"language":"french","review":"J'aime ce jeu.
