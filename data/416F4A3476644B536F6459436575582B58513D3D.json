reviewed the game with a silly phrase and i'm editing the review cause i got the hours to back it up what I WANT TO SAY....\nThis game is fantastic(don't mind the silly rage quit kids),for 20 bucks

(another one is coming) with clothes to personalize.....(20 bucks)with 5 modes to play.....Kill your friends,Survive with friends,Survivor mode,Killer mode and quick mode.Generated skill tree where you can combine 4 diferent slots of Itens,Add-ons,Offering and Perks to create multiple play styles....(20 bucks).Really???What's the catch?\n\nWell the catch is that the game suffers from constant pressure of silly kids who take things a little too serious while playing.....there's been bugs of rendering and some minor aspects of loading parts of maps,players get stuck under some rocks and and stuff and i dont get cause i never had any of this things in the amount of hours i had...they had over 30 bug fixes 3 days after release and people complained....They created survive with friends at people demands in 4 weeks and they complained,Infinite loop jukes got cried out they fixed a lot and people complained(20 fk bucks).\nWell i know the game is not perfect,none really are,the matchmaking is annoying for people,from what i've heard(never waited more then 2 minutes for each game,Ever),the dc's and lack of punishment for both sides,the hilarious part of lack of content(20 fk

Laggy games, stuttering, messing up skill checks, not being able to successfuly escape from the killer all vital things required to, you know, Win? On top of this, it means you'll be waiting 10 minutes plus for a possible 30 seconds of gameplay.\n\nBugs and glitches abound as shown in other reviews, You can get stuck vaulting, which results in you dying, not being able to be picked up, other survivors not being able to revive you which, by the by, is the only way to actually recover from being downed with the bar only being a slight cock tease as to you reviving.\n\nUnfair perks towards the killer, penalties given to the survivors if the KILLER leaves, and the Wraith is just utter easy mode for them, the ability to wander the entire map invisible is a complete cheese personal opinion on this is that the Wraith needs rescource management or to be allowed to only stay invisible for a certain amount of time, the slasher is fairly alright, maybe up the ability to escape traps easier and the Hillbilly is perfectly fine In my opinion\n\nIn conclusion, buy this game if you're going to have a group of friends to play it with, as I've had loads of fun in private games with 5 people. Don't buy this game if you plan to go in alone\n\nTLDR: Matchmaking now works better\nMyers is easy mode\n to the 4 survivors\n\n6/10 Wait for them to do something about Myers\n\nU P D A T E \nCongratualtions, upon releasing Myers you've absolutely ruined the game.\nBullshit one hit attacks\nno indication on where he is\nand you're banning people for Camping\nCmon Guys, what the fuck are you doing?","timestamp_created":1470056784,"timestamp_updated":1478199982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531914889812469482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24651570","author":{"steamid":"76561198289767765","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1570989428},"language":"thai","review":"เล่นไม่ได้\n","timestamp_created":1470054929,"timestamp_updated":1470054929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24651553","author":{"steamid":"76561198132914719","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":9618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2458,"last_played":1659286296},"language":"russian","review":"прикольна я прото офигенная игра море фана да и поугарать над месником или наоборот над выжывшими","timestamp_created":1470054864,"timestamp_updated":1470054864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447154492139816284","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24651465","author":{"steamid":"76561198154726218","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9985,"last_played":1514581942},"language":"german","review":"Eigentlich gutes Spiel, aber wenn der Killer ne scheiß Leitung hat und dann mitten im Spiel verlässt, wird dir trotzdem einer von diesen Rang Balken abgezogen.

Well this game is like evolve except not frustrating when you play the killer. It's actually kinda thereputic watching you victim get impaled on a meat hook and waiting for the dark lord (cthulhu perhaps?) come and claim your sacrifice. This game has amazing potential.

As a result it's caused me to make what is now 3rd change to my review of it. \n\nMy previous review was to the effect of \"It's flawed but the devs clearly seem to care as the issues eventually get fixed\". I can no longer say this. The team that gave this game it's strong identity and allure at the start has clearly left or been reshuffled to an insane degree. BHVR have gone from wanting to tighten up their new game experiencing teething problems to a developer that only cares about how much time and money it can siphon from it's overly addicted & toxic player-base.\n\nThey flippantly dismiss all player concerns about the game. One example I shall never forget is Cotes unironically looking at the camera when talking about the release of the Resident Evil Chapter and saying \"I still think we did a pretty good job so far\"... Only for the RPD map, arguably the BIGGEST amount of content people PAID for to be buggy and disabled for A WHOLE MONTH after release. They still happily took players money for something they clearly put no quality control into... Cote's \"PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr\" attitude followed immediately by the release of broken content is embarrassing, and no, more bloodpoints & Iri shards doesn't make selling a broken product any less reprihensable. \n\nThe latest major update for the game is the final nail in the coffin for me. Survivor perks always make it through the PTB unaltered whereas new killer perks & base kits will almost always get a nerf shortly after the PTB, to the point where they no longer resemble the product they were happy to take your money for. \n\nFor this game to get a \"recommended\" from me some MASSIVE changes would need to be made. But I don't believe the developers care enough to divert their attention away from churning out more paid cosmetics to fix it. In it's current state don't buy it. Take it from someone who avidly followed this game since it's release.","timestamp_created":1470045247,"timestamp_updated":1643417220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495000004768371582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24649353","author":{"steamid":"76561198099636653","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2100,"last_played":1546355737},"language":"schinese","review":"敢问农场的那个桩子我没挂过？最怕的还是电锯动不动就听到那电锯的声音心惊胆战的！反正这个游戏乐趣无限！88值！","timestamp_created":1470044756,"timestamp_updated":1470044756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24649278","author":{"steamid":"76561198214514433","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1427,"last_played":1538290936},"language":"russian","review":"Купил позадротить, в итоге у друга играющего через семейный доступ часов больше","timestamp_created":1470044338,"timestamp_updated":1533019383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24649081","author":{"steamid":"76561198035666267","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2806,"last_played":1628120838},"language":"english","review":"addictive, a few bugs, this issues have been fixed every week since i started playing it, though.

Вы скажите сбегать это же круто, я с вами соглашусь, но экспу заработанную за эту катку вы не получите и ваш труд просто коту под хвост. Из 5-10 игр, вы отыграете полных 1-3. Цена этой игры потолок 100 рублей за кучу багов и лагов, да разработчики фиксят баги, но в игре их по-прежнему невыносимо много. Поэтому, если вы вдруг купили игру, то купите пачку успокоительных, а лучше две. И еще огромный минус игры в том, что игра не имеет регионов, а значит ты  находишься на Камчатке и можешь попасть в игру к примеру Московской области, где интернет в разы лучше, и твой пинг будет около 150+. Когда игру доведут до ума, она уже будет никому не нужна, по этому не советую!","timestamp_created":1470027074,"timestamp_updated":1470469824,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438413351774215698","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24646129","author":{"steamid":"76561198067540269","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1567224092},"language":"english","review":"You get caught, its pretty much game over.\n\nKiller likes to camp\nAllies won't come get you\nYou come to try to free someone, oh hi killer.......\n\nNot to mention a couple of hackers I have found....","timestamp_created":1470024650,"timestamp_updated":1470024650,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518094360828399658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24646038","author":{"steamid":"76561198157331132","num_games_owned":1042,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":67230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":983,"playtime_at_review":8152,"last_played":1660490157},"language":"schinese","review":"很爽的游戏","timestamp_created":1470024041,"timestamp_updated":1470024041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24645968","author":{"steamid":"76561198212619700","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5105,"last_played":1655478435},"language":"schinese","review":"总体还可以咯。","timestamp_created":1470023608,"timestamp_updated":1470023608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24645869","author":{"steamid":"76561198046445186","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1540750048},"language":"spanish","review":"Para pasar el rato!","timestamp_created":1470022970,"timestamp_updated":1470022970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24645776","author":{"steamid":"76561198058162166","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":111190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":730,"playtime_at_review":33388,"last_played":1660572267},"language":"tchinese","review":"每年一更 好啦!","timestamp_created":1470022326,"timestamp_updated":1637845358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24645675","author":{"steamid":"76561198210362948","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1655170853},"language":"thai","review":"เล่นตอนแรก ใจสั่นมาก แต่โดยร่วมก็สนุกดี ลุ้นละทึกตอนผีมา ติดนิดนึ่งถ้าไม่แลค กับ Join Game ยากบางที","timestamp_created":1470021613,"timestamp_updated":1558205600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24645548","author":{"steamid":"76561198057102834","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":57575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27822,"last_played":1641775115},"language":"english","review":"Somehow the devs keep the game going.

The man who gives credence to the old adge of \"its just cold outside\", in response to why his penis would be smaller than a vienna sausage. They abuse obvious loopholes in the games mechanics, like camping generators/escapes to insure their victory. Even in the event you get lucky (unlike myself) and actually get a cool team willing to complete the game together ( as I can only assume it was intended to be played) this peace of shit will probably knock you down, hang you, and camp you till you die. Regardless of the fact that they have to wait like 40mins to get a team of survivors willing to play against them, this gamer is willing to go the extra mile . Afterall its not like he can power trip on people when hes working his usual 9-5 at the local gas station. They also don't get penalized for leaving mid game like survivors, which is perfect because its not like running away from them is the objective of the game or anything.\n\nAll in all the games got potential and could have been something worth talking about in the horror community, as there aren't nearly as many titles for this gaming category as I would like there to be.
