the game isn't in its best state right now but after the 6 year stream, I have a lot of hope for the future of DbD. For that reason, I'm recommending it. New players might be a bit irritated by the stagnant gameplay but give it a chance. It's way more fun with friends (especially if you're not a bully squad and you just meme and dream). \n\nI main Legion so the rework definitely helps this review being positive. It's a refreshing take on Legion despite still being the noticably same character. I also play a lot of BOON GAMEPLAY so you know I'm such a fun survivor lol\n\nBut seriously, give the game a chance.

The devs are continually updating the game with new killers, survivors, maps and perks, as well as significantly improving upon old content.\n\nThe only negative of this game is that a sizable portion of the player base struggles to play the game as intended, with a lot of trolly survivors and killers that either prevent you from playing by excessively camping or don't try to kill you at all.
