Furthermore, for the killer part is more like an instinct behavior of surviving in harsh choices. Players will tend to give emotions towards the game even towards others because of this interactive multiplayer game.\n\nPlayers already seen the behavior of others, well there is skill in this matter. I'm not saying that this will help you from certain chase of a psychopath or a serial killer no. It tests our instinct of choices and adaptivity. \n\nThe game content is well, not to shabby i guess, balancing in this type of gameplay is quite hard but acceptable. Between an unexperienced survivors they sometime tend not know what to do, but the killer only has one purpose just plan course of action, stab the hell out of them, and sacrifice the survivors. If players uses survivor and test it all the time, they get some points to redeem it for talents. Well, this is quite a downer to me. Talents earned are so fast that the graphics on reaching the point where the killer needs to do the hard work from now on\n\nLast, its about the mechanics and system. First of all the mechanics, the mechanics of the game is quite acceptable from TPS view for the survivors and the FPS view for the killer I think its quite fair. Controls are definitely good to me, but for the \"falling down the wooden part to escape\" is lack in responds. For this game system, you guys really need A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION. This is the part what I hate about, at first I don't want to buy this game because of waiting for players part, or disconnecting and so, but the least to prevent that is to having good internet connection. \n\nIn conclusion this game has been adapted quite well, a 8/10 spot for me. \n\nPros:\n-Creative gameplay\n-Acceptable controls\n-Interactive graphics\n-Marvelous sound effects and BGM\n\nCons:\n-Game balancing harsh\n-Unfriendly internet connection properties\n\n[ADVICE] : Try making a server for each region if can, but it really costs a lot.

BALANCE\nClearly, the killers have downhand while playing. Of course, the killers have faster speed and have special abilities that can chase the survivors down. However, survivors have 1 ultimate tool to surpass all of that, which are WINDOWS AND LEDGES. For example, the map where there's more than 2 windows at the same spot (Autohaven Wreckers), the killers (the Wraith, and the Hillbilly) can't  do anything but watch them tease. The trapper might set the trap, but while he's setting it, they run away. I know that the team has patched for the \"Sprint\" perk, which was bloody op, but they should either get rid of the # of windows or make a cooltime/exhaustion system that when they vault more than 3 windows, their next vaults will be slower for few seconds (like the quiet vaults when they walk/vault to make no noise).\n\n2. INTENTIONAL DISCONNECTING\nSome tryhards that plays the game not for fun, but to win ,disconnects everytime when they can't escape. They tease the killer around the game, like vaulting the windows and sitting up and down etc., and when they get caught, they simply disconnect. This is partially because the ranks doesn't get effected whenever they disconnect. I really hope the team to patch the ranking system, that whenever someone disconnects, they get to lose 1 stack in their rank , which is the stack you need to level for next rank (for example, you need 3 to upgrade from 20 to 19) I understand that there are some people that gets disconnected against their will. but the truth is, there are more people that uses this system to gain their personal advantages than the people who gets disconnected against their will. I know that they had patched that the killers gets a reward as a \"sacrifice\" instead of getting none, but  a glitch makes this patch somehow useless. Whenever the killer picks someone up, and the survivor disconnects at that moment, the killer glitches out and stands still for a lo~~~~~~ng time (I waithed minutes until I could move again). Unable to move, and see the survivors escape without any problem. So, I personally hope that the team patch something \"more\".\n\n\n\nDead by Dailght is a great and fun game to play, but I believe that game can get better.","timestamp_created":1467392014,"timestamp_updated":1467392014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23990040","author":{"steamid":"76561198067647954","num_games_owned":558,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":787,"last_played":1657627681},"language":"english","review":"This game would of been a game if there wasn't so many bugs and it definitley needs a lot more balancing, I will list examples below.\n\n1. There needs to be an online party system, when you want to play with a friend or two it gets annoying when you have to jump server to survivor looking for them, but what about cheating? well with the spectating mode there is no real way of cheating seeing how both the player and the spectator have to be looking at the same thing.\n\n2. Jumping from server to server can easily crash your game, I have been at it for an hour trying to find my two friends and out of that hour I have crashed about 7 - 8 times. First it starts off with your character duplicating itself, then bringing you into a screen with the UI and some floating trees, once in this screen you can not access any of the UI elements.\n\n3. Matchmaking is not totally fair, new players are getting matched with rank 1 level 50 characters so the game has basically decided who wins. There should of been quite a bit more thought put into that aspect because some of the perks the higher levels can use are quite over-powered.\n\n4. Like I said some perks really need to be nerfed or atleast evened out a bit.\n\n5. Also half of the time a patch is released it seems to make the game more buggier than it was before. Great job devs!\n\n6.

В течение игры выжившие должны включить несколько генераторов, разбросанных по карте игры, чтобы найти выход и спастись. Игра отлично передает атмосферу всем известных фильмов-слешеров в стиле Пятницы 13. При приближении маньяка начинает громко стучать сердце не только у управляемого несчастного, но и у самого игрока, так что море впечатлений гарантировано. Да и в общем у игры явно большой потенциал дальнейшего развития.

It is obvious that there are glimpses of brilliance in this game, but it is completely overshadowed by the multitudes of problems this game has.\n\nOne is the game balance issues, the devs are notoriously incapable in their attempts to balance the different killers. \nMoreso, any time the killers find any perk combo that is effective in this game it gets nerfed to a point where all the perks are made useless. Survivors, being the majority of players, do not get these problems. Devs listen to them really carefully.\n\nThe largest sin this game makes is that it has no dedicated servers, which is completely unforgivable. There is absolutely no reason why the killer should be the host. None. Example: I feel like i need more exp, so what do i do? Well i change the download region on steam to some faraway place (USA for example) and farm points like a looney because now the players are lagged to hell, they can't do shit.\n\nThere is only one game mode. One year after the release and the devs cannot even arse to do more game modes. Game gets repetitive really fast. The repetition is not helped by the completely irrelevant and badly implemented ranking system that brings into the game whiny userbase, but still does not manage to make the matchmaker to make games with equal LEVEL players, my lvl1 trapper WILL meet lvl25+ characters constantly, good thing i am the server so i can lag them!\n\nI had more fun with the F13 beta (which was obviously not finished and had oodles of problems in it) than i have had fun in this game. This game is just more frustrating than fun, and i do not think it will ever get fixed. Ever.\n\n\nDid i mention there are no dedicated servers?

by Daylight แปลกดี เราซื้อเกมนี้ตั้งแต่ วันแรกที่มันวางขาย Day1 แต่เรากลับเพิ่งจะมาเขียนรีวิวมัน หลังเล่นไปได้ 2พันกว่าชั่วโมง\n.\nเราเป็นคนนึงที่ชอบเกมอินดี้มากๆ เราแทบไม่ตามเกม AAA เลย เวลาว่างเราจะชอบนั่งดู \"เกมใกล้วางจำหน่าย\" นั่งดูแทบทุกสัปดาห์ว่ามีเกมไหนน่าสนใจบ้าง ครั้งแรก เราเห็น Dead by Daylight ในหน้าใกล้วางจำหน่าย ตอนนั้นเกมยังมีแค่วิดีโอสัมภาษณ์ทีมงาน กับ ภาพแมพ แค่นั้นเอง แต่เรามีรางสังหรณ์อย่างบอกไม่ถูกว่าเกมๆนี้จะต้องปังแน่ๆ และมันก็เป็นแบบนั้นจริงๆ เราจัดเกมนี้ตั้งแต่วันแรกที่มันวางขาย แล้วก็ยังเล่นมาจนถึงทุกวันนี้ ตอนนี้ก็ใกล้จะครบรอบ 5ปี เราเล่นเกมนี้มา 5ปีแล้วเหรอเนี่ย ไม่อยากจะเชื่อว่า เรายังสนุกกับมันอยู่ และยังไม่มีความคิดหรือความรู้สึกที่ว่าอยากจะเลิกเล่นเลยแม้แต่น้อย\n.\nส่วนหนึ่งอาจจะเพราะ เราชอบทุกๆอย่างใน Dead by Daylight มากๆ ทั้งเนื้อเรื่องตรงๆ เนื้อเรื่องแอบแฝงต่างๆ คิดดู แม้แต่หน้า Lobby ที่มีกลุ่มคนนั่งอยู่ข้างกองไฟ กับฆาตกรยืนมองอยู่ ยังมีเนื้อเรื่องและ Story คือ Creative มากๆ เรารักเกมนี้แบบสุดใจ แม้มันจะไม่ใช่เกมที่สมบูรณ์แบบ มีบัค มีความไม่สมดุลอะไรบ้าง (ปกติของเกมที่มีการอัพเดตตลอดเวลา สมดุลไม่เท่าเรื่องปกติ ก็ปรับเรื่อยๆสนุกดี) ชอบเนื้อเรื่องเกม ชอบปูมหลังตัวละครเกม แม้แต่แผนที่(Map) ยังมีเนื้อเรื่อง / และสิ่งที่น่าสนใจมากๆคือ การเอาตัวละครจากลิขสิทธ์หนังหรือเกมอื่นมาใส่ใน Story ของตัวเองได้อย่างแนบเนียนและลงตัว\n.\nเกมนี้ผ่านมา 5ปี ยังมีโหมดการเล่นแค่โหมดเดียว คือ 4 VS 1 แต่เรากลับไม่เบื่อเลย เพราะ เกมนี้คาดเดาอะไรไม่ได้ เป็นความตื่นเต้นที่เล่นมาแล้ว 2พันกว่าชั่วโมง ประสบการณ์แต่ละเกมแทบไม่ซ้ำกันเลย ทั้งฆาตกร รูปแบบการเล่น Perk และ Ad-on ที่หลากหลาย ให้เผชิญหน้า / เพื่อนร่วมทีมทั้งดีและไม่ดี โง่และเก่ง ฆาตกรที่โหดและไม่โหด ผสมๆปนๆกันไป เป็นประสบการณ์ที่ไม่เคยซ้ำไม่เคยจำเจ ขนาดคุณที่เล่นเกมนี้จนเก่งแล้วก็ยังสามารถรู้สึกตื่นเต้นกับมันได้\n.\nในมุมมองของผม Dead by Daylight ยังอยู่ได้อีกยาวๆครับ อาจจะสัก 10ปี หรือมากกว่านั้น ตราปใดที่ผู้พัฒนาและทีมงานไม่ทิ้ง คอยเพิ่ม Story เพิ่ม Killer หรือเอาตัวลิขสิทธ์เข้ามา เซอไพร้เรื่อยๆ คนก็กลับมาเล่นอยู่แล้ว / เกมนี้ผ่านมา 5ปี มีทั้งผู้เล่นหน้าใหม่ และเก่าทยอยกลับมาเล่นกันเป็นช่วงๆ เอาง่ายๆคือ เซิฟไม่เคยล้างงงงง (ทุกวันนี้หาห้องเร็วแล้วครับ เร็วมากด้วย)\n.\nมีหลากหลายเกมที่พยายามตามรอย Dead by Daylight มีทั้งเกมที่ประสบความสำเร็จ และไม่ประสบความสำเร็จ ไม่ว่าเกมไหนจะดีหรือจะสนุกกว่าเกมไหน มันอยู่ที่รสนิยมคนครับ เรื่องนี้เราไม่ว่ากัน แต่สิ่งหนึ่งที่การันตีความสนุก ความสำเร็จ และความยอดเยี่ยมของ Dead

I played Evolve and immediately did not like the game and I have played my fair share of Left 4 Dead, but neither have captured my interest quite like Dead By Daylight has.\n\nThe gameplay of the game focuses around 4 survivors and 1 killer, with randomly generated 'trails' or maps which have randomly spawned 'generators' and 'hooks' The aim of the survivors is to repairs 5 generators for  for the escape gates of the 'trial' to open so you can escape. The survivors are only equipped with items like a torch, first aid kit, map or a toolbox.  However, while doing this the killer will be hot on your heels. The aim of the killer is to try and stop you from doing this by using their trusty weapon to try and slice you to injure you. Two hits and the survivors are down and the other teammates will need to interviene and help you get back up on your feet.  If you are unfortunate enough to be caught by the killer they are able to carry you and take you took a hook, these hooks are spread out across the trial randomly and you will be stuck on a hook until either you get help from a teammate, or ultimately die. \n\nThe game has up to 4 survivor characters currently at time of patch 1.0.2. \n\n[list]\n[*] Dwight Fairfield - Skilled at working as a team and has perks which enables the team to stick together and stay alive\n[*] Meg Thomas - Skilled at being agile and fast, and moving around quietly\n[*] Claudette Morel - Skilled at healing and uses plants to help enhance her healing perks\n[*] Jake Park - Skilled at being calm while under pressure\n[/list]\n\nThese 4 survivors have unique perks which are specific to each character, the way you unlock these items and perks is a system called the 'Bloodweb' which is essentially a tree of items, addons, offerings and perks which can be unlocked with bloodweb points that you get from playing trials. Each of these items can be taken with you on the trials but if you die, you will lose the item and addons. The offerings are one time use items which can help you, for example. A certain offering help choose the type of map you will join next game, another offering helps increase the amount of mist on trails etc. The perks are permenant and you start off with being able to use 1 perk. As you gradually level up to 15,20,25 you can get 2,3,4 perks relating to your level. Each character levels up seperately so it may take a while to get each person up to have 4 perks.\n\nThe killers within the game currently at the time of the 1.0.2 patch are:\n\n[list]\n[*] The Trapper AKA \"Chuckles\" - Skilled at physical attacks and can use his bear traps to trap survivors\n[*] The Wraith - Skilled at tracking and hunting down survivors, is capable of going invisible but unable to attack while in this state\n[*] The Hillbilly - Skilled at chasing survivors, is equipped with a chainsaw which is his secondary weapon, can be charged up and used to charge at suvivors within a clear line of sight.\n[/list]\n\nRegarding the killers however, They do not have items which can be used, they do however have the same type of addons as the survivors which can help with the certain killers primary weapons along with their secondary skills. The killers also have perks which can help them detect and hunt the survivors. \n\nIn regards to the balancing, there does need to be some fixes and work done so that the survivors and killers don't feel too overpowered with certain perks. \n\nOverall, I've been enjoying the game and at it's current state I would recommend it. It does need some work still to help balance out all the perks and there are a few graphical bugs. However, it does not impede the enjoyment of the game and it still makes the adrenaline rush when you are being chased by the killer or chasing survivors as the killers.","timestamp_created":1467380296,"timestamp_updated":1467380515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562822580337524414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23984880","author":{"steamid":"76561198255027663","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1615619277},"language":"schinese","review":"比较有创意的猫鼠游戏。虽然场景不大但挺上瘾。找回点当年坦克大战  炸弹人    合金装备一代的感觉","timestamp_created":1467380220,"timestamp_updated":1467380220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23984850","author":{"steamid":"76561198124220324","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1622672479},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая,если добавят нормальные лобби,уберут вылеты и баги,то однозначно 10/10.","timestamp_created":1467380138,"timestamp_updated":1467380138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23984799","author":{"steamid":"76561198130962883","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":1282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1147,"last_played":1653778241},"language":"english","review":"It is definitely more fun than I remembered...","timestamp_created":1467380031,"timestamp_updated":1647802363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23984773","author":{"steamid":"76561198174246317","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":19516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1554655297},"language":"german","review":"Dead by Daylight ist ein Spiel mit viel spaß und einer mänge aufregung","timestamp_created":1467379962,"timestamp_updated":1467379962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23984651","author":{"steamid":"76561198053691289","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9571,"last_played":1527189598},"language":"english","review":"I find the game to be very fun, though there are some balance issues and bugs here and there.
