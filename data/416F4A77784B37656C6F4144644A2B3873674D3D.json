I used to love this game. It was my go to game every weekend for my friends and I. Then they added MMR. You want to ruin a game. Just add skill based match making. I'm not a streamer. I don't play consistently 40 hours a week. I have a life. I have a job. I do things other than play dbd. I come back and am matched with the most sweaty killers in the world. They camp. Tunnel. Secure kills. Everyone, killers and survivors care more about rank and bullying than just having fun. They run meta perks because both sides have to. Its not fun. Sweating for the win and playing like a dick isn't how this game used to be. Sometimes you win sometimes you lose. I get that. But having the idea of every time you win you have to play against someone who is even better is absolutely ridiculous. I don't want to run meta builds made by youtubers just to stand a chance. This game should be a chill game to play with friends. You shouldn't get camped to death just for dropping a pallet on the killer. Just make a ranked and unranked mode. If your worried about bullies playing unranked give both sides the option to ban certain perks deemed \"meta\". Let us have fun. Let us play with friends and try unique perks instead of the same four perks every single game so we might have a small chance in winning. I'm not the best player in the world. I lose a lot. I try to have fun with friends on the weekend. Give me the chance to have fun.

Survivors have to reactivate power generators turned off by the scenario, which makes it possible for the realm's exit gate to be opened, so the survivors can achieve the long-desired freedom, but it's never as easy as it seems. If the killer catches them, he carries them to a macabre grappling hook that, if the surviving player isn't rescued in time, will turn into a diabolical hand, and game over for that player. If the killer \"hooks\" all the survivors, they win. [/th] [/tr] \t[/table]\n\n[b]When Dead by Daylight first launched in 2016, the one-on-four multiplayer game was failing in many ways, but it has progressed unbelievably well since then. Behavior Interactive took their game, took the criticism (mostly stability related), and worked hard to turn it into something that is now played and enjoyed by millions. Games that were hosted by players (peer-to-peer) are often messy. The company wants to save money (or doesn't have the resources) to make a server available and this caused several problems – especially when you faced killers on the other side of the world, with internet speeds much higher than those offered in my country – and now they work perfectly well thanks to the dedicated servers.[/b]\n\n[quote=💟 Mathieu Côté 💗] I think we did a pretty good job so far. [/quote]\n\nThat doesn't mean the game isn't constantly improving. Even beyond the quality of life improvements, Dead by Daylight introduced a wide range of fixes and gameplay tweaks to make things more fun for both sides. One of the most common problems that arose was “infinite loops”. Killers move about 15% faster than Survivors (not taking into account the advantages of some killers who can teleport or suddenly speed up and the like), which means that over a long enough distance, they will always get a survivor. Behavior did a good job of removing them as best they could - changing the map layout logic when necessary and implementing Killer Perks to readjust the odds in other areas. And when those solutions don't work, another one is at play. The killer simply blocks the window in question to force the survivor elsewhere. Problems still sometimes arise, but when they do, they are best resolved by a community of players who understand a key element of what makes Dead by Daylight fun – the game is best when both sides are having fun.\n\nThe player population has also increased thanks to cross-play. Where before you had to randomly queue up to try and join a game with your friends, Dead by Daylight now allows group matchmaking by default. However, Dead by Daylight has managed to survive for so long over the years because it cleverly tends to be asymmetrical. The more time you spend with dozens of different killers, survivors, and maps, the more you get the feeling that it's not meant to be balanced. Instead, by featuring multiple types of killers, all with a wide variety of play styles and management techniques, the feel of the game in 2022 is just to have fun with it. Pleasure is more important than victory.\n\n[quote=💗 McLean 💟] Nobody said that it was balanced. [/quote]\n\n[b]As the matches go by, and you become aware of your favorite character's abilities, the game takes on a new form. Where you are faced with your nightmare and have to fight to survive or where you are the reaper of lives who must create chaos. However, in both cases, when playing with friends, the horror experience provided by Dead by Daylight is transformed into a bittersweet feeling of fear and fun. Both for those who are going to play alone and for those who are going to play with friends, the game is incredibly enjoyable, and I recommend it. There aren't many titles that catch my attention when it comes to online multiplayer games, because I'm more fond of a good story in a single player to be able to enjoy the experience based on my own tastes, but the title has the ability to leave me playing for hours on end just laughing with friends, not even seeing and noticing the time pass.[/b][/i]\n\n[i] [table] [tr] \t[th] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy4E_J41fa8&ab_channel=Omega [/th] [/tr] \t[/table]","timestamp_created":1650075459,"timestamp_updated":1650078923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638440132141113281","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113924375","author":{"steamid":"76561199039751954","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":87593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":70,"playtime_at_review":87065,"last_played":1659833955},"language":"english","review":"I have a love/hate relationship with this game.

The same dev team then takes FOREVER to make the simplest change, when a smaller dev team from another game can do tons more if they had the same amount of time that this trash dev team does each patch; not to mention the BRILLIANT idea to make the game have a free weekend on Epic Games Store when there was a known cheating problem, now they just made that problem 100x worse. Then the horrible community that is BY FAR the most entitled on steam and commonly shit talks and sends death threats to people, followed by the absolutely pointlessly long grind that this game has which forces you to pick your perks from an RNG based system when theres more than a hundred perks overall.\n\nIf you've never played this game before and are thinking about buying it, don't. I played this back on my console when it was first releasing on consoles before I finally got a PC and was stupid enough to get the game and the DLCs on PC too, do not buy this game at all if you want to actually ENJOY the games that you purchase and play.\n\nThis trash is finally uninstalled from my computer and I'm glad it is, never touching this shit for the rest of my life\nMAY 17-\nlaunched it after watching the 6 year anniversary to try the game out a month later due to seeing what they would do for the grind in terms of perks for prestiging, games back were just as boring.
