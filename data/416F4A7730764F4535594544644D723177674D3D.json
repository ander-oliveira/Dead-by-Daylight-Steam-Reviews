Some of the community can be pretty toxic but thats with any game. Most of the time when I asked other for help when I was starting most of the community is pretty friendly at explaining how things work for ex: The perks and the tools you can use as survivor. Killer on the other hand, you'll have just have to find the right person im not too familiar on that one, there are plenty of YouTube videos to seek out for specific killers and their abilities. With that, I think the killers that are unique & Original in this game really hit while the licensed ones are almost lack luster because of the lack of cosmetics and some balancing issues. I would love to see a ton more done with them as well.\n\nWith all of this said Id say give it a try, you could play for just a few hours or spend hundreds like myself and others getting lost in this game.

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.","timestamp_created":1656978486,"timestamp_updated":1656978486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":390,"votes_funny":39,"weighted_vote_score":"0.747414112091064453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118227155","author":{"steamid":"76561199148792709","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":32620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":674,"playtime_at_review":30402,"last_played":1660590467},"language":"brazilian","review":"A princípio o jogo parece simples, mas conforme você joga, descobre a experiência de combinar perks, personagens, amigos, etc. Jogo incrível, tanto para jogar solo quanto com amigos.

I want to start by saying that I have every achievement and tome completed. This game has been a love/hate roller coaster throughout the time I have been apart of it. I would add that it looks like the developers are listening to the community when they make many of their large decisions. I hope that continues.\n\nThe premise is simple enough: It's tag with killers and survivors. There is far more nuance to it than that, but if you really want to invest time into the game I would suggest you look at a guide and some youtube videos. I don't normally recommend solo queues as a survivor for anyone with any significant amount of time greater than 10 hours, but playing survivor solo queues is fine if you're just starting out. The experience of doing so will begin to enrage you when you see your team-mates make stupid mistakes, help the killer, or sit in a corner with various perks that don't help you complete objectives. Yes, this game is very objective based. Repair 5 generators and leave out of the gate without being hooked by a killer. The survivors aren't as active in this game as they are in other games of the same genre, but as things develop you'll probably see new mechanics and various things come in by way of the development team. \n\nLooking Forward the game still has life in it. The game has dipped from 100,000 regular users to 40,000 and then back to 100,000 during the event, so it's far from being a dead game. One of the things that I most appreciate about this game is that I never felt like losses come down to who can twitch their controller the fastest, and there is always a fair amount of strategic depth to each match. There are enough maps and players that the game, despite the simple premise, never really feels stale; in fact, it's quite the opposite! It borders on a horrible addiction at times, and as I write this I have come to the conclusion that I myself need a break from this game.","timestamp_created":1656975338,"timestamp_updated":1656975338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562057018280029297","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118225091","author":{"steamid":"76561198151099217","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":222,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1657057460},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight","timestamp_created":1656975322,"timestamp_updated":1656975322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542664289474487305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118224531","author":{"steamid":"76561198844780033","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":771,"last_played":1657660316},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok keyifli bir oyun.

Try to main a killer and you will enjoy your improvement. The the rank system can tell you how you are progressing. Also you can prestige and get some cool cosmetics with selected killer. Same goes for your favorite survivors and so on. Of course with all the different and unique killers some will be better than others. If you do enjoy a certain killer you will get better. I play as Pyramid Head and getting better with his lack of pace with perks and precision judgement placements. I saw this on sale for like 6$ which is a steal. I'm not the guy to ask about the  ranking and most competitive tiers. I play this game casual and I have fun.
