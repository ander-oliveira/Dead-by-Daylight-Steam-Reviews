The killers are kinda OP. I'm not saying that because WAH WAH WAH /insert tantrum I get killed. I'll accept my death like I should but there are times where it just seems impossible to even get away from the killer. The whole party system needs some help too. I shouldn't have to click ready constantly while trying to get into a lobby with a friend. The killers shouldn't be allowed to see the victims ranks. It gives them the chance to back out and then we are back to playing the ready simulator all over again. If we can't see the killers rank, they shouldn't get to see ours. Why should they have a hand up on deciding if they want to play with us or not when we can't make the same judgment based off the killers rank/level?","timestamp_created":1469296695,"timestamp_updated":1469296695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24483434","author":{"steamid":"76561198166332013","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":13516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3773,"last_played":1654336237},"language":"russian","review":"ручка это (in english)","timestamp_created":1469295581,"timestamp_updated":1605868123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24483292","author":{"steamid":"76561198273378513","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1591787370},"language":"russian","review":"govno\n","timestamp_created":1469295003,"timestamp_updated":1469295003,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.418452799320220947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24483104","author":{"steamid":"76561198279437403","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":133506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":978,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1660439010},"language":"spanish","review":"Me encanta el juego.

The gameplay at its core should be, and even sometimes actually is quite intense and thrilling. However, there are a ton of issues that make it difficult just to get into a game, much less actually enjoy it.\n\nFirst of all, the matchmaking is absolute garbage. It flat-out doesn't work more often than not, either putting you through a lengthy loading screen only to return you back to your loadout/lobby joining screen, or just giving you a \"failed to join game\" message outright. I get it, sometimes there are issues, sometimes someone else takes up the last spot in the lobby you're trying to join first, anything can happen, but for a finished product on Steam, this happens WAY too often. On the off-chance that it finally DOES put you into a game, there doesn't seem to be any actual effort to balance out the levels of survivors and the killer. Levels can make a big difference, both giving the killer a large advantage of perks obtained through leveling up over new survivors with absolutely nothing to start off, and giving more experienced survivors \"useless\" teammates against what could be an otherwise impossible survival mission.\n\nSecond of all, to elaborate on the player level side of the game, there's absolutely no effort to balance things. The wraith is completely OP, having the ability to become almost completely invisible while running at supersonic speed and removing the survivors' ability to tell how far away the killer is by measuring how rapidly the heartbeat effect occurs, since it doesn't seem to occur whenever the killer is invisible. There are also 4 different survivors which are not mutually exclusive in games, and they all have different upgrade trees and unique perks and unlockables, all upgrades and unlocks are random and procedurally generated. Of course, some trees are more viable than others, and some perks and the trees they belong to altogether just seem completely useless. Why? Well...\n\nEverything is weighed heavily in favor of the killer, and this is mostly done by allowing one thing. Camping. Absolutely every killer does it, and there's no reason for them not to. Once they hit you twice to slow you down to a crawl, it's basically game over. There's an option to try and \"wiggle free\" before and after the killer sets you on a hook, but it takes way too long to actually do it successfully. There are so many hooks all around the map that it's virtually impossible to wiggle free from the killer before he finds one. And what happens when he sets you on it? He stares at you. He refuses to move his ugly mug more than 2 feet away from you. [b]Every single time.[/b]\n\nNevermind the fact that it's just plain creepy even in a video game, it cheapens the experience for everyone. There are skill trees specifically designed to help your teammates recover and escape, but it's completely nullified by a killer just camping a hook occupied with his newest captured survivor. Not only does it make this survivor completely useless for anyone playing it, and make other survivors trying to play as a team all-around useless (there goes that \"play as a team OR play selfishly premise!\"), but the killer is practically forced to just stare boredly at his newest victim, because, again, there's no reason for him not to, and it ensures that they don't get rescued by another survivor. Maybe this is the way things are intended, but I find that hard to believe since there are so many opportunities where you can try to struggle/recover on your own, albiet uselessly since they have no actual effect, from the very moment after the killer gets a second hit on you. The game is hopelessly hard for the survivors when the killer does camp, and very easy for them when he doesn't camp. There's no sense of balance, no thrill, no excitement, no sense of danger or tense feelings. It's just run forever or be camped forever once you're caught. There's no dynamic gameplay whatsoever, everything just feels tedious.\n\nAfter a few games, it's easy to figure out that, despite the claim for a unique and procedurally generated experience every time, every game goes the same way. Hide and try to look for generators, and if you get found out, try and run to escape (even though you likely won't since the built-in killer tracking is unreal and absurd), and once you get hit twice, you're dead, but still forced to go through the same wiggle-waggle pattern of uselessness every time. It's tedious, frustrating, and just completely stupid all at the same time.\n\nOh, and you're guaranteed to lose equipped items that were obtained through leveling up whenever you get sacrificed, and you'll more often than not end up sacrificed because of the reasons mentioned above. The fuck???\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards a refund since I already feel like I've seen all that I'm ever going to see in every game, especially since, according to the vast majority of this game's playerbase, the devs are allegedly reluctant to fix any bugs or balancing issues which are both plentiful in the game.\n\nP.S. The tutorial very specifically says that you can \"hide in closets, and the killer will NEVER find you.\" But he's able to open closets, find you inside, and take you with him as if he hit you three times already and picked you up, even if he never actually saw you enter the closet in the first place. lol?","timestamp_created":1469289270,"timestamp_updated":1469771006,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468438953161239624","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24481461","author":{"steamid":"76561198264541262","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3427,"last_played":1657321006},"language":"thai","review":"เกมเหี้ยไรเข้ายากฉิบหาย","timestamp_created":1469288289,"timestamp_updated":1469288289,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24481223","author":{"steamid":"76561198128950871","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":227920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76470,"last_played":1654878765},"language":"koreana","review":"고였다 고였다 하는데 \n전혀그렇지않습니다\n여전히 청정수같은기분이에요 \n데바데넘나어려운것","timestamp_created":1469287356,"timestamp_updated":1522907359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622071206569671631","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24480770","author":{"steamid":"76561198035052161","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":9806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3463,"last_played":1655478350},"language":"english","review":"No matches found 10x \nFinds a lobby.

Many things are to be loved about this game, but sadly I can't recommend it even though i got it for a pretty good price. Here's why:\n  \n [*] The biggest and most noticeable problem is the pallet looping and how the maps are setup so that the survivors have a way of playing ring around the rosey with the killer for the entire match without getting hit or downed once in that time. Though windows (if jumped through enough) can be blocked, the survivors can time out a perfect loop where that doesn't happen.\n [*] The community is pretty toxic with the combination of pallet looping. You have to resort to cheap methods of getting any kind of points if you want to advance as a killer in this game. Not only is this almost necessary for there to be any kind of point reward at the end of a match, the 4 players will talk down on your \"cheesy\" or \"noobish\" style of play when it's hard enough to get the points already.\n[*] Finally, The perks in this game obviously favor the survivors, with the recent patches (this review being right after 1.9.2) not fixing the obvious balance issues with the game making the player basse leave and only have the toxic players stay and abuse the system in their favor.\n\nOverall, I really wish I could enjoy this game with how great the system on paper sounds, but sadly it can not be balanced properly and the devs as far as patch 1.9.2, are not making much effort in making sure the killers have their rightful spot in the entire game, to kill and not let the survivors escape. Like i said earlier in the review, all of this is making the current player base leave and not promoting this game to be a good pickup for new players that don't know what is currently going on at the moment. I would love for the devs to come back and make this game right where it needs to be between the killers and the survivors so that way I, and many other players could continue wanting to play this game.","timestamp_created":1469259640,"timestamp_updated":1520747029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24474559","author":{"steamid":"76561198072589239","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":675,"last_played":1470283640},"language":"english","review":"This is the only horror game I've ever played besides F.E.A.R.

The rush and panic of escaping the Killer into silence and sense whilst operating a generator gives this game the horror and excitement. The idea behind the game is very appealing for people who enjoy the intensity, quick-decision making and awareness level this game provides. The game also provides teamwork for people who play with friends, saving team mates allow you to gain more points in order to progress so the risk is generally worth it. There is also the Killers point of view, where hunting the survivors down and using your awareness and abilities to track down the survivors and play tactically to catch and sacrifice them. The more you kill, the more points obtained.\n\n\nHowever, as of this review there are several problems which need to be addressed:\n\n- The queueing system is very buggy and requires several clicks of ready/unready to trigger a search.\n- The Killer is the host, so bad connections lead to terrible game experiences.\n- It's a competitive game which doesn't have communication for survivors, even if they're nearby in the game. But playing with friends allows that communication so that should be considered.\n- IT TAKES AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME TO JOIN GAMES AS A SURVIVOR AS OF NOW\n\nOverall i gave this positive, as more often than not people have decent connections and i am able to play the game after overcoming the long buggy queues. Also playing with friends has been extremely enjoyable, working together to overcome the killer.\nIt should also be noted that the developers listen to the playerbase, as many features requested have arrived, so it's good to know the money is deserved.","timestamp_created":1469230471,"timestamp_updated":1469995866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24468961","author":{"steamid":"76561198046068126","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":79355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":684,"playtime_at_review":68823,"last_played":1660607522},"language":"english","review":"Kill People, try not to get killed, good game.","timestamp_created":1469229310,"timestamp_updated":1572738563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24468653","author":{"steamid":"76561198002817549","num_games_owned":2884,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":15329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1660602659},"language":"english","review":"I will start by saying this game is not for everybody.  It is a very team dependant game if you are a survivor, or nerves of steel as the killer.  You will run into many players who care nothing about teamwork, who would rather leave you hanging on a hook while they escape.  While playing as the killer you will run into survivors who abuse \"infinite juke\" spots (based on which killer, some areas it is impossible to catch a survivor unless they mess up) and those who disconnect right before they are sacrificed on the hook, which nets you less points and/or makes it harder to complete daily rituals... even with all of those possible problems the game itself is a blast.\n\nAs a survivor you will be randomly placed in each map you play and must help to repair 5 generators.  Once the generators are repaired it will power the gates which can be opened to escape the killer.  All the while tempted to go for the chests scattered about with items, trying to rescue your fellow survivors, and even sabotage the hooks around the map - provided you have the skill for it.  Nearly every action will earn you bloodpoints which can be spent in a bloodweb to buy perks, items, add-ons for items, etc.  Each survivor has a unique set of perks that can be learned, and as you level you can find teachable versions that will appear in other survivors trees.\n\nAs the killer you will have to hunt the survivors down.  The maps are huge, but if you pay attention to the audio and visual ques, you will find your prey.  Each killer has a different choice of evilness, and each will hunt differently than the other.  I mean what could be more fun than chasing down a survivor and carrying their bloody body to a hook and watch them squirm and die.","timestamp_created":1469227878,"timestamp_updated":1469227878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24468626","author":{"steamid":"76561198022074670","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":95099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3547,"last_played":1640425714},"language":"russian","review":"Игра затягивает!\nСуть: 4 игрока скрываются и чинят моторы пока пятый игрок ищет их чтобы убить.
