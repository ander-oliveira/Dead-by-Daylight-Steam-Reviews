For the next 3 months we are going to cease all sales, and stop buying everything BHVR releases. This includes cosmetics, rifts, and the next Chapter. BHVR has treated the health of the game poorly and ignored the community for the past 2 years, with it only getting worse and worse. If you are reading this and want DBD, wait for the next 3 months before you get it, and check in to see if anything has changed. \nI do not recommend the game. Disgusting matchmaking, broken hitboxes and a ton of bugs are waiting for new players. Balance can be described by the following expression: soloQ < killer < team. Solo surv role is pure pain. I don't think devs bother testing. Every chapter brings new bugs, but the RE chapter is a real symbol of not giving a F.  Issue with the memory usage on the killer Nemesis, expected bunch of bugs and the new map disabled an hour after the DLC was released. The Grind of BP and the f---ed up events are the cherry on the cake.

The learning curve on survivor is better than killer. You'll get to know the terms ''tunneling'' and ''camping'' very fast, but don't let this discourage you as you can get perks which can help prevent some of those tactics. \n\nKiller is a 1st person game-play where you need to hunt the 4 survivors and use your unique killer abilities to your advantage. The learning curve on killer is very harsh (toxic survivors). You'll more than likely get called a tunneler or camper when you start playing, and it'll feel like every survivor is able to escape from you. Each killer has a lunge attack which takes practice to get used to, but if you can master a lung attack, hitting survivors should feel easier. \n\nAll in all, DbD can feel hard to get into at first, and maybe not even your cup of tea. If you play more than 5 rounds in the shoes of killer and survivor, you should already get a sense of the game. I still learn things as I am playing, so don't give up the game definitely gets easier the more you play ! \n\nCheers!","timestamp_created":1624826344,"timestamp_updated":1624826344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94532866","author":{"steamid":"76561198098128915","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":435,"playtime_at_review":40379,"last_played":1660582863},"language":"english","review":"nice game, dont buy it","timestamp_created":1624826233,"timestamp_updated":1624826233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94532687","author":{"steamid":"76561199091543533","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1646321123},"language":"english","review":"iits og","timestamp_created":1624826065,"timestamp_updated":1624826065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94532647","author":{"steamid":"76561198164640221","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":12825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10248,"last_played":1658415743},"language":"italian","review":"Xiao xiao piao piao","timestamp_created":1624826032,"timestamp_updated":1624826032,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481249988079071045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94532414","author":{"steamid":"76561198086247020","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":7235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7235,"last_played":1543525518},"language":"brazilian","review":"120 horas correndo GG jogão!","timestamp_created":1624825820,"timestamp_updated":1624825820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94531967","author":{"steamid":"76561199125876047","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":43648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":453,"playtime_at_review":1111,"last_played":1660511650},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра\n","timestamp_created":1624825336,"timestamp_updated":1624825336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94531885","author":{"steamid":"76561198146426406","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1637,"playtime_at_review":5815,"last_played":1660566273},"language":"turkish","review":"Gelmiş geçmiş neredeyse tüm korku oyunu ve filmlerinden karakterler, hem kötü tarafta hem de iyi tarafta olanlar olmak üzere, çok iyi bir şekilde modellenip oyuna entegre edilmiş; haricinde karakterlerimizin özellikle kötü olanlarında herhangi bir diyalog görülmemesi biraz eksik bir psikopatlık veya saldırganlık hissettirse de bazı oyuncular için sesler kendi sesleri olmamasından dolayı oluşabilecek karakter ile bütünleşmeyi bozan bir girişimden kaçınılmış olabilir. mekanikler anlamında bazı minik çaplı bug lar olabiliyor ve bu bug lar oyunun ilerleme kat etme olanağını düşürebiliyor ancak nadiren gerçekleştiği için bu sorun da yok sayılmasa da göz ardı edilebilir. grafik anlamında türüne göre son derece iyi işler başarmış olan bu oyunun online tabanlı olması da cabası.

Things that have been discussed over and over in foruns but never have been addressed correctly. These 3 topics will explain where the game fails greatly:\n\n1. Edit (Jul/21th): I decided to change this 1st topic entirely since I thought after a while that some of my perspectives was wrong. My first review focused mostly on how the game unbalanced towards survivors, and killers having so much struggle in trials, which isn't entirely true after you learning things about the game. It takes time? Yes, a lot. You gotta read, watch and learn a bunch of things to actually understand how things work, which is downside in my opinion, but at least, it's a start towards the balancing issues.\n\n2. Matchmaking: The ranking system is always there, no matter if you play casually or not. On each trial, everything you did will be analised and gives 1 to 2 progression, or take 1 to 2 points towards your rank, and if you rach an certain ammount of points in a rank, you go higher, and that's about it. No matter if you playing against with an rank 16 (lower ranks) or rank 2 (higher rank), that will not change how your progression score is analised. That wouldn't be much of an issue if the ranks between the players in a trial wasn't that high, but it is; very often, rank 10 players are put with rank 4, 3 or even 1. That causes several frustrations in a trial for the level and skill diference between players.\n\n3. Repetitive Gameplay: I know that Behaviour had difficult times to insert this game in the market and make it playable overall, but it's impossible to avoid the fact that the game is always the same and it never changes a bit. Playing as survivor is the only casual part of this game, which will very quickly feel boring after fixing generators, running from the killer and looping walls and pallets, and that's it.\n\n4. Horrible Grinding: Each trial gives you around 20k bloodpoints (the game currency). They are used to buy perks, addons, items, and level up your characters in the called \"Bloodweb\". The bloodweb gives you random things to buy before you being able to buy the perks, causing you to lose more than half of your bloodpoints on something that you'll probably never use.\nI have 450h in the moment of this edit, and only now I finished [b]UNLOCKING[/b] all perks with [b]all killers (only)[/b]. Now I still have to spend a bunch more to buy them for each killer. I barely unlocked anything with survivors. Ah, I got to thank this 5th anniversary event, that makes each match worth as 5 matches.\nSo, summary, with all that said, I only unlocked 50% of the game with 450h played, roughly.\n\nIf you often have friends to play with, survivors in DBD have at most 100 hours before you tire the hell of it.\nAs a killer, you will often feel frustrated by the game matchmaking or just so tired from thinking or \"try-harding\" after 2 or 3 trials. All that and you will never feel rewarded for anything, both in rank and bloodpoints.","timestamp_created":1624822341,"timestamp_updated":1626838883,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510257840156555176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94528565","author":{"steamid":"76561199100116835","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2048,"last_played":1653500461},"language":"english","review":"fuck noed lol","timestamp_created":1624822029,"timestamp_updated":1624822029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94528523","author":{"steamid":"76561198215203213","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13807,"last_played":1630714908},"language":"brazilian","review":"é legal, as pessoas são chatas, é de longe a pior comunidade dos jogos mas é legal","timestamp_created":1624821990,"timestamp_updated":1624821990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94528297","author":{"steamid":"76561198142203848","num_games_owned":489,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":31009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27936,"last_played":1655404012},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game!

Also a some of the original still holds true so no reason to remove it.\n\nAs of this edit the past several updates have been mostly positive, with the Devs listening to players and making actual asked for changes. They've made some missteps, but forgivable ones and have even rolled back some things they've done that didn't work. There are still a lot of problems with both the game and the Dev's stance on some matters but as of right now it is looking like things are moving in a good direction. I still don't agree with some of it, not enough to recommend buying the game, but I'm moving more towards a neutral stance than a negative one.\n\nOriginal review:\nI love this game so much, but the people behind it don't really care about the players or the community, all they care about is money and that has been made really clear to me since I've started playing.\n\nThere are so many bugs in the game, some of them around from the very start and they release more bugs with every update than they do fixes. The most recent, as of this posting, update had a new map in it, but the map is broken and unplayable so they disabled it. And the map was a key selling point of the DLC.\nBeyond the bugs there are some major balance issues that go unresolved because they favor the Survivor side who spend the most money on cosmetics.\n\nRight now I am strongly encouraging no one to give them money. Don't buy the base game if you don't already have it, don't buy any DLC. Don't give them any more money until they listen and start fixing things. We don't want new content that breaks the game, we want the current content fixed. I'm not buying any more DLC until things change and if more people do the same the game will be much better for it in the end.","timestamp_created":1624818935,"timestamp_updated":1632481030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597529828548431396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zaywp/oCf/DK6AI="}
