It was really fun at first and we got to bond during the pandemic because of it. We all loved it...Until the new update. It became a consensus that the game somehow got harder (especially because we are survivor mains) due to the change in movements (ie. somehow you do everything slower but the killer movements didn't change so that kinda puts us in a bit of a disadvantage). No one really asked for these changes but the devs just went ahead despite the huge backlash even from the test servers. I do not recommend this game as of right now which is a huge contrast from a few months ago where I basically advertised the game for all of my friends to play. I loved this game and I am genuinely sad that the change was very drastic and negative right as my friends and I were getting the hang of it. I will truly miss the old DBD (RIP). Here's to hoping they do something about it (but then again I keep hearing from the DBD community that they never listen to the players so...They even said that we better get used to it 'cause they \"can't\" (more like won't) change anything in one of their streams :((( (Thinking of abandoning the game tbh.)\n\nNegative changes to the game from the most recent update:\n- Wacky hitboxes (At first I thought I was playing sht but turns out hitboxes were messy)\n- Movements\n- For some reason, I always get stuck in some parts of the map that I never encountered in my 200 hours of gameplay before the update\n- The new UI SUCKS, it looks like a bootleg version of DBD turned mobile\n- Not as fun anymore tbh","timestamp_created":1613456395,"timestamp_updated":1613456628,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86773583","author":{"steamid":"76561198868237241","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6487,"last_played":1633427311},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏的服务器真的非常的烂，动不动就得退出游戏重开甚至重启电脑，更新之后明明网没有问题还是会频繁掉线，不仅如此还要受惩罚时间，纯属恶心人","timestamp_created":1613455770,"timestamp_updated":1613455770,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537790119647979736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86773460","author":{"steamid":"76561199004217574","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":24498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2913,"last_played":1659030115},"language":"russian","review":"Страшна","timestamp_created":1613455629,"timestamp_updated":1657108426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86772896","author":{"steamid":"76561199078881374","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3957,"last_played":1646471634},"language":"english","review":"New update is dogshit the killers don't even have to be facing you to hit you.","timestamp_created":1613454928,"timestamp_updated":1613454928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86772811","author":{"steamid":"76561198115375805","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":40054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1351,"playtime_at_review":37550,"last_played":1660536034},"language":"english","review":"Don't buy this game until the Devs fixes everything they broke.

The game feels intentionally stacked against survivors, perhaps rightly so, since you're putting 4 meatbags with no means of defense up against a serial killer with all sorts of supernatural powers.

Why did I ever stop playing?\". Then, within 30 minutes i was reminded - Because of the people playing it and the way it is encouraged to play by the devs. \n\nPlayers constantly try to out-shit one another by being as toxic as possible , the ways to win are amazingly unfit for a scary, exciting game, with killers just camping and slugging and survivors running around boxes and spinning around like dumbasses. Above all, devs are famous for disregarding anything the community has to say. \n\nWhen playing you will be frustrated and disappointed, even despite evident merit present here. There really is an amazing game somewhere inside this mess, but as is, i can't really recommend it to anyone.","timestamp_created":1613440227,"timestamp_updated":1613440227,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86759983","author":{"steamid":"76561198055701852","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":52393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2108,"last_played":1654680088},"language":"english","review":"Sure there are bugs, but this is a sandbox game anyways and it's always changing with the updates so you can't expect perfection every update. It's a good game hands down for any horror game genre fans. It has killers and survivors from major motion pictures like Halloween's Mike Myers for example, as well as many others. The game is small scale compared to other free roam horror games... small maps based on fixing generators to escape. It does get routine after a while just fixing gens and I wished they had other game modes to spice up the fun and excitement. Let's not talk about how none of the generators even look remotely like generators and look more like car engines instead. There are some elements that can ruin the enjoyment of the game such as killer behavior such as slugging, camping, and tunneling the same survivor because the killer isn't good enough to chase so they stick to the same person the whole game. There are other things as well but I will let the comment section cover everyone if they want to add anything to 'What ruins the game' for either killer or survivor.","timestamp_created":1613440116,"timestamp_updated":1613440116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513750851154327393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86759943","author":{"steamid":"76561198013877444","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":60331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":752,"playtime_at_review":15792,"last_played":1660537784},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, aunque aun tiene detallitos, la mayoria de la comunidad es amable, pero siempre te encontraras con esos que les gusta hacer el \"tbag\" y otras cosas para burlarse. en general es muy buen juego","timestamp_created":1613440072,"timestamp_updated":1613440072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486381322145462036","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86759802","author":{"steamid":"76561198027072487","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":4164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":53,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1660387864},"language":"english","review":"So after the endless streak of losses as a loser ... or \"a survivor\" in game's terms - I've switched to killers. \"Suddenly\" it turned out it's practically impossible to win a match either (despite my killer having a bunch of optimal perks from the anniversary sale). Apparently the game's matchmaking put new people against veterans regardless if you are a new survivor or a new killer. Also this botched matchmaking takes forever - minutes during prime time (with 60k players online!) I've seen much better queue times in games with only 200-500 people online. It seems the whole development team is on auto-pilot and the management doesn't have any idea what's going on? For example, they've declared their recent killer is the first one with the voice (completely ignoring The Plague)\n\nNo idea how a low-effort product like this can get so much popularity?
