For survivors, there is also a fast paced aspect, but it steadily picks up to that speed with the game becoming much riskier as is goes on. Overall, the game itself is great in that aspect and I love it, the community is generally quite good as well. I find that matchmaking solo leaves you at a disadvantage as inexperienced teammates can quite often end up being the weakest link for the killer to exploit. Having help if you need to experience the game more is a great option and I fully support it being a mostly solo player over my experience, but it can be frustrating should you end up on the hook from less seasoned teammates. As for the killers side, experience is key, there is no one besides yourself to drag you down.","timestamp_created":1629524752,"timestamp_updated":1629524752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97959144","author":{"steamid":"76561198441126342","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":36720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1433,"playtime_at_review":12635,"last_played":1660531326},"language":"english","review":"j","timestamp_created":1629524713,"timestamp_updated":1629524713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97959129","author":{"steamid":"76561199142073424","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1656662898},"language":"schinese","review":"捆绑包比原版便宜还买原版，我是大傻逼","timestamp_created":1629524679,"timestamp_updated":1629524679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97959114","author":{"steamid":"76561198058348416","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":23357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":947,"playtime_at_review":2902,"last_played":1660603640},"language":"english","review":"well i think it is time to give this a review. i recommend you play this with friends and mostly just friends. the online is toxic you cant go without the game lagging or the ping is so high it go`s past heaven. now if you are with friends it is a lot more fun and balanced. as for being on a team of randoms it is like being stuck is a room full of pins, needles, Really bad smelling gas and no brain idiots. then the killers i like to be a fair killer one that dose not camp the hooks the killer that gives everyone a chance to run/get away. i don't block the generators. i only sabotage the generators 1-2 times. i put fair perks on so that it makes the game fun and challenging. but most the time you are put in a mach with a killer that has all the perks that are unbalanced as F and always camps the hooks. i hate those types of killers. all i can say the best way to play this game is with friends that you trust. this game i love it a lot it just needs more balancing and work on the online part. yes i am going to recommend this game still. i wish there were a mix option but there is not.","timestamp_created":1629524652,"timestamp_updated":1629524652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97959097","author":{"steamid":"76561198048807756","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4241,"last_played":1659392195},"language":"english","review":"great game to play with your friends! if your new the game can be frustrating due to people hiding and not rescuing or doing gens, and the new killers like to either tunnel or face camp.

like this game a lot, but it's pretty gross that BHVR is so money hungry that they would support NFTs and essentially trick their dwindling fanbase into buying their DLC by disclosing that it was part of their little NFT agreement much later. It's hard to support this game when they do stuff like this.\n\n[strike] I love this game, but I have mixed feelings about recommending it. This game is unique, thrilling, and addictive, but often frustrating and broken. \n\nFirst of all, this game is a full time job. There's a steep learning curve and the in-game tutorial is extremely limited. If you want to play this game well, or even passably, be prepared to invest (many) hours studying on YouTube. Otherwise, prepare to be angry and often confused. \nHowever, learning to play this game is very satisfying if you are willing to put in the time. \n\nWhile it seems simple at a first glance, there is a surprising amount of depth that will keep you coming back. The progression you feel from learning the techs, memorizing and recognizing perks, and just generally improving as a Killer/Survivor is so enjoyable. At my current 500 hours, I still feel like I am learning every day.\n\nIf you're just getting started, look up some quick beginner guides. It's really going to help!\n\n\nSecondly, about it being broken... \nThe \"hitbox\" problem... There are some definite and [i]painful[/i] latency issues. I understand that it is an impossibility to have a perfect latency-free system, but the problem in DBD is far more prevalent than in any other game I've played. Some of the hits the Killers get on Survivors are crazy. Like, 6-feet-away-through-a-window crazy! And it happens to everyone. All the time. The severity varies from match to match, but it is a consistent issue. You do learn to accept this and laugh about it over time, but it can be understandably infuriating, too. Especially so as you're playing more competitively.\n\nAnd, well, it's very fidgety. Many of my friends have had issues running this game or connecting to the servers. They often get randomly disconnected and temporarily banned as a result, or the game won't run for them at all without intensive investigation, multiple re-installations, etc. I've felt guilty a number of times for convincing friends to buy this game when (after hours of troubleshooting) they are still largely unable to play it. Their issues vary widely, and often it is something we cannot solve. \nSo, you may have a hard time getting this game to work. It may run fine. It's a coin toss.\n\n\nOverall, though, I'd still have to recommend this game. After 500 hours of waiting for matches and countless hours of study, I still want to play all the time.\nIn chase, this game isn't as much about quick and precise reflexes as it is about understanding and outsmarting your opponent. The teamwork required of successful Survivors and the discipline required of successful Killers, as well as the endless possibilities of perk combinations, keep this game interesting and new every match. \n\nAlso, there is constantly new DLC and a lot of love clearly goes into that. Whether or not you buy into it, the game is always changing as you'll be playing with new Killers and Survivors on new maps.\n\nI often hear complaints about the community. The community can definitely be toxic, but just as often you'll meet some really nice people.\n\n\nAnyway, TL;DR: The concept and design are great. The game is so fun and unique, if a bit difficult to learn, but also suffers from poor technical execution in some areas that will likely never be fixed. I still recommend it.
