Plain and simple. There's a learning curve to this game for sure, learning how to usefully use perks and when to unhook survivors is something you can learn in time. I most definitely am no expert at this game, but I'm not a beginner either. I've had enough experience to say I confidently can recommend this game. Some maps may feel hard to win, and sometimes you might encounter a killer that gives you a sense of hopelessness. What makes this game worth it? The exhilaration. The kick you get from blood as it rushes through you when you dodge attacks that are right on your heels, or popping gens as the killer's tells are ringing in your ears. This is a game you NEED friends to play with, but I find it fun regardless.\n\n9/10 Great game, hard to distinguish flaws in such a simple concept but sometimes maps feel unbalanced and unspoken rules make the game more enjoyable for all.","timestamp_created":1643090393,"timestamp_updated":1643090393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108737829","author":{"steamid":"76561198253943628","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":16770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":46,"playtime_at_review":3236,"last_played":1660151591},"language":"russian","review":"Великолепная игра с уникальным геймплеем.

Por otra parte, el juego presenta grandes fallas en torno a la regulación de desventajas, el motor anti-cheating se vuelve bastante redundante cuando un equipo de supervivientes (SWF) utiliza comunicaciones externas como Discord o Skype,  hecho que en la mayoría de los casos termina con el asesino perdiendo la partida gracias a que la comunicación rompe el principal pilar del juego que es el manejo de la información, esto sin mencionar el mal balance dentro de los propios Killers y mapas existentes en el juego.

Not only how but why? \n\nA lot of grinding-related topics, quality of life basic stuff that should've been in the game has years, a new random killer that adds nothing new or exciting to the game; and literally, NONE of the announcements were directed to improve the gameplay, that admitetly by the majority of the community to be in an awful shape.\n\nAs a player that wants to play this as a good and creative option of a party game, it feels like the company tries to make the absolute opposite of it while not being capable of developing it as an efficient option of a competitive game.\n\nBtw, talking about competition, since it's the mood set, if you are playing this game and is inclined to compete out of your way to win, just do these:\n\nAs survivor: \n* SWAT coms with friends the whole game, why even information perks and experience the match\n* Run Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard/Sprint Burst, DS, Iron Will every game in every team member, for max team chase/rescue performance\n* Perfect wall-hugging (its way easier than killer wall hugging) \n* Just force the killer to vault windows during chases, it takes more than 2 seconds to them in comparison to your 0.5 LMAO\n\nAs killer:\n* Proxy camp and force first death on 1 to 2 hook\n* After the first player dies, just slug the hell out of every player, its a waste of time to hook anyway,\n* Run NOED, its as lazy and efficient as most survivors rushing gens\n* Run 3 anti-gen perks, two of those being DMS and SH:R\n* Play with killers not reliant on M1 hit, since its basic chase mechanic is completely on survivor favor\n* Dedicate your ass off to perfect wall-hugging and learn hitboxes\n* If everything else fail, spam nurse to force other four people to play your own game, not the one they signed up for.\n\nSumming it up: the best way to have fun with this, is to make fun of.\n\nAnd now mentioning the pushy agenda stuff, the current game team literally made David King sexuality being part of his character, in the same manner Nickelodeon did with Spongebob Squarepants and Patrick; so out of touch, completely disrespecting the work of the original team that first concepted the character and just to push an agenda that is not even part of the game matter.\n\nThe same goes for the weeb dating sim shit; dude, who the fuck gives a shit. Your IP is being openly criticized for every dumb and lazy decision you take, the active player count is dropping like hell, the changes you were so resistant to make you were forced to do later (since you were so inclined to trust analytics database and dumb analysis), and yet you go out of yourselves, instead of being commited to solve the issues present in the game, to recognize the players abandoning after thousands of hours of dedication, to be sorry about the bad decisions you took, you present a dating sim game, out of fucking nowhere, expecting to people party with you like its all rainbows.\n\nAh, and mentioning the performance issue... admitetly was improved somehow; they didn't even mention in the patch notes, but for some reason, the game started to run better for lots of players (including myself) in recent patches. It's not great, but it's something good.\n\nTLDR: Indie game company tries to act like the \"cool\" kids on the block, ends up being slacky, dismissive, and generally inneficient. It's lost.\n\nDown is my original review, in Jan/2022:\n\n====================================\n\nLet me be crystal clear, so it wont have any doubt for them to remove any exclusive item given to me (which I dont have, morons)\n\nThis game is currently one the biggest poorly managed products in the whole video-game industry (if not the worst).\nIn 12 months, all the game has done except engaging with big IPs to back it up, was getting somewhat involved with NFTs, dealing awfully poor with public opinion, even deserting very long time dedicated people that earned nothing except some fucking digital clothing on their characters, and, on the top of that, the game constantly feels more inaccessible regarding its average performance.\n\nFor real, if you can run this game stably at 60 fps or even more holy shit you could rent your computer's processing power to fucking NASA for some easy and honest money; at least more honest than the answers given from this game's team to their customers.\n\nThis is the best example of a product that started by really engaged people and as time passed by, more and more money came, it expanded and eventually given to people that really don't understand what are they doing, to the point that the dev QnA of the game is openly recognized by the game community as either just sad, laughable and/or cringeworthy. The dev perspective of the game feels so disconnected from their customers expectation it feels like the same case of \"League of Legends\" team contradicting their playerbase, saying that \"their game characters dont have overloaded kits\".\n\nIn one year, a complex and creative system of match interactions completely demoted to \"just escape lol\", for 4 months a dash skill froze the game for console players, a killer ability could stun himself, a poorly implemented hidden mmr system, an ability that allowed the survivor team to heal and recover efficiently without any other requirement, are lazy enough to solve their grind/money-sink problem by giving even more money, letting it be run by cheaters, and the list keeps growing.
