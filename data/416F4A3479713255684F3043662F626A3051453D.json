In the first 100 hours the game seems to be extremely difficult and annoying, but as you get better and start understanding the mentality of killers/survivors you can pull off some great mind-games playing both killer and survivor (even though I'm kinda bad at playing survivor). \nSeveral killers are underpowered, but I've heard that they will get \"fixed\" in a couple of months.\nIf you decide to play solo surv, you should ALWAYS determine your team's mentality (if they're altruistic, you can make risky plays and not worry about dying on first/second hook) (if they're always hiding from the killer, your job is to be stealthier than them and just let them die one by one on the hooks, so you can eventually get the hatch/escape).\n\nAs for playing killer, everything depends on the perks you take, some are entirely useless, others are godlike (not even speaking of addons). \n\nJust don't be scared of the raging kids that threaten to report you because you kept denying them totems/gens or if you tunnel a bit. DO NOT ALWAYS tunnel/camp, it will get you less Bloodpoints and you'll be prone to \"genrushing\". In some cases you just have to tunnel or camp a bit and it's understandable if it's near the end of the game. But if you want to camp, at least do it well... So many killers let their guard down and lose the camped survivor because of some brain plays from the survivors. And if you see a facecamping Chainsaw killer, don't even think about rescuing the hooked survivor, you'll die with him.\n\nThat being said, this is a very adventurous game that just keeps on getting better :)","timestamp_created":1567813940,"timestamp_updated":1567813940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54994178","author":{"steamid":"76561198323732167","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1640460873},"language":"schinese","review":"对新手一点都不友好，把把被虐，我都快吓成心脏病了，外挂也多，电脑已经有点带不动了（这些只能说明我穷，技术菜）可是现在这游戏对一个新手来说很容易劝退，当初是打折买的，现在想退款也退不成了，放到库存都快成灰了，唉qwq","timestamp_created":1567812748,"timestamp_updated":1567812748,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54994131","author":{"steamid":"76561198412095288","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":9890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1657133905},"language":"english","review":"DBD is very fun and deserves my top 5.
