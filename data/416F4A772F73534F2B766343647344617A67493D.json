In those 666 hours I've experienced a plethora of emotions and thoughts on Dead by Daylight. I cannot trash something I've spent so much time on, but there's been many ups and downs over the course. Dead by Daylight has \"changed\" over the years, but it's pretty much kept the same for the most part. An Asymmetrical Horror game revolving around 4 survivors trying to escape a lone killer. Survivors attempt to power generators to open the exit gates all the while alluding the killer. That's it, Dead by Daylight's only game mode, so it has to be fantastic right?  Yes and no, when the game functions properly it's a fun and exciting gameplay loop, but when it fails it becomes a buggy shit show. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Fun Asymmetrical Gameplay/Good Loop\n+ Licensed Killers\n+ Consistent updates\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Queue times can be horrific\n- Wonky hit-boxes and hit registration/very inconsistent\n- All survivors play identical\n\n[b]The Rest:[/b]\nThe Toxic community, while you could list it as a negative, I believe this to be the driving force behind the amazing longevity of the game. There's a sense of rage and anger that  keeps the game fresh. As a killer being blinded repeatedly and \"tea bagged\" at exit gates enrages you and fuels your fire for more slaughter. Survivors, getting basement camped or tunneled sucks and it pisses you off, but you know what 3 years later you're still on the same damn game.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] ★★★★☆\nIn the end, the core gameplay mechanics work(when they work) and it can be a really unique and fun experience. I'd deffinitely recommend this to anyone wanting to sink their teeth into an asymetrical multiplayer game, it's one of the best ones out there. \n\n[b]TLDR:[/b] \"This game is fucking ass!\", plays for eternity.","timestamp_created":1614725419,"timestamp_updated":1614725594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87751916","author":{"steamid":"76561198310500746","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1644187884},"language":"spanish","review":"este juego es una pija pero me encanta la pija","timestamp_created":1614725117,"timestamp_updated":1614725117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4862385094165802","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87751712","author":{"steamid":"76561198453544728","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1646117462},"language":"brazilian","review":"leagal o jogo e de medo achei intrigante e medonho, mas mesmo assim bom de bola gostei fora bolsonaro","timestamp_created":1614724771,"timestamp_updated":1614724771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87751619","author":{"steamid":"76561198005582626","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1591,"playtime_at_review":2788,"last_played":1660518470},"language":"english","review":"I finally gave Dead by Daylight a try. About 46 hours in the past 2 weeks and I have some thoughts:\n1. The game is a ton of fun for both killer and survivor and offers a bunch of ton of replayability and things to chase.\n2. So many perks to try and different play styles.\n3. The licensed characters and levels are really cool. Only wish they had more customization options.\n\nGonna talk about a few gripes tho:\n1. The game enables toxicity via gameplay. More for killers to subject survivors to than the other way around, but  survivors and make a shitty experience for the killer as well. As much as I everyone would like the community to police themselves for this kind of crap.. if you give players the opportunity to play like dicks, they will play like dicks. And it's my opinion that Behavior Interactive to do more things to prevent this.\n\nA common thing is when the killer has the game in hand but then decides to take the game hostage by just not completing the actions to end the game. There needs to be a give up option for survivors and isn't just disconnecting and taking a matchmaking timeout\n\nI would also suggest limiting certain combinations of killer perks from be run together. Or make some perks hex perks so they can at least be countered by the survivors. There are some builds out there that just too strong and make for a negative play experience.\n\nThen there is tunneling. When a killer focuses one player out of the game is a shitty experience. High rank killers often won't do that, but if you are new and lower rank, I can use how this just turns you away from the game forever.\n\nI think there needs to be diminishing returns on tunneling a player. Make it so not in the killers best interest to play that way. Maybe killing a player before X Generator are completed gives a bug gen repair boost or something.\n\nLet's talk a little about survivor bullying. Flashlights and body blocking hooks just to troll the killer sucks. That should be on the devs to give the killer an out on that kind of lobby.\n\nAnd finally, the way you level up your killers and survivors needs a rework.

Playing a survivor often means matchmaking with the three biggest potatoes in the entire game, every game, unless you have a survive with friends crew. If you do have a survive with friends queue, queue times will be about ten minutes a game most of the time, and then the killer won't like your SWF and will facecamp their first down. \n\nWhen you play killer, you'll generally encounter survivors who are frustrated with the above problems, and they take it out on you. You'll see survivors with strong items, map offerings, often keys, and usually some teabagging. This can lead to a very frustrating experience, so many killers resort to facecamping or stop playing killer. Somehow, playing killer rarely results in seeing as many potatoes as playing survivor.\n\nBecause playing killer can be frustrating, this leads to many killers stopping playing or playing survivor, and results in higher queue times for remaining survivors, which helps contribute to frustrating survivors.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really interesting, the management of time and the use of resources (pallets and vaults) in chase, plus the play and counterplay (except spirit, fuck you) of each killer contributes to making both killer and survivor an enjoyable experience. Dead by Daylight is my favourite piece of shit.","timestamp_created":1614716004,"timestamp_updated":1614716004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87745717","author":{"steamid":"76561198154282665","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20301,"last_played":1647648954},"language":"polish","review":"Wszystko!","timestamp_created":1614715950,"timestamp_updated":1614715950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87745443","author":{"steamid":"76561198314760098","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":1261,"last_played":1659918025},"language":"french","review":"bien sur","timestamp_created":1614715578,"timestamp_updated":1614715578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87745306","author":{"steamid":"76561198094631031","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3212,"last_played":1658174656},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo dinâmico, diferente dos tradicionais famosos modos moba e battleroyale.","timestamp_created":1614715384,"timestamp_updated":1614715384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87745293","author":{"steamid":"76561197985470275","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":10784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9564,"last_played":1625074743},"language":"russian","review":"Всё, что нужно знать о DBD (и не обязательно для подобного обзора наигрывать овер 500+ часов):\n\n- На маньяках 16го ранга будете играть с выжившими 4-го, 2-го, 6-го рангов. Получайте в еbасосину фонарь при подъме нокнутых выживших, и вообще готовьтесь к столкновению с задротами, которых вам на вашем ранге даже не должно закидывать). Онлайн маленький, так что ранг теперь не имеет значения, будет закидывать всех.\n- Готовьтесь к постоянному нытью и токсичности насчёт кемпинга маняька от сурвов. Да да, у выживших куча возможностей для получения капли и продвижения по ранговой системе (а это цель игры), для байтов, станнинга маньяков. Выпрыгивания из шкафа прямо перед маньяком,  бросать доски перед маньяком, светить фонарём в лицо, когда тот ломает доски, светить фонарём, когда тот поднимает упавшего сурва. Чего только стоит перка на резист к нокауту после снятия с крюка. Без разницы, хоть три раза ударь, хоть бензопилой - выживший снятый с крюка не падает в knockout минуту - но нет, сурвы всё равно ноют и cрут в комменты фразами в духе \"учись играть\" и т.д. \n\n- Как я уже подытожил выше - комьюнити определённо токсичное. Очень круто, что в самой игре по ходу игровой сессии не существует ни войсчата, ни просто чата. Иначе вы бы ощутил всю мощь токсичности обиженных сынков.\n\n- Игруля, которая стоила под 350 р по региональной цене безусловно с годами подорожала. Ок. Но покупка двух персов (одного маньяка и одного выжившего) в DLC в 2/3 от стоимости игры - такое себе) Ах да. Сюда же добавим как можно больше платной косметики и конечно же платный боевой пропуск с косметикой опять же. В общем, я понимаю, что DBD не единственная платная игра, где внутри так много микротранзакций, понимаю, правда. Но ждал от инди разрабов чуть больше чуткости к игроку. Впрочем, почему? Типичная студия, которая хоть как-то продолжает зарабатывать не на продажах копий игры в цифре, а на  втюхивании косметики своей немногочисленной фанбазе игроков.\n\nЕсли подытожить:\nТоксичное комьюнити, игроки вечно будут разводить срач о несбалансированности персонажей и о кемпинге. Платные герои по цене самой игры. Разрабы ввиду низкого онлайна сами наssрали на свою ранговую систему и вам на 16-м ранге будет закидывать 4-й, 5-й,6-е ранги (задротов) в каждой второй катке. \nУдачи) \nДвижок вроде и поменяли, графон подтянули, мои fps сожрали, ну да ладно) Я всё равно не помню, как игра выглядела в 2016м. Сравнить тяжело. \nP.S. \nИ вроде хочется в целом даже несмотря на весь этот негатив поставить положительный отзыв. Но нет. Позиция больше принципиальная.
