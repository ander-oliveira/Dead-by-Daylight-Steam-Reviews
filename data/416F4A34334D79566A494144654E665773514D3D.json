by Daylight is a top secret torture method that is developed by Behaviour Interactive. This game is very bad and I don't recommend it to anyone. You have to be mentally handicapped to get any fun from this game. Thankfully, spending about 30 minutes in DbD makes you retarded. In DbD you can visit very interesting locations like ORMOND or HADDONFIELD.. nothing else. This game will bring you very fun experiences and fond memories. You can play as the survivors who need to repair generators to escape. Playing survivor is very easy considering this game is very balanced. The only thing you need to watch out for are random survivors that have the intellect of a plants vs zombies pea shooter. You can also play the killer who kills the survivors. Don't worry, out of every killer only like 3 are viable on high ranks. And you need to apply pressure to 4 people at the same time while you're playing padded jaws trapper. Thankfully, after 6 years this game still feels like its in Alpha. Its not DbD if the map doesn't have shit hitboxes and is full with bugs. This game also consists of  very fun cosmetics like 15$ trapper skin and pure cancer. Overall this game is fun for the first 100 hours, then its just pure pain and suffering.

Ranks reset once a month so dipping out and coming back in the future to avoid 24/7 sweaty and sabotaged matches is the best way to enjoy this.\n\n\nLong Version\nThis game is a fun cat and mouse style game up until the top ranks. If you aren't playing with a pre-made party at that point the community can become toxic (other survivors dumping killer on you, giving your locations away intentionally, etc.).\n\nYou'll find the end game killers come in basically two flavors, 1) crappy game ruining ones (the vast majority) who face camp survivors and tunnel them out of matches (approved and praised by the developers as a winning method, with total disregard for how game play is for those survivors on the hook who then de-pip). \n2) High skilled ones that understand the game is meant to be fun who challenge you without resorting to bullying tactics.\n\n Many killers can teleport, see auras, and block their auras from being seen (nulling several survivor perks). The only fighting chance most will have at high ranks is by having that pre-made group with voice chat. Which still doesn't give much of an advantage all things considered. \n\nOverall, the game is fun and I've purchased it for several friends, with that said, we also stopped playing upon hitting the next to highest rank in the game, because it just stopped being fun playing with random people. \n\nCustom games are a fun alternative if you have the friends and don't mind making no progress in the main game, but would be better IMO if they added an alternate mode of customs to allow us to level up and play privately, leveling up our 'ranks' and just having it be it's own leveling, aka not synced with public matches. \n\nThe game is fun and ranks reset every month, it's IMHO that playing until the end game and then dipping for a few months when it's too toxic is the best way to play this. Still fun, but it does have that 'death clock' feel to it knowing you're edging closer to endlessly sweaty and sabotaged matches.","timestamp_created":1649736679,"timestamp_updated":1649736679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113723210","author":{"steamid":"76561198184577001","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1596,"last_played":1653961691},"language":"english","review":"This game is a lot of fun to play with friends is all I've gotta say about that.","timestamp_created":1649735596,"timestamp_updated":1649735596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113723176","author":{"steamid":"76561198253181027","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1658088785},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é muito mal otimizado, não para de crashar, delays de render constantes, isso destroi completamente minha experiencia de gameplay, eu realmente fiquei bolado.","timestamp_created":1649735504,"timestamp_updated":1649735504,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51327437162399292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113722650","author":{"steamid":"76561198185016193","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":34483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":87,"playtime_at_review":34163,"last_played":1660343340},"language":"english","review":"Share my thoughts... I'm not sure if you want me to do that. \n\nThe game is 100% survivor leaned.. That was made clear with the release of Legion. A killer where their ability does nothing but help the survivor run away faster. \"Oh but they have to mend..\" Useless.. Because we have to stop chasing them for that to even start, and if we keep chasing them and hit them AGAIN with a knife it does nothing and our ability stops.\n\nThen the PTB.. I played 2 matches of the new Haddonfield update.. and I was done. Don't get me wrong, the graphics and visuals of the new map amazing. Could even swear they added new Pallet Breaking sounds. But everything else of the map... survivor based. You play a stealth killer, where you not being seen is a REQUIREMENT to get anything done? Haddonfield is wide open. Went from a regular real life street gaping of houses to 2x if not 3x the space on the street, with nothing taller than the occasaional pallet. Lets not forget the endless loop made of cars by one of the houses. \n\nThen we come to this MMR changes. Yes I get it, its a test. I will in no way say I was a professional Huntress Killer, I know there are people better than me. But before these changes I got 4 kills I wanna say 70-80% of the time. 2 kills atleast 90% of the time. This MMR change... Im lucky to get 1 hook before the gates are open. \n\nBehaviour you want to know why the Killer side of this community is failing? Stop favoring the survivors. This  game is nothing without killers. Another reason why, Survivor toxicity is through the roof! \n\nI uninstalled this game for 4 reasons. \n1) I'm done with the Toxicity from survivors. Using Flashlights not as intended, teabagging and generally being disrespectful\n2) Behaviours lack of Consistant Moderation. If you look in game when you go to report someone under Trolling, \"Body Blocking\" is clearly listed there. Plain as day. (This will tie into #3) Yet  on their forums, they say Body Blocking is not reportable.. Hmmmm\n3) Immersion Breaking --> Because of this 'Body Blocking' Meta.. it destroys what little immersion I have left in the game. You are being chased by lets say an Axe Throwing Woman. Who in their right mind will willing stand between them and the person they are targeting.. Nobody.. \n\nDon't get me wrong I am okay with bodyblocking when the killer is carrying a survivor to a hook. \n\n4) Another not really enforced reportable offence that doesn't see any attention to --> Taking the game hostage. You got the Gens done. Cool. Now leave. Don't 99% every door, run around troll the killer. Teabag the killer, click at the killer and be disrespectful to the killer. \n\nI'll allow comments cause frankly if Behaviour doesn't care.. I don't care. Don't expect me to reply to them cause why would I if Behaviour can't enforce their own Reportable Offences.\n\nNote: Added June 21st, 2022\n\nWell I was stupid and thought things might have changed when the new DLC came out.. It felt like it did.. till once again the MMR kicked back in.\n\nFirst 2 games. Were in my opinion a bit too easy for me. Nearly got two 4k matches. The next match was a joke. 0 Kills, maybe 2-3 hooks. Went right back to how it was previous. Because the game paired me with in my mind had to be new players and I wiped the floor with them, I must be a professional no life gamer who needs to be paired with other no life gamer survivors.\n\nIs there no inbetween of New player - Expert Player? There is no reason I should go from EASILY hooking and killing people to barely able to hook anyone. Where is the common ground? It is like the first two games were literally bait to keep you playing. To be frank, I feel that scratching the skill based or MMR or what ever it is called system and going with random selections every time you queue would be 10 times better than what ever you call this match making system.\n\nI go from enjoying the game wanting to play it, to wishing I had 572 hours less in the game so I can refund it before I break something. \n\nI mean common, you have an ingame report feature. You have a website report feature. Behaviour does nothing to hackers, unless YOU PROVIDE Proof. Which means you have A) Record every match you are in regardless of streaming or not just incase you find a hacker. B) Spend probably an hour or more editing that clip down to that specific match. C) Spend probably another hour finding and filing that report on their website. \n\nSo it seems that Behaviour expects every single one of its 105,052 average players to have some sort of screen capturing?\n\nStop sitting on your derrière and do something about these hackers. Stop making your players be the moderation team. Unless you start paying us to play your game.","timestamp_created":1649734344,"timestamp_updated":1655835337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113721650","author":{"steamid":"76561199263650080","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4099,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1660552041},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego","timestamp_created":1649732288,"timestamp_updated":1649732288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113721523","author":{"steamid":"76561198135279296","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":62416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2799,"playtime_at_review":42764,"last_played":1660535032},"language":"english","review":"I hate it please save me I keep coming back","timestamp_created":1649732070,"timestamp_updated":1649732070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486381322145462036","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113721424","author":{"steamid":"76561198359721802","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":3628,"last_played":1659579372},"language":"english","review":"Give us crossprogression... the games cool","timestamp_created":1649731881,"timestamp_updated":1649731904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113721413","author":{"steamid":"76561198202754794","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":17936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":17902,"last_played":1660074471},"language":"english","review":"One of the best game!","timestamp_created":1649731857,"timestamp_updated":1649731857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113721001","author":{"steamid":"76561198994439709","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":6241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":48,"playtime_at_review":6171,"last_played":1659532280},"language":"schinese","review":"充满乐趣","timestamp_created":1649731072,"timestamp_updated":1649731072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113720620","author":{"steamid":"76561198401685157","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":32486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2674,"playtime_at_review":1404,"last_played":1660591807},"language":"english","review":"Gamezinho bão, recomendo!","timestamp_created":1649730328,"timestamp_updated":1649730328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510489523410797119","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113720569","author":{"steamid":"76561198239185370","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":7996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7298,"last_played":1658365149},"language":"english","review":"lgbt survivor","timestamp_created":1649730233,"timestamp_updated":1649730233,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113720562","author":{"steamid":"76561198372374265","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1649729699},"language":"english","review":"DO NOT GET THIS PORT.

They also do events and have the rifts which keeps the game from getting boring. 8.5/10!","timestamp_created":1649723252,"timestamp_updated":1649723252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113716546","author":{"steamid":"76561198326483512","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4011,"playtime_at_review":10266,"last_played":1660598954},"language":"spanish","review":"Divertido y muy bueno para pasar el rato","timestamp_created":1649723167,"timestamp_updated":1649723167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113715791","author":{"steamid":"76561198856210281","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":6238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5896,"last_played":1658687183},"language":"english","review":"ilu\n","timestamp_created":1649721734,"timestamp_updated":1649721734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113715482","author":{"steamid":"76561198984506454","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":66,"playtime_at_review":809,"last_played":1659467559},"language":"english","review":"d","timestamp_created":1649721115,"timestamp_updated":1649721115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113713267","author":{"steamid":"76561199230131545","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":848,"last_played":1655142782},"language":"english","review":"is nice","timestamp_created":1649717066,"timestamp_updated":1649717066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113712447","author":{"steamid":"76561198037304225","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":69962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1068,"playtime_at_review":60566,"last_played":1660527176},"language":"english","review":"If I click my flashlight at the bad man he gets very angry.

En otras plataformas/consolas les está pasando lo mismo desde hace tiempo.\n\nHe enviado a sus paginas oficiales una queja, pues básicamente están violando la privacidad de la gente al consentir esto (y espero que algún moderador de Steam lea esto, pues puede haber un gran problema). Pues si borras a alguien y le bloqueas desde Steam, no tiene por que saber si estas o no estas, desde el juego (pues no tienes opciones de borrarlo desde dentro, solo \"Bloquearle\" para que no te invite a partida). Pues alomejor lo borras por que no coincidís o por alguna tontería. ¿Pero y si es algo grave? ¿Y si te amenaza, o es un acosador/a etc? Pues según esta empresa, te toca aguantarte, por que según ellos (y cito textualmente lo que me han enviado respecto a esto)  \"However, we currently do not have an option to remove friends listed in your account and apologize for this inconvenience.\"\n\nHay cientos de jugadores de distintas plataformas (según parece), a los cuales les está pasando de manera aleatoria, con lo cual no consintáis esta practica y no compréis el juego hasta que solventen esto, pues a quedado claro que es una empresa a la cual no le importa vuestra privacidad/seguridad (pues cada persona es un mundo, y no siempre se borra a alguien por una nimiedad), ni enviando tiquet o yendo a quejaros en su pagina de bugs, os lo van a solucionar, pues llevo casi 2 semanas intentando que esto no pase en mi cuenta (y al parecer, otra gente mas tiempo).\n\nP.D.: Si podéis dar un \"SI\" se agradecería, para que Steam (Steam no tiene la culpa, que quede claro) tome cartas en este asunto, pues nadie tiene derecho a vulnerar la privacidad de nadie (en ninguna de sus formas), consintiendo que puedan ver si estamos o no, si les borramos/bloqueamos por aquí (y encima si se queda bugueado en el juego, sin posibilidad de arreglo).\n\nAl margen de ello, es un juego repetitivo como superviviente (vas a llevar siempre las mismas habilidades sin variar nisiquiera un pelín).\n\nComo asesino te tocan premades que van a saber donde estas en cada momento, pues se consiente (según parece) las llamadas grupales con programas externos, vamos que son videntes en comparación contigo.\n\nSi juegas con alguien, para pasar el rato es un \"bueno, vale que remedio\", pero como asesino, puede ser muy frustrante.\n\nSolo vale la pena para estar un rato en compañía con gente, si no... no te lo compres, hay mejores juegos (y sin estos problemas tan graves como dije al principio).","timestamp_created":1649712262,"timestamp_updated":1649712262,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113708618","author":{"steamid":"76561199061943643","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":336,"playtime_at_review":6998,"last_played":1660595005},"language":"english","review":"scooby
