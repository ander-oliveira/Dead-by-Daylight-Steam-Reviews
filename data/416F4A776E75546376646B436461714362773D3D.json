I'm not talking about who gets paired with who (which is also an issue). I'm talking about whether or not it will even pair you up with ANYONE. It bugs out more than half of the time and kicks you back into the player menu.\n\nAnother issue is that you're lucky to find a decent match where all four survivors load into the map where you can finally play. It takes ages to load into a match sometimes after you've been paired up with everyone too.\n\nIf you go to join a public lobby through matchmaking (your only option), sometimes the game glitches and sits on the loading screen forever. You have to kill the game's .exe process and reboot it if you want to try and play again.\n\nIf you're playing with friends, you need to manually invite them again after each match. It kicks everyone back to their player menu after each match.\n\nIt's truly a shame to see such a great game go to waste if the developers don't pick up on these obvious flaws. Otherwise, the gameplay is great and the game itself is fine once you load into a map. Currently, I do not recommend this to friends until the developers fix these issues.\n\n***EDIT*** Septemeber 27, 2017 ***EDIT***\nWow!

First playing killer is VERY unbalanced and survivors can easily abuse multiple features. Flashlight spamming, pallet dropping, body blocking. On top of all that survivors can fix generators so quick they win most games in under 5 minutes. Let me paint a picture of how most games go as a killer.\n\nYou start the match, look for a survivor, maybe find one chase him hit him, if your lucky he dosnt get away. *ding generator fixed* You follow him or find him again, smack him again down him pick him up. * ding generator fixed* you move him to a hook asap so he dosnt wiggle out, hook him, *ding generator fixed* you camp the hook if your a cheap broken noob to get that 1 measly kill but if you have any kind of skill you will go after another survivior. *ding 2 generators fixed and your hooked guy is probably rescued* Now they just need to get out through the gates. You will probably get a few hits on them as they try to open the gates but still. And that not even if they are playing SWF (Survive with friends.) which is game breaking for something like this and nothing has been done about it. \n\nNow playing a survivor is cake, its so easy its not even fun. 99% of the time i find a generator, fix it, someone gets hooked maybe, or i get hooked. I go to save them or fix another gen, someone fixes the remaining 3, and boom were out of there in under 5 minutes. The only time i ever die is when the killer camps the hook. \n\nSo this game just needs to be totally redone, make it harder for survivors, make it so they cant abuse features and make it impossible for the killer to win, and do something about SWF.","timestamp_created":1483845643,"timestamp_updated":1630855779,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500007748603820801","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29105331","author":{"steamid":"76561198078425978","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":84618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":4395,"last_played":1659559681},"language":"english","review":"Great Game Developers are Great","timestamp_created":1483844015,"timestamp_updated":1492647264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500010013580322266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29105070","author":{"steamid":"76561198126598330","num_games_owned":430,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":72181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72181,"last_played":1638478980},"language":"english","review":"this game doodoo fart","timestamp_created":1483843035,"timestamp_updated":1643834558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29104837","author":{"steamid":"76561198183480311","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1032,"last_played":1587496834},"language":"french","review":"Excellent jeu !

If you land in a game where everyone is a similar level, you don't have a camper for a killer (benefical for the other survivors perhaps, but not in the spirit of good gameplay - morals people!) and everyone is in it for a good game, and not for hoarding points. \n\nI've been lucky enough to have quite a few of these games - and it is amazing. You are tense as soon as the music starts, your heart pounds along with the heartbeat you hear, you are genuinely terrified when the killer appears (Nurse is freaking scary!). The four survivors work as a team, saving each other from the hook and healing each other - the killer is creeping around, scaring the Bejesus out of you. It doesn't matter who wins - the victor(s) are congratulated and 'good game' is heartily concurred all round.\n\nBut be ready - because that is what I get maybe 20% of the time, and it's only that 20% and the hope that the bugs will be fixed that keeps me coming back. The other 80%? I'm lucky if I get in a game, usually it fails to get me in a lobby. Once I am eventually into a game, I last 2 minutes tops because the killer is top level with all the best perks (and it's no fault of their own that they've been paired with such a low leveller like me) but really, they should be playing with gamers of their own standard, Survivors who have reached the top level. It's a common complaint, and one that I hope will be fixed soon. How can we Survivors level up when paired with a killer who can see us a mile away?! Otherwise, I am paired with a killer of a similar level but once caught and hooked - they camp. I've had people who don't even hide it and stand there watching me die, I had someone doing something similar to a figure of 8 around my hook tonight! But I don't think there's anything that the devs can do about that - you just have to hope that you've got a decent killer!\n\nOnce the bugs are fixed - this will be an outstanding game! Right now - yes, buy it but play it with friends, or have enough patience to deal with not getting into a lobby for a while, and possibly dealing with mismatched levels or camping killers when you get there. I haven't played as a killer yet, but I've already read stories about Survivors acting like tools but that's the risk of playing online. Eventually though you will get a match which shows the potential of this game.\n\nAlso enjoyed watching my OH jumping at every little noise tonight - thanks devs!","timestamp_created":1483835830,"timestamp_updated":1483835830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498703271150588989","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29102893","author":{"steamid":"76561198119327940","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":157369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":728,"playtime_at_review":72691,"last_played":1660148236},"language":"german","review":"Es ist quasi eine sehr krasse Form von Versteckfangen.
