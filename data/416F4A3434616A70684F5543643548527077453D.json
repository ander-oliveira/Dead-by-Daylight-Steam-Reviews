is the first review I've ever written for a game on steam, and after hundreds of hours, I feel like I finally have a solid enough opinion to tell fellow onlookers about.\n\nLet me start off by saying, I love dead by daylight. It's one of the only online games I've ever considered myself somewhat good at and enjoyed playing. Now then,\nI FUCKING HATE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT. The community is so toxic on both sides of the spectrum it makes it unbearable to play at certain points. \nSurvivors will loop/stun/and flashlight a killer all game long while their friends do objectives in order to completely slaughter any chance a newbie killer would have in order to learn that side of the game. After the match, all of them will continue to call the killer shit and \"EZ\" all day long. \nHowever, I don't play killers often, so let me get down to the real root of my frustration: The Killers.\n\nThe killers are some of the most unbalanced and toxic things I've ever seen. I played for almost 5 hours on and off today, and out of all my games, there were maybe 3 games that the killers DIDN'T camp the hooked survivors. \nWith the new ranking system, Killers practically get rewarded for camping their hooks, while the survivors get shitted on for not being able to save one of their teammates. There are literally some killers, like the cannibal, hillbilly, or even Mikey who can insta down multiple people at a time just for trying to do their part as a survivor and save whoever is on the hook. \nI am honestly just so sick and tired of killers getting NO penalties for camping thusly ending the game in minutes, and it only gets worse the lower in rank you progress.\n\nIf the developers want want to work on anything, LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY AND FIX THE KILLER CAMPING PROBLEM. As of right now, the game in its current state, in good conscious, I would not recommend to anyone. \n\nThis game used to be a really fun thing that my boyfriend and I could play together, and now I'm lucky if he even plays a single game with me because of how bad it is. \n\nI will update this review as needed if the developers ever decided to address this issue, which I pray they do.","timestamp_created":1533523719,"timestamp_updated":1533523719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554161906242370605","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43957873","author":{"steamid":"76561197988039249","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":33531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3609,"last_played":1644986541},"language":"english","review":"With over 500 hour, this game was solid, but over the years it's community got very toxic, the devs are stupid and break as many things as they fix, sometimes it's not even in a playable state, they release maps that you can't play because they are breaking the game.

To give you just one example of what I encountered: premades of 2-3 survivors sniped their killer-friend and then proceeded to communicate him my position, body-blocked me into a corner and fed me off to the killer after that they just procedeed to farm points not even allowing me to die so I can move on to play another match because they can stun-heal you and let their Killer friend hit you for points as well as hook-unhook you several times for points.\n\nThere is a constant flow of [b]rage-quitters[/b] and [b]leavers[/b] on both sides, survivors quitting when camped or/and hooked early in the game on top of all the regular reasons people leave matches in multiplayer games (power/internet outages, lags, real-life emergencies etc.), and Killers also [b]ragequit[/b] left and right because of getting [b]looped[/b] and [b]bm-ed[/b] by survivors.\n\nThe most widespread complaints this game faces are:\n1. Balance\n2. Toxicity\nBoth complaints are very much deserved and are tied to players inability to rank up and feel rewarded proportionally to how well the match played out.\n\nGame monetization is also set up in a problematic way, but I don't even want to go deep into it. In short it's [b]Pay2Win + PayNotToPlay[/b] monetization design.\n\nUntil all these problems are solved -- competitive integrity and fun of the game are largly compromised plus there is a neverending conflict between [b]point farming people[/b] and [b]wanna win the game people[/b]. So I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone, stay away from it if you value your nerves, time and money.\n\n=======================================================\n\nBut I'm not here to just criticize, I actually have a solution to offer.\nI propose redesigning ranking evaluation system for survivors by looking at Dead by Daylight as a [b]team game.[/b] Team Killer vs Team Survivors. Game is obviously asymmetrical so Team Killer has 1 player and Team Survivors has 4, but this shouldn't change the team aspect of competition. Ultimately it should be one team winning and another losing with a tie situation at 2 escape + 2 survive.\n\nSo the changes should be made to survivors' acquisition of points that ultimately decides amount of progress (pips) you earn or lose in ranked progression:\n\n- Whenever anyone repairs a generator = every survivor gets equal share of points\n- Whenver anyone gets rescued from a hook = every survivor should get same amount of points.\n- You get the picture, basically anything any member of the [b]Team Survivors[/b] does contributes to total points earned by the team and everyone on the team gets 1 pip, 2 pips, no change or loses a pip based on total points accumulated with largest point bounties placed on escaping.\n\nThis design will eliminate most problems and frustrations surrounding situations like:\n- The Killer captures and ensures the sacrifice of the first survivor he caught by camping him.\nCurrently this sucks for the unlucky survivor who happened to be the first victim. And even if other survivors reacted properly to this situation by just getting all gens up and running and leaving camped survivor to die = currently this first unlucky player will get deranked while others who just had free reign of the map at his cost will rank up. In fact this is so infuriating for some that they suicide on the hook or quit the game.\n\nWith changes I proposed this situation will lead to [b]Team Survivors[/b] winning and even sacrificed survivor getting same ranked progress as ones that escaped. This is fair and encourages all the right ways to play the game while alleviating the frustration of being camped on a hook and/or being the first one to die. It also gives all the right incentives -- for a guy on a hook not to struggle and buy time if he is getting camped, for unhurt survivors to evaluate risks and rewards in a smart and strategic way - go for gens or saves depending on the situation etc.\n\nI believe this is the best approach. As survivors become more codependent on each others' success in a match -- it will alleviate frustrating situations (getting camped, dying early on in the game), lower ragequitting and incentify trying to rescue and escape with as many people alive as possible instead of current #1 objective in the game = farm points by looping the killer infinitely. When it comes to ranked progression survivors should be evaluated as a team, and judged by overall outcome of the match rather than how many points they farmed from any given set of actions. If some player contributes more to the overall escape progression then others -- it's a matchmaking problem, not design problem, survivors should be matched by their rank with similarly skilled survivors, but once matched together you should all play as a team.\nBest players will still survive longer and do more than unskilled ones, but this way it is less about farming points and more about trying to win the game.\n\nAll these problems don't have to be solved my way, but until they are properly fixed in [b]some[/b] way I give this game a thumbs down and don't recommend to anyone.","timestamp_created":1533466327,"timestamp_updated":1573120362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43944215","author":{"steamid":"76561198283222558","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4637,"last_played":1659173109},"language":"hungarian","review":"The game itself is very good and enjoyable.I love it to be honest.Gameplay is very funny since you can be killer and survivor,and because of rank system.The only thing i dont like in the game is the players sometimes.If someone gets caught they simply exit from the game,which is annoying.But in the rest of the games the other players are much better. 7/10 in my opinion because of the Community.","timestamp_created":1533465151,"timestamp_updated":1533465151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491803288459777832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44ajphOUCd5HRpwE="}
