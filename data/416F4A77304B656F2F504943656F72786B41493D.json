I definitely recommend Dead By Daylight if you're looking for a game to play with friends, or just for a multiplayer horror cat/mouse kind of game.\n\nMost dlc survivors are decent, but I'll always keep going back to Claudette and Nea, Dead By Daylight is one of those games where you don't need dlc to have fun, it only enhances the experience. The same goes for killers, although i don't play killer much, i enjoy the nurse's mechanics, along with the huntress', and those two are free.

Some that people fail to grasp and are quick to blame others or the game itself. Now I ain't saying the game is perfect (cause it has plenty of bugs), but really what game doesn't have bugs. You can argue that the developers are slow or don't understand and I will not argue with that since this game receives updates frequently. Sometimes if issues are left alone, its probably for a reason such as having to revamp the entire game or switching to a different engine to fix said issues.

They make the game better because you can survive longer if you use them right. As much fun as I have on here, it's not a game I would recommend. If you don't like the repetition of surviving and dying, dying, dying, dying, hook, unhook, surviving(and the Killer's version of it), you won't like this game in the slightest. Especially if you have no patience.\n\n\nApparently I've played 130 hours of this game! Wouldn't recommend it for the life of me though, unless you already have at least one person to survive with who will make the game fun for you. Or help you win, if you're in it solely for the experience of winning. Mostly I recommend SWF(survive with friends) so you can have a good laugh and a scream over voice chat. Mixed bag really, sometimes it's frustrating in public lobbies and sometimes it ranges from neutral to feeling accomplished.\n\nDBD gets frustrating for a lot of people, so if you want to try this game, don't go into it expecting anything. Toxicity in post-game chats is extremely common among the community, never had it happen to me specifically but it's still something you should be prepared for. Personally I feel it's more so on the shoulders of the community, but the game itself still shoulders some blame. BHVR too. I wouldn't know though, I don't care about that crap. I just log on and play either Surv or Killer and then go to sleep.\n\nMatchmaking has long been a big issue for me, being rank 17-15 consistently and being put up against people <10 rank-wise, quite frustrating sometimes. Recently they've changed the matchmaking(as of 13 June 2021), and I don't know if this has to do with recent wraith nerfs but I've rarely had any DLC killers since the new SBMM or whatever it's called. Just a bunch of wraiths and the usual camping huntress - though there's definitely non-campy huntresses out there, I just never have the privilege of going against them. Essentially the \"new\" SBMM has effectively managed to make the game quite boring for me, but maybe it's because I'll slowly level up playing with the people around my rank and then the true suffering will begin when I'm in the higher ranks if I ever bother to play that long. Who knows. Maybe your experience will be different.\n\nIf you want the good perks and to have a better chance of surviving(and therefore enjoying) the game, you'll have to prepare to open your wallet because to my knowledge all the super useful perks come with DLC, not the base game. And anyway if you have money to shell for DBD, you'll probably have money to pay for/waste for new survivors, depending on how you look at spending for DLC. On the bright side, at least you get fun perks to experiment with and new orgasm noises added whenever your survivor of choice gets hit! Some of them sound downright [i]sinful[/i] and it is strange in its own right. \n\nSound design outside of voice-acting(moaning? shrieking? groaning? whimpering?) is pretty good at helping the atmosphere, I've been spooked by environmental noises that pop out of pure silence or a rando jumpscaring me before the killer even has a chance to.\n\nDo I enjoy the game? Depends on the match, ultimately it's the people that either make or break it for me for the day/match. If you don't want to take the risk, maybe don't bother until the base game and its DLCs get prices slashed during sales.\n\nOr get the game specifically because you're a shameless simp for at least one of the killers and survivors, I know that was my reason.","timestamp_created":1593314343,"timestamp_updated":1623560926,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71538711","author":{"steamid":"76561198149019207","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1593139547},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bien","timestamp_created":1593314080,"timestamp_updated":1593314080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71538480","author":{"steamid":"76561198131902280","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1598367192},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดีครับเล่นไม่ยาก เล่นกับเพื่อนคงสนุกน่าดู","timestamp_created":1593313787,"timestamp_updated":1593313787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71538391","author":{"steamid":"76561198067347816","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":11434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11408,"last_played":1595765043},"language":"english","review":"The entity has watched me make survivors squeal and suffer in my wake, as I Mori stab them multiple time while they are on the ground and hear their cries of agony and despair, begging to be rescued by their friends..
