The concept is amazing and has never been done before. It's as I say \"the only game in it's genre\". And it's also really fun! Sometimes.. More like never.. But when it's fun; it's like the best feeling in the world. You're really having the time of your life when things go your way and you feel like the game is fair (which is rarely the case). Sooo YEAH; onto the review!\n\nI can't even begin to explain how badly designed this game is, and worse of all is that the game encourages strategies that are boring for both sides. The killers are encouraged to target a single person making them unable to play the game and the survivors are encouraged to play selfish and let all the other teammates do the dirty work. \n\nThis review is probably going to sound like the most entitled survivor main review ever but believe me, I actually play killer (wow). I used to be a killer main and I have at least 200 hours on killer alone as of writing this. \n\nThere is this term in the Dead by Daylight community called \"tunneling\". What it means is that the killer targets a survivor with their \"tunnel vision\" and doesn't care about what's happening around them to just get the survivor killed as quickly as possible. As to why they are doing this is to make the game a 3v1 instead of a 4v1, but this is really not fun for the survivor playing. And one argument I often hear is that it's the teammates fault for not having the injured survivors back. While this is valid for some situations, I would say that this isn't the case 70 percent of the times. The other survivors can take hits and body-block the killer as much as they want but often times than not the killer doesn't care and just chases that survivor anyways. This is really unhealthy for the game and makes the players being tunneled really mad, and thus making the community extremely toxic. \n\nThe \"skill based matching-making\" added a few months isn't at all true to it's name. It's a lazy attempt at giving a player a number resembling their skill. The survivors objective is to; well, survive. So the developers thought that it was a good idea to make it so that if a survivor escapes their MMR goes up. On paper it sounds good, but if you think a few seconds more about it, you realize how shitty it actually is. It doesn't matter if the survivor looped the killer for the entirety of the game, it doesn't matter if the survivor completed all of the generators alone and it doesn't matter if the survivor healed and unhooked all of the other teammates constantly. If the player didn't escape the game just says: \"fuck you ,your bad\" and lowers your MMR. \n \nWhat's worse is that the developers do nothing to fix these issues either. It feels like the developers doesn't even care about their game and they can't take critique either. Not that long ago a streamer gave the developers critique about the skill based match-making explaining how it's bad and doesn't work to make such a simple solution to such a complex game. And how did the developers react to this critique, you ask? Well, they removed one of his in-game cosmetics. Yep, that childish move they made on a streamer because they didn't like what he was saying about their game. They gave him an email saying that he was breaking the guidelines of having the cosmetic. He wasn't even making fun of them, he was just giving them critique about how to fix this broken FUCKING game. \n\nThe perks withing the game are too a wreck. There are these perks you see in the game all the time because they are fucking cracked and then there are these perks that aren't seen AT ALL. Like when was the last time  you actually saw someone using Solidarity. I bet that most of the player base doesn't even know what it does. I sure as hell didn't before writing this. The better perks, the \"meta perks\" are the perks you see all the fucking time. I'm sick of having my game being ruined because of one single perk. I try to help my team as much as possible but with some of these perk I physically can't. In some situations you need to chose to either help the teammate and die yourself or just let them slowly die. The same is for killer too. Like what the hell are you supposed to do when you get BT:ed into DS then get the down, all survivors take a bunch of hits, the survivor downed has unbreakable, you get Soul Guarded then after that you get Dead Harded and last but definitely not least: you get a bunch of clickity clickies and shaking asses in your face at the exit gates as a form of taunt as to justify that your the worst player on the entire fucking planet. And you don't have to remind me in the endgame chat about how bad I am at the game because you did plenty with shoving your thick Jane ass in my face. \n\nSome of the killers are also really badly designed. A bunch of the new killers are just designed to make you run forward through the entirety of the game. Like if that is what you want with the game BHVR why not just remove pallets? Yeah sounds great doesn't it? Wouldn't actually be surprised if you did.. Okay maybe a little. Some of the killers greatest strategies are really boring for the opposite side, and in my opinion for the killer too (camping and tunneling). When I play killer I actually want to play the game and chase survivors, regress generators and use my game-knowledge to outsmart the other side. I don't want to stand in front of the hook liking the survivors feet and waiting for a survivor to come and rescue, which sometimes isn't even worth it for them because the time the killer wastes is more valuable. \n\nSo to summarize: this game has only one single good quality: the concept. The developers are absolute shit at making games, the game is badly designed. has a bad match-making system, a toxic community and really isn't fun most of the time. But it's fun sometimes so why not just dive head first down the rabbit hole that is Dead by Daylight and continue to play hundreds or even thousands of hours of the game.","timestamp_created":1573581743,"timestamp_updated":1646684270,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57057425","author":{"steamid":"76561198301983670","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1620202771},"language":"russian","review":"Страшно, весело, долго!","timestamp_created":1573581680,"timestamp_updated":1573581680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57057303","author":{"steamid":"76561198071318648","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":227717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204688,"last_played":1655587810},"language":"english","review":"I have played Dead by Daylight for 3400 hours at this point and have played off and on since launch. The game has had it's ups and downs, but right now it is on one of it's large downs. Don't get me wrong, when it's on it's ups it can be amazing, but this down has been happening since Clown's release last year and shows no sign of going back up. Legion got released in such a bad state and was completely broken for 3-4 months before it was fixed. This just highlights the level of priority that the devs give to balance changes. Spirit has been out for a year now and she is still broken and unfun to play vs. Nurse was running around with completely broken add ons and builds for the longest time too, although he add on update has made her not as brain dead as she was. \nMap generation and design are the things I think need to be changed a lot. It is completely up to RNG sometimes as to whether the game is survivor or killer sided. I've had plenty of maps as killer where 3 long wall jungle gyms spawn, usually next to other OP structures, namely Cow Tree and OP building windows like Coal Tower. Balanced Landing (BL) just highlights the other issues that come from map imbalance, since a survivor with BL can just run a killer around an OP window on a building for the whole game with little to no counterplay from the killer. Map design is a huge hindrance and the 5 different map designs for preschool did nothing to change the map in terms of good loops, since fence window can still cause a lot of grief if they run it correctly. There are also a lot of weird loops on the map, just random short ones that either do nothing to save you or need to be kicked, although the short ones are much more common, which isn't good either, since having a bunch of short pallet loops on the map will just make it a death sentence for survivors. \nI know the game is inherently hard to balance, but the way they have gone about waiting months and months to fix huge gameplay flaws makes it that much more unfun to play right now. Maybe this will change in a few months, but right now all of the gameplay issues are compounding and making the game incredibly unfun. If they take away dedicated servers, this might be helpful a little bit, but I think DBD has been going in a direction that I cannot agree with for a while now.\nAnd for reference, I probably have a 75/25 survivor/killer split, so if that makes you feel like my opinion is invalid for killer, do what you will.","timestamp_created":1573581520,"timestamp_updated":1573581520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57057266","author":{"steamid":"76561197994345366","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1968,"last_played":1612567589},"language":"english","review":"After learning how to play you get thrown into the game and get r4P3D By the Killer to start for the first few rounds.

I wait extra long times to get into a game. And then when I update my PC I still wait extraordinarily long for a game unless I'm a survivor and I get that stupid fucking error every time I play. Open the game Crash, Get into a game Crash, Repair a generator crash, unhook a player crash. It's relentless. I like this game and I want to play it, but if it's unplayable there should be a refund!\n\nThat's right a Refund.\n\nAfter an additional 63 hours after I fixed my graphics card, the gameplay was a little smoother, but the community was still toxic. I don't play killer very much anymore, due to the fact that I have to buy a good one. so I just use the regular ones in game and the one that I never was refunded for. \n\nIf this game wasn't so bad I would buy more DLC and have fun. But until they fix some of the killers powers / survivor perks to make the game a bit more fair, then the sacrificial items should cost less, because if you lose a game you still get say 6k blood points. you only will then get 1 rare or 2 common items for the next trial. And that's if you still have stuff available in the blood web.","timestamp_created":1573581476,"timestamp_updated":1598639379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57057152","author":{"steamid":"76561198007343670","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":66552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42855,"last_played":1651006639},"language":"dutch","review":"It
