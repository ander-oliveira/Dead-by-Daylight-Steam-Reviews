But I actually love it. It's tense, it's fun, and you can play with your friends or queue solo and have (in my opinion) just as much fun.\n\nOther reviews mention a toxic community. I haven't noticed it that much; there are a few survivors who like to tease you when you mess up, but that happens in literally every pvp game I've ever played. If you don't like the player comments at the end of a game, you can always close the chat box, but in general I don't think it's been an issue. \n\nAll in all, it is a great game and I'm very happy with my purchase :).","timestamp_created":1532651882,"timestamp_updated":1532651882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43767601","author":{"steamid":"76561198108072256","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":18757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10519,"last_played":1650048089},"language":"english","review":"Killer biased dev's nerfed survivors into the ground.

I picked it up mostly to fill the void in my heart that my one true love (Evolve) left when 2K savagely murdered it. \n\nI was blown away by how engaging the game is, despite how simple the premise is. Killers are fun and unique, and there's plenty of ways to play. Survivor is currently very strong (the large volume of negative reviews recently is because they took some minor nerfs, and apparently balancing the game so the power role (Killer) is actually strong is too much to ask) but can still be difficult to play. The controls are easy, but practice and experience really is the difference-maker in most cases. \n\nThe community can be a little toxic at times (see the current reviewbombing, the Nightmare on Elm Street reviewbombing, the OchiDO temporary ban reviewbombing, or just post-game chat screenshots). It can be a little discouraging at time to new players, because some experienced players like to prowl the lower ranks in hopes of pubstomping new players. Just try to ignore them. They exist in every game. Over time, you learn to appreciate salt as an indicator that you're doing something right. \n\nThe grind can be a little overwhelming, but it's not that bad. As you get the ball rolling it gets easier.\n\nOne more thing, people in this game complain a LOT. More than any game (includes LoL, Dota, CSGO, every toxic cesspit ever, etc) but there can be some good people out there. I've friended a lot of chill people through this game.\n\nPS, don't trust negative reviews of people with less than 50 hours.\n\nUPDATE: This is now an all-time favorite game. The grind seems bad at first, but it doesn't really stay that way. The game is a little more balanced now. It still has some way to go, but it's moving in the right direction. SWF (survive with friends) offers the easiest gameplay experience for survivors (by giving an unfair information advantage), but admittedly it is fun for most players, because you know you won't get screwed by a rando that has no idea what they're doing. \n\n9/10 game.","timestamp_created":1532645290,"timestamp_updated":1543095973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43766479","author":{"steamid":"76561198090519110","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":55219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2194,"last_played":1655634921},"language":"english","review":"game sucks","timestamp_created":1532645052,"timestamp_updated":1641252111,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504780113697052002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43766340","author":{"steamid":"76561198149545720","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":15456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10436,"last_played":1585951007},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun, but you need to keep your cool when you play. the game has many bugs and its not balanced, but you it is still a fun game and sometimes the bugs make you laugh. the game is not 100 but it is fun and i think if you rage easy then dont buy it, if you here to have fun and be a good sport BUY IT!!!

Jednak nic bardziej mylnego! Jest to tytuł warty zakupu, ponieważ nie jest to ten typ gry, który znudzi nam się po 20 minutach.\nWcielamy się w jednego z 4 ocalałych, którzy dzięki sile współpracy muszą przeżyć. W tym miejscu wkracza zabójca, którego celem jest... zabijanie. Wow. W rozgrywce zmierzymy się z prawdziwymi, myślącymi graczami, co dodaje pikanterii i potrafi sprawić, że rozgrywka staje się nieprzewidywalna.\nZasady są całkiem proste, a szczególnie jasne po przejściu samouczka. Ocalali muszą naprawić kilka generatorów aby otworzyć bramę wyjściową. Zabójca ma za zadanie im w tym przeszkodzić. Jedyne co musi zrobić, to złapać ich i powiesić na haku, aby uzyskać sympatię „Bytu” - istoty, ucieleśnienia zła, która panuje nad tym swego rodzaju uniwersum, w którym gra ma miejsce. \nMimo tej prostoty Dead by Daylight zachwyca swoim klimatem, świetnym wykonaniem map, postaciami i ich umiejętnościami, które niemalże idealne wpasowują się w miejsce akcji. Podczas naszej przygody mamy nawet możliwość walki jako znane postacie z klasycznych horrorów jak na przykład Freddy Krueger. Nie zabraknie również oryginalnych charakterów, takich jak: Trapper, zastawiający wszędzie pułapki na niedźwiedzie czy Widmo, który potrafi stać się niewidzialny. Każdy powinien znaleźć coś dla siebie i zapewniam, rzadko wystąpią sytuacje gdy będziemy się nudzić.\nJednakże, im bardziej wciągamy się w grę, tym łatwiej zauważamy jej wady. Tytuł niestety cierpi na brak odpowiedniego balansu. Wbrew pozorom, nie na korzyść  zabójców, a ich ofiar, czyli ocalałych. Balans w tej grze doprowadza wręcz do momentów, gdzie ci którzy powinni być słabsi, mogą wręcz dokuczać ich oprawcy. Na wyższych rangach osoby które preferują granie mordercami wręcz są zmuszeni do grania określonymi postaciami, tylko po to aby mieć chociaż cień szansy na wygraną.\nJednakże uważam, że ta gra ma potencjał na bycie bardziej zbalansowaną do tego stopnia, że przeżyje jeszcze przez kilka następnych lat. \nNa końcu wspomnę o zapewne jednej z lepszych możliwości, jaką jest gra ze znajomymi. Po zebraniu się w grupę pięcioosobową, lub, co ciekawsze, można grać mniejszą liczbą (Gra dostosowuje liczbę generatorów do liczby graczy), a nawet doprowadzić do sytuacji jeden na jednego. Możliwość zagrania w horror ze swoimi znajomymi sprawia niesamowitą frajdę po obu

04 / 2021 \n\nDead by Daylight hat immer noch zwei schwerwiegende Probleme:\n- Tryhard Survive with Friends\n- Rundenzeit zu kurz\n\nDas wirkt sich massiv auf das Gameplay aus und macht es manchmal als Killer schwer für alle eine gute Spielrunde zu bieten. Leider hat es das Team bisher nicht geschafft diese zwei Probleme kreativ zu beseitigen. Von Seiten der Community gibt es sicherlich hierzu genug und auch gute Vorschläge.\n\nAndererseits finde ich hat sich Vieles verbessert, grafisch und auch das neue HUD finde ich persönlich sehr gut. Trotz inzwischen vieler kosmetischer Produkte gibt es keinen direkten Zwang oder Vorteil.\n\nNeues Kapitel \"All-Kill\":\nIch bin kein Fan von Anime oder Manga und sicher auch kein Experte - aber es wirkte alles irgendwie \"Fehl am Platze\". Im Nachgang muss ich aber sagen, dass der neue Killer zwar nicht sehr stark ist, aber er wirklich ganz nette Mechaniken hat. Er spielt sich sehr flüssig und die Soundeffekte sind wirklich gut gelungen.","timestamp_created":1532632035,"timestamp_updated":1618074006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525268912315368652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43763275","author":{"steamid":"76561198083627057","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":63232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31425,"last_played":1593365036},"language":"polish","review":"Pretty good job so far...","timestamp_created":1532631850,"timestamp_updated":1555939286,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517647087574005127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43763263","author":{"steamid":"76561198061949260","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":113195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":67,"playtime_at_review":42096,"last_played":1660219356},"language":"english","review":"Best survival horror game you would ever play.","timestamp_created":1532631804,"timestamp_updated":1532631804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499950200319290161","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43763195","author":{"steamid":"76561198037549060","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":169587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41410,"last_played":1657909161},"language":"german","review":"Am Anfang fand ich das Spiel sehr interessant, und es machte teillweise Spaß, obwohl wir es mittlerweile \"Bug by Daylight\" nannten. Aber seit einiger Zeit wird es immer schlechter. Alle Verbesserungen dienen nur den Killern. Aber jetzt nach dem letzten Update ist das Spiel zum K*****!!!!!!! Es sei denn man spielt einen Killer z.B. den Billy. Dazu nehme man den Perk Tüftler und BBQ & Chili. Allein schon mit diesen Perks ist der Killer op. Aber soll ich Euch was sagen? Als Killer findet man kaum noch schnell eine Lobby, da kein Survivor mehr BOCK hat auf die gottverdammte S******. Man startet in einer Runde und man ist so gut wie tot. Man kann nur hoffen, dass der Killer einen nicht findet. Oh ich vergaß, mit BBQ & Chili weiß der Killer sowieso wo alle Survivor sind, wenn er jemanden hängt. Es ist echt schade um die Zeit und um das Geld, welches man investiert hat. Ich werde das Spiel nicht mehr spielen, bis die Macher endlich mal klar sehen und das Spiel wieder ausgleichen.","timestamp_created":1532631478,"timestamp_updated":1532631478,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50263136625289917","comment_count":19,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43763152","author":{"steamid":"76561198304180340","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":73673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46509,"last_played":1629238164},"language":"english","review":"Thanks devs!
