Play killer solo or queue up with 3 other friends or randoms as survivors. The only problem is that the game is bugged to shit. Getting stuck on random terrain, falling through the floor and floating are some of the bugs you may encounter. There are also exploits where killers can use survivor perks to reveal other survivors and harmless glitches like having a killer weapon (unusable) on a survivor. The matches are also killer hosted, so survivors are at the mercy of their internet connection. For some reason when playing survivor, the more people you are in queue with, the longer it takes to find a match, even though a 4 man queue who only needs a killer SHOULD be quick. There is also a bug where offerings aren't used up and can be endlessly spammed, game after game.

Reading some of the reviews it seems like this has been a problem for quite some time. \n\nIf you're thinking about buying this game, DO NOT, wait for Friday The 13th, it looks way more promising. I honestly regret purchasing this game at launch. I will not be supporting this game further or any other game the studio releases in the future.","timestamp_created":1485998716,"timestamp_updated":1485998716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29639594","author":{"steamid":"76561198355008062","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1510824479},"language":"schinese","review":"不错的游戏","timestamp_created":1485998143,"timestamp_updated":1485998143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506849288940429688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29639574","author":{"steamid":"76561198291416280","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13699,"last_played":1633161845},"language":"schinese","review":"黎明杀机，又名朴实农场主和四个偷电贼的故事。这是吸引我入steam的最大原因，游戏以一个第一人称的屠夫与四个第三人称的逃生者为始，斗智斗勇，各种挂钩子与溜屠夫。游戏可玩性很高，但也经常出现bug，好在能快速修复。不知不觉玩了近300小时了，希望游戏能越做越好。","timestamp_created":1485998056,"timestamp_updated":1485998056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53242337703704834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29639328","author":{"steamid":"76561198352891193","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1123,"last_played":1646742600},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然看到有很多的差评，反我个人觉得还是一款不错的游戏，我一般都是选择开黑语音的，基本上都有个小姐姐带我，感觉游戏氛围还可以，并没有许多玩家说的bug多的情况，可能我还只是个小萌新没发现吧，但我个人还是挺推荐这款游戏的，有一次就剩我一个没逃走被鬼抓到他居然把我背到出口。。。感觉这游戏氛围并没有许多玩家所说的那么差","timestamp_created":1485996642,"timestamp_updated":1485996642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510627806186676025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29639250","author":{"steamid":"76561198332835614","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1485926055},"language":"english","review":"I played aorund with this for less than an hour, primarily because I wanted to play with a friend and it would NOT work for anything.

Check the bottom for the updated parts. \n\nIf you read through the negative reviews for Dead by Daylight, you'll generally find two things: genuine complaints about the bugs, and people who simply aren't good at the game talking about how this Killer or that Survivor perk is \"broken\" or \"nerfed.\"\n\nLet's be real for a moment: Lots, and I mean lots, of people are just bad at this game. You'll see them, trust me. They either can't learn to work as a part of a team (or can't find others who try, which is only a real problem at the lower ranks with all the other newbies), or they don't have the stuff to take down a team on their own. \n\nSo, to start, don't pay attention to these particular complaints. They are made by people who, as the kids say, suck at either specific aspects of the game or the game as a whole.\n\nCONS:\n\nNow on to credible cons. The bugs, too often, render the game unplayable. I'm looking at you, loading screen bug. If you're like me and used to playing buggy games, this will be tolerable for you; I mean having to exit the game several times and reboot it is by no means an issue to people who make a habit of playing games in their alphas, we're almost surprised when we *don't* ever have to relaunch a game. If you don't like the waiting, you may struggle with this, and that would be a valid reason to avoid Dead by Daylight. Until such a time as the developers finally fix this issue (among others, of course), I expect and encourage a lot of complaining about the loading screen bug.\n\nSometimes, you'll get put in a lobby with someone either way above or way below your rank. It happens. You'll get butchered by a rank 4 Killer (who isn't really enjoying it either, mind you; you're too easy), and you'll make a far-too-easy getaway from a rank 19 Killer who hasn't yet learned how to look in the bushes. This is frustrating for everyone in the lobby, and you'll probably catch some flak for it if you were the one misplaced; the Survivors in particular (usually ranks 15-10, the ones who have gotten good at the game and are still in their angsty phase of play where they think everyone else sucks and should be told so) can be a salty bunch.\n\nMore often than you'll probably like, you'll get put in a lobby with an Old McDonald's WiFi Killer, and you'll lag badly enough that you'll either die because of it or be disconnected entirely. Yeah, it's frustrating, but that happens in any multiplayer game hosted by one of the players. Somehow, people seem to attribute this flaw to Dead by Daylight in particular, which is absurd. That being said, dedicated servers, should they ever become available for the game, would be fantastic, and that's the half of this complaint that is completely valid.\n\nPROS:\n\nNow that we've addressed the major cons of the game, let's look at some of the pros. The way the leveling system works, at its core, is that you gain points and ranks based on how many points you scored in a match. There's four ways for Survivors and four ways for Killers to get these points. That, on its own, is a fairly basic and simple system. The part of this system that makes the game great is *what* those ways to get points are. For example, as a Survivor, you gain points towards leveling by assisting, saving, or even just being near your fellow Survivors. You make progress in the game by helping each other; a seamlessly introduced method of encouraging players to stick together. As a Killer, you get points from using your chosen Killer's special power (chainsaw, short-range teleporting, etc.), meaning that you're inherently going to level up as certain Killers better than others; you do, in fact, make a special kind of progress by playing to your strengths. \n\nSpeaking of leveling, while your rank is static across all the different Survivors and all the different Killers, each specific member of each group is counted and leveled individually. This means that most of the time, a Jake Park player is a Jake Park player; that's who you're good at, that's who you play. It leaves room for diversity among players, because it's not as simple as \"this one does more damage, so naturally everyone plays him.\" There's no one Survivor or Killer that's better than the next, they're all unique in some way and they all play to different types of players' styles and tastes.\n\nFinally, as a horror game enthusiast, when I initially played Dead by Daylight, I found that the fear that accompanies hiding from a monster that isn't an AI, that is in fact another person, was far more satisfying than waiting for the programmed beastie to finish its programmed patrol and move on when I knew it was safe. You can't predict a Killer as easily as that, because it's not nearly as easy to know what they're doing. Are they really gone, or did they take a few steps away to wait for you to come out? Is he revving up that chainsaw because he actually did see you, or is he just trying to scare you out of hiding? Do you stay, or do you go? As I played on, of course, this fear eventually left me. But it didn't fade away; it transformed into strategy. I'm not playing a game trying to figure out the patterns of the AI monster, I'm trying to either outsmart and outrun or outsmart and run down another person. This dynamic may not be as prevelant at the lower ranks, which is natural given that at lower ranks players simply aren't as experienced, but should you stick to the game long enough, you'll find a unique kind of game that you're going to love just as much at rank 1 as you did at rank 20 if you're anything like me. \n\ntl;dr: If you can't handle bugs, waiting, and lag, this game probably isn't for you. If you're prone to outrage when someone's better at a game than you, this game probably isn't for you. If you can appreciate strategy, skill, and teamwork, this game is for you. \n\n8/10, do recommend.\n\nUPDATE: Dead by Daylight is an ever-growing, ever-changing game. And it's changed a lot since I started playing, and since I wrote this review. Lots of new killers and survivors, new maps, new perks, updates to the way things used to work... I won't get into specifics, but one thing you can definitely count on is that this game is not a stagnant one. It's still evolving, and it's still improving. The community, however, has overall gotten much saltier since last writing. That's something that can't really be helped by the developers or by other players; it just is. \n\nAll of this being said, I've found that the longer one plays Dead by Daylight, the *more* hooked one becomes. It's not a game where playing for the first 100 hours is the highlight, and it fades from attention after that. In fact, you don't even really begin to understand the game until you're much further in. At 171 hours, I know enough to stay alive and kill people a lot more efficiently than I used to, but I'm still a rookie compared to some of the people that play this game, with 500, 1,000, 3,000 hours logged. \n\nIf you're looking for a game that'll stick with you as long as you stick with it, this is the place to be.\n\nScore remains at 8/10.","timestamp_created":1485995598,"timestamp_updated":1511435064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509151458740234375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29638861","author":{"steamid":"76561198359413389","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3570,"last_played":1537620669},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏","timestamp_created":1485994210,"timestamp_updated":1485994210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29638847","author":{"steamid":"76561198040991477","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":2971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2554,"last_played":1531302795},"language":"english","review":"Balanced (no)","timestamp_created":1485994139,"timestamp_updated":1485994139,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446772128343582153","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29638197","author":{"steamid":"76561198266179013","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1471806899},"language":"english","review":"awesome game","timestamp_created":1485991291,"timestamp_updated":1485991291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29638191","author":{"steamid":"76561198345995768","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":47950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":75,"playtime_at_review":10732,"last_played":1660570801},"language":"schinese","review":"对新手玩家不友好。\n","timestamp_created":1485991260,"timestamp_updated":1485991260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549549520015716553","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29637983","author":{"steamid":"76561198029222786","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":25164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15402,"last_played":1518549978},"language":"koreana","review":"재미는 있는데 개쓰레기임 관리가. 이지안트치트 오류가 게임을 재설치해도 얼마안되서 뜨질않나.","timestamp_created":1485990320,"timestamp_updated":1493355952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29637845","author":{"steamid":"76561198127057589","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":70667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":236,"playtime_at_review":1390,"last_played":1659936042},"language":"english","review":"Changing my review because this game has become unbearable to play.\n\nUpdate: It's not that bad.","timestamp_created":1485989635,"timestamp_updated":1657149272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29637738","author":{"steamid":"76561198053744245","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":344207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1880,"playtime_at_review":38836,"last_played":1660516329},"language":"english","review":"Game is very fun to play with friends.

The majority of matches now launch without issue and for several weeks I haven't had to kill the game process in order to play.\n\nWith that said, the game itself is fantastic. It's entirely objective based. There is no way to avoid the objectives and this leads to teamwork in 9/10 matches. The changes being brought to the game sometimes don't sit well with me, but they are balance fixes and so it is perfectly valid I may not agree with all of them. Many changes they make improve the gameplay and negate cheese tactics. Just recently they changed the game to prevent the Trapper (a killer) from placing his traps underneath hooks. They also made it so that hooks which have been sabotaged respawn.\n\nAs someone who plays survivor almost exclusively, I agree with one of them as it is beneficial for me, but I completely respect their decision on both of them - I can only imagine the frustration that killers must go through when they only have a small set of hooks left which could be located on the other side of the map.\n\nHow would I compare this to other games on the market? It's become one of my most-played. It's fun for the sake of being fun. There's progression, but it isn't such that you NEED to be a high level to be able to compete. It's beneficial, but even a completely new player could jump in and have a chance of winning.\n\n\n** ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW **\nThe massive bugs with failed match loading, and being stuck unable to join a lobby or go back to the main screen let down what would otherwise be a fantastic game.

Постоянно кидает в команды с 1 рангом хотя я играю еще только 3 день, просто потрясающе интересно играть без перков против фул вкаченого маньяка с \"эбеновым мементо мори\". Ну ладно допустим вы решили раз так много багов за выживших что не возможно нормально играть, сыграю тогда за маньяка... ага удачи, вас бросит против команды из 1 ранговых персонажей которые сидят в скайпе и общаются, у вас нет ни одной пассивки, а у них полный набор топовых пассивок со всех персонажей...\nВ общем мое мнение что игра без багов заслужтвает 4 из 5, не пять потому что все таки довольно однообразно и скоро надоест, но так как в игре полно багов из за которых практически не реально играть за выживших, плюс отстойная система подбора команды с закидыванием вас к 1 рангам, игра не заслуживает больше чес 2 из 5. В оьщем для мазохистов желающих помучить себя багами советую, а остальные пусть придержат деньги если баги не пофиксят то игра не достойна внимания","timestamp_created":1485981550,"timestamp_updated":1485981550,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515528023242950439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29635692","author":{"steamid":"76561198068645498","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":20978,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1172,"last_played":1658700862},"language":"english","review":"spoop","timestamp_created":1485981428,"timestamp_updated":1485981428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475162297487258911","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29635639","author":{"steamid":"76561198112208999","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1485980842},"language":"spanish","review":"-Mal optimizado\n-Algunos bugs\n-Repetitivo\n-Sin terminar\n-Graficos bastante malos\n-Dlcs\n-Dificil de entender como se juega al principio","timestamp_created":1485981207,"timestamp_updated":1485992712,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29635564","author":{"steamid":"76561198200658823","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":8335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1304,"last_played":1642221027},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что сказать ,игра заеб*сь ,но Фредди Крюгер это п*зд*ц имба","timestamp_created":1485980961,"timestamp_updated":1512385955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470140844583511353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29635445","author":{"steamid":"76561198178966755","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1485961294},"language":"turkish","review":"optimizayson=0\nfps drop=var\nsürüsüne bereket bug=var\noyun  zevki=%20\n","timestamp_created":1485980504,"timestamp_updated":1485980504,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29635233","author":{"steamid":"76561198364090451","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1615499336},"language":"german","review":"gut diese","timestamp_created":1485979727,"timestamp_updated":1485979727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510548532009124756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29635138","author":{"steamid":"76561198118085194","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":22158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":7303,"last_played":1660589189},"language":"czech","review":"Super hra na zabavení :) 8/10 :) pár chyb se najde, ale která hra je nemá, že ?

раз мне приснился сон, где я очутился в лесу. В руках у меня был фонарь. Было как раз темно, и я захотел хоть что-нибудь увидеть. Но он почему-то не включался. И вообще он у меня застрял в руках. Что за чертовщина? Ладно, рядом стоял генератор и ящик с инструментами. Взяв второе и оставив фонарик, я принялся чинить первое. Перед моим ебалом вылез скилл чек, и я нажал по инерции на несуществующий пробел. Я попал на белую полоску, но что же я вижу - сломал! Я бегу со всех ног, но я не слышу сердцебиения. И тут из-за угла вылетает Майкл с бензопилой, перед этим взлетев на кочке и перелетев через всю карту. Я начал от него бежать, и решил скинуть на него доску. Но когда я ее скинул, я не переместился вперед, а остался на прежнем месте, и Он меня ударил. Мне было больно, но я терпел. Я оббежал его, и продолжал бегать вокруг препятствий. И вдруг я проваливаюсь под землю и застреваю там! Какого хрена? Я пытаюсь вылезти, но бесполезно, и маньяк меня бьёт. Ну всё, конец. Но почему он меня не подбирает? И постоянно уводит свой взгляд прямо, хотя совсем недавно на меня смотрел? Что за чушь? Ладно, попытаюсь от него уползти, может тут уже открыт люк. Но тут он меня берет, и несет к крюку. Эй, а почему я выбраться не могу? Где кнопки? ЭЙ, Я ХОЧУ ВЫБРАТЬСЯ!!! ОТПУСТИ МЕНЯ, ТУПАЯ МРАЗ-. Повесил. Все, теперь точно конец. Лапы Энтити протыкают мое тело. Я чувствую невыносимую боль, и меня утягивает наверх. Крюк сломался, и... Я смотрю на него. И ничего не происходит. Просто сломанный крюк. Он бегает в недоумении вокруг крюка. Почему не заканчивается этот ужас? Почему я должен теперь смотреть на этот крюк? Как отсюда нахрен ливнуть?
