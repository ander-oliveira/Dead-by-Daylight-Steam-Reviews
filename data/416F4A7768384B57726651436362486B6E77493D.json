have played Dead by Daylight for 2,098 hours. That's about 4 months of playtime in the game, which is honestly sad, but no regrets right. This game is definitely worth it, my favorite game, despite how much I hate it at times. If you are looking on playing this game, don't expect it to be fair. Sadly, it's virtually impossible to make a game fair when the teams aren't equal. Take overwatch for example, Both teams are completely equal in opportunity and ability, meaning no team has an advantage going into the game. The same doesn't apply to Dead by Daylight, as good survivors will destroy any killer, and a good killer will destroy any survivors. Personally, I believe the game is very survivor sided, and while killers may win more, this is because in a typical survivor game, even in the best of ranks, one or two players weigh the entire team down and lose the game for them. It is for this reason that I do not play survivor as much. I have 2098 hours, again, and I have not yet gotten to rank 1 as survivor. You might just think it's because I play killer a lot, but no. I play very well as survivor, to be honest. I can carry the game for my other survivors or take advantage of a weak killer at will, obviously this comes with playtime. When I'm playing in my rank 10 games (Rank I am currently at) I often find my other teammates are not as good as me ( I wouldn't expect them to be, at rank 10) and they often throw the game and give the killer a big advantage. Instead of playing on like I should, I normally give up at this time once the game is lost already and I can't possibly win. If I kept playing on every time this happened, I would be rank 1 by now. But I do not enjoy playing a game that is impossible for me to win. Why play on if my only objective is obsolete anyways? Despite this, I still play survivor and killer, and I find killer a lot more fun. This game is definitely worth the money.

There is an incredibly steep learning curve--I could only really get into it with weeks of hand-holding by a friend.\n\nThe fundamental issue with this game is the sheer number of traits and perks each character might have: you cannot possibly know them, let alone anticipate them. Inevitably, you will be incredibly frustrated. Some character perks are downright overpowered, such as \"BBQ & Chili\" to know precisely where all survivors are.\n\nA massive frustration of the game is waiting for matchmaking. This sometimes takes up to 10 minutes, but more often around 5 minutes. Set your expectations as this is not a game to play a quick round.\n\nSome game elements are so poorly balanced, that it seems like only the game developers never play survivors:\n- Killers can see the location of all of the hooks when carrying a survivor, which makes attempting to escape by wiggling simply an exercise in getting RSI. Furthermore, hooks are placed so close to one another, that even if you're willing to risk getting tendinosis in wiggling, it's extremely unlikely you will be able.\n- Sabotaging hooks is pointless, because it takes requires a dedicated add-on to perform, a considerable amount of time to do and it only lasts for 30(!!) seconds.\n- Keys are now useless because they can only be used to reopen a closed hatch in the so-called \"end-game\" state.\n- Killers can hit survivors through windows at a considerable distance.\n- There's an imbalance between add-ons that enhance killers' abilities versus those that enhance survivors' abilities, in particular regarding the performance of a toolkit.\n- Some killers have skills that can be exploited, such as The Trapper, who can place traps on the top of stairs in such a way that survivors cannot disarm them; by placing a trap at the top of the basement stairs, survivors that escape the hook cannot leave the basement. The Trickster can combine skills such that they have 44 knives that incur damage to survivors even when missed, effectively making it impossible for a survivor to avoid immediately entering the dying state when discovered.\n- Survivors often have to do more than just generators, for instance wander the map to find ONE hex totem that is causing the round to be unwinnable due to rapid regression.\n- Not knowing what to anticipate in the round will invariably result in you feeling \"cheated\" out of a win, only to discover after the match that the killer had some absurd perk that effectively made the game unwinnable.\n\nAll in all, the goal of the game appears to be for the satisfaction of playing the killer, as it seems that the developers see any game outcome where all four survivors aren't killed to be a loss.\n\nBear in mind that the game elements require a high level of dexterity and may not be suitable for all players.\n\nI must also point out that the graphics and hit boxes are reminiscent of a early 2000's game.\n\nNew content is regularly added, but the 30+ GB updates are completely unoptimized and take ages to patch.\n\nIf after all this, you are nevertheless interested in buying it--wait. It is often in discount. Watch some gameplay videos before investing time since, as stated, it has an extremely difficult learning curve, bearing in mind how many different combinations of character traits, perks, items, add-ons and offerings there are.","timestamp_created":1599260828,"timestamp_updated":1657414982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75453057","author":{"steamid":"76561198069007438","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":30646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1432,"last_played":1648994409},"language":"german","review":"Not boring at all :)","timestamp_created":1599260611,"timestamp_updated":1599260611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75452884","author":{"steamid":"76561198873634720","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1654441813},"language":"russian","review":"очень увлекательно , разрабатывает реакцию, обучает стелсу, повышает внимательность!","timestamp_created":1599260354,"timestamp_updated":1599260354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75452257","author":{"steamid":"76561199022711005","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":84,"playtime_at_review":3103,"last_played":1660599289},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games so It's def worth buying.

I don't know why or how but I start repairing it. My heart beat pounds within my chest. A strange man appears from the shadows wearing a mask and hits me with something sharp. I yell out in pain and run for my life. I vault windows and drop pallets on my relentless pursuer. But despite my best efforts I end up cornered. I can hear fast approaching footsteps, they almost sound excited with anticipation. With nowhere left to go I jump into a locker. The man passes me by and I think I'm safe, but then manic eyes gaze into my own through a slit in the locker. I try to move, I try to scream, but it all happens in slow motion, and the next thing I know I'm being carried and thrown on a hook. I scream until someone rescues me and I run with them. But then the manic sadist reappears and I get separated from my rescuer. The pursuer follows me, getting closer as I run out of breathe, almost exhausted. I hear the sound of metal hitting concrete as I throw the last of my strength into vaulting a window. I gaze behind me, thinking my pursuer will surely follow, but the sadist just watches me as I stagger between two tall posts and escape into the night.","timestamp_created":1599244873,"timestamp_updated":1599244873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":235,"votes_funny":77,"weighted_vote_score":"0.819219410419464111","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75441835","author":{"steamid":"76561199060447938","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2014,"last_played":1653585015},"language":"russian","review":"c кайфом","timestamp_created":1599244684,"timestamp_updated":1608391150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75441791","author":{"steamid":"76561198964369190","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7854,"last_played":1658936371},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel macht sehr viel Spaß, aber die Entwickler müssen unbedingt den Doktor, den Henker und den Todesboten Nerfen.\nSchaue dir mal die Fähigkeiten von Legion an und dann vergleiche sie mit den Fähigkeiten vom Dokter etz.","timestamp_created":1599244619,"timestamp_updated":1599244619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502447009086608887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75441541","author":{"steamid":"76561198138702005","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":3899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":996,"last_played":1647462000},"language":"portuguese","review":"yah","timestamp_created":1599244330,"timestamp_updated":1599244330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75440913","author":{"steamid":"76561198239522622","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3957,"last_played":1607029630},"language":"english","review":"Still quite a few bugs, and matchmaking is a bit broken, but over all this is a fun game to play.

But I highly recommend this game.\n\nI stand by my recommendation for this game, however, I was banned by EAC. I accidentally left the game running while I was doing my computer science work, and the programs I use are against EAC policy. But what this experience taught me was that Behaviour actually cares about their players. They were quick to reply and helped me wherever they could. EAC on the other hand has refused to even respond to my, or my friends, many emails to them about the ban. Just be mindful about what you open when the game is launched and you shouldn't have a problem, but if EAC bans you, then you have to either rebuy the game like me, or you will be unable to play the game again.","timestamp_created":1599243686,"timestamp_updated":1606682599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh8KWrfQCcbHknwI="}
