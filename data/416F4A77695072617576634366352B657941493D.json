Although my opinion of the game is much more complicated and nuanced than a 'thumbs up', I feel like, at the end of the day, I would still recommend this game to anyone looking to either have some casual fun or possibly some competitive fun (with caveats). \n\nGenerally I think the less seriously you take this game, the more fun you will have, but in the case you find yourself intrigued by the seemingly deep mechanics and want to get better and achieve an understanding of it's complexity, the game becomes much more frustrating as it's flaws become glaring. Still doesn't detract from the fun factor of it all in my opinion, but yeah. This game makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes.

Es ist ziemlich simpel; um effektiv zu spielen, muss man nicht viel Zeit investieren (wie bei z.B. Lol). Es gibt aber ein recht hohes Skill Ceiling, also langweilig wird es nicht so schnell. Die große Anzahl Killer macht jedes Spiel etwas verschieden - erst nach laanger Zeit im Spiel (1.000h) verläuft sich das etwas und es wird vorhesehbar - und die große Anzahl Perks gibt individuelle Möglichkeiten, den Spilstil zu verändern bzw. die andere Seite zu überraschen. BHVR arbeitet auch daran, die Perks weniger redundant und wirkungsvoller zu gestalten (genauso, wie andere Aspekte des Spiel).\nDas Spiel ist nicht sehr für Competitive geeignet, weil die Killer zu unterschiedlich sind, um gut verglichen zu werden. Einzelne Perks machen auch einen großen Unterschied und viel hängt auch von Glück ab. Es ist mehr wie Among Us, das man zum Spaß spielt, nicht wie League oder ein Shooter, wo Perfektion konsistente Siege einbringt.\n\nAnmerkungen eineinhalb Jahre später: Nach einem halben Jahr Pause spiele ich das Spiel wieder sehr intensiv. Das Spiel entwickelt sich noch weiter fort von einem Horror-Spiel zu einem reinen Action-Spiel. Gerade nach dem letzten Perk-Update habe ich das Gefühl, dass nurnoch Chases entscheiden.\nImmer mehr Content (Killer, Perks) bedeuten immer mehr Fähigkeiten-Counter-Beziehungen, wodurch Counter seltener nützlich sind. Bestes Beispiel: Das neue Perk 'Shattered Hope' countert die neuen Boon-Totems, die Ergebnis der neuen Boon-Perks sind. Shattered Hope ist aber nur dann nützlich, wenn die Survivor Boon-Perks dabei haben. Das weiß man vorher aber nicht, daher ist Shattered Hope quasi nutzlos.\nMehr Content heißt auch, dass man immer auf dem Laufenden bleiben muss. Es gibt mittlerweile so viele Perks und Killer, dass ich den Überblick verliere (weil ich einfach spielen will) und mich wie bei League fühle. Ich meine auch einen Power-Creep zu bemerken. Wraith hat noch eine krass simple Fähigkeit: Unsichtbarkeit an, aus. Onryo hat was Ähnliches: Manifestieren, Demanifestieren. Aber dann noch Teleportation zu Fernsehern. Das kann man verhindern, indem man Videokassetten von A nach B bringt. Und dann hat sie noch die Maß für jeden Survivor, dass wenn es voll ist, ihr erlaubt, Survivor zu Morin (Tötungsanimation). Da es so viele Killer gibt, habe ich bisher nur 2 mal oder so gegen sie gespielt und mehr Schwierigkeiten, mit ihrer Power klarzukommen, als mit dem Skill des Spielers.\n\nInsgesamt macht mir das Spiel noch sehr viel Spaß. Aber die Richtung, in die es sich entwickelt, ist nicht meine. Es braucht halt einfach nicht immer mehr.","timestamp_created":1612613001,"timestamp_updated":1658601725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634806275367736816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86066503","author":{"steamid":"76561198389240584","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":19160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":1520,"last_played":1659632956},"language":"german","review":"Yeah

И вроде бы сбежать становится чуточку сложнее, но на первый план здесь выходят другие переменные... Почти с ходу вас с распростертыми объятьями встретит токсичное комьюнити и нежно почешет крюком преследователь, напоследок долго пожирая глазами и как бы намекая, что легко не будет. Нередко, провисев положенные стадии и отправившись по месту прописки, обнаружите, что вашим рандомным камрадам в общем-то всё равно на вас - надо выполнять ритуалы, архивы, зарабатывать очки крови и приседать за палетками (а если вдруг поймали после этого, то ливать из игры). После катки полпати вероятно будет грешить на баланс игры или гореть и плевать ядовитой слюной в маньяка, который в общем-то делал свою работу и был плохим мальчиком/девочкой.\nРанги - вовсе не показатель хорошей игры. Нередко это вопрос подбора команды и удачи, нежели опыта, который, кстати, приходит только с практикой, наигранными часами и личным порогом вхождения в игру. К слову, спустя 300 часов игры, добравшись до 3 ранга выжившего, я так и не научилась мансить :3\nЛучший способ избежать определенного негатива - играть своей компанией (против рандомного маньяка или в свою игру). Выживание с друзьями здорово влияет на процесс, особенно если вам важен не побег, а возможность провести время вместе за активной игрой с элементами хоррора. Если победа не важна, то и гореть незачем. А уж вместе развиваться и расти - вообще сплошное удовольствие. \nСтоит заметить, что из аналогичных кооперативных игр, с частыми обновлениями контента и ненавязчивым геймплеем, лучше пока ничего нет, а то, что есть - либо ещё больше забагованно, либо быстро надоедает, либо ещё что-то. В любом случае, игра стоит свеч, особенно если брать DBD по скидке.\nДо встречи в тумане!","timestamp_created":1612605290,"timestamp_updated":1612605290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":47,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.763480484485626221","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86060640","author":{"steamid":"76561199111742507","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9031,"last_played":1656360032},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра, топ пробития, отличный античит.
