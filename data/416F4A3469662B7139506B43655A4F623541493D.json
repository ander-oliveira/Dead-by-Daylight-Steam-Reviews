But when hearing Nemesis was going to be added to the roster of Killers, then I was quite excited to give this game a try. Unfortunately, over the 18 hours I've played, I'm so far not enjoying this experience. \n\nI've talked to a few friends who have hundreds of hours on this game, and I can probably put together that this game is just not friendly to new players. Especially people looking to play killers.\n\nPerks are everything in this game. Apparently some of my friends told me that this game is poorly balanced, and perks are just added to fix the balancing rather than fixing the issue itself, but I am not that deep into the game yet. So far, my experience as a killer main is negative. I played survivor too, but that was even worse.\n\nIn my honest opinion, this game isn't about enjoying yourself. It's about using what's optimal. If you aren't using the perks you need, you aren't going to be having much fun. And to unlock those perks you have to grind. I wanted to get the perk Barbecue and Chili for Pyramid head, however, I have to play Leatherface. And I hate playing him. I'm forced to play a killer I do not enjoy just to make a killer that I do enjoy more viable. That's the problem for me. I'm not having fun because in order to have fun, I need the right perks. But to get the right perks, I have to grind bloodpoints for killers that I hate playing. \n\nThis game's community though, is far more toxic than I have ever seen. Christ almighty it makes COD look like the friendship club. Almost every single game, no one is civil, everyone whines and complains that I used this tactic or that tactic. All in all, if you don't have a regular group of pals to play together with, avoid this game. \n\nI'd offer up alternatives but uh...this game is kind of unique, and it's the best mechanically out of other asymmetrical games. I've spent hundreds of hours on Predator Hunting Grounds and Friday the 13th, but the former is just jank, and the other is a dead game. Funny enough made by the same people.","timestamp_created":1623150249,"timestamp_updated":1623150249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93402546","author":{"steamid":"76561198803573108","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":30092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1653595524},"language":"russian","review":"имба,стоит своих денег!","timestamp_created":1623150205,"timestamp_updated":1638311059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93402366","author":{"steamid":"76561198416053780","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1643673076},"language":"brazilian","review":"MUITO BRABO","timestamp_created":1623149839,"timestamp_updated":1623149839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93402153","author":{"steamid":"76561198977233347","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":111997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62712,"last_played":1658684529},"language":"russian","review":"Игра кажется классной первое время но потом, примерно через 500 часов тебе надоедает чинить генераторы или вешать на кукан сурвов.

would recommend this game but its a difficult one to get into? the community has basically a code of unwritten rules your suppose to abide by if you play killer or survivor and if you don't they become extremely toxic towards you and are SUPER unfriendly and not helpful to new members of the community in any regard. \n\nthat being said if you can get past the initial hurtle of toxic players and lack of knowledge the game can be incredibly fun and rewarding its one of those games you should keep on the back burner maybe learn through live streams and youtube videos before you buy it; get it comes on sale or maybe exclusively play with friends to avoid getting stressed out by the horrid cesspool of angry little goblins that meta game on this.\n\nthe premise and concept is simple and fun you play as ethir a serial killer trying to kill everyone 2 hits to a down 3 downed hooks to a kill; or as a survivor trying to evade the killer repair generators and leave the map via the two exits or if everyone dies a third hidden exit called hatch. has a ton of trade marked killers with plenty of play styles and a ton of survivors with a variety of perks as well as maps are semi randomly generated so no game ever feels the same and if your a skin junky like me has a ton of cosmetics to please that side of things as

survivah, survivah stopid.\nkillah stopid too if trusted survivah.\nkillah and survivah Quad love, but take geam tooo seriuis then game look stopid.\n\nedit: 6 months after owning - my word are people sweaty and extremely toxic once you get passed those early ranks, what id give to go back to the days where i could chase/be chased without the overwhelming pressure of the fact in 4 to 5 minutes the game will be over, being in the trail is all so fun for both killer and survivor, gone are the days of treating each trail like enjoyable game play, hello to the days of every single match being a competition to see which side can end the game in their favour quicker, i still love this game but so unfortunate about the community, i play this game for fun and it is very fun, its not at all fun when people act like they could go pro in a fuckin asymmetric pvp horror of all things just because they watched a few \"bulling the killer\" or \"ez 4k\" videos and think they're gods gift, its not that deep bro, hop on the game, have some fun,  don't be mad and don't take it too seriously.\nall in all the community is a real let down but the game is still close to my heart.\n\n\nedit 2: 1+ year of owning.\nkill me... unfortunately since my last edit, the community has only become more toxic, mostly perpetuated by survivors who feel entitled to win or have a \"fair chance\" every game, presumably because their mother never told them \"no\"\nwhen i have to play on the same team as these people who complain to the killer like a Karen to a manager, i feel a huge amount of second hand embarrassment, the killer isn't entitled to give you anything, the killer isn't some sort of pawn for you fun or entertainment, the killer is also there the play the game in the way they want to play it, nothing should stop them from doing so, so stfu about \"face camping\" \"proxy camping\" \"tunneling\" \"using noed\"\nand more power too the killers who don't cave in at the abuse by some entitled players of this game which brings me on to my second problem.\n\nTwitch streamers: Over the course of a year or so of playing, ive bumped into many streamers, some more prominent than others but the vast majority of streamers i have played against while im killer have one major thing in common, a general hatred for their fellow players, especially those who choose to play killer.\nfor example: i was playing bubba (my main) with the perks: BBQ & chili, ruin, mad grit and agitation (semi meme build, still not at all meta) with no add ons\nit came to my attention very early in a match on haddonfield i was playing against a 4 piece, who all happened to be streaming together, long story short, i got to a point where there were two survivors left and 1 gen remaining, they effectively 3 genned themselves in a corner of the map, after downing and slugging (the act of leaving a survivor down in order to chase another survivor/secure a 4k) i chased the remaining standing survivor and hooked them, i then returned to the player i first downed and dropped them on hatch, when i arrived at the endgame screen i went through my usual procedure of saying \"gg wp, gl in your next game, you guys were fun to go against\" before i could finish my sentence i had all forms of abuse and hackusations coming my way, the conversation continued for until we timed out on the endgame screen, so i went to visit their twitch channel and to my surprise they had a rather decent following, i introduced myself in chat and she absolutely let off a barrage of abuse, making comments on my sex life, mother, father, financial situation, despite knowing anything about me, making wild assumptions based on \"the way i played\" now i found this all quite amusing since she was a rather large effeminate woman who appeared to be disguised as a 3rd rate carnival clown, looking past that i assured her my sex life, family life, and financial situation were in rather good health and i proceeded to question her on why she is so upset about the game to which she stuttered and slurred out the words \"Well you used scummy tactics to down me at the end to get your kills\" (clearly ignoring the fact i gave hatch to who i thought was the best player) the scummy tactic i think she is referring to is the slugging\nANYWAYS after looking back on the VOD (which has since been removed, i wonder why) she actually pulled up my steam profile (but didn't show it to the stream) and then said the words \"WOW HE PLAYS LIKE THAT AND HAS 5000 HOURS\"......... now even to this day i haven't even racked up a fifth of what shes proposing i have, she lied to her audience and even worse, she is perpetuating the disgusting \"i cant be wrong and i need to win always\" attitude that plagues this game.\nshes not the only example i have of streamers openly acting in this way, unfortunately its common place, we all know dead by daylight has a huge following on twitch, so its no surprise that almost every match or two you will come across a survivor either against you or on your team who will complain and attempt to berate the killer for not playing by their certified \"fair chance, no scum, cuddles and kisses only\" rule book.\n\nfuck the people who make this game all about them, fuck the people who play it to give people a hard time for enjoying the game how they wish to play it, fuck the people who think everyone is part of their competition, SOME OF US ARE PLAYING IT TO HAVE FUN.\n\n\nanyway yeah cool game, buy

Definitely recommend if you're willing to commit to the game.","timestamp_created":1623111301,"timestamp_updated":1623111301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93381291","author":{"steamid":"76561199062651727","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":241,"playtime_at_review":1133,"last_played":1660192551},"language":"english","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1623110570,"timestamp_updated":1623110570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93381262","author":{"steamid":"76561198336384020","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2405,"last_played":1658880229},"language":"english","review":"so I said bruh and i won\n","timestamp_created":1623110524,"timestamp_updated":1623110524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93380129","author":{"steamid":"76561199175876878","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":4074,"last_played":1659923826},"language":"english","review":"Very very fun game. Its a liitle hard when youre first starting out but you willl get the hang of it. I recomend to watch youtube videos if you are having a hard time getting the hang of it. it is worth evvery penny i spent on this game and there is a lot of content. No two games will ever be the same so its diffrent every time, the wide range of surviors and killers are fun to play. i recommend this game one thousand percent.","timestamp_created":1623108469,"timestamp_updated":1623108469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93380036","author":{"steamid":"76561198275971011","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":11610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3394,"last_played":1629997766},"language":"spanish","review":"buenardo","timestamp_created":1623108285,"timestamp_updated":1623108285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93379950","author":{"steamid":"76561199166919055","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":79558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1209,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1660603699},"language":"russian","review":"🤔","timestamp_created":1623108108,"timestamp_updated":1623108108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93379608","author":{"steamid":"76561199158883127","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":5231,"last_played":1660462828},"language":"spanish","review":"añañañ ñañañ ña","timestamp_created":1623107514,"timestamp_updated":1623107514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93379490","author":{"steamid":"76561198848652839","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6160,"last_played":1655685336},"language":"spanish","review":"ta ien","timestamp_created":1623107308,"timestamp_updated":1623107308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93379165","author":{"steamid":"76561198874680482","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1641420626},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP","timestamp_created":1623106726,"timestamp_updated":1623106726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93378873","author":{"steamid":"76561198449449344","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1623405552},"language":"english","review":"tunneling,NOED,basement-POG","timestamp_created":1623106255,"timestamp_updated":1623106255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502923965454101563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4if+q9PkCeZOb5AI="}
