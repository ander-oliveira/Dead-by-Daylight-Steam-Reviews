So why is this review negative? \n\nWell, you can look at the trends and see that the game is now \"Mixed\" on it's reviews with the most recent patch. That is partially why I'm switching  my review, but it's not the entire thing. Just to start on that note though, I haven't played this game in perhaps about a month, came back to this patch, and...wow. It is an absolute mess. It's buggy, there is an EXTREME desync issue at the moment that is causing hits to connect even when the killer looks very distant, the animations are very wonky, and...plenty of other things. So if you are planning on playing the game it really isn't the time.\n\nBut let me give a rundown of why my review is negative now. Some points are directed to the most recent patch, and others aren't. \n\n1. [b] Developers do not listen [/b] \nI'm not even going to touch on balance. I used to just excuse it by saying the devs are perhaps not that good at their own game, it's fine. This IS related to the most recent patch. The UI update and clunky animations got such an insane amount of criticism, but was still released. Why? Fix it, change it, do SOMETHING. But no, not a single change. What was even the point of allowing players to join a beta to test it?  They didn't listen to any feedback at all. Then they add a bunch of things that NO ONE has asked for. They have redone the flashlight-animation so many times, for no reason. And that's something that has actually affected gameplay; people get caught off-guard because suddenly, you have to aim the light differently. Why are they fucking around with such a trivial thing that was perfectly fine before? I have absolutely no fucking clue. There's plenty of more examples, but the shitshow that this patch was that has led to the game being review-bombed should be enough for you.\n\n2. [b] Repetition [/b] \nI have told my friends for the longest time, DbD isn't really a good game in my opinion. It's a game with tons of potential. But now that I'm writing this years later, This game is a game that has been in a state of \"has potential to be good\" for YEARS. There's been some good updates, but so many more bad updates. Events are stale and boring, and somehow got even worse throughout the years, to the point that they had to apologize for their shitty Halloween event. A SHITTY HALLOWEEN EVENT, IN A HORROR GAME. The game is overly grindy at this point, there has been a content drought...the last content drop was an unfinished chapter (some of the perks just didn't work and the changes to the killer that they said would come out, didn't come with the final product). Even the cosmetics are  becoming super repetitive and uncreative. I used to LOVE the games skins, but they're all extremely samey now. The core gameplay has not changed, a new objective has never been added, there has never been a new game mode. \n\n3. [b] Community, and how they affect gameplay [/b] \nThis is my BIGGEST complaint, and will probably be the largest part of the review. \nI never thought that criticizing the COMMUNITY would be the worst offender in a negative review of a game, but here I am. The problem is, community actually affects gameplay here.\n\nI will not call anything toxic if it actually helps the player win the game. The amount of people in this game who will legitimately throw their chances of what is considered a \"win condition\" JUST to ruin your game is absolutely absurd. The god-awful Us vs. Them mentality present in the community manages to lead to awful interactions with other players of the game. If you caught me after just playing the game, I'd feel enticed to drop a hundred anecdotes here, but it'll just be pointless and perhaps I'd come off as just someone who is salty, so let me just give context, and then sum up the majority of what your experience will be on the game. \n\nI have 3k hours on this game, where I have played plenty of killer, and plenty of survivor. I've mained one side over the other at various points, but, for most of my experience, I was a 50/50 player. I don't ever teabag the killer, I almost never BM, I do my best not to camp. \n\nDespite this, and no matter how \"righteously\" you play, you will be flamed, you will be blamed, you will be accused of BMing, you will be targeted throughout multiple matches, and the player will still not be banned. \n\"But that's just par for the course for any online multiplayer game!\" \nIt is, but DbD is a game where another player can heavily affect your gaming experience. Not just flame you or say mean things until you mute them. This is more true for the survivor side, because a killer has s degree of control of your experience where they can legitimately lock you out of gameplay until you die. Yes, I'm referring to camping, and, survivors have other ways to be obnoxious, but the problem with survivors usually goes to entitlement regarding post-match flaming.\n\"But wait, that's not a META thing to do. Other survivors can just escape. Killers can close chat. Whatever.\"\nThat's the whole ass problem. When you play Dead by Daylight, the goal of the majority of players at this point is to RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE, not play the game, not achieve the \"win condition\" of ranking up. Whatever. People will go absolutely out of their way just to ruin someone else's experience, even at the expense of their own. And while camping is an example specific to killers, there are plenty of survivor squads that intentionally make a game as unfun for a killer as possible, for no clear reason outside of being assholes. You can see it in the players. You go to DbD player's profiles and they have \"salt mines\" and post about how they intentionally want to ruin another person's experience, because they think it makes them look tough when it just looks edgy. You go on the subreddit, and there are so many memes about \"haha, thinking I will go home to play DbD and have fun, and then not having fun!!!\" It's just sad. So many people just play to fuck over other people. And it's largely because of this silly \"Us vs. Them\" mentality. It's a dumb fucking game, and this community acts like it's a civil war. \n\n-------------\n\nAs a conclusion, I have so much more to say on how this game has managed to run me out of my patience, which has persisted for 4 YEARS. I haven't played in a month or so, and when I came back, I had a miserable experience. Then I heard about the shitshow that was the most recent patch, and realized plenty of others were also having a miserable experience, and I realized the above three points should be a good enough reason to not purchase the game, among plenty of other things, but I'm getting tired of writing this review.  I can't lie and say I'll never come back to the game; I might, maybe a good patch will come by, who knows. But I really recommend that if you are planning to buy the game, DO NOT. It is not worth it. I've given the game the benefit of the doubt for so long, and genuinely care about it and want it to succeed...but I simply cannot recommend it anymore :/","timestamp_created":1494492590,"timestamp_updated":1613654642,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679468","author":{"steamid":"76561198363321031","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5554,"last_played":1512138180},"language":"russian","review":"Просто шикарная игра, все советую","timestamp_created":1494491885,"timestamp_updated":1494491885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679410","author":{"steamid":"76561198280022469","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1478243705},"language":"schinese","review":"挺不错的 开发商赞一个","timestamp_created":1494491576,"timestamp_updated":1494491576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679260","author":{"steamid":"76561198375270362","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":34552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5896,"last_played":1652163094},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดีครับ","timestamp_created":1494490543,"timestamp_updated":1494490543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679180","author":{"steamid":"76561198382526782","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":74520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3536,"last_played":1655329572},"language":"schinese","review":"值得玩，什么lol去你的吧","timestamp_created":1494490055,"timestamp_updated":1494490055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679154","author":{"steamid":"76561198312882997","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":1040,"last_played":1659764021},"language":"schinese","review":"特意写的好评，法王啥时候能来啊？","timestamp_created":1494489955,"timestamp_updated":1494489955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679144","author":{"steamid":"76561198083808025","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":51620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30908,"last_played":1656680574},"language":"russian","review":"Думаю за 500 часов игры, у меня сформировалось мнение об игре, и теперь, настало время моего обзора. \n\nПлюсы: \n1. Задумка. \nЗадумка довольно интересная, выжившие (с собственными и уникальными перками), маньяки (у каждого тоже свои перки). Суть в том, что нужно выжить всем 4 сурвам и дать маньяку меньше очков (так думают выжившие), и совершенно наоборт у маньяка.. он жаждет посадить твою жопку на крюк (как правило, в подвале). \n2. Разные позиции выживших и маньяков. \nВыжившие - есть вариант носиться с маньяком всю игру, пока остальные твои тиммейты заводят генераторы и ты потом сваливаешь, и наоборот. \nМаньяки - тут все проще, в любом случае ты должен всех убить. Ты либо кемперишь (стоишь возле крюка где висит сурв и не даешь его спасти другим сурвам), либо вешаешь и сваливаешь в другое место (тем самое, получаешь больше очков крови, потому что повесишь ты, этого несчастного сурва, не один раз (если повезет ;)).\n3. Быстрая прокачка благодаря храму таин.\nВ игре есть храм таин, благодаря которому ты можешь купить некоторые перки за \"осколки\", соответственно быстрее прокачаешь своего выжившего или маньяка.\n4. Пасхалочки или Скины.\nНекоторым, например, стримерам дают особые футболки на выживших с логотипом твича. И есть другие редкие скины, но как их получить...(продолжение следует).\n\nМинусы:\n1. Баги.\nВ игре очень много багов до сих пор, с которыми разработчики не больно то и хотят работать. Делают они все лениво. И естественно багами пользуются некоторые $Yчки, и из-за этого бомбит. Особенно у маньяков, например, есть в одной карте, в одном месте, одно злачное местечко, если тебя там возьмет маньяк, то он там застрянет. И не сможет выйти. После такого, для сурвов карта становится благоприятной и творят они че хотят (как правило фармят).\n2. Текстуры.\nЭтот пункт можно в принципе отнести к пункту о багах, но благодаря ТРАВКЕ (обычной, $Yка, траве) в которой ты застреваешь (как правило, в основном когда бежишь от маньяка), я всё же, поставила отдельным пунктом, ибо иногда с этого дико бомбит.\n3. Баланс между выжившими и маньяками.\nНу когда то он был, соглашусь. Но теперь, добавили отрастающие крюки (если их собатажить, т.е. спиливать), и главное ЖАЖДА КРОВИ, это звиздец! Маньяк набирает скорость за, буквально, каждые несколько секунд преследования за тобой. В итоге, твоя задница все равно будет на крюке, если ты не сумеешь вовремя спрятаться. \n4. Все твои сохранения и прокачка, может слететь в тартарары.\nСейчас они немного поправили это, и стало гораздо меньше людей у которых слетели сохранения достижений в игре (прокачка). Но я, успела схватить этот \"вирус\". В декабре, у меня просто слетели все сохраненки. И естественно желание играть в игру отпало, потому что смысл прокачивать все тоже самое, когда ты прокачал уже больше половины всех перков. Я писала разработчикам, они мне говорят мол, нужен твой ид игры (он если что, в меню настроек подсвечивается), а от того что у меня игра слетела  ИДА НЕ БЫЛО. Я описываю все это, и что мне они ответили? мол, ничем мы помочь не можем, нужен ид. Окей. Я написала снова, прошел месяц, мне сделали ИД. После отправки ида, прошло еще 2 месяца и мне \"вернули мои сохранения\", то бишь просто дали 17 миллионов блудпоинтов. И на них, мол, прокачивай все заново. \n5. Скины на одежду маньяков и сурвов.\nЯ твичер, стримила дбд. И еще в конце декабря я подала заявку на твич футболку. И что вы думаете? сейчас середина мая, и у меня нет ни их ответа, ни твич футболки.\n\n\nВ общем, будет много треша который вы не поймете, и от которого будет гореть ваша попка. Но задумка игры интересная. Попробуйте выжить, если конечно ваш фпс будет это позволять. ;)","timestamp_created":1494489921,"timestamp_updated":1494489921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679085","author":{"steamid":"76561198307031834","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":88101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14221,"last_played":1658566413},"language":"schinese","review":"只有治疗青年人对于网络的依赖中国才有救！既然社会不认同我，我就化身为魔！你，需要治疗！","timestamp_created":1494489612,"timestamp_updated":1494489612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31679037","author":{"steamid":"76561198140933801","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":29312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":110,"playtime_at_review":3464,"last_played":1659446929},"language":"english","review":"eh","timestamp_created":1494489356,"timestamp_updated":1626691981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31678911","author":{"steamid":"76561198286480055","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":20773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10217,"last_played":1629479559},"language":"schinese","review":"为了游戏制作方的诚信和责任心，这个好评我给了","timestamp_created":1494488475,"timestamp_updated":1494488475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550102293491363525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31678744","author":{"steamid":"76561198353353785","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":44021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6079,"last_played":1555211476},"language":"schinese","review":"杀鸡是真的好玩啊，杨永信好评！","timestamp_created":1494487322,"timestamp_updated":1494487322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31678594","author":{"steamid":"76561197977785483","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1235,"last_played":1562797853},"language":"english","review":"Really fun to play....

kommt man bei Survive with Friends auch nicht mehr ins Spiel - angeblich liegt ein Verbindungsproblem vor - obwohl in Wahrheit natürlich keines vorliegt. D.h. man kann nicht spielen, obwohl man dafür Geld bezahlt hat.\nAber hey - das ist doch nicht schlimm! Die Devs müssen ja schließlich an ihren Profit denken und Spiele müssen ja auch nicht funktionieren! Warum auch?\n\nWeiterhin ist es jetzt wieder möglich für die Killer das Spiel so zu beenden, dass sie keinen Pip verlieren. Eine Runde lief nicht so, wie du es magst? Zieh einfach kurz das Kabel und steck es schnell wieder rein und du hast die bösen Survivor bestraft und dafür noch nicht mal EINEN Pip verloren. Das ist dann natürlich absolut fair!\n\nAußerdem gibt es jetzt ein neuen Rang-System für die Killer. Wenn du eine gute Gruppe hast, die fair spielen und du bist kein mieses Stück Scheiße und willst sie rauslassen... dann verlierst du einen Pip! Ja, da kannst du auch gern 35.000 Punkte gemacht haben - das ist scheißegal, denn du musst jetzt mindestens zwei Leute töten. Angeblich wurde dieses System eingeführt, um die bösen Camper zu bestrafen - obwohl es in diesem Spiel ja gar keine Camper gibt (das habe ich mir natürlich nur ausgedacht, weil ich \"salty\" bin). Mit der neuen Mechanik passiert aber genau das Gegenteil - man wird zum Campen animiert (obwohl ja NIEMAND JEMALS CAMPEN WUERDE! NEE!) \n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nIch habe jetzt knapp 900 Stunden mit dem Spiel verbracht...\nEs war anfangs sehr lustig, gruselig, aufregend - es war das erste Spiel, das ich wirklich gesuchtet habe.\n\nMit der Zeit kamen neue Killer und neue Survivor, Maps, Items und Perks ins Spiel. Man merkte schnell, dass die neuen Inhalte nicht genug ( vor Release) getestet wurden - ständig musste etwas nachgebessert werden. Perks wurden schwächer gemacht, da sie zu stark waren. Killer wurden langsamer gemacht, da sie zu schnell waren, Maps wurden generft, weil sie einer Seite (Killer oder Survivor) mehr Chancen bot als der anderen Seite.\nNun kann ich sagen, dass das noch in Ordnung war.\n\nWas nicht in Ordnung war und noch immer ist: Die Devs versprechen Dinge, die sie nicht halten.\nEin Beispiel: Es wird nunmehr seit einem halben Jahr versprochen, dass die Haken-Mechanik geändert wird. Ist der Killer in der Nähe des Hakens (als campt er den Aufgehängten ab), so läuft der Lebensbalken des Überlebenden nicht ab. Das wurde versprochen. Es wurde nie umgesetzt.\nEs wurde generell versprochen, etwas gegen Camper zu unternehmen - das Spiel fairer zu gestalten.\nAber das Gegenteil wurde umgesetzt: \n- Haken kommen nach 3 Minuten wieder, obwohl man sie sabotiert hat. Angeblich um den häufigen Gebrauch von \"Eiserner Griff\" einzuschränken... natürlich nutzen die Killer den Perk weiterhin fleißig\n- sollte man einen Killer blockieren, weil er einen abgecampt hat oder einen in dem anschließenden Gruppenchat beleidigt, bringt es dir nichts, denn du kannst dir die Killer nicht mehr ansehen... die Killer haben im Gegenzug einen Direktlink zum Profil der Survivor erhalten\n- die Killer haben nun eine Art Beschleunigung beim Jagen erhalten, damit sie auch ja einen Survivor bekommen... nicht auszudenken, wenn die plötzlich anfangen müssten, Skills zu entwickeln\n- desto schlechter die Internetverbindung des Killers ist, umso besser für ihn, denn so kann sich der Survivor nicht mehr verstecken, laggt 10 Meter zurück, rennt gegen Wände und bleibt ständig hängen.\n\nGenerell ist die Balance sehr unausgeglichen. Während man Camper belohnt, hat man als FAIRER Killer kaum eine Chance gegen eine 4er-Gruppe aus Rank 1-Survivors, die alle lilafarbene Taschenlampen bei sich tragen, \"Entscheidungsschlag\", \"Geliehene Zeit\" und \"Unbeugsam\" nutzen.\n\nNatürlich KANN man als Survovir das Spiel überleben und natürlich KANN man Spaß an diesem Spiel haben und natürlich KANN man ein fairer Killer sein und trotzdem alle Survivor töten - aber das funktioniert kaum noch.\n\nWeiterhin liegt das auch an der DBD-Community an sich. Es gibt 2 Lager: die Main-Killer und die Main-Survivor. Und beide Lager hassen sich bis aufs Blut. Beide Lager hassen übrigens auch die eigenen Lager, weil... ja, weil die eben anders spielen als man selbst. Kurz: die Community ist ein einziges Krebsgeschwür.\n\nIch habe jetzt so viel Zeit und Geld in das Spiel investiert und ich hatte, wie gesagt, wirklich Spaß, aber sollte sich das Spiel weiterhin so entwickeln, dass man auf die schlechten Spieler hört anstatt auf die erfahrenen Spieler, die beide Seiten/ Lager kennen, sehe ich keinen Sinn darin, dieses Spiel weiterhin zu spielen.\n\nIch kann es im Moment auch niemandem empfehlen, sich dieses Spiel anzuschaffen.\nLeider.\n\nEdit: DAS IST HAUPTSAECHLICH EINE KRITIK AN DEN ENTWICKLERN, NICHT ZWANGSLAEUFIG AM SPIEL SELBST. DAS SPIEL HAT SEHR VIEL POTENTIAL.\n( Ich finde es nur schade, dass ein Spiel mit diesem Potenzial, sich selbst so ins Abseits schießt.)\n\n\n\nGood Job, Devs!","timestamp_created":1494424998,"timestamp_updated":1522070796,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":198,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.800716936588287354","comment_count":80,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31665393","author":{"steamid":"76561198112184789","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14356,"last_played":1528039906},"language":"english","review":"Love the concept.
