For survivor, you only need to repair gens, not get caught by the killer and finally escape by opening an exit gate. Of course, there are other side things to do, i.e breaking totems or helping teammates by healing them or unhooking them, but that's just a tiny part of the main objective, survive by repairing 5 gens. \n\nOn the other hand, the killer has a more straight forward objective and that is to find, chase, hook and sacrifice the survivors. What is interesting about this side is that every killer has its own style of doing the same objective, and that would be the killer's power. However, even though every killer is different, the objective remains the same, and that is something that I don't longer like, I would prefer something new, something innovative. From the past 4 years I've been playing this game, I have seen some pretty good ideas from the community to make a change, but they are too good to be ever considered by the devs... and now that I've mentioned them, they are the main problem for this game.\n\nThe devs are focusing too much on balancing the perks/addons/killer's power as well as some survivor's perks to make the game as fair as possible for both sides, which is not bad but they are forgetting what made Dead by Daylight unique in its own way. An action / horror game where survivors, must hide from a psychopath killer who is hunting them down to make them know despair, fear, to make them know that death, is not an escape. That was the essence that really hooked me up to play the game for a lot of hours, and that was on its first 2 years. But now, there is no longer any of that, survivors (not every single one of them) only focus on the famous \"gen rush\" in order to complete their objective and escape, which takes away the \"horror\" from the game. \n\nAs the game is right now, the only killers that are capable of maintaining the suspense and fear in a match would only be Myers, GhostFace, The Pig and The Hag, and why them and not any other killer? Because they, in my opinion, are the only killers who can still scare the sh1t out of you when you less expect it (of course, these killers have their own exceptions when it comes to how they use their stealth but this is assuming that they use their power to surprise the survivors). And that is something that I would highly like in the game.\n\nDead by daylight has potential, its fun to play with friends and also alone when playing as the killer, but the path that the game is taking for the future, really doesn't convince me. If the game stays as it is, I wouldn't recommend it, but I still have my hopes for this game to change in a near future.

I dug the concept, but it was buggy, surprisingly ugly, and incredibly basic. There just wasn't much to do. Crouching behind rusty metal, sneaking around extremely chunky set pieces (which consisted of 2 main textures, muddy low res rust, and rusty low res mud), and banging on generators. And that...was literally the entire game. Rinse and repeat\n\nBut between then and now a lot of time has passed. Updates. Patches. DLC. And even I had to admit that the addition of so many horror properties to the game had me feeling a bit curious about it again. So during the steam sale I picked it up cheap, and hoped to be wowed with the new, streamlined, content laden 2020 version of Dead By Daylight!\n\nThe result...still buggy, exactly as ugly and unoptimized as before, and just as empty and basic. Only now you can play the same clunky game of hide and seek while being chased by Freddy Kruger, or Michael Myers while doing so. In all of their (bizzarely for a game in 2020) ugly low resolution textured glory. There's definitely a ton of new content to throw your cash at. But the game itself, is virtually unchanged\n\nIn the time since launch, with so much money to apparently throw at multiple horror properties, how have they not had time to add any new modes? Or at the very least update the graphics and performance to at least resemble something post 2001?\n\nIt's cool to include Silent Hill DLC, not so cool to somehow look, and control worse than the original game","timestamp_created":1466036343,"timestamp_updated":1595184263,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.42448192834854126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23588623","author":{"steamid":"76561198072718497","num_games_owned":498,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1538192488},"language":"english","review":"It's time to talk about Dead by Daylight a 1v4 Horror game in which you either hunt down four survivors, or do whatever you can to survive and escape, questioning yourself whether it's worth risking your life to save your friends, or leave them for dead to save yourself.\n\nIt's a very fun game, but due to the fact that it lacks features that are absolutely necessary, and certain issues haven't been fixed it cannot get my recommendation.\n\nGameplay: I've played the beta for a very long time, mainly as the survivor mind you, but I have tried being the bad guy a couple times. Gameplay is rather simple. SURVIVORS: Fix the necessary amount of generators in order to open an exit to escape the monster. Watch out for traps, hide, and evade the monster as much as possible. You cannot fight back, and use whatever tools you can to help you on your survival. Perks and items can be used on your character if you so choose to help give you a little boost. Also listen for your heartbeat...the faster it goes the closer the monster is to finding you. \n\nMONSTER: Obviously Kill everyone who was dumb enough to come to your area. You can pick from three monsters all with various traits and abilities Whether you wound them or interrupt them doing something else, you pick them up and sacrifice them to whatever fucked up god you worship. Be sure to make sure they ARE sacrificed as survivors can pull them down from the meat hooks. You will have certain special abilities and will also be able to use perks to get a one up on the survivors. You can run faster than survivors, but they can climb over objects faster and knock stuff down to slow you down.\n\nHere comes the first issue of the game...Survivors can just keep jumping over windows making it near impossible to stop them. If there are two windows in one room, they basically play ring around the rosey with the monster until he puts either a trap down, or gets so frustrated he moves away. This happened about...2/5 times I've played a match as a monster, and i've also seen it done by others.\n\nAnother Issue is that...it gets repetitive...Very fast....There's no variety in objectives which makes me sad because...I don't want to keep fixing generators. There's a lack of variety when it comes to what to do as a survivor. Fix the generator. Fix the Generator. Save/Leave friend. Fix the Generator. Run. Hide. Fix the Generator. Die/Escape. That's just about it. If you're looking a game that will keep you on your toes, force you plan and ponder what you should do next, this is not it.\n\nSound/Music: Sounds aren't bad, hell I'll even say they are pretty good. The immersive atmosphere is nailed as I always freak out when hearing a noise, and when i start hear the heartbeat of the monster coming, my heart starts beating as well, especially when the chase music kicks in when the monster is hot on your tail. I flinch when I spook crows and thinking I just screwed myself and gave away my position. Don't expect nothing special from this category, but it gets the job done.\n\nFeatures: This is also something lacking in the department. The game has a Ranking System and a RPG system. Ranking is what you expect, a rank is given based off skill as a survivor or a monster. RPG System is...rather interesting as everytime you level up, you are given random drops essentially in which you use blood points to purchase in order to get new perks and items to help you. It's nice to see what you get when you leveled up your character.\n\nHowever, the downsides for this is that there is no way to host a private match unless you have a full party. You want to play with two of your friends and fill up the game with random people? TOO BAD. They don't let you do that. And even if you just play with your friends only, YOU ARE NOT REWARDED FOR IT. For the sake of keeping people from grinding points to get more gear, they take away the reward of playing the game with just friends.\n\nAnother downside is there is NO MIC OR CHAT COMMUNICATION. A game in which requires cooperation has no way to communicate to other survivors. This would've been easy if they programmed proximity voice chat, so you can only talk to those who are close by. And the monster can have a little fun with it as well, but no. It was pulled from the game due to the fact it's an 'immersion breaker'. Honestly, I get the worries, but immersion isn't a big priority for me. It's frustrating not being able to talk to other players. You know how annoying it is for when a survivor comes to save you and the monster is hiding his presence and I want to scream for them to turn back, well you can't. They'll probably die. There is almost.\n\nGraphics: They are nice...Nothing extraordinary but if you want a game that looks immersive, you'll get it. You don't need a top end graphics card to get it on ultra, and don't even need a good one to play it.\n\nOverall: 6/10 It's an above average game that will give you a couple scares and the feel of being hunted down. But unless you're playing with friends, you won't be playing it for long, and good luck playing with friends as there is no lobby system. Monster can be trolled fairly easily, there is almost 0 cooperation due to the lack of voice chat so random people are going to be nothing more than stranger sto you instead of people trying to help eachother out to survive. My advice is to add proximity voice chat and also a RADIO item in which you can contact survivors globally should they have the item as well. Add a Lobby system to play with friends and Random people. Fix these exploits Survivors can use to troll the monster. Give some more variety like lock the survivors in a house and force them to find certain items to open a door to leave. But as it is now, it is not worth your money. Even at a low price like this.\n\n","timestamp_created":1466036290,"timestamp_updated":1466036290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452117800712585449","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23588607","author":{"steamid":"76561198113972127","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1396,"last_played":1513837068},"language":"schinese","review":"太刺激了！就是这个版本人不太好赢...","timestamp_created":1466036209,"timestamp_updated":1466036209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23588600","author":{"steamid":"76561198108879136","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1466034278},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é muito limitado e não tem um bom desempenho no meu computador.

I was able to wiggle away but was immediately caught again. I kicked and beat on the killer's back as he carried me off, but he took me back in and hung me up on a meat hook. I did more wiggling and tried to get away, but a giant spider ate me instead.\n\nThe next round I chose to be the killer.  It started a bit slow and I couldn't find anyone, but then they started messing with stuff and I tracked a few of them down.  I chased one guy as he threw things down in front of me to block me, but each time I smashed through and kept following him until a girl ran close past me and I began to chase her.  I managed to hit her a few times and I knocked her down.  As I carried her on my shoulder she got herself free and ran off.  That's when I saw the guy I was going after before and decided it was definitely his time.  I chased him into a house and he kind of got away from me, but I heard a noise and went into a room where there was a dresser type thing that seemed like an obvious hiding place.  So I went to see if I could open it. I did and there he was with this scared ****less look on his face.

Dabei gilt es auch ein wenig taktisch zu denken. Lohnt es sich dem am Haken hängenden zu befreien und die Punkte für die Rettung zu bekommen?\nIst man der letzte wäre dies beinahe Kontraproduktiv, da die Killer meistens bis das Opfer am Haken stirbt diesen bewacht. Bin ich in der Gruppe von max. 2 Leuten könnte ich den 3ten Retten indem einer ihn ablenkt. Also Taktik und Absprache kann in diesem Game durchaus Sinnvoll sein. \n\nGenerell ist das Spiel sehr spannend gemacht. Es gibt 3 Killerarten und jede Spielfigur kann im Level aufsteigen und so Perks und Gegenstände freischalten um sich zu besser gegen das Böse zur Wehr zu setzen. Meistens jedoch ist es am Sichersten einfach die Beine in die Hand zu nehmen und zu versuchen dem Killer irgendwie zu entkommen. \n\nSuper: Hat der Killer dich geschnappt ist es nicht das ENDE. Man kann sich noch aus seinem Griff heraus befreien und vom Haken entkommen. \n\nPro\n+viele sehr gute DLCs (Killer und Überlebende und jeweils eine Map)\n\n+gruselige Atmosphäre\n\n+Mehrere Maps\n\n+Mehrere Charaktere\n\n+Teamplay\n\n\n\nContra\n- einige wenige Bugs haben bei mir die Stimmung ein wenig vermießt.\n(Beispiel: War mitten im Level und dann Endet das Level plötzlich mit der Nachricht \"Entkommen\")\n\n- ein Bug sorgte dafür dass das Level nicht beendet wurde nachdem das letzte Opfer am Haken hing. Musste manuell das Level beenden. \n\n- Bisher nur ein Spielmodi\n\n\nMein Fazit: Letzten Endes glaube ich fest daran dass dieses Spiel enormes Potential hat, wenn die Entwickler weiterhin Content bringen und vielleicht noch einige weitere Killer und Opfer einfügen, sowie noch ein paar mehr Maps.\n\n\nLivestream dazu: Ich habe den Livestream mal aufgezeichnet und möchte das Spiel euch hier nun zeigen.

When it came out, I got it for 17.00. I can say that I am very happy with the game overall. It's a 4 V 1 multiplayer game (No bots or AI controlled players) that sets four survivor players against one Killer in one of a handful large, randomly generated arenas that look like recreations of sets from some iconic horror movies. The objective of the survivor players is to light up five generators by holding the M1 button and paying attention for \"skill checks\" ( random quicktime button presses). Once all five generators are lit, a highlighted switch needs to be pulled, opening a large gate for escape. \n\nThe objective of the killer is... well, kill everyone. The killer will have important points in the map highlighted, like generators. Seeing the generators will give them an idea of where the survivors could be lurking. There are three classes of killers so far. 1. the Trapper, a spooky mask wearing psycho that sets bear traps to catch his victims. 2. the Wraith, he can go invisible to stalk his prey. 3. The Hilbilly, he wields a sledgehammer and a chainsaw that he can powerup for a burst of speed and murdery goodness. The killers have to knock down the survivors and hang them on a hook that will eventually sacrifice them after a period of time. \n\nThe survivors do not carry any weapons to fight off the killers, but they do have the ability to sense the presence of the killers ( via loud heart pounding sounds). The are slightly slower than the killer, so there are obstacles to shove over while you are running for your life. The survivors can work together to get out alive, or they can creep in the shadows and go lone wolf. If all but one survivor has been killed, an option to find a randomly generated floor hatch will open up, giving the final survivor a slightly easier way out of the arena.\n\nSurvivors and killers earn levels through matches by working together, completing objectives, healing and rescuing each other, escaping the killer, and a few other things. The points can be used to purchase items and skills via \"Blood Web\" to use in the matches. be careful what items you take into a match though, if you die, the item is lost. \n\nFor the price, I'd say this game is well worth it. One last thing, there is no voice or text chat in the game. So unless you are using a chat program with friends, you are going to feel pretty alone out there.

Some sort of partying system would benefit this game greatly.\n\nOther than that, I definitely recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1466027843,"timestamp_updated":1466027843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23577075","author":{"steamid":"76561198047929722","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":70849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1706,"last_played":1658863049},"language":"english","review":"Tru killer's story:\n> Catch one survivor\n> Hang him on the hook\n> When you are suppost to go away about second later, another survivor comes, trying to rescue him\n> Hit another survivor with chainsaw before he manage to rescue friend\n> Grab him and go to other hook\n> Wild third survivor appears!\n> Third survivor used \"Take your friend off the hook!\"\n> Drop survivor u held, hit 3rd survivor\n> Hang 3rd survivor on the hook meant for 1st survivor\n> 1st survivor tries to take 3rd off the hook, ignoring the fact i'm standing right beside, watching\n> Grab 1st survivor\n> Go to other hook, and hang him there\n> Go back and find 2nd survivor inches away from place you've left him(yes, you can move while knocked down)\n> Hang him on another hook\n> 4th survivor disconnected\n10/10 human worse than AI\n\nTru human story:\n> Save a girl from a hook\n> Killer chainsaws you then hang you on the hook\n> The girl you've saved runs away toward exit\nNever felt so betrayed before.

Macht mega Spaß und hält bei Laune - auch wenn man mal verliert. Das Level- und Rangsystem gefällt mir sehr gut.\n\nABER:\nBITTE liebe Entwickler, gebt Freunden die Chance als Team in eine Lobby einzusteigen. Nicht als Killer, aber als Überlebende. Das ist für mich noch ein extremer Minuspunkt.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdate nach 92 Stunden Spielzeit:\nDANKE liebe Entwickler, das ihr Freunden die Chance gegeben habt als Team in eine Lobby einzusteigen! Das ist für mich ein echter Pluspunkt.\n\nABER:\nBITTE liebe Entwickler, könnt ihr diese Möglichkeit jetzt auch noch so anpassen, das man nicht 30 Minuten in der Lobby alle 15 Sekunden auf \"Fertig\" drücken muss um dann in der Killerlobby festzustellen, dass der Killer die Lobby verlässt weil er Angst hat gegen die \"guten\" Überlebenden zu verlieren und man sich dann wieder von neuem für 30 Minuten auf die Suche nach einer Lobby machen kann um erneut das selbe festzustellen und gefühlt nach 2 Stunden das erste Spiel zu finden was dann innerhalb von 3 Minuten und 13 Sekunden endet, weil der Killer den ersten findet und aufhängt, alle anderen Überlebenden hin laufen um ihn zu retten, der Killer aber (wie gefühlt 98% der Killer) campt, den ersten erschlägt und liegen lässt, den zweiten erschlägt und liegen lässt, den dritten erschlägt und liegen lässt, wartet bis alle 3 verblutet sind, keiner was von dem Spiel hatte aber sich jeder nochmal 2 Stunden auf die lustige Lobbysuche macht, weil das Spiel einfach verdammt nochmal Spaß macht wenn man mal nicht 2 Stunden wartet und ein 3 Minuten und 13 Sekunden spiel erwischt. Falls es jemand bis hier hin schafft: das war der längste Satz meines Lebens.","timestamp_created":1466027717,"timestamp_updated":1470759701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23577049","author":{"steamid":"76561197961276694","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1533584310},"language":"english","review":"Game is great but get ready to spend hour searching for a match","timestamp_created":1466027710,"timestamp_updated":1466027710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4/KDq9UCeZ34WQ=="}
