This makes a killer mmr grow unreasonably higher than their actual skill area is.\nThis is the reason that me as an ash 1 (highest tier of the lowest league) killer gets put up with 4 iridescent 1 (top league) survivors on a regular basis. It's come to a point where i as a killer am completely unable to get even 1 hook before 3 of the generators are already finished. It's come to a point where i can only get something out of it when i play scummy with face camping, there is no escape, and no one escapes death perks to get at least some kills. Worst part is, survivor groups usually give the killer 1 mercy kill to cut them some slack, at this point however it's basically tying a noose around their neck because it brings DBD to match you up with higher level players even though they're far from ready for it.\nIt's still enjoyable as a survivor sometimes. But because of the fact that the matches are already favorable towards the survivors and matchmaking has gone to shit nobody wants to play killer anymore and you get stuck in an insane queue. Once you do get to play as survivor you get matched up with the killer builds i mentioned earlier and are extremely likely to fall flat on your face.\nBoth sides are being forced to go for meta and toxic builds at this point, killers more than survivors.\nThis game used to be very enjoyable to play yourself, but now it only is with friends in custom games, as that's the only place where you get equal grounds.\n\nI still play it from time to time but i cannot recommend it to anybody until this is fixed.","timestamp_created":1639573884,"timestamp_updated":1639574001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510676145553588867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105867291","author":{"steamid":"76561198013358521","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":79407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":295,"playtime_at_review":51279,"last_played":1659863252},"language":"english","review":"It's an entertaining game, but hard to recommend. It can be great fun, especially during the first few hundred hours as you learn the game (it has a steep learning curve).

A shame they are unable to even utilize the feedback they get from their own community creator team (Fog Whisperers).\n\nThe new ranking system they implemented earlier this year is utterly terrible, and pretty much everyone knows and agrees on this.

It's kind of irritating that majority of them are stuck behind DLC, but developers gotta eat as well I suppose. It's not too terribly bad if you can get the different collections on sale. \nAs much as it is of a grind to get the perks you want on a character, unlocking stuff in the bloodweb is actually satisfying and makes it feel like you're working towards something. It's just a shame that this game has been out for so long that I am way behind other people in terms of perks. \n\nAlso want to make one thing clear, this game isn't really targeted for a casual audience. When I first started playing it, I was surprised by how sweaty and competitive the community was, but now that I'm 200 hours in, I understand. This game has a lot of complexity for both killer and survivor. I still think that a custom game with your friends can be fun, but don't expect that same experience when you go into public matches. \n\nThis game is a trial by fire for new players. It'll probably take you about 20 hours until you feel like you're getting the hang of it, and it'll be about 100 hours until you actually understand the nuances of the game and feel like you're an average player.

I don't see many of these bugs people talk about (the ones I do see are more funny visual glitches than major game-breaking bugs), connectivity is a problem in any online game, the game has never seemed insanely overbalanced in one way or another (every match is a crapshoot--but that's what I expected!), and the developers have been consistently working on the ranking systems to make them more fair and balanced over time.\n\nI think this game only works best if you play as the Killer or if you play with your friends. There is zero communication in solo matches, so the real enjoyable way to play as a Survivor is with a full friend group of four Survivors communicating over voice chat. Otherwise, if you want to play solo, you'll definitely want to play as the Killer, since it'll give you that thrill of messing with the lobby and preventing them from completing their own objectives. Even getting just one kill in a match is a win in my book, since, after all, it's a 1v4.\n\nAs someone who is deathly afraid of horror movies and gets jump-scared easily, even in this game, I'm still surprised by how much I enjoy Dead by Daylight. If you're interested in this game style, or if you're a horror junkie lured in by the Super Smash Bros.-like crossover with all of these horror properties, I would definitely look past the cloud of hate and give the game a shot. Play a couple of rounds with Survivor friends, play a couple of rounds as the Killer, and you may be as surprised as I was.","timestamp_created":1639556650,"timestamp_updated":1639556650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506726443767547607","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105858520","author":{"steamid":"76561199111610133","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":97,"playtime_at_review":11068,"last_played":1660467008},"language":"japanese","review":"a","timestamp_created":1639556217,"timestamp_updated":1639556217,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45355638861656189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105858230","author":{"steamid":"76561199221318479","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":47510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2796,"last_played":1659013024},"language":"japanese","review":"ふえぇぇぇぇぇい","timestamp_created":1639555629,"timestamp_updated":1639555629,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105858159","author":{"steamid":"76561198824975243","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":68234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":200,"playtime_at_review":49517,"last_played":1659725462},"language":"german","review":"Good game, but some Bugs should be fixed","timestamp_created":1639555472,"timestamp_updated":1639555472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105857425","author":{"steamid":"76561198802160200","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":50998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":33205,"last_played":1660587970},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight - одна из лучших игр в своем жанре.

Like many people have been saying about this game and community for YEARS, you're more likely to be afraid of the survivors because of what they pack. WAY TOO MANY SECOND CHANCES. Not to mention keys and maps. Those should have NEVER been brought into the game, they have it easy enough with their insta-health totems, toolboxes, med-kits, speed boost perks, etc. Some maps are way too big, with too many generators for them to work with like the school map. While others give them a ton of looping opportunities by which the killer isn't able to catch them. Survivors should be scared of the killer. It should be hard for them to make it out. I hardly ever play as a survivor anymore because it got way too boring. The patch for the generators does absolutely NOTHING. They wonder why there's now a shortage of killers. This is coming from someone who's played both sides equally in the past. Skill based match-making is also NOT it. Someone who's ranked silver will be matched with gold and higher. Probably won't be playing much until they fix this, it's not fun anymore. There's no room to play casually. They cut down most of the killers, many cannot make up for their lack of speed. Especially the Pig who I was grinding for a while until they patched her as well. This game has so much potential to be great but the more they listen to survivors, the worse it gets. Hence, the love-hate relationship I have with it. I also really wish they'd make it so there could be two killers in the same match with 8 survivors. So much potential...I'm just disappointed now.","timestamp_created":1639546903,"timestamp_updated":1639546903,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510676145553588867","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105854260","author":{"steamid":"76561198969280898","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16829,"last_played":1639792070},"language":"koreana","review":"망겜 접어야지","timestamp_created":1639546884,"timestamp_updated":1639546884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105853952","author":{"steamid":"76561198255240321","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":911,"last_played":1645458320},"language":"schinese","review":"买了很久 一直没玩 玩了之后 差点吓死，游戏感觉还是不错的，\n\n有种身临其境的感觉。！！高血压 心脏病 还是不要玩人类！！","timestamp_created":1639546162,"timestamp_updated":1639546162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105853895","author":{"steamid":"76561198016611561","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":35002,"playtime_last_two_weeks":887,"playtime_at_review":10744,"last_played":1660135843},"language":"schinese","review":"马上联动午夜凶铃 yyds\n\n5.18   今年生化联动第二弹和巨人联动  好评!","timestamp_created":1639546061,"timestamp_updated":1652847357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105853852","author":{"steamid":"76561199045089193","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":870,"last_played":1644465569},"language":"english","review":"You never truly become great, you just get a little better each time.","timestamp_created":1639545987,"timestamp_updated":1639545987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105853848","author":{"steamid":"76561198197190901","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9291,"last_played":1655886744},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1639545979,"timestamp_updated":1639545979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105853708","author":{"steamid":"76561198157606949","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7631,"last_played":1641101933},"language":"english","review":"Rough by yourself, a blast with friends.
