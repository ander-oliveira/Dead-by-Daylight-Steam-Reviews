It an important mindset to know your not always going to win. Even with practice it might take 1,000's of hours before you're anywhere near rank one as a killer or a survivor. I do believe that if you want to rank up you have to know how to play both sides its ok to main in one, but if you've only played survivor and know nothing about each of the killers you definitly won't rank up. Personally, I play to the game to have fun and I think thats an important mindset to have when playing this game. There is always something new to learn on both sides. Plus, the dlcs are pretty cheap and come out pretty frequently, so you'll get alot of play time out this game. I believe the games worth the money, time, and effort.","timestamp_created":1606970496,"timestamp_updated":1606970496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81504587","author":{"steamid":"76561198444207653","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1640227255},"language":"english","review":"good game with friends","timestamp_created":1606970263,"timestamp_updated":1606970263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81504369","author":{"steamid":"76561198089362444","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1650819361},"language":"spanish","review":"asd","timestamp_created":1606969853,"timestamp_updated":1606969853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81504357","author":{"steamid":"76561198310127512","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":245577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":82,"playtime_at_review":209556,"last_played":1659486041},"language":"english","review":"just bad, sorry guys","timestamp_created":1606969825,"timestamp_updated":1606969825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81504188","author":{"steamid":"76561199010638413","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":52358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":5560,"last_played":1659938453},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩(我詞窮","timestamp_created":1606969548,"timestamp_updated":1606969548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81504003","author":{"steamid":"76561198799424417","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":124591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2484,"playtime_at_review":16975,"last_played":1660573967},"language":"tchinese","review":"讚","timestamp_created":1606969217,"timestamp_updated":1606969217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81503990","author":{"steamid":"76561199010142914","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":1196,"last_played":1660376098},"language":"schinese","review":"赞，和朋友一起玩的，很不错","timestamp_created":1606969193,"timestamp_updated":1606969193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81503903","author":{"steamid":"76561199105567980","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":26947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":692,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1660496690},"language":"english","review":"You have to give props to the developers for constantly working to add new content to the game.

pains me to not recommend this game as it can be so much fun but the quality and health of the game is clearly not a priority for the development team. Other games have me excited when DLC is dropped but with DbD I just get disappointed as it inevitably adds to the mountain of bugs and game imbalances that have been ignored for months and even years now.\n\nHot fixes and patches that focus on game improvement are few and far between and they often create more issues than they fix. BeHaviour are notoriously slow when it comes to fixing game breaking bugs. However paid cosmetics and paid DLCs are consistent and will always be available for purchase. The most recent DLC (A Binding of Kin) was so broken and buggy on release that the devs knew it and still pushed it to live servers with a price tag. No paid content should have a “list of known issues” in the official patch notes that’s just unprofessional and embarrassing. Not to mention this DLC was on a public test build about month before release and was still shipped in poor condition.\n\nThere are also obviously unhealthy add ons, perks, items and offerings that ruin the game for new players. To name a few; Moris allow a killer to remove you from the game after one hook (rather than 3) [NOW CHANGED TO TWO HOOKS], Iridescent Head Huntress will down you in one hit regardless of your health state & Keys allow the survivors to leave the game early without repairing all generators. I like to play both survivor and killer but these things make me not want to play the game at all.\n\nI’ll be more than happy to change my review when (if) BeHaviour change their focus to game health but until then they do not deserve any more purchases and certainly do not deserve the labour of love award.\n\nTLDR: Devs prioritise pushing out unfinished paid content and rather than fixing glaring game issues.","timestamp_created":1606965805,"timestamp_updated":1607502259,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548022627830505371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81501730","author":{"steamid":"76561199066021606","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1657832901},"language":"english","review":"i love this game its a fun game i love being the killer","timestamp_created":1606965227,"timestamp_updated":1606965227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81501600","author":{"steamid":"76561198825147058","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7214,"last_played":1644117454},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game!!!

A few developers have tried the 1 v Many asymmetrical slasher game to no success (Evolve, Friday the 13th), but finally Behaviour cracked the formula. It's like hide-and-seek meets freeze tag. Being the killer is great fun, and scratches a primal itch deep in my hunter brain. Outsmarting survivors, tracking hidden foes with rapidly fading clues, getting the perfectly timed stab, all are great fun. However, they are perhaps the least competent developer to make any game in general, let alone be responsible for the quintessential slasher simulator.\n\nBehaviour's history as a developer is terrible, they make shovelware games based on cartoons and children's movies. They make the games that grandparents buy for their grandkids at christmas, fun for a minute because \"I love that cartoon, this game will be good\" but the kid never finishes the game because somewhere deep down they know it's not fun, even if they can't articulate why. So, a bit of speculation on my part: This game was originally supposed to be a horror-movie tie-in cash-grab, but the license fell through during development, so they hastily changed it from Licensed Killer to Similar-To-But-Legally-Distinct Killer. Amazingly, they made something pretty fun. It's a genuine wonder we haven't seen this before. As I mentioned, others have tried, but missed the mark. This hits the mark, but it's still just the developers responsible for 20 years of shovelware. As such, this game is made by amateurs.\n\nBugs, bugs, balance issues, and more bugs. Every single update comes with broken content, and breaks old content. The newest killer (The Twins) just doesn't work at all. Switching between The Twins will break the game. You'll go blind, or get stuck in place, or move slower than a snail, or clip through the floor, or lose the ability to switch back to the other twin. I saw every single one of those bugs in my first 2 matches with them. Oh, and they also managed to break the abilities of all the old killers at the same time. Last month there was a bug where the killer couldn't kill the survivors. The version of this game on the Switch had a bug where survivors couldn't run at full speed. There are spots in maps that will trap you in place until the game ends. These bugs are all completely game-breaking, and they're just the bugs from the past few months. If you go further back, you'll see more. A lot of them are really quite baffling. Updating one killer breaks another because they both shared code. Sometimes killers can't break obstacles, making survivors untouchable. Some killers had the \"kicking metal\" and \"kicking wood\" sounds mixed up. How do you miss that? One single test match would reveal that. The list goes on, and paints a picture of a development team with literally no testing process.\n\nBalance issues. I mentioned these. I won't go into too much depth, but the developers are quite obviously unaware of how their game is played. Watching developer streams is like watching your little brother trying to play a video game. You'll shout at the screen \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING\" every 5 seconds. They'll say things like \"the statistics say this killer performs below-average, but we know the skill ceiling is high and good players do fine\" which is great, but in the very next breath say \"the statistics say this perk performs below-average, so we won't be nerfing it\" when the perk in question is \"you always know exactly where the killer is\". Slaves to math when it suits them, but enlightened on the lies of statistics when they want to be.\n\nMost recently, the event that made me write this review: The Twins. As I mentioned, they just don't work. $5 for this killer and it breaks every time you try to use it. Worse yet, they are actively trying to police any and all conversation regarding the twins. The Twins are two characters: The adult female (Charlotte), and the tiny little baby (Victor) that lives inside a hole in her chest. Cool concept, but strangely enough we are not allowed to call Victor a baby. Twitch, discord, reddit, the forums, any platform where this game is discussed, you cannot call him a baby, you cannot refer to him as a baby, you cannot even allude to the fact that you cannot call him a baby. You will be deleted, kicked, banned, for referring to Victor as a baby. \"Why?\" Because the survivors can kick Victor. Thus, if he's a baby, the game \"encourages violence against children\", so he cannot be a baby. He is an \"adult\", despite being the size and age of an infant. Aside from the absolutely terrible and hypocritical logic (This is a game about murdering innocent people, but kicking the homicidal demon baby is encouraging violence?), it reveals a basic fact: Behaviour does not think. They don't think about anything, at all. How did this question never come up? How did they never realize that people would be making \"Kick the baby\" jokes? Why does the discord server have to ban every single person that says \"baby\" when there is an actual baby in the game? We cannot even discuss the actual game because the most common word to refer to the killer is forbidden. \n\nSo, finally, we've found the issue with this game: This company does not think. They don't think about balance, they don't think about bugs, they don't think about their game, they don't think about us. If they were carpenters, I wouldn't live in their houses. If they were car manufacturers, they'd make exploding pintos. If they made guns, you'd be more likely to shoot yourself than your target. There isn't a single tester, or a single person with any common sense in a position of power. So while the game really is fun, I can't recommend giving these people money. It's terrible, it's buggy, and it's never getting better. Every day I pray that another company will do this better, but Behaviour already has all of the licenses, so the odds are slim.\n\n\nI initially wrote this review from the perspective of someone who only played killer. Since then, I have played a bunch of survivor, and what can I say, except: holy crap this is horrifically unfun. Most of the game is holding down M1 while you watch TV in the background. The only \"fun\" part is being chased by the killer, but that's about 30 seconds of entertainment sandwiched in between 10 minutes of waiting. All killers run some overpowered build, or camp, or tunnel, or camp and tunnel, and generally just aren't good sports. Random teammates range from actually brain-dead to actively sabotaging you. The only thing that is even close to enjoyable is playing with a squad of 4 friends, but killers can smell fear, and they'll pick off the weakest link and tunnel him to death. Over, and over, and over. And once he's dead, the game is already over. The rest is just a clean-up simulator where everyone else pretends to try but really has already given up and started checking their phone, basically wasting everyone's time. I absolutely do NOT recommend this game as survivor. Under no circumstances should you imagine it will be fun or enjoyable.\n\nAlso, this newest update, the Resident Evil chapter, HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. AHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. AHAHAHAHAHAHAH. The map is broken on release? You can't play it for 2 weeks? The update, once again, makes the game unplayable for console players? Glad to see one of the biggest franchises in horror video game history gets the red carpet treatment from our classically incompetent friends at Behaviour.","timestamp_created":1606949687,"timestamp_updated":1625109477,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":194,"votes_funny":23,"weighted_vote_score":"0.829880952835083008","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81491933","author":{"steamid":"76561198104193133","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":121017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":497,"playtime_at_review":49962,"last_played":1660603937},"language":"english","review":"At the time of writing, I have played this game for 832 hours, and I've been split on writing a review for a long time. Because the truth is, the core gameplay is unlike anything out there, and... it's fun. So what's the issue? Well, kind of everything else. I'll preface this by saying I play about 60% killer 40% survivor, so not really any bias here. Both sides have things that make the game extremely unfun.\n\n- This game runs so badly it's kind of incredible, considering the graphics (even the updated graphics aren't great imo). My PC is somewhere in the mid-high end and even running this game on the lowest settings, my framerate tanks for no reason. This isn't an issue with any other game.\n- The way some killers, addons, items, and offerings are designed makes you wonder if the developers [i]actually[/i] play their game and think \"yeah, this is fun!\". Offerings that allow you literally kill every survivor immediately after hooking them once, making the game a 3v1 very quickly, which then turns into a 2v1 quickly, which then turns into a loss very quickly. And you better believe killers bring that offering every other game.\n- Survivors have so many second chance perks that sometimes you just want to not even chase them. Finally caught up to that player that's been running you for ages? No, actually, they had Dead Hard, and now you have to dedicate even [i]more[/i] time to catching them. Decisive Strike and Unbreakable together make the survivor invincible for a full minute after being unhooked (if 4 survivors bring DS + Unbreakable, that's 8 minutes of invincibility! [two for each hook]) But with DS alone you can be invincible just by jumping in a locker! Now the killer can't touch you for an E N T I R E minute! That doesn't sound like a long time, but it really is, especially when they run in your face because of how cocky they are with this invincibility perk.\n- This game is more buggy and broken than any moderately maintained game I've ever played. Sometimes you load into a match, but actually the game decides you disconnected, and then you get penalized and have to wait 5 minutes before matchmaking again. This is at least daily.\n\nThe real icing on the cake, the straw that broke the camel's back and forced me to write this review, was the fact that three weeks ago they put out a new killer and survivor on the beta testing branch. It was buggy, it was beta testing. That's expected. Yesterday, the update got pushed to live, and most of the bugs literally are not even fixed. It's not like minor occasional bugs; these are constant visual and LITERALLY GAME-BREAKING BUGS that appear in EVERY MATCH. BHVR wants to be nominated on Steam for \"Labor of Love\", but in the entire year I've played this all I've learned is that [i]something[/i] in their pipeline is completely broken, because they don't make balance changes that are extremely obvious to everybody, they choose to release [i]objectively[/i] unfinished DLC for [i]actual money[/i] instead of delaying it and ironing out the bugs, and the entire game in general is a miserable experience that I put up with because I like chasing survivors and looping killers fairly. The way the game is designed makes it a drag to get to the core of that experience, and that's why this game upsets me. It has so much potential, but somehow they screw up so many simple, simple things.\n\nTL;DR: If you never get tilted at badly designed mechanics, plethoras of bugs, or random frame drops, Dead by Daylight is a fantastic game. If you do, try it at your own risk. It can suck you in and then you're like me, stuck and addicted, for some godforsaken reason, to a game that is broken and nothing but frustrating for an overwhelming majority of the time.","timestamp_created":1606949451,"timestamp_updated":1606949451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81491660","author":{"steamid":"76561198033238053","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":65,"playtime_at_review":11213,"last_played":1660037660},"language":"german","review":"Ich spiele das game schon seit 2 Jahren und es ist immer wieder ein erschreckender Moment da der immer wieder Eintritt.

Доставали дефицит, слушали пресные речи престарелых генсеков и ждали перемен. Нам смешно и грустно вспоминать ушедший век, советскую эпоху.
