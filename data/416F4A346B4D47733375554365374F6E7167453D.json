person and the survivors is in third person\n\n+ The fair price tags on the microtransactions (i.e. for 500 cells it is $5 which to me seems a fair exchange)\n\n+ The ability to have each individual

And out of the three the first one to start using would be Technician because it will save your life if you fail a skill check.)\n\nCons:\n\n- The mixed amount of skill checks on the generator (e.g. I had one game where I was repairing a generator with zero perks equipped and no one helping me repairing and I only got three skill checks the whole time I was doing it then in the same match the next generator and I had someone helping me repair I had 12 skill checks and the killer never damaged it as I started it from scratch)\n\n- The only way to earn iridescent shards from leveling your personal profile and not at the end of each match (or trial as they call it in the game)\n\n- How much all the cosmetic items cost with the iridescent shards\n\n","timestamp_created":1536576902,"timestamp_updated":1536576902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44666148","author":{"steamid":"76561198224142376","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7729,"last_played":1659035995},"language":"russian","review":"там маньяк убийца бегает рубит врагов","timestamp_created":1536576389,"timestamp_updated":1536576389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44665915","author":{"steamid":"76561198106222413","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":50898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13754,"last_played":1655092875},"language":"english","review":"This is the coolest game ever!

Switching over to PC and playing at 60 fps cap constant is a whole new experience, I love the PTB access as well but one thing that I will always say to people about the developers of this game. They try their damn hardest to please and respect their community even though it's packed with toxic people, survivors who teabag, pallet loop, comment \"ez\" at the end of the game or the killer who get triggered when they don't get a single sacrifice, body blocked because they tunnel, all the fancy stuff dbd have to offer etc.\n\nThe 4v1 asymmetric survival horror game puts the player as either a survivor or killer where the objective is to either escape and survive or kill the survivors depending on your role. Despite the survival side of the game, there really isn't any horror, I have never been that spooked by this game besides the odd times when mike myers sneaks up on you, I wouldn't shy away from this game if you saw the word horror and thought I don't want to play that, it might scare me. Trust me, it won't.\n\nGraphically, the game looks good with a variety of different maps to change the game however it does feel like overtime the maps get stale and reptitive, I wouldn't mind dlc of just 4/5 new maps instead of the generic 1 new killer, 1 new survivor, 6 perks, addons, offerings and 1 map. I feel some maps are boring and don't really excite me to play.\n\nGameplay wise the game is fun and enjoyable especially when you first start off since the matchmaking puts you in a balanced lobby (noobs with noobs). As time passes and you start to decrease your level around to 15-10 you start to realise the toxicity and negativity the community so kindly offers to you. It sometimes makes me wanna quit the game just because of how some people take critism for their bad actions. Also, get used to the constant topics, discussions, blogs, youtube videos talking about nerfs and buffs to survivors or killers. Unfortunately, some players will not like the changes in new patches and that's why the devs cannot find cutting edge to balanced and unbalanced.\n\nPlaying as survivor is much more enjoyable than the killer, unless being teamed on and dealing with 4 people at once is your style then I guess you can enjoy it too, but personally after playing killer fairly and still getting comments like \"toxic camper\" even though I despise of camping and hope they punish campers in future patches, playing killer isn't as enjoyable for me personally.\n\nPerks, offerings and items seems to be the deal breaker in games, it can basically make or break the game as some items are ridiculous especially in higher quantities like Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe for med kits and Odd Bulb for flashes, luckily they tweaked Brand New Part for toolboxes so gen rushing isn't as extreme but is still a huge problem in this game\n\nI could talk and critique this game all day tbf.\n\nWith well over 300 hours across PC and Xbox I can say this is definitely one of my top 5 favourite games just for the content it has to offer, especially with free killers and survivors on the odd occassion, the licensed and dlc content, the maps and the introduction to the marketplace. The game is enjoyable especially with friends and the progression system is very rewarding and unique to any game I've seen.\n\nOnly thing I'd advise is to watch out for the toxicity\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1536538628,"timestamp_updated":1536538628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":59,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.740254223346710205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44660748","author":{"steamid":"76561198168517775","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":128156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1890,"playtime_at_review":65176,"last_played":1660578052},"language":"english","review":"I'm a killer main and althought the survivors bully sometimes, its pretty fun to play ;).
