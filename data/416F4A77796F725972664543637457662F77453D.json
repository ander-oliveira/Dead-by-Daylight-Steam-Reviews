While some of the pros of this game is the consistent updates and new content that the developers continually push, the cons of this game simply outweigh the new content to an absurd degree.  As I am sure you will read, or have already read, there is something of a dispute among the community about which side is more over powered; killers or survivors?  Hands down the answer is that the game favors the killers without question.  If you do happen to purchase this game, as a new player be ready to face a constant barrage of killers that use this very effective and unoriginal perk combination:  BBQ & Chili and Hex: No One Escapes Death.  Coupled with two killers who wield chainsaws with the ability to one shot you, multiple killers who have abilities that allow them to practically teleport across the map, and you have a wonderful recipe of overpowered killers running at you right from the very beginning. \n\nWhatever \"balance\" people speak of, it really doesn't exist in this game.  I've lost count of how many times teammates have intentionally disconnected during a game due to rage quitting and there are no reparations for being abandoned.  You simply get to be beat on by the killer that much more.\n\nEnd game is joke, where if you are the last survivor you essentially have zero chance of winning.  If you do manage to evade the killer, you'll never get a door open before they swarm you.  If you're not lucky enough to either have the hatch spawn next to you or lucky enough to locate it before the killer, you won't make it out.  The best you can hope for is that you run out the end game timer and let the entity kill you but you still don't get anything for that either.\n\nOn the flip side, if you play a killer the wait time for matches is ridiculously long.\n\nLastly, the community is just toxic in general.  I've enjoyed a few matches with some quality players  but all in all the community is just rancid.  Killer players are poor winners and continuously show poor sportsmanship by delivering late hits even after they've won.  Constant taunting after matches, acting like they somehow won a championship or an award, its really quite pathetic.\n\nI originally became aware of this game through videos posted by Ohmwrecker and initially I was generally pleased with the game.  But after logging some quality hours, I'm sad to say that this game simply doesn't live up to the potential that it has as it favors catering to the killer class and leaves the survivors out in the cold.","timestamp_created":1586399575,"timestamp_updated":1586399575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66928812","author":{"steamid":"76561199017259171","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1655594541},"language":"english","review":"Super damn fun.

There is nothing else out there that comes remotely close to a player/killer survival game like Dead by Daylight. Half of the characters are movie characters, so what's there to complain about? \n\nYou've got great perk-sets for both the killer and the survivors, helpful add-ons and abilities, and it's almost completely balanced.\n\nI do say almost, however, because there are a lot of ways for survivors to bully the killer now. Because of how biased it is, it becomes almost impossible to not camp as the killer, which decreases points earned for the match. \n\nAlthough, the developers actually listen to feedback and are constantly doing their best to balance the game in a way that's easy for everybody; whether they are experienced or not. They've even fixed the loading times (which used to be atrocious) so that games can be found quicker. Granted, sometimes for survivors now it takes a long time, but I think if the playerbase were to increase, this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10 and highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good fright or a good kill!","timestamp_created":1586397846,"timestamp_updated":1586397846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66927172","author":{"steamid":"76561198841629465","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":42,"playtime_at_review":6778,"last_played":1660391962},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然112小时，但我依然是个菜鸡，杀鸡就是这么朴实无华，且枯燥","timestamp_created":1586397049,"timestamp_updated":1586397049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66927152","author":{"steamid":"76561198991702763","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1857,"last_played":1631183184},"language":"schinese","review":"休闲游戏，不恐怖，值得推荐，但是游戏形式太单一了，玩久了可能会腻\n","timestamp_created":1586397030,"timestamp_updated":1586397030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66927139","author":{"steamid":"76561198409424539","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1977,"last_played":1639514324},"language":"koreana","review":"앙 기뭬리","timestamp_created":1586397005,"timestamp_updated":1586397005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512658238410949707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66927029","author":{"steamid":"76561198882061269","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1373,"last_played":1656078655},"language":"english","review":"Scary af","timestamp_created":1586396856,"timestamp_updated":1586396856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66927005","author":{"steamid":"76561198072127164","num_games_owned":1068,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":23000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14759,"last_played":1656194979},"language":"english","review":"For [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Behaviour%20Interactive%20Inc.] Behaviour Interactive Inc.[/url]'s Dead by Daylight, I almost wish there was an \"Okay\" button for recommendation when writing a review. But for the amount of gameplay and fun I've had while playing this game, I'll tip it over to the recommended status.\n\nThis game is community based. It comes down to a gameplay mechanic where four players take the roles of survivors, whose goal is to repair the generators located across the map, while another player chases them down as the killer, sacrificing them to the great and mysterious \"Entity\" that controls the realm. The people at Behaviour is working hard to make their gears turn around in this game, though some players constantly complain on certain mechanics, on some which I agree with.\n\nI like the game. It's a simple and fun goal. The most fun experience will be playing this with 1-3 other friends, handling different killers and learning to adapt to their different powers and strategies. The dev's are keeping some tabs on the mechanics as well. They nerf certain perks and tools that are overpowered, and they constantly add new content to the game. Some of the content feels (a bit) similar, like the Oni and the Spirit for example. But what I like the most is that they constantly work towards adding famous slasher-movie killers into the game. \n\nFamous killers like [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/530711/Dead_by_Daylight__The_Halloween_Chapter/]Michael Myers[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/700282/Dead_by_Daylight__A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street/] Freddy Krueger[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/700280/Dead_by_Daylight__Leatherface/] Leatherface[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1089270/Dead_by_Daylight_Ghost_Face/] Ghost Face[/url] and even the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135280/Dead_by_Daylight__Stranger_Things_Chapter/]Stranger Things Chapter[/url], adding both survivor and killer characters. Additional Content like this is beautiful for a playerbase that a game like this would attract, and I love that the developers think that way too. My only hope is that for the future, the development will not resort to spitting out lousy killer-ideas for some quick bucks. Their latest idea was a hit, so I personally hope they will keep investing time and creativity into their ideas.\n\nSome mechanics would still need improvement though. Joining a lobby as a killer could take some time due to an imbalance in survivor-players and killer-players. Players do complain about certain overpowered killer and survivor perks, the hitbox being too easy to hit for killers, some killerpowers being overpowered. I somewhat agree with some of them as well, but it does not ruin the game for me. And then there's the community. I mostly encounter alright people, but you will find some toxicity here. It's not League of Legends, but people here can spit a lot of trashtalk your way and hassle players.\n\nIn overall, I enjoy the game. I think it's a great idea and well made for a development team with the resources that Behaviour Interactive has. There are a lot of hours' worth of gameplay, as you're able to grind your way to earning every perk on every killer/survivor. They've added Rift challanges, making it easier and more fun to complete tasks for the main currency and level up your characters. They are constantly working on improving the game by adding content and fixing imbalanced mechanics. It is worth your time, if you are the type to enjoy this kind of game, and willing to give it a chance.\n\nI'm having a lot of fun with Dead by Daylight, and I'll keep playing it for years to come.","timestamp_created":1586396803,"timestamp_updated":1592413284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444444417953491211","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66927004","author":{"steamid":"76561198382740545","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5839,"last_played":1591389025},"language":"english","review":"This

If you're just here wondering if the community is as toxic as everyone says it is ... well, yes, it is. I wouldn't say it's any more or less toxic than the communities you'd find in CS:GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. ... but post-game chat can definitely frighten off a new player.\n\nIf you're new to the game, I highly recommend playing it with one or more experienced friends who can coach you. If you don't have a thick skin or much patience, playing solo right off the bat will likely make you rage quit. That being said, a lot of people will only have fun with DbD if they're playing with friends. And that's okay and completely fair. The basis of 4v1 gameplay is cooperation, and you can't guarantee that a random is going to have your back.\n\nThere was a period where I took this game very seriously, and it ruined it for me for a while. After taking a break, I came back and swore I'd only play it for fun anymore, disconnecting the second I felt myself getting even slightly salty or competitive (EDIT ~ I can't even believe that I have to say this, but I'll take partial blame for it because of my wording. After someone took the time to go to my profile and flame me for this review instead of commenting right below where I could actually respond, I felt the need to clarify that I did not mean that I disconnect in-game. I'll finish a match and quit playing. I'll admit that \"disconnect\" wasn't the correct word, and I should've just said \"stop playing\". You could've said that instead of just criticizing me altogether when you've never played with me. Truly, the toxicity over the wording I'm leaving here in my review proves how right I am about the community, eh? But anyone who has spent time playing DbD knows it all-too-well.)\n\nI'm a survivor main, but I enjoy playing killer every once in a while. I think it's extremely important for every DbD player to experience playing killer. You'll have toxicity in-game and post-game when you're a survivor, but there's really nothing that can prepare you for post-game chat when you're the killer. I tend to minimize the chat so I don't see it, or I change my username to something friendly (which no one should have to do, but I'm a lover, not a fighter). While playing killer can help thicken your skin against the community, it's really helpful in learning to be a better teammate while playing survivor. There's also a killer for everyone. While I want to be the best with every killer in the game, I've succumbed to the fact that it's just not a possibility for me and tried every killer until I found one that matched my play style.\n\nI do have a lot of gripes about the developers, as do most players. Every update seems to fix something but break something else. Server lag is atrocious, and, lately, matchmaking is a complete joke (you're supposed to be matched with players on your skill level, but it's really not unusual to be shoved into a lobby with players way below or way above your skill level anymore). Certain perks are broken, hitboxes are BS, and you'll be kicked from lobbies, menus, and matches, requiring you to have to restart the game completely.\n\nIf you need a friendly face to play this game with, you can add me. I'm serious. There are kind and gentle players in this game, and they're honestly the ones who kept me around when I first started playing. I'll never forget my first time playing killer in a public match. I was nervous and played terribly. Post-game chat, a more experienced player encouraged me: \"You're a good killer - just watch your tracking.\" They hung around and gave me some advice for practicing. Granted, every post-game after that was toxic ... but that energized me enough to keep trying. I try to reciprocate that to newer players when I can.","timestamp_created":1586387112,"timestamp_updated":1586387112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66920165","author":{"steamid":"76561198822536325","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1388,"last_played":1658369696},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito divertido, jogo pelo Xbox e criei uma nova conta justamente para jogar pelo PC tb, me divirto, dou risada, tomo susto, tudo em uma única partida lol.","timestamp_created":1586386845,"timestamp_updated":1586386845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66920111","author":{"steamid":"76561198433845474","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1611475397},"language":"spanish","review":"es muy divertido y entretenido entre amigos XD para pasarla un rato","timestamp_created":1586386777,"timestamp_updated":1586386777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66919884","author":{"steamid":"76561198068657742","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1658346921},"language":"english","review":"chainsaw dude runs","timestamp_created":1586386471,"timestamp_updated":1586386471,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66919788","author":{"steamid":"76561198259372016","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20856,"last_played":1649658935},"language":"english","review":"Its just poggers boys","timestamp_created":1586386338,"timestamp_updated":1586386338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66919631","author":{"steamid":"76561198280166688","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":22715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17900,"last_played":1615758647},"language":"english","review":"lol","timestamp_created":1586386132,"timestamp_updated":1586386132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66919536","author":{"steamid":"76561198367569765","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1660448668},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mto bom, só falta um chat de voz pra ficar otimo","timestamp_created":1586385991,"timestamp_updated":1586385991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66919037","author":{"steamid":"76561198134922587","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":14744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8083,"last_played":1657246487},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ah, é baum.
