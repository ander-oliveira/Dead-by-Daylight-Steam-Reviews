When you first start out on survivor, you'll be a bit flustered because you have to learn some techniques to keep yourself alive longer. The real problems that I have with the game are the killer matchmaking and the MMR system (if they go through with it). MMR doesn't work in an unbalanced game like this since there are too many variables that can swing the match in one way or another, but killer matchmaking is frustrating. I am rank 20 (the lowest, haven't played killer much) and I have constantly been matched up with survivors who are much higher than me. On average, I am against a team of rank 12-17 survivors which keeps me from learning which killer suits my playstyle since they all escape anyways. If they would ensure that similar ranks were matched (e.g. not having a rank 20 killer vs 4 rank 13 survivors), I would easily recommend this game to anyone interested in playing","timestamp_created":1581042841,"timestamp_updated":1581042841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63083109","author":{"steamid":"76561197980258071","num_games_owned":602,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":18504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16282,"last_played":1637806241},"language":"english","review":"Game good.

Pretty boring. Killer sided despite what people say. I mean they are griping about the only four perks that give survivors the neccessary edge to actually escape and youtubers only talk about the most sweatiest of sweaty survivors but in reality they don't exist in public matches. If killers want so badly to be faced against survivors they just need the ability to toggle facing swf groups. I mean they gave us that ability to toggle off crossplay why not toggle the ability to turn of in pregame and endgame chat as well as swf groups. Course when your constantly facing killers that proxy camp and tunnel low skilled survivors out of the game with no penalty except the risk of them doing gens while the survivor is hooked. But let's face it the hooked survivor would rather kill themselves on hook than wait it out allowing the camping killer to move to the next target faster or god forbid all three survivors go in and be the second victim on hook because all the hooks are within camping distance from each other now. Place while there is plenty of anti-tunneling perks there is only two petty anti-camping perk which is steve's kinship perk but requires other survivors to get close and kindred which let's face it either causes the other survivors to ignore the fact that there is a killer nearby because they want to be a frickin hero, the killer has stealth or insidious and all survivors are stupid enough to not take that into account or waltzes around not doing anything but hiding. No gens no totems just running around like a headless chicken. There is no penalty perks for survivors facing a campers, so campers get griped at but let's face it survivors it is allowed because behavior made it so. If anyone is to be blamed it's behavior for allowing this. Until there is a survivor perk that gives a severe penalty for killer camping survivors  until they are in the next stage of the hook it is pretty killer sided and thanks to all the youtubers and streamers taking this route and exposing this it's the norm now. Killers win by killing at least 3 survivors the 4th is considered optional survivors win when all generators are fixed and exit through the gate while 2 or more survive. Killers gain more bloodpoints than survivors and most killers have pretty good anti-loop which are needed for survivors to actually have a chance to win but since anti-loop killer exist now the scales tip further towards killers favor in all. Prove to me that newbies, intermediaries, early mmr experts are capable of winning 4 games in a row daily without dieing then I will be convinced that it is not killer sided. Otherwise leave a comment to show everyone interested in the game that it's community just want to troll, start trouble and leave toxic hateful comments because they are desperate to say I am wrong when actually I am right.

Le nuove mappe sono unicamente belle da vedere, terrificanti da giocare specialmente per il killer che si ritrova ormai in una succursale dell'Ikea. Dall'altro lato, l'hitbox è tra le peggiori in circolazione, con killer che letteralmente proiettano le mani in avanti come Mazinga. \n\nIl matchmaking a questo punto è totalmente rotto e i futuri aggiornamenti lo romperanno ancora di più. Il problema principale di questo titolo è la voragine che si spalanca tra giocatori ormai veterani, dotati di tutte le perk, centinaia di add-on e quant'altro e giocatori che appena iniziano ad approcciarsi ai ranghi più alti, dove le magagne del sistema diventano davvero rilevanti.\n\nFintanto che gli sviluppatori non estrarranno la testa dal c**o ed inizieranno a ragionare su aggiornamenti ben programmati e modifiche oculate, mi trovo a dover sconsigliare l'acquisto.\n\nNon lasciatevi illudere dalle numerose patch e promesse: ad ogni nuovo personaggio e killer, ad ogni nuova patch e aggiunta, il gioco si rompe ancora di più.\n\n\n***************************************************************************\n[Di seguito la \"precedente\" recensione.]\n\nAvete sempre desiderato impersonare il killer malvagio che senza pietà stermina disarmati ed innocenti individui, senza alcun motivo se non per soddisfare i vostri impulsi folli e crudeli?\n\nSe la risposta è sì... fatevi curare, ignobili mostri! \n\nPer aiutarvi nel processo di liberarvi da queste tendenze sadiche, potete provare questo multiplayer assimetrico 4 vs 1, dove un killer spietato deve uccidere 4 poveri cristi rinchiusi nel suo cortiletto.\n\nPotete giocare come mostro assassino oppure essere uno dei 4 imbecilli che deve fuggire ad ogni costo per non finire in pasto ad un entità malvagia che ha le zampe pelose di un ragno, quindi chiaramente cattivissima.\n\nSvariati killer, svariati sfigati disarmati, svariate mappe create proceduralmente, svariati oggetti e perk, svariati russi antipatici che vi rovineranno ogni partita, community che rappresenta perfettamente la schizofrenia morale e sociale umana, svariati oggetti di personalizzazione per lo più a pagamento, svariati DLC che però sono in sconto tipo un giorno sì e uno anche...\n\nInsomma, se avete il male dentro e vi sale il crimine e non sapete come placarlo... non comprate questo gioco perché ogni tanto vi salirà ancora di più, sopratutto ai livelli più alti. Se invece cercate un titolo divertente e competitivo, ottimo per cinque amici che vogliono avere buoni ragioni per odiarsi, DBD fa per voi!","timestamp_created":1581008753,"timestamp_updated":1642786450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577548027038574219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63065048","author":{"steamid":"76561198388883263","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":24304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18930,"last_played":1658659792},"language":"schinese","review":"爽就完事了","timestamp_created":1581008646,"timestamp_updated":1581008646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63064992","author":{"steamid":"76561198329373875","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8904,"last_played":1601441098},"language":"english","review":"pretty
