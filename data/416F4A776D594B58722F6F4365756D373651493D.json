About the toxcity tho the game just divides the player base killer vrs survivors.Play killer and ur against 4 other people I heard the term bulling at some degree and then killers can camp hooks which to  me as  new player u know theres no where says I cant but survivors will grief you after the match for it. I probably sound very biased killer main but when I played survivor it didn't excite me like killer does.\n\nGame\nBut ignoring all that shit This is a fun game I mean I love pyrimad head(a killer) Ive prestige him like 3 times now and hes fun to play hard to master which is why I like trying to get better with him.\n\nThere is a bit more negatives but it comes down to crossing paths of finding matches and farming blood points the curreny to lvl up your killer/survivor. Wait times can be long and theres a bit more wait time when u find a match even tho the player base is quite healthy along with being cross-play. This isnt a BR but it takes more time load in 5 players then 100 in actual BR game.Last issue I have is FOV is a perk and I like a wide FOV very odd this game choose to do this and if in the future they took away the perk and made it standard in options like in every game out there I do believe survivor backlash incoming because the slot the was fov can now be taken for any perk.\n\nadded note their are mirco-transactions so its up to you weather u think their fair or not in terms of their prices .But I had to pay for Pyrimad head with real money cus grinding ingame currency takes to long imo.\n\nI came from team based games and now that I can play killer its very nice to not have to worry about other people then myself.If your solo gamer like myself the game is rewarding. \n","timestamp_created":1625091785,"timestamp_updated":1625785406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94766978","author":{"steamid":"76561198057224555","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1095,"last_played":1626812738},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, usem pampers para jogar!","timestamp_created":1625091679,"timestamp_updated":1625091679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94766585","author":{"steamid":"76561199177188160","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1657471939},"language":"schinese","review":"前一个st号丢了，这次看到5周年，特地回来买上，正在买DLC，希望游戏越来越好","timestamp_created":1625091200,"timestamp_updated":1625091200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94766189","author":{"steamid":"76561198125486916","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2541,"last_played":1656210321},"language":"portuguese","review":"Se vocês querem um jogo para jogar com os amigos e se divertir, Dead By Daylight com toda certeza NÃO é o jogo para isso, o jogo é extremamente desequilibrado, o sobrevivente não possui vantagem alguma, além de correr na mesma velocidade um paraplégico, fazer barulhos o tempo todo e quando está machucado então, minha nossa, parece que o personagem saiu de um filme pornô, já o Killer, tem uma velocidade que faria o flash ter inveja, ele consegue alcançar distancias incriveis com os seus ataques, as vezes até mesmo copiando o teletransporte do Goku em todos os momentos, ele pode te rastrear, te ouvir a distancia, obviamente tem a localização de todos os geradores podendo assim ir de 1 em 1 para achar sobreviventes, e a quantidade de ganchos para pendurar os jogadores é 1 a cada metro cubico, se você chutar um arbusto, cai 5 ganchos para o killer te pendurar, além do mais, alguns killers tem HITKILL, ou seja, super velocidade, super alcance, teletransporte, telepatia, olfato, localização espiritual e fisica, praticamente um ser onisciente, todas as vantagens vão para o killer e  a unica vantagem do sobrevivente, é poder quitar do jogo e desinstalar para nunca mais voltar, o que eu altamente recomendo vocês a fazerem.

From issues like simple visual bugs that could have easily been noticed in the main menu if they did any sort of testing before-hand, to many bugs making the new killer unplayable sometimes, and the new perks just literally not working. The PTB was better working than the chapter itself. This will be a recurring theme.\n\nAll Kill\n\nA chapter which was released with terrible desync. All Kill also had a game breaking bug, where killers couldn't be stunned by pallets most of the time, it took them 36 DAYS TO FIX THIS. The other issue with it was the Killer. How the developers thought that the Trickster was in any way a good killer when they sent out the PTB, I will never know. Everyone and their grandma collectively gave BHVR feedback for the PTB Trickster. He went live and was almost the exact same. Until the next patch 15 days later when he was made slightly better. While he may be fun and unique, he is still one of the worst killers in the game to this day. They have basically left him untouched since. The chapter is remembered by all as the chapter that made Blight and Wraith better. That was it. which by the way, it took them NINE MONTHS to fix Blight's POV. It took them even longer to buff Wraith's movement speed and nerf Windstorm.\n\nResident Evil\n\nThe Resident Evil Chapter. The licensed Anniversary chapter. It'll be really good right? The PTB seems good, new map seems iffy but oh well. Nemesis needs a few small buffs with tiering up his power. The survivor perks are good, the killer perks are meh, but oh well the Killer looks fun as hell. This will bring so many new players to the game, this'll be a good game for Resident Evil fans to enjoy. OH MY GOD IT'S BINDING OF KIN ALL OVER AGAIN. NO. FUCK. GO BACK. This chapter probably made every new Resident Evil fan look at the game and then immediately leave it. The mountain of bugs are obvious. Console is practically unplayable, the new map is disabled an hour after the game comes out, BHVR linked the new skins into sets so you have to spend more auric cells and buy the same exact head pieces as the default ones. But hey, they gave everyone 300k to make up for the shitty chapter launch and help with the terrible game grind right? Speaking of which.\n\n\n\nCommunity Issues and complaints\n\n\nThe Grind\n\nThe Grind for this game for the last year has been ridiculous. Survivors have 95 perks in total, 3 tiers for each perk. That's 285 PERKS FOR SURVIVOR ALONE. Killers have 84 perks, once again 3 tiers for each. Adding up to 252 perks you have to buy if you want every perk on ONE KILLER. Perk tiers were made back when there were three killers, essentially having there be a total of 30-ish perks. With the tiers being something to work towards. It inflated a small number for gameplay reasons. But nowadays, with both sides having around about 90 perks the tier system in entirely unnecessary. People have complained about the grind for the past year or two, and the complaints will get more relevant with each addition of a chapter. The community has suggested that tiers should just be removed all together. BHVR has done what BHVR does best. They stubbornly refuse to communicate with the community. Otzdarva barely made it to P3 level 50 WITHOUT GETTING ALL OF THE PERKS. This man has 6,694 hours in DBD, saves every challenge he does for the BP, plays the game as his job, and still barely had enough BP saved up to get Nemesis to P3 Lvl 50 as fast as he possibly could. He had to go through all of the tutorials to just barely make it to P3 level 50. The grind for this game is insane, and the cherry on top is the Bloodpoint cap that BHVR still hasn't removed from the game for some unknown reason. I don't think anything about prestiging should be changed however, prestiging is just more of a flex in games. It serves no advantage and if anything, hinders you by removing everything you own for that character. That's just how prestiging works in video games. Dead By Daylight doesn't have to be any different. But the community has begged BHVR to lower the grind. How does BHVR respond? They have turned events into extra BP focused weeks.\n\nThe Events\n\nBHVR has changed every event in the game into a diet, off brand, discount, lazier version of it's older self. The Halloween and Chinese New Year events are the biggest examples. They originally gave killers and survivors side objectives, and gave players the chance to earn event currency to buy an event skin. They have since been replaced with, temporary use offerings that give everyone more BP. They have removed event currency, and made all event skins either a big Iri shard grind or $10. The Halloween event from last year still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I would link you to a Reddit post that someone made for the Eternal Blight event. But it's impossible to find since I never saved it. Last year there was no event currency, but every Eternal Blight skin was purchasable for Iri Shards. Someone did the math, and it would take almost every hour that the event was live to earn enough Iri shards to buy 1 or 2 skins. That's not including queue times and sleeping. After the community bitched enough, they lowered the price of the skins to 9k Iri shards each, and gave out Iri shards daily for the event.\n\nu/Zillence made a post better comparing the modern issues of the game today, as compared to the past. His post is worth a read, it does a better job explaining how the devs have gotten slower and less transparent as time went on than this post.\n\nNow I know you're falling asleep reading this, or rolled your eyes a sentence in and left. But please stay with me. Thank you for reading this far.\n\n\n\nThe Boycott\n\n\nBHVR has no other big games. They have no other competition. All of their chips are in on DBD. At some point along the way, both BHVR and the Community forgot that the community has the power to decide whether DBD succeeds or fails. BHVR has gotten slow and somewhat greedy with DBD. They are leading the game down a path that if continued could lead to the poor health of the game we all love. Another Boycott was suggested earlier the day I posted my Proposition post. They suggested we stopped playing the game on June 26th and June 27th as a Strike against BHVR. Scott Jund made a video perfectly explaining why doing only that, won't work. You don't have to like Scott, but he's right. Just not playing the game as a strike won't do anything. BHVR loses nothing. We need to collectively stop giving money to BHVR for the next 3 months. Cosmetics, Rifts, Chapters and the next Chapter. BHVR would lose their main source of income if the community did this. If 25% of the community did this it would dent their income. If 50% of the community did this it would vastly harm BHVR. If 75% or higher did this it could ruin BHVR. We have that power, not this subreddit, but the community as a whole. Think about that for a second. I AM NOT PROPOSING WE DESTROY BHVR! But we need to remind BHVR that the community should be listened to, or else they could lose their cash cow.\n\nFor the people that immediately assume it won't work and we shouldn't try. Whether it's because the subreddit is too small, or we will never band the rest of the community together to do something like this. Think about how we don't even need the whole community to do this. If 30-50% of the community did this is would work, and if this boycott gains enough traction it could go beyond the subreddit and become a general idea in the community.\n\nAll you have to do, is not spend your own money. Spare your wallet for the next 3 months of DBD. You can play the game, but don't buy any chapters for a bit. Don't buy those overpriced skins. If we do this it could potentially help the games health in the long run. Making a more enjoyable experience for everyone that plays the game.\n\nYou contributing helps the game in the long run.

It is such a thrill to hide from a stalking killer, sneak around, and making gutsy moves to save your fellow survivors. It is even more fun when coordinating with friends (four people can play survivor together), but tbh playing with random people online is a gamble, sometimes you get amazing teammates and sometimes you're on your own. The different survivor perks cater to different styles of play, and you can have a couple of survivors built differently to mix up your games to keep things interesting, although a lot of the best perks are DLC.\n\nPlaying as Killer is a blast, and what I play when none of my friends are available. It is really satisfying to win a match and even close games are so much fun. All of the different killers have unique ways of playing, so you can mix up your games as you like, or find the style you enjoy and stick to it. Like survivors, a lot of the best perks are DLC, which can be a bad thing, but DBD keeps their DLC relatively cheap and regularly goes on sale.\n\nThey're constantly coming out with new survivors, killers, and maps, so the game is always changing and staying fresh. I'm the kind of person who gets bored quickly with games, and this one has managed to keep my attention longer than expected. As I said before, it's best played with friends, but the solo killer mode is equally fun.","timestamp_created":1625085257,"timestamp_updated":1625085257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94761074","author":{"steamid":"76561199087986003","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1659072014},"language":"english","review":"\"I think we did a pretty good job so far\"","timestamp_created":1625085152,"timestamp_updated":1625085152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94761040","author":{"steamid":"76561198114128754","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":11751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3968,"last_played":1656908214},"language":"latam","review":"JUEGA JUEGA!
