Luckily, if tried enough it does eventually work. It seems to work better now than it did before but, the problem still remains a bit.\n\nAnother thing that really annoys me is how the heck did the survivors even end up there. There's no cutscene or anything and the place is pretty much walled off. It makes no sense.\n\n\nPROS+\n=====\n- good scary survival fun against a killer player\n- very challenging and unpredictable\n- can be killer or survivor\n- great idea for a horror game\n- very realistic feeling and style (could be improved more some hopefully in future updates..)\n- can be tough fun trying to shake killer once he finds you but it is possible to get away and also to escape\n- constant updates to this game and new dlc added often\n\n\nCONS-\n=====\n- trying to maintain a decent stock of items in your inventory is annoying\n- level up is super slow and takes forever\n- have to join about 1-2 games since occasionally the first game won't connect\n- maps aren't really very big and should be somewhat larger\n- not enough hiding spots with variance (its all the same thing over and over)\n- rarely get to be killer because it takes a long time before survivors will join you\n- no option to rejoin same game with the last group of players you played with unless it's private\n- private match doesn't always load and gets stuck on loading screen\n- private match survivor characters will sometimes load as killer's character mesh in t-pose\n- other players constantly leaving after joining so it takes about 5-10 minutes before you can play a game finally (I believe this is because they are all having the same connection problem)\n- odds of surviving are not in the survivors favor (3-4 caught | sacrified to 1-2 escape ratio)\n- there's no real way to fight back at all other than trying to wiggle to release yourself, and escape (not very realistic since you should at least be able to find a weapon and such in the environment to protect yourself somehow though that's not what the game was designed for but it would make a lot more sense since shining a flashlight at  the killer is not ideal)\n- sometimes you are trying to keep an eye out for the killer not to catch you and somehow you won't get any notice until it's too late (your heartbeat doesn't do anything as it should or there's nothing to indicate he's nearby which is supposed to happen)\n- nothing to stop killers from camping too much at a hooked player site so your team is pretty much screwed and you are left with no choice but to let the other player die even if you wanted to try to save them for extra points (luckily, some killers are nice players that walk away for a bit to go hunt down other players intentionally to offset that problem)\n- ever since I last played they've now added 2 more stupid things to take away the fun mainly the killer can now slow down repairing the generators and players require help to heal themselves especially after being hooked or if taken too much damage to get up off the ground making it even tougher to make it as a survivor, it was hard enough to survive before so now its even worse!\n- there's now this stupid thing in there that if you get hurt too much you have to wait til another \nliving player can finish saving you or you're screwed which is the worst mechanic ever and really puts this game in favor of killer players, its no longer fair to survivor players, what a waste of a good game, great job behavior and starbreeze for ruining your own game\n- 9 times out of 10, a chased survivor will get all the survivors caught or killed at some point","timestamp_created":1466255628,"timestamp_updated":1541170245,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550981640815734863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23632093","author":{"steamid":"76561198053283243","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":7730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1445,"last_played":1655993264},"language":"english","review":"This

The new killers feel like playing a whole new beta just without the relative smoothness of the first one, I often get controller keys popping up for me even though I'm using a mouse and keyboard. I never experienced any crashes during the beta and yet within my first 5 minutes of playing I already had d/cs and crashes. \n\nMy main issue though was the new killers. The hillbillys chainsaw just feels....eh. The revving isnt really that intimidating but thats more of a preference. But his charge, its SO buggy, every time i tried to use it i would just get stuck on terrain that clipped through my feet and end up just swinging at nothing, or better yet i would get bounced off and sent flying in a different direction, and THEN swing at nothing. The wraith isn't that bad but hes just so underwhelming. Going \"invisible\" doesnt even make you fully invisible and then you have to wait about 3 seconds to do anything once you uncloak.\n\nBack on the cheaters issue it seems like its painfully easy to just modify your save file to give yourself unlimited bloodpoints without having to actually play the game. Granted the game just fully launched but this is a huge thing the devs really need to get on instead of \"hair fixes\"\n\nI really hope they fix this stuff and I'd be more than willing to play the game again then but as it stands it looks like this game really is going down the drain right out the gate.\n\nEDIT: Just a sidenote but the same balance issues that were prevalent in the beta are still in the game. (Hook camping is NOT a balance issue since the killer is pretty much deranking himself by just sitting there.) Window spamming makes survivors invencible unless you're playing the trapper and already trapped one of the juke shacks, disconnecting as killer STILL makes everyone eat a loss, and survivors can disconnect to make the killer lose out on his potential points and take a demotion.","timestamp_created":1466249666,"timestamp_updated":1466251462,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48172760009765625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630609","author":{"steamid":"76561197983502938","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":11037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2631,"last_played":1647131206},"language":"english","review":"This game nails everything you want from a slaher film made into a game.

Even tho i'm pretty bad at this game i'm hugely impressed by it and hope to see a good community about it. \n\nIs there issues? Yes. \n\nThe game has a few bugs and the dex didn't seem to understand that people have friends they want to player with... Which seems pretty obtuse. However they are open about what they are doing and are actively wroking on features the feedback from players has produced. \n\nThere is no communication in the game and i understand why, There seems to be alot of complaint aimed at this but i honestly think chat in game would ruin the atmosphere too the game.

But your actions are show intent anyway. \n\nOverall brillant game that needs a bit of polish which they are currently applying.","timestamp_created":1466249297,"timestamp_updated":1466249297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630586","author":{"steamid":"76561198097590768","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1561593819},"language":"schinese","review":"得分级制有问题  最后一个人类 被我击倒 然后人类强退 我掉分数 哎！","timestamp_created":1466249207,"timestamp_updated":1466249207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630576","author":{"steamid":"76561198011543643","num_games_owned":762,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":6563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3031,"last_played":1630881068},"language":"english","review":"Ha ha chainsaw go \"VRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMMM\"","timestamp_created":1466249143,"timestamp_updated":1597620095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630487","author":{"steamid":"76561198022867706","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1657547611},"language":"english","review":"BEST HORROR GAME EVER, GONNA BE BETTER ONCE THEY ADD THE PARTY SYSTEM","timestamp_created":1466248702,"timestamp_updated":1466248702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525065958499908447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630482","author":{"steamid":"76561198109084102","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":39787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1430,"last_played":1636916508},"language":"english","review":"Alright, after putting in 20 hours I feel I can fairly evaluate this game in its current state, also full disclosure approximately 95% of my time playing was from the perspective of the survivor. As of writing this review (6/18/16) the game has been officially released for around 4 days now and this raises some cons to this game that will hopefully be resolved soon. The devs have already put out one patch to address some of the bugs players have faced and while this shows that they're looking to positively support the game, many problems still remain that may warrant a hesitancy when deciding on whether to buy the game in its current state. While this game's concept is very clever and addictive, its early release harms it quite significantly. Before telling you why I recommend this game, first I'll tell you of the biggest problems this game suffers from at the time I'm writing this review.\n\n-Be aware of what you're buying-\nThis game has a wide array of bugs everything from simple lobby issues to game-harming problems such being stuck in a dying state where neither your teammates or the killer can interact with you, The other huge issue most people need to realize is that their is no way to party up with your friends as well as strangers. This means if you want to play with a friend and gain blood points you'll have to dodge lobbies until you happen to join the same one.  Being able to party up is a feature that has been promised to be added soon but really should have been added before being released, as this game shines brightest when co-operating with your friends. The last significant issue this game unfortunately suffers from is exploiting and cheating. Some players take advantage of disconnecting to retain their ranking, and some full-on shamelessly cheat, going so far as to have max perks on a level on character or having a level 100 character (the cap is 50). Though most players play the game fairly, there are always a few who exploit and while they're able to do so the game suffers for it. As annoying and unfortunate as these problems are there is still a wonderful gem of a game here to appreciate if you're willing to look past them. \n\n-Why its still worth buying-\nHave you ever played Cop's and Robber's? It's sort of like a more objective-based hide and seek game that's played at night. This game is essentially the same formula but with a wide array of added strategy and terror. Dead By Daylight manages to capture the adrenaline-fueled sheer terror that all horror games strive for, and it manages to keep it up every single match you play. From missing the skill check on a generator to narrowly escaping the killer in a heart-pounding chase: this game is exhilarating and nerve-wrecking at the same time. What's more, the more times you play the more layers of strategy you'll notice within the game. You'll probably lose the first few games when you play as a survivor, you might even be tempted to call the killer overpowered and question the developer's balance choices. Eventually though, you'll come to realize that while a new player playing the killer may have an advantage over a new survivor, an experienced team of survivors have many more tools and tricks at their disposal to take down even the most ruthless of killers. Knowing when to sprint, when to hide, when to repair and when to help your teammates are all vital skills you'll need to learn and hone if you want to survive against the powered up killer. \n\n-In Conclusion-\nOverall, Dead By Daylight is a challenging but extremely rewarding game that will truly test your skills and nerves nearly every match. Similar to the map variations, each match you play will be a different and unique experience of terror of the sort most other horror games strive for. If you're willing to look past the wide array of issues the game faces right now, you'll see a unique and shining gem with a formula that will surely continue to terrify players for many months to come, especially if the developers continue the passionate support they've shown thus far.","timestamp_created":1466248677,"timestamp_updated":1466248863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525065958499908447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630418","author":{"steamid":"76561198311374579","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":56027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1559,"last_played":1655260897},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩儿","timestamp_created":1466248414,"timestamp_updated":1466248414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630410","author":{"steamid":"76561198288855121","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":99,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":99,"last_played":1466186738},"language":"english","review":"It is funish i played for over 1 hour but the game does the same thing and gets old i only had fun playing with friends i might buy it again if more works goes into it","timestamp_created":1466248391,"timestamp_updated":1466248391,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421713560819625854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630360","author":{"steamid":"76561198063868429","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1466229135},"language":"schinese","review":"请把配置调低一点   让买了的人都能玩上！毕竟  大家都想玩   就因为   电脑配置跟不上","timestamp_created":1466248135,"timestamp_updated":1466248135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496551722288131714","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630357","author":{"steamid":"76561197991378350","num_games_owned":1156,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":83,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1466247403},"language":"japanese","review":"面白いっちゃ面白いけど……。\n結局追いかけっこ/かくれんぼしながら、逃げる方はちょっと宿題やりましょうっていう程度の味付けなのでそこが賛否別れる理由かと。\nルールがかなりシンプルで高度な連携などは余り必要ないので、他のゲームの合間に野良でも気軽にco-opしたいんだけどって人には打って付け。(というか、野良の方が面白いまである。「あいつを見捨ててでも俺は生き残るんだ！」的なホラー映画風ロールプレイをしても心が傷まないので)\n\nガチで遊ぶにはシンプル過ぎる＋バグがまだ多い。\nしかもバグがゲームの進行に支障をきたすレベルなのがまた……。\nオブジェクトにアクセスできなくなるバグは流石に勘弁して。","timestamp_created":1466248120,"timestamp_updated":1466248120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.705888152122497559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630350","author":{"steamid":"76561198089335396","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1659269609},"language":"danish","review":"Dette spil er super fedt, fed atmosfære, fede ide´er og ganske fornuftig grafik! \nNår det så er sagt, syntes jeg helt sikkert at den ene morder \"Klokke manden\" der har den ting at han kan gøre sig usynlig, skal laves en lille smule om, måske så der var en timer på usynligheden eller lignende da jeg nu flere gange er blevet mødt af en usynlig mand der bare camper, der hvor man har opgaver og kan blive ved med det i uendelighed! \nUd over det syntes jeg det er fedt at man som overlever er så hjælpeløs og underpowered! \n\nJa jeg anbefaler spillet og der bliver arbejdet på at gøre det endnu bedre med en masse bugfix der allerede er kommet + matchmaking med venner!","timestamp_created":1466248099,"timestamp_updated":1466248099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630347","author":{"steamid":"76561198158134182","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":22312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1894,"last_played":1582839288},"language":"russian","review":"Класная игра, может быть это и релиз но нужны фиксов по больше!

Das Spiel sollte mal Balanciert werden, man kann nicht mit seinem Team kommunizieren im Spiel, was es zusätzlich noch schwerer macht. mit einem Random Team verliert man immer. Das Rangsystem ist absoluter Mist, man braucht eine Grundzahl von Punkten sonst steigt man einen Rang ab, egal ob man gewinnt oder verliert. Wie gesagt der Killer ist viel zu stark, vorallem der Hinterwäldler oder auch Hillbilly sollte mit seiner Kettensäge Aufladungen haben und die nicht immer nach belieben schwingen dürfen. Nach nur 2 Treffern vom Killer am boden zu sein und dann noch auf Hilfe angewiesen zu sein ist eine unverschämtheit (mit dem Hinterwäldler Sekundärangriff nach einem Treffer). Die Entwickler haben sich bei diesem Spiel absolut nichts gedacht, selbst nach kürzlichem Patch gibt es noch jede menge Probleme in diesem Spiel. Diese Review ist für Leute die sich dieses Spiel holen wollen und nicht wirklich wissen ob es Spaß macht. Zur Zeit spielt fast jeder Killer weil diese eben viel zu stark sind für zufällig zusammengestellte Teams von Überlebenden. Es ist auch leider in diesem Spiel so das kaum jemand die Chance hat jemanden vom Haken zu holen wenn der Killer seine aufgehängten Leute campt und wartet bis diese sterben, das ist mit kombination das der Killer noch die Möglichkeit hat das \"Opfer\" das am Haken hängt und sowieso dem Tot geweiht ist weil er da campt noch ordentlich geschlagen wird, (was für mich absolut keinen Sinn macht). Das geschlagen werden am Haken bringt absolut nichts, nur das es auf den Geist geht. Irgendwann nach vielen Runden, werded auch ihr entschließen das Spiel zu \"refunden\" weil es absolut stimmt was Ich hier schreibe. Mein Tipp wenn ihr dieses Spiel kauft, testet es selber und macht eine Geld zurückerstattung wenn es euch genauso wenig wie mir gefällt. Ein Spiel bringt meißtens das übliche Ergebnis. Dieses Spiel werde ich positiv bewerten wenn: 1. Es Killernerfs, 2. Ein ordentliches Rangsystem, 3. Lagfreie Server und 4. Die unzähligen Bugs überarbeitet worden sind.

I don't recall ever seeing or hearing something like this, and it just works. Evading the killer and getting the generators up and running as a survivor is thrilling, and hunting and sacrificing the survivors as the killer is engaging. The systems are designed in a way that constantly demand conflict, with the killer being able to see all the generators and thus knowing where the survivors will want to go.\n\nYes, the actual gameplay is extremely fun, but there are some problems with the game that can make it somewhat frustrating. There's a noticeable amount of bugs and glitches in the game which sometimes break the matches, such as becoming completely untargetable by all other players (killer and survivors) - that can happen when bleeding out on the ground or hanging on the hook, which basically means you can't be saved anymore. But all the survivors can still see where you are and may try to come and help you, thus putting themselves in danger and not progressing on their objectives for absolutely no reward.\nSome of the design around the perks can be frustrating as well: You start out with absolutely nothing, but you may be matched with or against players who have several very powerful and game-changing abilities. When that happens, you pretty much feel useless which really isn't a feeling you want as a new player.\n\nAll that being said, I want to stress again that the actual game mechanics really are very fun and interesting. I've enjoyed it a lot both with random players and with friends in a private match - if the players are roughly of equal skill and with roughly equally valuable perks, the game really shines.","timestamp_created":1466247369,"timestamp_updated":1466247369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630185","author":{"steamid":"76561198017351486","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1465934389},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Класна і цікава гра в якій можна вбити всіх своїх друзів(і не тільки) багатьма цікавими способами!

Jedoch wurde ich auf Belangen eines guten Kollegen dazu überredet, die Closed Beta mitzuspielen; und schon nach wenigen Minuten konnte ich mir beim Spielen ein eindeutiges Muster machen.\n\nDead by Daylight ist wirklich ein pulsierendes und rasendes Horror-Survival Spiel, was zeigt wie langsam und vorsichtig man vorgehen muss, wenn ein Killer sich in der Gegend rumtreibt. Das Spiel basiert auf Zusammenarbeit und taktisches Verständnis, um den Killer effektiv auszutricksen. \nZiel der Survivor ist es (je nach Spieleranzahl) Generatoren wieder zum Laufen zu bringen, und das kann alleine ganz schön laaaange Dauern. Dabei sollte man sich natürlich nicht erwischen lassen :P ... dadurch kann man den Ausgang aktivieren und nur noch den Hebel umlegen und ... puh Freiheit\nWenn aber 3 Survivor tot sind, besteht auch noch die Chance durch eine Fallluke zu fliehen, doch die zufinden ist auch kein Zuckerschlecken. \nZiel des Killers ist es, die Survivor zur Strecke zu Bringen und sie dann qualvoll an einem Haken aufzuhängen, wo sie fast keine Chance haben loszukommen, es sei denn ein anderer Survivor rettet ihn. \nSoweit die Beschreibung des Spiels, nun kommen wir aber mehr in die Thematik und der Vor- und Nachteile:\n\n>Pros:<\n\n- sehr schön gezeichnet und visuell dargestellt, die Atmossphäre lässt einem wahrscheinlich eine Gänsehaut übrig. Man hat das Gefühl man ist mittendrin im Geschehen.\n- viele verschiedene Variationen der Spielinhalte (Items, Perks und Offerings/Opfergaben bieten zusätzliche Spielmöglichkeiten und geben dem Spiel einen kleinen Kick)\n- man hat einen ständigen Adrenalinspiegel: also wem da langweilig wird, den kann ich nicht verstehen \n- das Spielen als Survivor ist zwar schwer doch auch machbar, hier entscheidet zusammenarbeit und teamgeist (4 verschiedene Survivor alle auch mit besonderen Eigenschaften)\n- das Spielen als Killer ist einfach unglaublich, man fühlt sich wahrlich wie eine Killermaschine (3 verschiedene Killer für noch krassere Herausforderungen)\n- Ranked System für herausfordernde und motivierte, talentierte Spieler\n\n\n>Contras:<\n\n- bei allem Respekt, aber wie behindert kann man eigentlich sein, dass man Lobbys erstellt wo es keine Chance gibt, mit Freunden zu spielen im Ranked Modus <- ist übrigens (noch) die einzigste Möglichkeit um Blutpunkte für das Skillen zu verdienen) ... BITTE schreibt wenigstens FETT davor, dass es eine Solo Queue ist !\n- Du kennst das bestimmt, du spielst, bist ingame und dann leavt der Killer was passiert -> Lose.. Ehm moment .. LOSE?!

I'm also a huge horror nerd/fan and I really enjoy watching or even playing them.\n\nThis is my opinion and my opinion is that. Dead by Daylight is one of the worst games ever made in gaming history. I don't think anyone realizes how awful this game is because firstly, the developers of the game don't test their own game out and would rather have their community to test it which barely does anything. They call it 'PTB' which is stands for Public Test Build and its the most pathetic system I have ever seen. When a new killer or survivor comes out, the feedback from the PTB doesn't do anything and so the release of its beta form comes out on full release and it ends up breaking everything.\n\nOn the Steam platform for PC players, the game tends to lag the entirety of their game library. This game frequently causes huge frame drop spikes and it wouldn't matter if you happened to have a high-end PC because it'll still do it.\n\nFor Console players, simply just launching the game would take a very long time to boot up just to get to 'Press Start Button' segment which is something so you are able to get into the menu. It doesn't stop there though because certain killer's have abilities like 'Nemesis' who uses his tentacle to whip you and that causes massive frame drops. This game also ends up crashing more frequently and they haven't released a patch for it to this date. The crashing still happens on PC as well.\n\nDead by Daylight also happens to have a extremely toxic community that they aren't aware of and they also have a toxic exclusive group called 'Fog Whisperers' who are people that will support the devs and the game no matter what reason. That group also happened to frame someone/remove them from the group because of their accent and how they pronounce certain words which is highly unacceptable. Fog Whisperers are so toxic that they are aware of how bad this game is and they don't even let the developers know how broken it is because they would rather create a FAKE patch note which is something the devs release to show what they fixed and what they added.\n\nThe game is heavily unbalanced because many of the maps are Survivor sided. When you get paired up against a proper team of four survivors who are in a group call together, you will 99.9% lose the match without killing anyone. The role as killer is to apply enough pressure on Generators so they don't get completed, but the problem is they get done far too quickly because there is a perk system in the game which alters the match for whatever side.\n\nThe developers have recently introduced a new feature for Survivors where they get a huge buff by applying a spell on totems called 'BOON' which are something that were created for only Killers. Which was really good because it helped aid the killer into a more fair situation. Those were called 'HEX', but now Survivors can apply a BOON on them and whenever it gets destroyed they can apply it on a different one or the same one where the killer cannot do that with theirs.\n\nAs mentioned, the community is extremely toxic and will either harass or insult you in anyway possible. They'll also publicly create something so others will hear about you and will harass you as well.\n\nOne good thing about this game is how they updated the look of their game which is slowly progressing. But that is really it. The fact that this game was released to the public eye in 2016 is very pathetic considering its not even polished or designed very well. Its a game that expands, but in the worst way possible.\n\nThey have a few of the most iconic slashers in horror films, but they don't really do them justice. Michael Myers looks like he bench presses and his mask seems to be part of his face (Looks like he's high or just really happy). Ghostface doesn't look anything like in the movies and they removed Pinhead's voice line because they purchased an NFT for it rather then actually renting the license.\n\nBut yeah, that's why this game has 1 star. Its updated graphics. Nothing more because I unfortunately spent TOO much time on this game, but its kind of a good thing because I am able to give a full on review so people are aware before they purchase this god forsaken game. Its really bad and I highly don't recommend it.\n\nI suggest playing other games that has a competent team behind it, so do your research and you'll be fine.","timestamp_created":1466245774,"timestamp_updated":1640833304,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481838107109069824","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23629830","author":{"steamid":"76561197980139303","num_games_owned":566,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":2868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1633,"last_played":1655537597},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est une tuerie, sans mauvais jeu de mot...\n\nVous incarnez un tueur ou un survivant dans un parc clos duquel vous devez vous échapper...\nTout est fait pour garder la pression, à la place du tueur, comme des survivants... \n\nBien que l'ambiance soit très sobre, elle se porte tres bien au jeu qui joue sur l'angoisse, dans un style de film horreur des 30 dernieres années...

The balance and quality of the game goes down every day as more and more survivors learn how to abuse the game's mechanics.  When the game first came out it took 20+ minutes to get a game as Killer because nobody wanted to be survivor.  By next week there'll be nobody left playing Killer because playing Killer  in the current balance environment is an agonizing ordeal.\n\nAs it stands, right at this moment, the game is broken.  It's not horror, it's not stealth, and it's definitely not fun.  It's Benny Hill whack-a-mole where survivors will actually start chasing you if you haven't given them enough points to rank up.\n\nDon't buy it right now.
