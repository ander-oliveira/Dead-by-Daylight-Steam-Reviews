Pour faire simple les survivants sont clairement avantagés à haut niveau (ce n'est pas de la rage car je suis moi même main survivant) et avec un vocal c'est encore pire! Mais les tueurs peuvent ce défendre avec des techniques qui deviennent normal à haut niveau ; mais pas compris au plus bas level. Car si en tant que tueur tu chasses un survivant trop longtemps les autres en profitent pour faire des générateurs (logique c'est le principe du jeu).

I'll break down some aspects of the game, including what it is, the good, and the bad, and the game's current state at the time of writing.\n\nWHAT IT IS\nDead by Daylight is a 4 v 1 online multiplayer game. 4 players team up as survivors, and 1 person plays the killer. You can choose which side you join when you queue, or you can make a custom unranked game and invite friends. You then choose your character, and choose various perks to equip (these are passives with a multitude of effects), and if you're a survivor, you may have items to equip like a toolbox or medkit. The survivors objective is to repair 5 of the generators on the map (there's usually 7 I think), then go to one of the two exit gates and work the lever long enough til the gate is open, and then to escape. The killers objective is NOT to kill the survivors, oddly enough, but get a hit or two on one to knock them down, then pick them up and carry them to a sacrificial hook (this is part of the game's lore). If the killer hooks a survivor, they can be rescued by others, and the killer's job is to go look for more to hook. This continues until the killer hooks all survivors at once, or hooks each survivor enough times that they're immediately sacrificed and out of the game (max of 3 hooks per survivor).  This is also where the first of my problems begin, but we'll get to that soon enough.\n\nSound reasonable? Perhaps it does, in principle. Each killer has a unique power to assist them, as well as their own perks and add-ons which can make them more effecive or change how they play. Some are easy to learn, some not. Some are also licensed, and these ones have to be paid for with real money (e.g. pyramid head, Mike Myers, Freddie Krueger etc). The rest can be earned in-game if you have a LOT of time to put into it, or also bought with real money if not (a bit cheaper than the licensed ones I think).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nCore Survivor gameplay goes like this: \n\n* Go to a generator. Do you hear the warning heartbeat sound telling you that the killer is nearby? If so, carefully sneak away to another generator and work there. If not, start fixing. \n\n* Fix generator. If a team-mate gets downed or hooked, consider rescuing them, depending if you know how far they are and how risky it is, and how close to being done your generator is. When done, go do another.\n\n* When 5 generators are fixed, go to the gate levers and hold that til the gate's open.\n\n* If you get found, just run and waste the killer's time with \"looping\" (running around the same obstacles in a way that makes it difficult for the killer to catch up), using pallets wisely, and using vaults where appropriate. The heartbeat and red light that emits from the killers face in a cone tells you how close they are and if they're coming around a corner, so these let you know where to run somewhat. Waste as much of the killers time as possible so that your teammates can do other essential thing uninterrupted, like heal each other or repair the generators.\n\nCore Killer gameplay:\n\n* Look at where the generators are and make an educated guess as to which generators might have survivors nearby, and head in that direction. Trying to be sneaky as the killer is mostly pretty pointless as most killers are large, can't crouch, and all of them give the telltale heartbeat warning and red light cone.\n\n* If you find a survivor, chase after them, maybe using whatever power you have to find them or make a chase easier. The survivor will of course try to waste as much of your time as possible so that the others can get the generators done. If you get into attack range, do an attack. Providing it hits and they haven't run a circle around you during your swing (known as 360'ing) to make you miss, your vision is now shaking and bloody for a sec, and the survivor gets a speed boost to run away from you. Now you choose whether to keep chasing for a second hit to down them (assuming you didn't have an attack to insta-down them, which most killers don't), or do you now break off and look for another, leaving them injured but able to move just as fast and get healed by their teammates when they find safety? Depends on many factors. You can also damage a generator that's been partially repaired by kicking it, making it lose progress over time until repairs are started again.\n\n* If you hit an injured one a second time, they're now downed. You can leave them and look for another one if you think there's one nearby (called \"slugging\" in the community), or do what you're supposed to do and pick them up and carry them to hook, hoping they won't break free or have that one perk that a LOT have ready that lets them do an attack on you when being carried to break free and run off while you're stuck stunned for a few seconds, rending everything you've done in that second chase pointless and wasting potentially a large chunk of your time.\n\n* Assuming you've hooked a survivor, you now go look for another to start the process again. While you're doing this, chances are that a survivor will come and rescue their teammate from the hook. Remember, there are 4 survivors, so even if you hook one and find another on their way, that's still two able to go and save them. This wouldn't be too bad, except for the next thing.\n\n* If a survivor is rescued quickly enough (the timer is pretty long if they don't struggle to break free, which has little chance of working anyways), they now require hooking again. If they're rescued quickly enough a second time, then a third hooking is instant death, removing that survivor from the game (they can spectate their teammates I think.\n\n* Hook all survivors at once, or all survivors enough times, to sacrifice them all and win the game.\n\nPROBLEMS:\n\nSo, why do I recommend against the game? I've almost exclusively played as a killer, and I have to say... the game seems stacked against you when you're the killer, which seems... counter-intuitive. It advertises itself as a horror game, but it's really not. If what I wrote above seems balanced to you, let me explain my reasoning as to why I think it isn't.\n\n* FOV: The survivors play in third person mode with a wide FOV. The Killer is in first-person mode with an FOV of 87 degrees, and this can only be changed with a perk that goes up to I think an extra 10 degrees at max. I can get why this was a design choice (the dev's wanted the killer to have \"tunnel-vision on a survivor\"), but this means the game is going to be unplayable for some people as killer. People who get headaches or motion sickness from low FOV settings are advised not to play killer at all, if you want to play this game. Minus points for small imbalance and lack of accessibility on this one.\n\n* Theme vs Gameplay: The game advertises itself as a kind of horror game. It's not. Very rarely will you encounter survivors who play as if they're scared of you, unless you're much, much better than they are. Even then, you will still encounter players who literally follow you around when you're carrying someone, players who wait behind points they think are safe and click a flashlight on and off, or teabag in front of you, players who deliberately try and get you to chase them to distract you from their less capable teammates etc. While the latter is strategically sound, it doesn't exactly play into the theme of the game. All of this making supposedly scary killers into the equivalent of the old man annoyed at some kids for making rude gestures and calling them names... which, now that I think about it, is probably what you're playing against when this happens. You're the old man, telling the durn kids to get off your lawn. They don't though, they just insult you and make a mess of the place, all the while acting like it's your fault. Which leads into my next complaint...\n\nCONTINUED IN COMMENTS, BELOW","timestamp_created":1606168683,"timestamp_updated":1608741264,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526935219764709473","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79728034","author":{"steamid":"76561199085776611","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":62,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1660441724},"language":"latam","review":"===[ Público ]===\n☐ Niños\n☐ Todos los públicos\n☐ Jugadores Casual\n☑ Jugadores experimentados\n☐ Jugadores Hardcore\n\n===[ Modos de juego ]===\n☑ Un jugador\n☐ Cooperativo Local\n☑ Cooperativo\n☑ Multijugador\n\n===[ Gráficos ]===\n☐ Patata\n☐ Muy malos\n☐ Malos\n☐ No están nada mal\n☑ Buenos\n☐ Hiperrealistas\n☐ Preciosos\n☐ Obra maestra\n\n===[ Calidad/Precio ]===\n☐ Simplemente no lo hagas\n☐ Devuelvelo si puedes\n☐ Espera a unas rebajas\n☐ Normal\n☑ Excelente\n☐ Estás atracando a la desarrolladora\n☐ Gratis\n\n===[ Rendimiento ]===\n☐ Potato Master Race\n☑ Muy bueno\n☐ Normal\n☐ Meh\n☐ Basura\n☐ 1000 Titans V\n\n===[ Dificultad ]===\n☐ Solo necesitas dos manos\n☐ Easy peasy lemon squeezy\n☐ Normal\n☑ Facil de aprender pero dificil de dominar\n☐ Dificil\n☐ Dwarf Fortress\n\n===[ Duración del Juego ]===\n☐ Muy corto ( 0 - 2 horas)\n☐ Corto ( 2 - 8 horas)\n☐ Unas cuantas horas ( 8 - 12 horas)\n☐ Larguillo ( ±20 horas)\n☐ Largo ( 30 - 50 horas)\n☐ Muy largo ( 50 - 100 horas)\n☑ Infinita\n\n===[ Jugabilidad ] ===\n☐ Walking Simulator\n☐ Transmite VIH , cuidado\n☐ Normalilla\n☐ Buena\n☑ Muy buena\n☐ Obra maestra\n\n===[ Innovación ] ===\n☐ Call of duty de cada año\n☐ Es conservador pero se sostiene\n☐ Pequeños detalles\n☐ Intenta innovar pero fracasa en el intento\n☑ Innova bastante\n☐ Revolucionario\n\n===[Historia] ===\n☐ No tiene/No busca tenerla\n☑ Al menos es mejor que Crepúsculo\n☐ Promedio\n☐ Buena\n☐ Fantastica\n☐ Obra maestra\n\n===[ Personajes ] ===\n☐ No hay como tal\n☐ Carecen de importancia\n☐ Están ahí\n☐ Normalillos\n☑ Memorables\n\n===[ Misiones Secundarias ] ===\n☐ No tiene como tal\n☑ Es Opcional\n☐ Están ahí para molestar al jugador\n☐ De recadero y alguna interesante\n☐ Muy bien escritas y distintas entres sí\n\n===[ Bugs ]===\n☐ Más bug que juego\n☐ Bugs que te destrozan el juego\n☐ AC Unity de salida\n☑ Unos pocos bugs\n☐ Los bugs los puedes usar para hacer speedrun\n☐ Casi imperceptibles\n\n===[ Banda Sonora ] ===\n☐ Demasiada Música\n☐ Quitala si puedes\n☐ Imperceptible\n☐ Atmosférica\n☑ Para cada acción\n☐ Muy memorable\n\n===[ Recomendación Final ] ===\n☐ No te lo recomiendo por nada del mundo\n☐ Poco recomendable\n☐ Solo recomendable si te gusta mucho la propuesta\n☐ Recomendable\n☐ Muy recomendable si te gusta la propuesta\n☑ Recomendadísimo\n☐ Lo mejor que he probado en los últimos años\n☐ Lo mejor que he probado en mi vida\n\n===[ Requisitos mínimos ] ===\n☑ GeForce GTX 460 1GB o AMD HD 6850 1GB\n☑ Intel Core i3-4170 o AMD FX-8120\n☑ 8 GB de RAM\n☑ 50 GB de espacio disponible\n\n===[ Recomendados ] ===\n☑ GeForce 760 o AMD HD 8800 o superior con 4GB de RAM\n☑ Intel Core i3-4170, AMD FX-8300 o superior\n☑ 8 GB de RAM\n☑ 50 GB de espacio disponible\n\n===[ PC con el que el juego fue testeado ] ===\n☑ GeForce GTX MSI 1650 Super\n☑ Intel Core I3 9100F\n☑ 16GB Ram 2x8 2666MHz (Xpg)\n☑ H310M-e\n☑ 1TB HDD\n☑ 240 SSD\n☑ Gamemax 450w (+80 Plus bronce)","timestamp_created":1606168619,"timestamp_updated":1606168619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79727963","author":{"steamid":"76561199094352754","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7366,"last_played":1655663245},"language":"brazilian","review":"Dead by DayBugLigh é muito divertido, principalmente jogando com amigos.\nMas da pra passar muita raiva com esse jogo, os bugs, os campers.
