I will admit when playing as survivor, it's so much better with a full stack of friends. Randoms are hit and miss, as with every other game with matchmaking - but it makes a huge difference when you can be on comms whether to share in the horror or laughter. I can be an easy one to scare, so having that camaraderie of friendship helps me stay focused lol.\n\nAs far as difficulty and gameplay: They just released a huge update that changes how the prestige system works. You no longer lose everything you gained during your bloodweb looting, so now there's even more incentive to prestige. The teachable perks I believe have changed as well, but I'm still figuring that out myself.  If you haven't played in a bit, check it out! They made quite a bit of updates to improve upon the game and it's so far, all pretty great. Difficulty comes from the base strategies and tactics. And matchmaking. Yes, there are ranks, and there are seasons. Hopping in and playing a few games aren't going to give you a clear idea of how the game or community works. It's just like any other ranking experience. The more you play and show your skill, you'll be matched with others who are in that same bracket and that's where the real challenge begins. Playing against someone who is similar in skill can really spice things up.\n\nAlso, getting to the know the community is great too. There's a whole language behind head nods and shakes as well as crouching repeatedly and spinning. This is the first game I've played where tea-bagging isn't BM lol but rather is a high five of good sport. I have to give credit to the community of DbD because there are actually very few toxic players - the majority of people I have experienced this game with whether killer or survivor are usually pretty cool. I have only had to report someone for unsportsmanlike behaviour, maybe 3xs in the last 80hrs of gameplay??? That's unheard of for a competitive game, am I right?\n\nGive it a shot, play for a while then make your decision! There are so many perks out that you can create all kinds of strategies based on the way you want to play. Again, I do recommend if you are playing survivor to go in with friends - if I am playing alone, that's usually when I go Killer! And that in itself is a great time. And if you do go Killer, remember the survivors are cool people too and like to party with you. If you get beaten, consider giving them a high five at the gate because 90% of the time they want to as well for a good game shared! :D","timestamp_created":1659911514,"timestamp_updated":1659911514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120245718","author":{"steamid":"76561198084334692","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":3479,"last_played":1659910432},"language":"french","review":"Le jeu en lui-même est excellent, mais la communauté est ultra-toxique.\nImpossible de faire quoi que ce soit sans camper, tricher, exploiter etc...\nSi tu n'exploite pas tous les pires défauts et comportements du jeu (provocations, frames d'invincibilité, obstacles, provocations, camping, bodyblocking, encore plus de provocations), abandonne.

Why have you marked this as a \"No\" for not recommended I hear you ask? Well.. Let me explain. This game is like Marmite - You either love it or you hate it - This is a game that I have had a love/hate relationship with since I first purchased it in 2017. \n\nThe aim of the game is simple. As a survivor, you and your team mates need to repair x5 generators, power open a gate and escape. As the killer, you need to kill. Sounds easy enough - right?.... However\n\nThe bugs in this game makes my back garden look like a tropical paradise. The only way to \"fix\" the bugs in this game, is it to release a new buggy update. With every update, I feel the game gets more \"clunky\" and the survivor perks seem to get nerfed on a regular basis to favour killers - That's right Deadhard, i'm looking at you. The new prestige system now sucks and the MMR is a whole other story....Overall, I give the game a 6.5 / 10\n\nHowever, as much as I could sit here and slag this game off, it has its moments. If I don't play the game for a while and watch it played online, it gives me withdrawal symptoms and I have to load it up. The challenges are good and keeps the game fresh and also gives you something new to aim for. With every new DLC, there are new achievements and being the achievement hunter I am, I make sure that I am on top of that (203/203 at the time of writing this). I like that many of the characters are from popular Horror films - Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser, Resident Evil and Stranger Things.  If you are also an Amazon Prime member, you can get codes once a month for a free cosmetic or item and there are regular events in game to increase your bloodpoints. \n\nThe game has a lot of potential and it can be fun when playing with friends, but as they say - Keep your friends close and your enemies closer - Play for yourself to see who lives by the statement \"Gens before Friends\". From Claudettes (Blendettes) Bush hiding to Dwights Locker Loving, try the game and see for yourself.\n","timestamp_created":1659907620,"timestamp_updated":1659907620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120243251","author":{"steamid":"76561199082325552","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":78008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6998,"playtime_at_review":73449,"last_played":1660576420},"language":"koreana","review":"망겜이라 욕하지만 이만한 게임이 없다...\n다른 게임하고 싶어도 이만큼 재밌으면서 빡치는 게임,,","timestamp_created":1659907519,"timestamp_updated":1659907519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120242582","author":{"steamid":"76561198359177137","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":14,"playtime_at_review":2557,"last_played":1659906461},"language":"english","review":"I openly admit that I'm not very good at the game, but whether you're in the higher ranks or lower, everyone will make your shortcomings known.

by Daylight is my favourite game.\nI hate playing Dead by Daylight.\n\nTo clarify, I love this game. When it's good: it's a love letter to the slasher genre that makes you feel like a scared survivor hiding from a monster, or a powerful maniac chasing down people. At it's worst, it's a toxic sess pool of people trying to screw each other over. To be honest, the worst part of this game is the people. Most games are fine, but let me be clear by saying I enjoyed the game so much more when I found out you could mute post game chat. I'd recommend watching a few videos of the gameplay to see if you'd like it. You can pick up the base game for peanuts and it's not a bad time killer. You can also pick up all the non-licensed characters by playing the game, but hoo boy there's a lot of

Same meta perks, same core gameplay, unfun MMR matchmaking, heavy luck based RNG systems and more problems have made me want to not play this game anymore for almost half a year. I miss the times where this game was simple and fun, where you would not have to worry about playing meta, where new chapters were unique and fun and did not present glaring issues and bugs on their release.\nPromising Steam Deck Support and not giving updates for a year shows how lazy the developers truly are as it is just toggeling a switch in their Anti Cheat Webpage. Also when on the topic of Anti Cheat, does it even work? Because Cheaters are able to snipe Streamer's lobbies, well, cheat and are able to continue doing so. And if reported, you won't even be informed about them getting banned or not.\n\nI miss the old times, where I had fun with my friends and did not have to care about meta perks or playing as if I were in a competitive tournament.\nIt's sad to see, as the devs don't care and are in the \"you think you want this, but you don't\" mindset, which is not good.\n\nOverall, if you value your time, play something different. Or maybe I just played too much of this. If you really want this or friends play it, try it out on free weekends and maybe buy it when it's on sale because it is often.\n\nCheers","timestamp_created":1659884302,"timestamp_updated":1659884302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527272701263427734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120223177","author":{"steamid":"76561198405586693","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":428,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1660594212},"language":"spanish","review":"Esta bien pero con amigos esta mucho más divertido","timestamp_created":1659883244,"timestamp_updated":1659883244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120221593","author":{"steamid":"76561198964719888","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2336,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1660498883},"language":"english","review":"Pain","timestamp_created":1659881262,"timestamp_updated":1659881262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120221057","author":{"steamid":"76561199192273703","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":699,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1660181680},"language":"schinese","review":" 印豆话小测试：（请说出意思）\n初级：夹夹，空军，我真的按了，逛该，狗面，极汗\n中级：居居，毛菇，狗洞，臭味，炸都气肺\n高级：刘易斯钓鱼，太阳，波王，魔王\n直播甘的砖家们，你来真的啊","timestamp_created":1659880631,"timestamp_updated":1659880631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120220526","author":{"steamid":"76561198410054864","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2792,"playtime_at_review":54423,"last_played":1660414489},"language":"schinese","review":"下饭游戏","timestamp_created":1659879976,"timestamp_updated":1659879976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120220424","author":{"steamid":"76561199017451266","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":575,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1660141106},"language":"english","review":"awesome game","timestamp_created":1659879856,"timestamp_updated":1659879856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120220167","author":{"steamid":"76561199217680513","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":480,"playtime_at_review":917,"last_played":1660141765},"language":"english","review":"the cost is worth it because it dosn't matter if you play survivor or killer both are really fun and engaging. i defiently recommend it. if you have friends you can play with it its even more fun. some players got this game for free but its defiently worth it if you just buy it for 20 bucks.","timestamp_created":1659879499,"timestamp_updated":1659879499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120219926","author":{"steamid":"76561198201463159","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":117,"playtime_at_review":1609,"last_played":1660008383},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo super legal pra jogar com amigos.
