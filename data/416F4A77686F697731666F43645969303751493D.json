El juego está completamente desequilibrado, desde siempre los supervivientes han tenido ventaja sobre los asesinos debido a que les permiten jugar con amigos y comunicarse vía Discord, entre muchas otras razones. Las partidas se convierten en un juego de bullying en el que dejan en ridículo al asesino, le haces tbagging, le insultas por el chat y no te pasa nada. PERO si juegas de asesino no se te ocurra matar a los supervivientes porque te reportan (el sistema que se utiliza es el autoban, es decir que si 40 personas te hacen un reporte falso - que lo hacen- serás baneado y podrás perder la cuenta). Además, si no juegas de la forma que ellos quieren te van a insultar (es la comunidad más tóxica que he visto en mi vida, sin exagerar). Y BHVR NUNCA VA A HACER NADA CON RESPECTO A ESTO porque juega más gente de superviviente que de asesino, y claro, el dinero es el dinero. Pues eso, valoran más ganar dinero a costa de sus jugadores que equilibrar el juego. Y para rematar, hay hackers que llevan jugando DBD AÑOS y haciendo streaming mostrándoselo al público, pero BHVR no hace nada, ¿y sabéis por qué? PORQUE BANEAR A UN HACKER NO DA DINERO. \n\nDa igual que te guste mucho la película de Halloween y que quieras jugar con Michael Myers, este no es el juego adecuado. Porque te vas a estresar, te van hacer bullying, te van a insultar por el chat y te vas a enfadar hasta el punto en que quieras destrozar el ordenador. \n\nNo gastes tu dinero en esta bazofia, no merece la pena.\n\nActualización: Van a sacar a un nuevo asesino, pero no os dejéis llevar por el hype porque después de una semana el juego va a volver a ser la misma mierda de siempre. Ahora ocultan los rangos en las partidas para que no te puedas quejar del matchmaking de mierda, porque sigue siendo una mierda, y lo va a seguir siendo.","timestamp_created":1626380723,"timestamp_updated":1628905760,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95803718","author":{"steamid":"76561198809912563","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":8392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1658460122},"language":"english","review":"fun but im dook at it","timestamp_created":1626380285,"timestamp_updated":1626380285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95803239","author":{"steamid":"76561198254002536","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":63,"playtime_at_review":9258,"last_played":1659896400},"language":"english","review":"this is a really good game and im having so much fun this is so much recommended","timestamp_created":1626379677,"timestamp_updated":1626379677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95802591","author":{"steamid":"76561197999655579","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":208,"playtime_at_review":19190,"last_played":1660576628},"language":"spanish","review":"muy entretenido , un juegazo del que no te puedes aburrir","timestamp_created":1626378777,"timestamp_updated":1626378777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95802016","author":{"steamid":"76561198416087403","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1654714025},"language":"english","review":"In what other game can you play as Chris Redfield?

Unfortunately BHVR has already dropped the ball in less than a week after improving the game, it's really too bad because for a week straight the game felt really good. They've already started regressing changes due to the outcry of an extremely vocal minority of the playerbase, and went overboard when doing so. The worst example of this by far is what they did to Thanatophobia, it was a mediocre perk that only had value on Legion and Plague so they gave it a 2% buff that barely did anything; however when people started using it a bit more and a few people complained they decided to make it completely worthless and it's worse now than it's ever been. The buff made it so that each injured Survivor caused a 5.5% slowdown on generator repairs and such, up to a maximum of 22%, this was strong on certain killers but easily counterplayed because the entire Survivor meta is based around fast healing. They decided to nerf it into the ground to the point that nobody will ever use it again, injuring three Survivors now gives 1% more slowdown than a single injured Survivor did before; 6% slowdown for three injured Survivors is laughably pathetic and the only way to get the 20% (they removed the tiny buff too!) is to have all four injured at once, which is nearly impossible because every lobby has someone running Circle of Healing and a medkit which ensures that you will NEVER get value out of the perk. Also, if you kill a Survivor it means you'll never get more than 6% for the rest of the match. They even managed to make an already awful Survivor perk worse when their intent was to buff it, Mettle of Man is a handicap and actively makes the game harder for the Survivor using it after it's \"buff\". BHVR has no idea of what they're doing and is just throwing random things at the wall to see what sticks. Some great changes, some absolutely awful changes, there's no consistency at all and it feels like they don't even playtest their patches before they release them. Oddly enough, this is probably the best state the game has been in for years and is far more enjoyable overall than it was before this edit. Still has most of the same issues but at the very least BHVR is changing things, even if it's 50/50 on whether or not those changes are good. It is worth mentioning that the last four Killers have been fantastic though, from Onyro to Wesker; they've been doing a great job on them and they're very fun to play!\n\nI got to Iridescent One (highest Killer rank per month) on this patch, but sadly it seems like the matchmaking is still atrocious after playing for a while and things like Circle of Healing still render any Killer without instant downs or high mobility nearly useless so I've gotten bored again and will be taking another break. Having four Boon totems active at the same time is absolutely cancerous and at high levels of play that's exactly what you'll get every time without fail. Every match is guaranteed to have [b]at least[/b] one Circle of Healing that provides nearly instantaneous and completely infinite heals that remove all pressure from the Survivors to actually do anything but go hide in their corner once they're injured, so you either chase a Survivor until you down them or you have all your progress removed the moment you chase someone else. It's been unchanged since release and is still the single most busted perk in the entire game, having single-handedly made all Hex perks irrelevant while providing a massive crutch to bad players. Despite this, more Boons are being added while the already useless Hexes are being nerfed even further; it's pretty clear that this garbage mechanic is permanent and frankly it's just not fun to play against, when I hear multiple boons being set up I stop caring about the match entirely and having dealt with them for at least fifty hours in the past two weeks I'm absolutely sick of seeing them. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy this game is to play for a week twice a year when your MMR resets, it starts out great but quickly devolves into a boring mess if you're good at the game.\n\nSECOND EDIT: The Developers have knowingly lied to the community about the reasons for removing content from the Hellraiser DLC, while also not telling us that the purchase of that DLC supports NFTs which are both anti consumer and horrible for the environment. They deliberately misled the community and then shamelessly announced the NFT connections via social media. Please do not give BHVR any of your money because they are some of the worst Developers I've ever had the displeasure of paying. I've uninstalled the game and will likely never play it again as it just isn't enjoyable anymore, between the repeatedly horrible updates and the Dev's morally bankrupt business practices I'm just done with this game.\n\nEDIT: Having played 80+ more hours, I even more wholeheartedly will not recommend this game. The balancing is absolutely garbage, there are over 130 perks in this game but you'll only ever see the same ten in every single game because the meta perks are so OP that not choosing them feels like gimping yourself; this goes for both Killers and Survivors. In addition to this, the devs are absolutely incompetent, the Pinhead DLC was released in such a broken state that I will never give them money again. I'd refund all the DLCs I bought during the current sale if I could, had I realized they released a paid DLC with this many game breaking bugs I would never have bought the others even at 50% off. Do not support these devs because they are total garbage and do not deserve your money.\n\nA wonderful game that is held back by bad balancing and an absolutely horrendous community. Playing as a Killer feels great sometimes, chasing someone down as Micheal Myers while the Halloween theme plays is exhilarating. Playing as a Killer also feels infuriating and pointless at the higher levels (which I reached in less than 10 hours) because of the heavily Survivor sided perk/add on system and the ridiculously toxic playerbase.\n\nMy first five matches were great, ever since then at least half the games I play are against players who deliberately abuse mechanics, taunt and troll. I had one match go on for over an hour because the last two Survivors refused to play the game normally in an attempt to make me quit. 8/10 matches end with vitriol in the chat, reminiscent of MW2 lobbies. Whether you win, lose, play well or bad, people will be salty.\n\nMany Killers are very outdated and some are blatantly better than others. Newer characters have better perks (which can be taught to others), better add ons, more cosmetics and are generally just stronger than anything older. Playing Michael Myers VS playing Spirit is a night and day difference in difficulty, for the same price. I feel as though more than half the DLCs are pointless, and the fact that multiple DLCs are bought purely for the OP perks says a lot.\n\nThis game can be very fun but frankly the community is atrocious and it makes me not want to play at all. I started out loving it and was planning on buying a bunch of DLCs, but I've changed my mind as most of the ones I like are weak and actively gimp me to play them. You see posts about the toxicity in the forum daily it seems, and it's a known issue to the Devs that seems to have been left to fester. \n\nOnly purchase this game if you're okay with being at a disadvantage as Killer in every match, can handle the constant toxicity in both game and chat, are willing to pay for the perks that make things easier, and really like the gameplay. That's a lot of caveats, I would not recommend this game unless you play it exclusively with friends.","timestamp_created":1626374833,"timestamp_updated":1660283667,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507299244403839111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95799332","author":{"steamid":"76561198357814848","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":15833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9769,"last_played":1658858643},"language":"german","review":"Really nice game for 20€","timestamp_created":1626374587,"timestamp_updated":1626374587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469696968793869019","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95798992","author":{"steamid":"76561198117637713","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":18520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18479,"last_played":1626376423},"language":"english","review":"There'll always b e some toxicity in the community, but find some players to enjoy the game with and it's fun.","timestamp_created":1626374160,"timestamp_updated":1626374160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95798889","author":{"steamid":"76561199170533520","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1656847656},"language":"schinese","review":"包含了很多美国经典恐怖片角色 刺激紧张 音效和画面效果都特别不错 推荐","timestamp_created":1626374047,"timestamp_updated":1626374047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95798883","author":{"steamid":"76561199083862852","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1626316101},"language":"latam","review":"una pija","timestamp_created":1626374039,"timestamp_updated":1626374039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95798817","author":{"steamid":"76561198883200241","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":35687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1415,"last_played":1657219601},"language":"english","review":"I really like this game. \n\nThe concept is great and the game is successful. \n\nFurthemore, this game is capable of everything, because it can make you angry as well as it can make you laugh. \n\nI truly recommend it and wish you to have fun. ;-)","timestamp_created":1626373953,"timestamp_updated":1629580511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95798737","author":{"steamid":"76561199092831561","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8015,"last_played":1653184536},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo extremamente bom!

I love it when it's good, but the bad games are just too much. \n\nThere's perks that totally ruin the fun of the other side, and the community very often takes advantage of that. Solo survivor is unfun to the point I don't even play it, so if you don't have friends (and can't really make them) you're fucked. Killer is about micromanaging 4 different people, and at high level you're forced to find the weakest link (guess what happens if there isn't one? Entity Displeased!). You can feel so powerless so many ways.\n\nMaps are a real gamble, with most of them making me groan when I get them because they're either too large or have way too many safe loops for survivors that you just have to abandon them on, else you lose half the objective.\n\nAnd then there's the bugs. I don't know how, but every update just gets worse. Survivors sometimes make no noise on the ground, so good luck finding them if you're forced to slug them. The Resident Evil patch was so poorly optimized that console players literally couldn't play. The servers must be running on potatoes powered by a hamster on crack.\n\nI'm taking a break from the game for my mental health at the time of reviewing. I want to come back, I probably will because of sunk cost and those rare amazing games that are evenly matched and I'm actually having fun with. But for now, I'm just gonna watch Otzdarva play it every now and then","timestamp_created":1626364156,"timestamp_updated":1626364156,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507299244403839111","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95790784","author":{"steamid":"76561198894109862","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1626812817},"language":"russian","review":"Никогда не думал что в своей жизни буду бояться звука сердцебиения","timestamp_created":1626364123,"timestamp_updated":1626364123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95790732","author":{"steamid":"76561198082646488","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":38429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":288,"playtime_at_review":25567,"last_played":1660568927},"language":"koreana","review":"난 오늘도 이 게임을 욕할 것이다. 뭐가 또 쳐 바뀌었는지 몸소 하나하나 확인하면서 말이다.","timestamp_created":1626364063,"timestamp_updated":1658293735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95790632","author":{"steamid":"76561198407859449","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1388,"last_played":1657982292},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos multijogador que já joguei, muito legal e divertido de se jogar com amigos e sozinho também, valeu cada centavo.
