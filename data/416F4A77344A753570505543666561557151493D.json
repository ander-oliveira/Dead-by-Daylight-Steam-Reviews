(Otzdarva is a good place, he is where i learned to be good and learn really good tips, good kind streamer).\n\nLearning different load-outs comes over time and with the in store shrine of secrets, you can spend shards (you get these from leveling up) to get good perks and not pay real money or with already unlocked characters, get their teachable perks just by leveling them up and able to use perks with any of your characters.\n\nThe matchmaking is a bit messed up with ranks mixing at higher to low ones but normally, you should be okay with playing with people on your level in the beginning, around rank 10 (lowest is 20, highest 1) is when it starts getting funky.\n\nI recommend trying to just have fun and try new play styles, you have good days and bad days.\n\nGen-rush and

I have a good grasp of the perks, strategies, and maps. I do enjoy the game- for the most part. As a survivor, there is an ebb and flow of tension as you go between being chased and completing objectives. The pressure is always on as killer, however. As a survivor, you are 1 v 1 with the killer. As a killer, you are 1 v 4. With that in mind, here are my grievances:\n\n1. Toxicity. As a killer, teabagging and dragging out the end-game when they should just leave. As a survivor, you're often \"tunneled\" and camped in the lower ranks. It can be difficult to gain rank where killers don't do this as much because your fellow survivors are, for the most part, inefficient. End game chat can be pleasant, but often is not. I am guilty of this too. You tend to become a monster.\n\n2. Map design - There are issues with some maps, and quite a number are killer-dependent. For example, if you're in an indoor map, it is extremely difficult to play a killer like Huntress.\n\n3. Killer bugs - There are some bugs that the developers have ignored that have existed for over a year. For example, the Nurse \"blink bug\". In addition, the hitboxes for Huntress's axes can be really wonky (sometimes in your favor, sometimes not). Continuing off Nurse, there were pervasive issues for a long time with Blinking through tires, haystacks, certain rocks, under the pier in the Swamp map, in the hallway in the Silent Hill map, around basements (sometimes you blink to the basement when you're looking ground level), in the basement (there are corners you can't blink through at all)- to name a few. In addition, when Victor pounces on an incline, he goes two feet and is vulnerable for Survivors to kick/kill him. \n\n4. Grab mechanics - Often as a killer, if you grab a survivor as they are entering/exiting a locker or off a generator, it will \"cancel\". I believe this has to do with favoring Survivor latency. However, it is extremely annoying as killer- especially when they are full health and now you have to hit them once, they get a speed boost, loop for a while, down them, and then carry them to hook when you should've just grabbed them and got to immediately carry them to hook. \n\n5. Censor filter - This is a new advent by the game's development team. While it isn't my biggest criticism, it is the most damning. Utterly, horribly broken. Phrases that are perfectly fine are filtered. Even one of the killer's names (Meyers) is filtered. Phrases related to in-game mechanics are filtered such as \"picked her/him up\" when referring to literally picking them up off the ground. The worst part is that you can't turn it off. Seriously. You are playing an M rated game to be treated like a ####ing child by the developers. It's insulting.\n\n6. The developers are unresponsive - They are not very responsive to the community. In fact, in the face of criticism, the lead for the game at one time recommended that others play another game on live stream (to his cohort's visible dismay). Way back when, he played as a killer and was visibly frustrated at the number of pallets and \"infinite\" loops in the game. The game is very survivor favored by the developers. \n\n7. Hackers - While you don't run into these every day, it is common enough to make you wonder how on earth they don't have a good anti-cheat mechanic. I mean, they have SOMETHING, but it's really not good. Makes for funny YouTube videos sometimes, though. Just not fun to play against. \n\n8. Pallets - too freaking many.\n\nAll in all, the game was fun for a while, and I've played for about...I think 4 years? But the lack of concern by the developers, or lack of transparency, in treating known issues and allowing them to persist for YEARS is what made me leave this negative review. I am a little sad because I want to be as passionate about this game as when I was a new player. At the same time, I've played this game long enough to hope this review catches someone's attention to either inspire change or prevent them from gaining any more money until they get their crap together.\n\nEDIT (6/14/2021): Consistent disconnect from game servers. Results in auto-ban.\nEDIT (6/20/2021): Dealt with the Nurse \"blink bug\" a lot today. Yesterday dealt with the bug for clown where his power sometimes doesn't hinder/slow survivors. Also discovered a new bug with Blight where he has to use his basic attack before he can use his special (Rush) ability. And my game just crashed...please don't buy this game. \nEDIT (6/22/2021): Tried to use a meme build today where I used Insideous at the exit gates. Supposedly, it makes you undetectable. However, the survivors could hear me behind the closed exit gate because of default killer noise (breathing) while I was in \"undetectable\" status. This is also an issue with other killers like Demogorgon, who is supposed to be undetectable when using his ability, but his footsteps are extremely loud and distinguishable. Please don't buy this game.\nEDIT (7/26/2021) Nurse still has the blink bug. Been like 2 months now.\nEDIT (7/28/2021) Supposed recent update to fix Blight/Clown.\nEDIT (8/1/20201) This will be my last edit. At 754 hours, I F***ING QUIT.
