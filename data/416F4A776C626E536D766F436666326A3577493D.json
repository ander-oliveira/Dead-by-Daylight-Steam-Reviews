The recent removal of a bug that let you use different cosmetics in a set, for example... was patched. They took the time to fix something fun like that, which... arguably should just be available to do, anyway, and left other outrageous bugs, and issue to plague the game for years... because they can, because they have the player base to do so. \n\nPatches are outrageously slow for bugs that have been in the game for years, or simply ignored. The community at times can be an absolute cesspit of toxicity for both survivors and killers, and the level of entitlement you'll come across every single match, will drive you ballistic. \n\nThe game itself has become unplayable for me, not from a game-play standpoint, but a technical one. Patch after patch, changing things, without a single form of optimisation, that got so bad, that I became un-killable to a killer, because the stuttering, and lagging from my computer would desync me, and teleport me around the map. \nFps, and stuttering has been a huge issue for a lot of people, not just me with an older pc, but even new ones will seemingly struggle against this game. It's probably better, i don't talk about the console version, because from everything I've heard, it's pretty much completely unplayable from all the technical issues, that have been left completely unaddressed since launch. \n\nMy least favourite part is the grind, and how, even though you've now payed for the game... nothing in the game is free. the new fancy skins you want to unlock? Good-luck, have fun grinding 500 hours for it. Or it's not available for free at all, and you have to buy the new skin for $10. It can cost over a $100 to just have all of the characters unlocked. It's ridiculous, and the indervidual skins pieces are not cheap either. \n\nI can... easily go on for hours as to what the fuck is wrong with this game. Which... however tempting, will take me time, and some effort to do so. Effort, the devs never put into this game.","timestamp_created":1624401704,"timestamp_updated":1624401704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94189933","author":{"steamid":"76561198122172395","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":251,"playtime_at_review":4797,"last_played":1660587773},"language":"brazilian","review":"que

I would nearly guarantee that your first 100-125 hours are gonna be prime and you'll for the most part be loving it. The gameplay loop of DBD is very addicting and I think the grind for the most part is in a good spot. However the more you play the game the more you will end up peering behind its polished exterior and notice that at times its kind of a turd.\n\nHere are some problems:\n#1 The Devs\nThe game is in a really messy spot currently and is in need of a serious 6 month or more health patch or overhaul of a few different systems and the code. Every new update breaks a bunch of stuff that shouldn't be breaking and there are a lot of killers and gameplay systems that are suffering in their design or due to various bugs. Bugs stay around for way too long, especially really annoying ones like the Blight Camera Bug. The devs do not seem to care much about the community, or at least the higher ups don't. All they do is focus on making more money and releasing new stuff. This game is truly the only of its kind that is so successful and the devs both know this and milk it. The game just simply isn't in a healthy state and the devs will do anything to try and gloss over this. DBD is most certainly succeeding as more people are sucked in with brand deals etc but the backbone of the game is extremely weak with a lot of vet players completely gone. The growth that dbd has is just not sustainable unless they fix some of the more glaring issues. I've stopped supporting this game because of the Devs.\n\n#2 Solo Survivor\nSolo Survivor is a huge waste of time, having 0 comms with your team can became extremely frustrating at times when people just sort of do whatever. Your game can end very quickly as a solo survivor. You also don't get any more points then a group of survivors would. There is no benefit to go solo over a group. Do not buy this game if you're looking to play solo unless it is as killer.\n\n#3 The Killer System and Variance\nVariance in a multiplayer game is a good thing its a great thing but the problem with DBD is when this variance is unfun or you get strings of bad games. The player who has the most control over this variance is the killer who is basically the DM of your game session. The killer can do a lot of things to ruin your day like camping, straight up being too good (the skill based matchmaking is meh) or using a killer that isn't fun to play against. This isn't ever the killer players fault its just part of the inherent game design. The game just isn't fun when you're losing unless its an extremely close game which usually doesn't happen. They need to introduce more systems around camping or cheap tactics and also provide greater bloodpoint rewards to survivors relative to the kinds of game they can have. The killers performance is purely up to them whereas a survivor needs to rely on 3 potentially random people of varying skill levels.\n\nI would only recommend playing this game with friends unless you're playing killer. The solo survivor experience is garbage. Wait till this is on sale please. Overall the gameplay is great, so I am still gonna recommend this but purchase at your own discretion.","timestamp_created":1624398351,"timestamp_updated":1624398351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187852","author":{"steamid":"76561199165220431","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":4428,"last_played":1659722057},"language":"english","review":"Reviewing dead by daylight is a difficult task. On one hand, you have an extremely fun and unique gaming experience, either alone or with a couple of friends. On the other hand, you have a grindy frequently unbalanced game with a frustrating ranking up system. You can have some great games and some absolutely miserable games. Both from the killers and survivors side. This game brought me both pure joy and laughs, as well as frustration and discomfort. I would not classify dead by daylight as a horror title after the first 20 hours. At the same time as I hate the game i also really love it, there is no other game like dead by daylight and that is great. Would I recommend this game? The game has a semi-steep learning curve combined with having the knowledge about perks, maps, killers etc. If you are looking for a unique experience that can all be played with friends (if you are willing to play survivor) or even a solo killer experience, I would recommend you buy the base game without the dlcs. Play it for a bit and decide for yourself. I do not have any objective opinion on dead by daylight, it's all a matter of what you would want the game to be. \n\nI have had way more fun with the game than what I would care to admit so for me it's a recommend but remember my words: (this game brings great laughs as well as groans of pain as you watch your teammates do nothing for 5 minutes straight or when you get flashlight blinded for the 5th time that match as killer.)","timestamp_created":1624398246,"timestamp_updated":1624398246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187693","author":{"steamid":"76561199127424378","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2009,"last_played":1650850786},"language":"english","review":"we need more people on this game","timestamp_created":1624397952,"timestamp_updated":1624397952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187685","author":{"steamid":"76561198298266160","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":8040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5365,"last_played":1654061802},"language":"english","review":":)","timestamp_created":1624397941,"timestamp_updated":1630334468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187572","author":{"steamid":"76561198086941525","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":41396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23251,"last_played":1656527985},"language":"brazilian","review":"É tipo BOM","timestamp_created":1624397756,"timestamp_updated":1624397756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187178","author":{"steamid":"76561198141134909","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":661,"last_played":1625679666},"language":"english","review":"im a good killer","timestamp_created":1624397127,"timestamp_updated":1624397127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187054","author":{"steamid":"76561198858330108","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2099,"last_played":1652008748},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1624396919,"timestamp_updated":1624396919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94187029","author":{"steamid":"76561197961128651","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":8696,"last_played":1659472540},"language":"english","review":"While this game will never be 'balanced' in the traditional sense, it really doesn't suffer for it. \n\nThis is a game I've been playing on and off for years and it never gets old.
