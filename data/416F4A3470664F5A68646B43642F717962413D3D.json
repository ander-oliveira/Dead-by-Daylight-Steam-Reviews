feelings about the game are between mixed and love it. The concept is amazing, levels are reasonably well made, graphically I have nothing to complain about. I played for free this weekend for a good several hours as I've been sceptical due to a large number of negative reviews, played about 20ish matches both as survivor and killer.\n\nMy overall opinion is that its definitely worth a purchase on any kind of sale, otherwise spend a bit more time looking at videos and/or wait until you get a chance to play for free on a f2p weekend or this weekend if there is still time before committing as the cons I list before could be enough for some people to be put off.\n\nPositive:\n- Simple but brilliant concept.\n- Reasonably nice levels.\n- No-fuss game easy to get into game play\n- Satisfying and intense game play at times\n\nNegatives:\n- Unfortunately balance can seem a fair bit off for newer players\n- Sometimes can be greeted with people trying to exploit the system for exp (Joined a lobby where a guy was a killer and he invited 2 friends, they sat damaging and healing each other all game to grind exp spoiling the game for the rest of us)\n- Could do with more maps\n- Unfortunately its buggy at times\n- Lacks a settings menu, even for basic options like VSync. (There is a work around I believe but this is standard stuff that should be in a settings menu)\n- Plenty of game breaking bugs and frustrations.\n\nMy recommendation:\nDon't play this game expectations of levelling or as if its some sort of competitive game. It's not, go in with a frustration free, open mind and to play for fun. Don't come in expecting to grind EXP so you can get all of the perks and never lose, just play the game and deal with the issues that are there and you'll have a far more enjoyable experience.\n\nThis is why I personally suggest its not for everyone, if you're a very nit-picky person who cannot get over the minor issues this game will frustrate you. If you're a person who cannot deal with unfair games, this is also not a game for you, though there is 'balance' the game is heavily bias most of the time to the killer, but that is intentional, you will still receive exp for playing regardless and you don't have to win to have fun. Sometimes, its odd moments where you pull yourself miraculously off the killers hooks yourself and escape that are more satisfying than just simply doing the objectives and winning.","timestamp_created":1481961910,"timestamp_updated":1482026259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28420202","author":{"steamid":"76561198088467576","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1488074126},"language":"english","review":"BOOORINGGG Pointless better play overwatch and gets salty here a mountain of salt.","timestamp_created":1481961614,"timestamp_updated":1481961614,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520749032497406006","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28419997","author":{"steamid":"76561198083396894","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1587944768},"language":"koreana","review":"게임 실행이 안됩니다.. 어떻게 해야하죠","timestamp_created":1481960695,"timestamp_updated":1481960695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517591714859008789","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28419947","author":{"steamid":"76561198244089836","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1617433780},"language":"schinese","review":"那些差评都是因为机子不行就怪游戏","timestamp_created":1481960412,"timestamp_updated":1481960412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499168068170547485","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28419924","author":{"steamid":"76561198194619363","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":24900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7185,"last_played":1606360770},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, good consept.

Its a great premise and when it works, its fun. But therein lies the problem. There are definitely some connectivity issues, in addition to the game locking up in a load screen or in the main menu itself.. The other reviews that say it takes a long time to successfully find a match are not misleading. It does. It is not uncommon to see 4+ people leave your match after they get tired of waiting.\n\nWhen I do get in to a game, its not terribly balanced to new players. I'll be a rank 1 Survivor up against what feels to me like a CoD 10th Prestige killer who has all Ultra Rare Perks. How can a new player compete with that?\n\nBut that's all negative. If you're really reading this review in order to help your thoughts on the game, here's the good stuff.\n\nThe game is incredibly polished. It looks beautiful, it sounds beautiful (Which is GREAT given that audio cues are pivotal in this). The killers are different, rather than reskins of the same basic thing. They each have their own little niche and learning curve that they fall in to. It really builds a good replayable base for the game to develop from. Survivors, though few, are pretty decently customizable and you can get some good diversity between characters between the four of you.\n\nI'll finish this up with a quick summary.\n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Beautiful sound design\n-Unique and Interesting Killers\n-A Multitude of Survivors to choose from and customize\n-A decently robust leveling system for both Killer and Survivor\n-Pretty decent update schedule thus far\n\nCONS:\n-Connectivity Issues\n-Lock-up Issues\n-Poor Matchmaking\n\nOverall, I'm not yet disappointed with my purchase. Issues can be fixed and the game is still young and growing.

That said, I am NOT recommending it in hopes that the devs will be more likely to read my review. The matchmaking needs serious work. It was semi-okay for a while. Occasionally you would have a hard time finding a match. You might be kicked out to an empty lobby when trying to join. It seemed to hinge more on how many friends you were playing with. But, since this last Swamp update, finding a game is almost unbearable. I have figured out that if I'm playing by myself, the secret is to select \"Survive with Friends\" and then close out of the invite option. This puts me with people almost immediately, but I still run a high risk of it hanging up on the map load or just being kicked out during it. I just want to play!!! \n\nOnce you get in a game, it's magically delicious. The devs seem to have knocked out any real way to exploit. You can't communicate while alive (unless you are using a VoIP app), which makes it realistic, and you can't play with friends if one of you is the killer. It's kind of a bummer, but, again, destroys any communication exploits. The dynamics of the game make every match different, so there is no monotony. Again, this game is AWESOME.

Very much so. Because it has a large community and you can get into games generally pretty fast compared to other 4V1 games. I got this for free, and then bought it soon after.\n\nHOWEVER, the DEVS need to seriously get with the program!!!!!!! \n(You can either read the book I posted, or watch this short video.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d31kV-K0cXw&feature=youtu.be\n\nAs of this review, I have experience bugs and glitches that have not been fixed despite my game having to update constantly. Usually these \"updates\" are simply to add some cosmetics to the game or whatever. That urks me. You take time to add that pointless junk, but not prioritize your major issues people are having. IT'S SAYING SOMETHING WHEN YOUR BUG FORUM IS THE SECOND LARGEST FORUM IN YOUR GAME!! It's about 15k posts!!!! COME ON ALREADY!\n\n\n===THE CONS===\nFirst off, before you buy the game, or test it, be advised that you will get stuck in loading screen loops.. very often.. especially at lower survivor levels. This glitch doesn't seem to appear when you play as killer, despite level. \n\nSecond, there are bug abusers, you will find people able to use weapons that are not intended for the killer they have. Like Nurse is able to use Billy's chainsaw.. this is not intended, but it happens.. and it's very absurd.\n\nThird, your perks will randomize as a survivor.. like.. I place my perks in an order I need them in as a survivor.. so I can see the notifications easier each perk gives as a result.\nBut despite so many attempts to keep perks at a certain order.. the game will CONSTANTLY randomize them in whatever order it chooses once you enter the match. This throws me off and makes it very difficult to see if the killer is nearby. I want my perks left the way I intended them to be.. not how the glitchfest wanted them to be.\n\nForth, you will find people with large egos.. you will find killers that will stalk you the entire match, ignoring your comrades that run about them.. \nAnd some killers on top of this you can't seem to shake off, you can crawl, run, walk, they'll find you. They'll just keep following you around the map and finally if they do catch you, which they normally do, because you can only be chased for so long before it annoys the feces out of you.. they'll camp you, and smack you, when they hook you. Just to add insult to injury.. you WILL run into people like this.\n\nFifth, you will find players, and experience this yourself, where you bounce around as if lagging.. it's almost like you're losing considerable framerate, and you're in one place at one minute and then at an entirely different place the next minute.. despite your ping being perfectly fine.\n\nSixth, the DEVS don't seem to want to or even consider making bugs a priority.. some bugs are annoying but can be overlooked, while others are ultimately game breaking.\n\nPeople have been complaining and complaing.. the bug forums are filled with the stuff I mentioned.. and it doesn't seem like the DEVS even care. \nEventually people are going to wise up, or ANOTHER GAME is going to be released that has DEVS who actually LISTEN to the COMMUNITY.. but by that time.. it'll be too late for this game and it'll be old news. And when that happens, the DEVS of DbD will have NO ONE to blame but THEMSELVES.","timestamp_created":1481953447,"timestamp_updated":1482742807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28418733","author":{"steamid":"76561198339267209","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1314,"last_played":1657597263},"language":"russian","review":"игра очень драйвовая. рекомендую","timestamp_created":1481953358,"timestamp_updated":1481953358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28418589","author":{"steamid":"76561198195746939","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":76774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29158,"last_played":1659262059},"language":"english","review":"9/10, At first it can be a little frustrating by constantly losing being a survivor but thats part of it...

Por favor añadan servidores dedicados.PLEASE ADD OFFICIAL SERVERS\n-ultimamente estan vendiendo dlc de 6 o 7 dolares donde te da la posivilidad de usar asesinos y supervivientes que otros no pueden usar.Los asesinos de los dlc son mas dificiles de combatir que los normales, busquen en internet algun gameplay de alguien usando a the hag o a michael miers y vean que facil que la tienen\n-el emparejamiento: puede que seas nivel 1 y que estes jugando contra un nivel 10, esto nunbca me afecto pero se puede ver que a mucha gente si.\n-interminables bugs que afectan la jugabilidad (solo mira en el artwork de la comunidad y veras varias capturas de bugs)\n\nalgo que no se si es bueno o malo es el arbol de abilidades, que se genera al azar, pudiendote dar cosas malas mientras que a otro le toco algo impresionante, y los dos son el mismo nivel\n\nTrate de escribir esto de manera objetiva, en el unico lugar que doy mi opinion es respecto a los dlc.No recomiendo este juego, mejor espera a
