The game has had its up and plenty of its downs and I mean a lot. Others rose to dethrone it and failed but not without a valiant effort. It's hard to establish a foothold in a genre that didn't really exist and keep going (almost 4 years to-date) while still having a player base as well as a development team that didn't abandon ship.\n\nThe game will never be truly balanced. You will lose, a lot. From being tunneled by the killer or getting destroyed by competent survivors. This is paired with the continual release of perks from killers/survivors joining the fray.\n\nOverall, I've loved this game. I wish my hours reflected more of that but even I took Matt's message to heart. \"Play something else.\" You won't ever hear a Dev tell you to take a break from their own game and with that, I respect the man despite how much of a meme he has been in the first couple of years.\n\nEvents:\nWith the release of Tomes/Rifts, I absolutely loathe the game more than ever. Granted past objective events were not at all that great. This requires more play time.\n\nTL;DR\nRecommend: Yes but be prepared to feel like in an abusive relationship.","timestamp_created":1574915277,"timestamp_updated":1580027890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58348197","author":{"steamid":"76561198063152596","num_games_owned":443,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":33651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7135,"last_played":1654316895},"language":"spanish","review":"gran juego, gran comunidad, estas siempre atentos de lo que busca la gente de entregar nuevo contenido esta muy genial recomendado a full la mejor inversion de todas para las horas de entretencion que da","timestamp_created":1574915233,"timestamp_updated":1574915233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58348065","author":{"steamid":"76561198258354232","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":70446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60035,"last_played":1649149589},"language":"koreana","review":"킹갓인디게임! 버그 찾는 것도 컨텐츠!","timestamp_created":1574915172,"timestamp_updated":1574915172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58346609","author":{"steamid":"76561198065457958","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":56359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3215,"playtime_at_review":12929,"last_played":1660335775},"language":"russian","review":"Невозможно прочитать комментарий к игре.

R6: Siege with 600 hours. And this with 200 hours. I play alot of other games, but for some reason this one is super satisfying, both as a survivor and a killer. Alot of people, including quite a few of my friends, do not like this game, and at first I can understand why. But to be completely honest, if you just put time, effort and a bit of video watching on Youtube, you get better and it starts getting super addictive. It is alot unlike other games so don't get discouraged by the learning curve. Last but not least, this game I believe was made by creators in Quebec, Canada which is my home province and there's alot of pride to that for me. I want to show as much support as I can. Hopefully this review was somewhat helpful.
