You can't do anything as a survivor with a laggy host and on top of that lose your item and rank upon death since you don't have enough points. Until they fix this issue either with dedicated servers or recognition of the host being too laggy and not penalizing dc's, \"it'll be a no from me.\"\n\nEDIT: New patch updates game so that you can not unhook before disarming a trap but still gives the option of unhooking. There should be a mechanic that prioritizes disarming a trap first if there is a trap underneath a hooked survivor.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Vaults are literally useless and I don't understand why they call the action a vault anymore as you seem to walk over the windows instead...","timestamp_created":1473658913,"timestamp_updated":1479962483,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25474567","author":{"steamid":"76561198159583667","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1487,"last_played":1648084838},"language":"english","review":"This game it's really fun! I really enjoy how it is difficult for survivors to get away from the killer as it allows for interesting jukes and dodging mechanics! The games I've played were all fun as I rev my chainsaw to down survivors or hide out in closets in the basements. I've never seen an asymmetric game done so well and balanced. \nThis is 10/10 best fitness game because I lose so much weight forgetting to eat.\nAs for my recommendations for different Survivor Perks and Killer Perks, something to do with trapping the killer, like 'Vine Knowledge' where you can set up a small slowing trap for the killer in a really small area (5/10/15% slowdown). Maybe for killers, a perk that allows you to lock the Escape Hatch, (temporarily, permanently (unless 2 survivors open it together), and permanently).\nAgain, I really enjoy this game, it's super fun and cool.

As soon as he sees you, he will hastily rush towards you sprinting towards your love and eventually a hook up will be yours to enjoy!\n\nWraith: The exotic Casanova type, always appearing when you least expect him ready to give you the attention you need. Be careful not to be too eager as he has been known to disappear again, but have faith his love will return.  Just listen for the bells!
