However, that time I've put in gives me the experience to point out the massive flaws in this game.\n\n1. When I play with friends, it's slightly common for a killer to see us all pop into a lobby at the same time, and then disconnect once we've started loading into the map. We then lose our offerings because of a killer who doesn't want to face a  coordinated team of 4.\n\n2. Lag. There's no real fix for this one because this game is a peer-to-peer connection kind of game. I very rarely ever find a game with double-digit ping. For me in NYC, I usually find games with around 120-150ms ping.\n\n3. The Flashlight is almost completely useless. Unless you find yourself with an incredibly slow killer, you'll probably go down before the Killer is blinded. This is especially true for the faster Killers in this game.\n\n4. The Saboteur perk. Sure, it was incredibly OP in the beginning, since you could break literally all the hooks on the map except for the basement hooks. Now after the nerf however, it's completely useless. Hooks can magically unbreak after a certain period of time? How does that make sense? There are better ways to solve this problem, and making hooks regen is not one of them.\n\n5. There's something wrong with the tapping mechanic when one is hooked. Sometimes a person struggling on the hook will just die, even when tapping furiously on the space key. Something is just off here.\n\n6. This game is heavily skewed in the Killer's favor. This critique, to me, is the biggest one out of all the ones I've listed. Some perks allow a Killer to see a Survivor's aura for long periods of time. 'Long' in this game can mean just a couple seconds, but it does not take long at all to go from one end of the map to the other, as these maps are actually quite small.\nMonsters like the Hillbilly, Nurse, Spirit, and the alien looking thing are able to teleport, making it easy to catch up to highlighted survivors. Shape and Legion can easily close distances by just simply being fast. The combination of long distance detection and fast mobility can make this game too difficult to figure out and enjoy, even when coordinating with three other friends. Nurse's Calling and BBQ and Chili are two perks in particular that are near impossible to beat when paired together.\n\nOverall, if you're specifically looking for a highly suspenceful online co op game, this is it. But if you're just looking for a game in general to maybe play with friends some of the time, you'd probably be better off with something else.\n\nEDIT: Patch 2.5 just came out! They buffed a few survivor stuff. But they also buffed Killers, like a lot more.\nEDIT: It's January 2020! Happy New Year! Anyways, the Killers are still kinda OP. In some games, I feel like there's just little to no hope of getting out alive. I only hop on this game now with friends just to pass the time. It's hardly that exciting any more. If me and my friends had found something cool to play instead of this game, I really wouldn't have put so many hours into it.\nEDIT: August 2020! I hope you've been doing well all things considered. This game is still pretty bad honestly. The probability of finding highly ranked killers is pretty high. Things in my opinion are still heavily skewed in the killers' favor.

WEL THATS TU BADD!!! What i AM going to tell you, is why you SHOULD get this ga-uh wait a minute....okay nvm :( Eny-who. So. Right. Okay, so, you just get home from a STE-RESSFUL day at work, or maybe a bit of a rumbux with the missus...you know what you wanna do? THATS right, play some facken DBD. Cause when you're pissed off at the world, seething, boiling....cooking if you will, there's nothing better to do, then play a game of ring around the fucken rosie, whether you're playing killer....\"\"K I L L E R\"\", or survivor (God). \n\nBut you're probably wondering, \"hey dick-head, what else does this curse-i mean game have to offer?!?!?\" WEYULL, for one, each bitc- killer has a special ability that they can use to alter the course of the game and the god-awful chases within them. Both survivors AND babies.....wait, NOT babies? oh okay, i mean killers, each have their own ways of dealing with each other. Survivors and their toxic fucking 360 spins, killers and their sicc moon-walking, and the one and only....PALLET  L O O P S. There are also perks that the killer and survivor can use, Hex: Ruin for example, which is used to slow teh game down \"JuSt a Lil biT !?!?\", and facken...ugh....dear i say it....D E C I S I V E   S T R I K E  *commits suicide* \n\nAND if those survivor perks weren't butt-facken annoying already, they've also got these lil thangs we call \"items\" or as baby-killers have come to call them...weapons [ :( times infinity ]. \"what exactly ARE these items, dickwad?!?!\" well that is a HORRIBLE question. We don't talk about it in front of the baby-killers, at least :/ Well first off, you got flashlights, used for blinding the killer like a true asshole, aswell as some SPICEY moonwalks. Then you've got the medkits, pretty much fortnut healing in a nutshell (or alternatively you can use that one negro gals \"self-care\" perk to heal yourself, killers take 2 hits to down you btw after that they can hook you, which takes 3 hooks for you to die, sometimes 2 if you struggle too much or dont get sav- wait a minute....why TF am i telling you this? check out a fackin community guide or some shit....focken parasite >:(  anyway, you also got toolboxes, which you can use to gen-rush the killer lyke the true toxic survivor you are >:( and uhh, maps....well, we dont talk about those :(\n\nAnd last but not least, you got the killer weapons/abilities and addons. Both of which are annoying as fack for survivors (but not killers >:) SPECIALLY shit ones like Hex: NOED or...ugh...Hex: Devour Hope :( feelsbadman, don't even get me started on huntress' lullaby and Hex: Ruin :( But if you're wondering what makes the killers abilities annoying for you baby survivors??? thats right, killers have adapted to your toxic 360's and jukes, well....most of them have, baby killers exist, it's a fact we can't deny, BUT we respect them regardless...okay survivors? >:( \n\nCause i know a couple of guys and gals that have hard time playing killer, or just the game in general, and then in the post-G chat, they get some friendly ass comments :( This is why i love and hate the DBD community, cause getting nice survivors is a bit of r'n'g, you never know what you're gonna get, but regardless, you know you're always going to get the most common reward, in this case; toxic survivors that talk shit. Something i've noticed tho, is that most survivors will find any and i mean ANY excuse to put you down and class you as a \"shit\" killer. Even if ya play fairly :/ Heck, i gave the last guy the hatch once (alternative escape if the doors arent open), and in the post-game chat he scolded me for being a \"soft-pansy that lacked any true talent\" XD what a bloke, wouldnt ya say?\n\nAnd on the other side of things, there's the toxicness that killers possess, be it camping or tunneling. Camping...well....we won't get into that :( and tunneling...yeah, pretty much goin after the same poor sod time and time again, thats all ima say :(.
