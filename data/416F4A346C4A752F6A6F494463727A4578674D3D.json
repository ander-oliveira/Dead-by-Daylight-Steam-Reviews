Até o final da semana ele tinha 24 horas neste jogo. Isso foi horrível para mim, pois já era difícil encontrar maneiras de passar o tempo com meu filho, pois ele está sempre com os amigos ou apenas assistindo ao YouTube. Então eu decidi fazer uma conta no Steam e pegar esse jogo para ver se eu poderia jogar ao lado dele. Eu comprei o jogo, escolhi minha skin e mundo e comecei a jogar, mas eu estava preso no que você deveria fazer. Pedi ajuda ao meu filho e ele organizou um jogo para eu participar. Adorei, pois foi o melhor momento que passei com meu filho desde que minha esposa morreu. Desde então, esse jogo aproximou eu e meu filho novamente e agora passamos um tempo juntos fora de casa também.

The knocking is getting louder. You recognize the voices, but something is off about them. They are telling you to let them in. Are you prepared for the situation? If not, then you are already behind, and your chances for survival have drastically decreased. Today, we will discuss how to effectively defend against home invasion. All you need is a 12 gauge shotgun, an M84 flash bang, One bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce, and a 20,000 kilogram block of solid Uranium-235. We first must create a diversion. This will distract the assailants so you have an opening for tactical withdrawal. It is for this reason that we brought the barbecue sauce. With your buff, we’ll toned arm, lob the barbecue sauce out the window at exactly 100 m/s and an angle directly parallel to the outside ground. This gives you exactly 1.11 seconds to escape the vicinity before the barbecue sauce lands on the ground and explodes into a lethal fireball as all nearby objects are incinerated by a common household condiment burning at 6,000° Celsius. A single tear escapes your eye, as you realize, you will probably never taste the sweet nectar of Sweet Baby Rays ever again. Not after the Sigma variant caused the downfall of the barbecue sauce supply chain; a great regime of unwavering glory that surpassed the Roman Empire at its peak. But right now, more important matters are at hand. You will never forget the sacrifice that Sweet Baby Rays made to save your own life, and entrust in your hands the future of human civilization. You must now take action and seek immediate vengeance. Carefully breach your bedroom door with the 12 gauge shotgun and clear the outside area with an M84 flash bang. Then, run towards the nearest exit while making random turns and detours to confuse the enemy; for if you do not know your next move, neither can they. Finally, once you are outside, it is time to unleash the fury of a 20,000 kilogram block of solid subcritical uranium-235. With your house surrounded, it only makes sense that you make one last stand for the survival of human civilization. This is what you have been preparing for. Assuming you have not been lacking, you should easily be able to replicate the compression effects of a chemically fueled assembly nuclear weapon explosive lens with your bare hands to force the fissile uranium into super criticality. Causing an exponential growth of nuclear chain reactions that releases 226,000,000,000 joules of energy into the surrounding environment. But this is not a tragic case of self sacrifice, because you took a swig of Sweet Baby Rays before running out of the house. You will not go gentle into this good night, for souped up on the sweet nectar of God, you are now essentially a human nuclear recoilless gun. No mortal shall oppose you now, for you have ascended to a plane of existence touched by no other living human. Your opponents will not even realize what is happening before a beam of fissile material transfers five hundred kilotons of TNT through their chest, killing them instantly. You are above humanity now. You are a God. The entire world is at your fingertips and you can do anything you want on a whim.

Killers were already strong if you played it right (ranged killers exist, pick them and you're good to go), now they nerfed survivors into the ground and buffed killers into nirvana.

Good change to the blood rank system and borrowed time though. Matchmaking incentives are a great idea. But that's it. Not going to touch survivor anymore, that's for sure. I don't know why these developers are unable to balance this game.
