Many many hours of gameplay and all around balanced with a good community. The game places 4 survivors in a map with the objective of repairing 5 generators which once done will power exit gates where a survivor can escape through. There is one killer which will attempt to stop as many survivors from escaping as they can, either by sacrificing them or finishing them themself. Players can use perks to aid gameplay, both on the killer and survivor side of the game. Gameplay is very simple to understand and get a good grasp of.

Основные моменты опишу в двух словах, не поленитесь прочитать, если хотите услышать действительно правдивый отзыв о данном продукте\n\nТимплей:\nРазработчики очень постарались над ранговой системой и благодаря ей тебя кидает в матч к ребятам, соответствующим по скиллу, которые всегда помогут, подхилят, снимут с крюка когда ман далеко и не станут сбегать в ворота при первой возможности. Помимо этого плюса - есть еще один - у меня ни разу не было такого, что бы я попал к ребятам, у которых ранг выше или ниже моего хотя бы на один. Всегда кидает к тому рангу, который действительно равен твоему!\n\nГеймплей:\nОчень порадовала проработанность хитбоксов в этой игре. Как у манов так и у сюрвов. Если касаться маньяков - то очень реалистично проработан \"конус\" удара маньяка перед собой, иногда очень трудно хитовать сюрва, так как нет никакой помощи вроде автонаведения и целится приходится самому. Сложнее всего хитовать сюрвов в окнах, т.к. маньяк уже не может достать сюрва после прыжка оного в окно. Хиты в палетках тоже не удается удачно проводить, т.к. хитбокс выживших всегда оказывается по противоположную сторону паллеты при её опрокидывании, плюс если учесть стабильность серверов и минимальнейшего пинга благодаря стабильному интернет соединению всех участников матча - то всецело образуется картина качественного хоста на базе серверов игры (хостом выступают именно сервера игры, а не сервер маньяка, как вы могли подумать)\n\nБалланс:\nНужно отдать разработчикам должное - видно что они проделали титанический труд в плане балансировки и скаждым обновленем добавляют небольшие поправки, что бы игра была более честной как по отношению к маньякам так и по отношению к выжившим. Что мне нравится, как мейнеру сюрвов - это то что разработчики часто апают перки, подношения и аддоны сюрвам, а манам нерфят, думаю это должно привнести справедливый баланс в игру.\n\nРазработчики:\nТут всё безусловно на высшем уровне. С момента выхода игры за три с половиной года поменялось огромное количество аспектов. Если сравнить начальные версии и настоящую - то, пожалуй, это можно назвать двумя разными частями одной истории! Чего только стоит нюрса, самый старый маньяк в игре, она изменилась до неузнаваемости за это время. Но если честно - то разработчикам вместо того что бы с каждым патчем улучшать поведение хитбоксов и постоянно заниматься тестированием новых маньяков перед их релизом, стоит почаще добавлять косметические предметы в игру для поддержания интереса у игроков, дабы они могли почаще кастомизировать своих персонажей, поскольку этого игре пока что категорически не хватает!\n\nКомьюнити:\nНаверное тут всё не так солнечно как в предыдущих пунктах. Сейчас объясню почему. К сожалению меня часто кидало к разным англоязычным игрокам, которые после того как мы все вместе сбегали в ворота, писали в чат что-то вроде \"Tnank you guys\" или \"Have a nice time today\"...и так как я не силён в иностранных языках - могу предположить что они были чем-то недовольны и это негативно сказалось на моём отзыве о комьюнити. Но вроде как в остальном играя за манов ты никогда не встретишь тибагающих выживших, слепящих тебя фонарями или с инстахилами, или играя за сюрвов - маньяков, которые стоят тебе в лицо перед крюком, я лично с таким не сталкивался за 700+ часов в игре, но друзья говорили что такое изредко бывает. Но оглядываясь на количество плюсов этого продукта - этот минус просто меркнет.\n\nБонус:\nЕсли вы ходите поиграть в атмосферный хоррор с друзьями, над которым компетентная команда разработчиков трудится уже третий год, с ламповым комьюнити и небольшим количеством багов (а для игр 2к19 года это редкость) - то обязательно купите этот продукт, желательно за полную стоимость, без скидки, так как студия определённо заслужила эти деньги!\n\nP.s: Для тех кто очень может в иронию  - добавьте после каждого пункта смайл \"Kappa\" и всё станет на свои места.","timestamp_created":1549217675,"timestamp_updated":1572693148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539267003536224365","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48739785","author":{"steamid":"76561198322763531","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":18560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15577,"last_played":1598819696},"language":"polish","review":"Pewnie

DbD is basically hide & seek for adults - a concept which, admittedly, has me sold by default. To play, first you choose a role (either killer or survivor) and then select a character from the generous (and growing) roster. The gist of it: as a survivor you must fix 5 generators to power up 2 gates so you can open them and run away. As a killer you must keep the survivors from accomplishing this, chasing and slashing them, hooking them on meat hooks and so on, and so forth. Besides a number of alternative possibilities to achieve \"winning conditions\" which you will learn by playing the game, the catch is that everyone has perks, which are traits akin to superpowers. New players will plow through a bunch of hours before they understand why others manage to do some of the things they do. For that reason it is very important to get to know the perks, so take your time. Everything falls into place once you get to know the game. Most of the content is accessible without the purchase of any DLC's too, which is to say you can grind for most of the characters and respective perks instead of buying them. Aside from minor design choices and bugs, my only real issue with the game resides in its skill ceiling. Maybe I've just grown too used to online games in which 300 hours of playtime are barely enough to give you a proper chance at higher ranks, but I just wish that after 300 something hours I didn't feel like I've dealt with pretty much everything this game can throw at you... here's hoping they keep putting out content, including the fabled brand new mode the community has been craving so much.\n\nIf any of this sounds good to you and with the amount of effort being put into improving the game constantly, as well as a thriving community both in and out of the game (shout-out official DbD subreddit), you should be in for at least a couple hundred hours of quality entertainment with this game. With that, I'll say that Dead by Daylight has seen me through some of my darkest days. The whole vibe around the game is awesome and though there's definitely some room for improvement in the game in general, no other game currently in the market accomplishes what DbD does.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\n8.0/10","timestamp_created":1549187275,"timestamp_updated":1549187453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496993005275726318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48730119","author":{"steamid":"76561198805802249","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":119,"playtime_at_review":7955,"last_played":1660515218},"language":"polish","review":"Gra super, lecz wg. mnie, system bezpieczeństwa lekko niedopracowany.
