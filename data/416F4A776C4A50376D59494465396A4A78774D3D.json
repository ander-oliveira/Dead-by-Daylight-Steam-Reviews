game can be very frustrating if you get tryhard killers/survivors or teammates who do absolutely nothing, however I think once you get past the lowest ranks of the game, things start to get better with finding competent survivors and less toxic killers. Whilst I have only ever mained Feng Min (I just liked her character, and got it before knowing that Fengs are often targeted), I'm already excited for getting her shared perks maxed out then trying to main other characters, as this does become important later on in the game if you want any kind of worthwhile builds. The game is fairly easy to get into, though as I mentioned some lower ranked lobbies may be toxic/tryharding, but you can push through those fairly quickly. Pricing of DLCs is good, especially as there's a discount on right now, but you can also work towards characters by levelling up and getting iridescent shards. Good alone, better with friends and generally a fun game to kill some hours on. 8/10 since the community is pretty toxic.","timestamp_created":1658750684,"timestamp_updated":1658750684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119438340","author":{"steamid":"76561199338939140","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5136,"playtime_at_review":4413,"last_played":1660597153},"language":"german","review":"многие из них токсичны, многие кемпинги в туннелях, но все равно очень весело играть","timestamp_created":1658750357,"timestamp_updated":1658750357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119436614","author":{"steamid":"76561199376056032","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":70,"playtime_at_review":1254,"last_played":1660225074},"language":"schinese","review":"不建议入坑，玩杀手最难受的不是抓不到人，是抓不到人还会被人类各种蹲起手电筒嘲讽，","timestamp_created":1658747637,"timestamp_updated":1658884031,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119436393","author":{"steamid":"76561198373662974","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3038,"last_played":1655568326},"language":"koreana","review":"니애미","timestamp_created":1658747290,"timestamp_updated":1658747290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119436317","author":{"steamid":"76561199135281618","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2713,"playtime_at_review":49667,"last_played":1660503047},"language":"english","review":"Really fun game and enjoyable with friends.
