I think we all did at one point. This concept is still pretty fresh so I can forgive this game's shortcomings in some ways. Unfortunately, what I can't get over is this game's complete lack of depth and feel. \n\nAs it stands currently there is only one game mode. Flip on a bunch of generators using QTE's and run circles through windows to outrun the psycho and escape. I don't think this is the sort of game people thought of when they heard \"1v4 where YOU play the killer!\" and it's left a sour taste in my mouth. It's just a quickmatch arena game that could have any kind of subject matter and not feel out of place. Replace all the assets with literally anything else and it'd be the same game. Nothing was done to hammer the \"YOU play the killer!\" part. At no point does this game feel like an 80's slasher flick. You're just in a field switching on generators to power a door that'll let you leave. It doesn't make sense. Why are they even there in the first place? Why do you need this many generators just to open a door? I can only handle so much suspension of disbelief before it just completely destroys my immersion. This is what disappointed me the most.\n\nIf this game were actually a lot of fun then I could forget all that and just have a good time. Unfortunately I didn't find it fun in the least. There's nothing fun about waiting at a generator for minutes on end performing really limp QTEs. This basically encompasses the entire gameplay for the survivors. The killer's just a bit more fun but unfortunately I can never find a game where I can play as one since that's what everyone else wants to do and I don't blame them. You either get plucked off within seconds of joining or you have to suffer through QTEs and button mashing. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the bugs. I'll leave it to the other reviews to handle all that. Bugs can be fixed. The gameplay, however, will not.\n\nTo conclude. There's no immersion, nothing makes sense, it's not even fun and the whole thing just feels like they cobbled it all together so they could be one of the firsts to make a game with that \"play as the killer!\" premise. If they could add a few more gamemodes and take out those daming QTEs then I'd give this game another shot. Until then I can't recommend it.","timestamp_created":1470381507,"timestamp_updated":1470381636,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500823736190795898","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24720794","author":{"steamid":"76561198312336523","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2784,"last_played":1470651437},"language":"schinese","review":"一直秒退啊能不能处理处理这个问题","timestamp_created":1470381398,"timestamp_updated":1470381398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24720707","author":{"steamid":"76561198118327236","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1647124175},"language":"english","review":"trash game","timestamp_created":1470380880,"timestamp_updated":1627426453,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24720634","author":{"steamid":"76561198135633271","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":16354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1812,"last_played":1569849092},"language":"russian","review":"Когда мне грустно, я захожу за маньяка и...\n\nИ помогаю людям искать генераторы.

They care more about the bad skins they put out than fixing month old or year old bugs, every patch or so their game breaks, the game went from being fun and casual to sweaty and toxic with people face camping and slugging and trying so hard for a 4k like their life depends on it then flames everyone in the end game chat. The sad part of all of this is its been promoted by the devs as a \"strategy\" so killers continue to have really bad behavioral issues and have scummy playstyles.\n\nSome honorable mentions from the toxic players I've come across \"I'm going to go to your house and shotgun you in the chest 7 times in your living room and make sure you die a painful death\" (Because I ran this 6k hour huntress for 5 gens) \"I hope you get cancer and die\" and the usual kill yourself haha funny!!!

It's not perfect, but nothing is. The sooner you learn to accept that fact; the easier your life will be. \n\n This game does a really good job of balancing risk and reward as well as critical thinking and understanding. It's not just about survival; it's about weighing your options. Is it worth it to risk your life to save your teammate? Is it worth his to save yours? What do you value more- your dignity or your skin? The killer plays the game in first person perspective while the survivors are given a third person perspective, and this spearpoint of a mechanic sets the tone for the entire game. As the killer your greatest weapon(besides a jagged machete and rusty beartrap) is thinking like your prey. Knowing where they'll run, where they'll hide- how they'll react to the actions you take. As a survivor; there are two things that will get you killed faster than anything else. 1) Panic. 2) Movement. By abusing blind spots, vision cones, and the most basic forms of camoflouge and deception- survivors can evade or escape the killer to live another day. \n\nThe question remains... \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill you be dead by doorknobs?\n\n*cough, I mean daylight.

To start, I absolutely fucking loved this game! But, I also fucking hated it. Actually, that's strill trye now. But more on the love side less on the hate. Reason for that? The lurning curve isn't a lurning curve; It's a lurning sheer drop. But once you get the hang of it, as survivor and killer, with a pinch of luck, the game is awesome. Of course, the game is still riddled in bugs glitches and crashes, and a lot of them can screw you over. (eg loss of rank, bloodpoints etc.)\n\nSo after playing dozens of hours more of this game, I am switching my negative review to a positive one. I would definitely recommend this game, and it's an amazing game to play with friends.\n\nJust two things that will make you bash every little key of your keyboard out:\n-Camping killers (Seriously? You want that kill so bad? don't look at him chin to chin, just roam around until some survivor tries to free him! You might even get a dual kill!)\n-Juke cheesing survivors (A lot of killers use this as an excuse for camping hooks. Although I don't believe that to be a valid excuse, it needs to stop. If this happens to you as a killer, just walk away rather than spend time with these 12 year olds. And by the way, juke cheesing is basically going around in a circle, jumping over windows that killers take longer to do, in an endless chain of not being caught.)\n\n-Oh a third thing - Bugs. If you don't like unsquashed bugs, give this game a few weeks or months before playing it :)\n\nEd","timestamp_created":1470348325,"timestamp_updated":1471858390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24715059","author":{"steamid":"76561197996174637","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2047,"last_played":1656616797},"language":"german","review":"Geiles Game ! \n\nNur.. welcher Vollidiot hat sich diese Dumme LUCKE..! ausgedacht !?\nAls würde man es als Killer nicht schwer genug haben, haut der letzte Überlebende immer durch die Lucke ab !!! \nwasn Scheiss ;(","timestamp_created":1470346855,"timestamp_updated":1470346855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475307047367095947","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24715013","author":{"steamid":"76561198045464442","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2681,"last_played":1563315310},"language":"english","review":"This is a really fun game to play whether you play with friends or not.

Задумка реализована просто гениально. Вариантивность игровых стилей впечатляет. Прокачка персонажей присутствует, впрочем, как и система ранкеда. \n\nОднако все положительные аспекты с лихвой перекрывают недостатки. Захотев поиграть, вы сразу столкнетесь с огромной массой проблем, то у вас не находит игру (приходится постоянно кликать кнопку \"готов\"), что весьма проблематично (особенно когда люди предпочитают заняться другими делами во время поиска игры), если вам все-таки повезло и вы попали в лобби, маньяк может по мановению пальца распустить лобби, тем самым заставив вас испытать муки поиска снова. Количество персонажей достаточно, но кастомизация практически отсутствует, а у маньяка ее вообще нет. Система баланса ужасна. Ок, вы зашли в игру и настроились насладиться игрой с другом, однако, против вас может попасться маньяк с огромной массой скиллов и всяких прочих фишек, в итоге вы не понимая, что происходит отлетаете от него за 5 минут, попутно поражаясь как могли по вам попасть, если вы перепрыгнули укрытие и уже успели отбежать метра на 3. Постоянные баги с анимациями, вырываясь с плеча маньяка вы легко можете выпасть туда, где вы не могли находиться. Из игры вас легко может кикнуть, при этом вы естественно потеряете ранг, который зарабатывали потом и кровью.\n\nИтог: Игра сырая, как весла после академической гребли. Покупать рекомендуется, если перечисленные выше факторы вас не смущают или вы до безумия любите хорроры и скупаете все, что с ними связано.","timestamp_created":1470346050,"timestamp_updated":1470346342,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503484547138214111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24714391","author":{"steamid":"76561198127260974","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":487,"last_played":1488580406},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game to play, it's fun, and....fun.

A lot of fun.\n\nHowever, a friend of mine was banned in DBDL. The reason is that he installed a language patch into the game before the new version realease, after which he was not able to join in the game as a survivor for 95% of the time and was told to be banned later. I sent an appeal email to EAC, and they still have not replied. I have heard that they never reply, so I am not really expecting anything from them.\n\nIn a local forum of mine, I saw the Developers reply to someone who was questioning the fact that those reported cheating or tempering with game files have not been properly dealt with, like getting banned. Okay, so they mentioned that it takes time to ban someone because it has to be absolutely sure, and I understand. But first and foremost, could you not ban someone wrongly? As I turned to mods, I was told they and the developers are not able to deal with any bans happened already. So what could we do? A man paid full money on the game, and for his life has always done things with integrity even in the game, was now banned 200% for sure wrongly and could turn to no one for help because the EAC never reply and the Developers will simply spare the responsibility by saying “Sorry we can’t help, send an email to EAC???”. This is the annoying point. Okay I want to make this clear again and for the last time. He for 300% sure was merely installing a language patch, and did not do any single action that violated the rules, like cheating or tampering with the game file. If you said, that merely installing a language patch should be banned, then I accept, alright? If that is what you are telling me, then I give up. But just take a look at those cheaters, they are still enjoying their games with nothing happened. Ridiculous.\n\n8.12\nOkay I wanna make this clear. This negative review is only directed against the attitudes the Developers have been showing on dealing with wrong ban and appeal, and the fact that my friend was banned wrongly. This game, itself, is absolutely awesome with so much fun. However, this is like you are watching a tennis game with a full price ticket, and you got thrown out from the audience because the guy next to you threw a bottle into the pitch. I guess no one would give a positive review to the match in this case.","timestamp_created":1470328923,"timestamp_updated":1529928201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":38,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24710554","author":{"steamid":"76561198186107590","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1497645233},"language":"french","review":"alors pour le moment je ne vait pas voter ce jeux favorablement car comme plusieurs l'on signaler et je le confirme le jeux et beuguer pour rejoindre une parti ces la croix de la bannière 5 minute pour tomber sur une parti domage car ce jeux a du potentiel mai  exploiter en espérant que les dev vons ce réveiller et sortir une mise a jour qui corrige tous ça","timestamp_created":1470328550,"timestamp_updated":1470328550,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512548267841339111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24710317","author":{"steamid":"76561198277476377","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":46948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1653988893},"language":"thai","review":"Very Fun Game I Hope The New Update Will Be Soon","timestamp_created":1470327677,"timestamp_updated":1470327677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24710206","author":{"steamid":"76561198017387255","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":32995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23249,"last_played":1637485742},"language":"schinese","review":"很有意思的游戏 紧张刺激 但是某鱼主播完成了搞笑游戏","timestamp_created":1470327250,"timestamp_updated":1479226908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24710012","author":{"steamid":"76561198112970950","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8430,"last_played":1513258087},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER","timestamp_created":1470326414,"timestamp_updated":1470326414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436219453811645508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24709858","author":{"steamid":"76561198080975660","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5084,"last_played":1610307567},"language":"english","review":"Dead by daylight is really fun!
