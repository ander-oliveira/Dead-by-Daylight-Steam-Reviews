The developers do whatever they can to please their fans by attempting to balance out the game, fix bugs, or make new cosmetics to blend in the dark or stand out from the crowd, even though it may take a while, but I prefer they take their time so nothing looked like it was rushed. The developers (in my encounters with them mind you...) are genuinely approachable when it comes to asking questions about their game, they will sometimes shrug off some questions (if they’re just plain idiotic or have nothing to do with their game) but they certainly give you the answer you’ve been looking for, or maybe they want to keep it quiet if it’s planned for a future DLC. Even the big man himself is rather approachable and enjoys answering questions his fans inquire on his stream (not the Dead by Daylight twitch stream by the way...) I’ve gotten a few of my questions answered myself, but I’d rather not say personally. All I can say about the developers, They’re doing a pretty good job so far. Still good to this day.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, it may seem to take a lot when you actually play the game for the first time. At first, there was no tutorial on how to play the game so you had to learn on your own, but thankfully it was put in for newcomers later on and get 50, 000 bloodpoints and a free charm for completing the it. Playing as survivor, your objective is to turn on all 5 generators (or less depending who doesn’t connect to the host of the server) and open the escape gates to survive. Seems easy enough that is, you’re being hunted down by the killer who wants to sacrifice you to the entity, a parasitic spider-like god that feeds on any emotion, mainly hope and rage. Playing as the killer, your objective is simple, hunt down the survivors and sacrifice them to your spider god on rusted meat hooks.\n\nThese characters have different ways to earn blood points which is the in game currency. For survivors it would objective, survival, altruism and boldness. Objective is quite simple, you just have to work on generators to earn these points or search through chests that are scattered from each map. Survival is how long you live until you finally escape from the killer’s clutches or die trying. Altruism is either reuniting with your team members, distracting the killers to keep your injured friend safe or help heal them. And lastly, boldness, this one give you points for sticking close to the killer who hunts for you, stunning/blinding or escaping from a chase from them. The more you of these tasks, you’ll be able to unlock new items or perks from using the blood web.\n\nObtaining blood points for Killers are chase, destruction, sacrifice and deceit. Chase is simple, go after the survivor until you successfully knock them down. Destruction is for destroying pallets/walls and generators to prevent them from escaping. Sacrifice, another simple one, hook the survivors on the meat hooks three times until they are sacrificed to the spider god. And deceit, for using your abilities against the survivors. \n\nAs I mentioned before, the blood web is basically leveling up your characters, starting it off with survivors, you can unlock items to help you out throughout the matches you’re in. \n The main items for survivors are flashlights that blind killers for a few seconds, med kits to help increase your healing rate for yourself or your teammates, toolboxes to repair generators faster or sabotage the killer’s meat hooks, maps to help guide to look for chest, generators and trap doors and lastly, the key, this will help you open the trap door if it becomes difficult to open the gates. For killers you can get add ons(same goes for the items for survivors) for their abilities which varies on what killer you choose. However, all killers can obtain moris, which let you kill a survivor after hooking them twice or if there is only one survivor left.\n\nAgain, it seems a lot, but when you continue playing it you will eventually get the hang of it. Now, there are some cons in this game, but mainly it’s the community which is no surprise. People continuously argue who or what needs to be \"nerfed\", usually it can get extremely unnecessary that it needs to be reported, however I will admit the report system is a tad delaying. Other than the minor hiccups such as killer/survivor lobbies being too long or bugs in game, there’s really not a lot of cons (in my perspective that is...). Would I recommend getting this game? Yes, I would highly recommend it. The matches(for me at least) are quick to play and easy to join in. Not to mention you make private games to play Kill your friends or Survive with friends on public matches. I’ve played this game since beta and instantly got hooked to it, I love the unique characters they’ve made especially the mascot of the franchise, The Trapper and the sporty redhead Meg Thomas. The lore of the game has brought my interest and I cannot wait to see what else the developers will bring in the future.","timestamp_created":1543188053,"timestamp_updated":1638298141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46989849","author":{"steamid":"76561198314739859","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1592864790},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlarla oynıyıcağınız çok güzel bir oyun .","timestamp_created":1543188037,"timestamp_updated":1543188037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46989675","author":{"steamid":"76561198158068550","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":15043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3637,"last_played":1638248600},"language":"latam","review":"Interesante e.e","timestamp_created":1543187879,"timestamp_updated":1543187879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46989342","author":{"steamid":"76561198332066949","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":33255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3836,"last_played":1656673842},"language":"polish","review":"Najlepszy horror multiplayer na świecie.

The game maintains a long lasting thrill and has its own sense of originality while yet being so simple that you can't help but wonder why your dumbass didn't think of it. \n\nThe premise is you are a generic survivor, along with three other generic survivors, running for your lives through a dark misty environment repairing generators in the hope to escape while some arbitrary dude hunts you down to beat you senselessly so he can put you on his clothes hanger for his mother to come and eventually take you to the laundromat or something along those lines.\n\nOR\n\nThe premise is you are a generic raging murder psycho whose soul purpose is beat down random passerby, fireman carry them to said clothes hangers and proudly put them on display like a social outcast with a bug collection.\n\nThe game is quite easy to get the hang of for the most part. I found myself routinely survivng within the first few games when I wasn't getting found within ten seconds after the start and being hung on the fisherman's display for what seemed like every fucking time. \n\nObviously, the game isn't without its many little frustrations. As I just mentioned, getting spotted and hung at the start of the match pretty much means that the game is over for you. There's a flashlight item in the game that is supposed to stun the killer but only works about 1% of the time. There's an escape hatch that the last survivor can escape through but, let's face it, you'll never find the thing. It's never fun when you're hung and the killer decides to camp you so that your buds can't come get you down. The only real method of getting away from the killer when being chased is to juke the fuck out of them but, that only works in certain parts of the map and most killers know how to avoid being juked anyway. It's also never fun when the killer is chasing one of your teammates and they run past you so then, the murderous dude decides that they'd much rather have your scrumptious ass for dinner instead so then, you end up being chased.\n\nNone of this is helped due to the lack of in-game voice chat which I found galling. You'd think the developers would be fine with us yelling vile obscenities at each other in an M-rated game about being jump-scared half to death and murdering people.\n\nIf you've played Friday the 13th: The Game and your sick of being killed at the start because you spawned right next to the sodding car/phone box and have to wait fifteen minutes for everyone else to die so you can get your experience, then this game might be a good substitute for you. Dead by Daylight is a lot more fast paced. Also, you can't group up and gang bang the killer with a bunch of baseball bats.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the slasher thriller genre.
