Gezielt möchte ich diese Review an jene richten die sich überlegen dieses Spiel zu kaufen.\n\nIm Grunde geht es darum: Auf einer Map gibt es 4 Überlebende und einen Killer. Ziel der Überlebenden ist es 5 Generatoren zu reparieren und anschließend zu fliehen. Ziel des Killer logischerweise ist es dies zu verhindern und die Survivor mittels Haken ins jenseits zu befördern. Das Spielprinzip ist also recht simpel. Allerdings gibt es einige Tücken.\n Während des reparierens eines Generators, der Heilung eines Teammates und ähnlichem ist für die Survivor von Zeit zu Zeit ein Fähigkeitscheck nötig. Hierzu ertönt ein Geräusch und es bildet sich ein Kreis. Dieser Kreis hat eine Aussparung in der man rechtzeitig die Leertaste drücken muss. Schafft man dies gibts Fortschritt, andernfalls gibt es ein Signal an den Killer, dem dieser natürlich nachgehen wird. Sind also 5 Generatoren repariert geht es Richtung Ausgangstor. Davon gibts immer 2 Stück. Auch diese Tür geöffnet winkt die Freiheit. Sollte man als Survivor der letzte auf der Map sein gibt es auserdem die Fluchtluke als letzten Escape. Die muss man allerdings erst finden und der Killer kann sie auch verschließen wenn er sie vor einem findet.\nDer Killer hat wie bereits erwähnt die Aufgabe die Survivor zu opfern. Dazu hampelt er über die Map, sucht die Leute, schlägt sie zu Boden und hängt sie anschließend an die Haken. Wird ein Suvivor 3 mal an den Haken gehängt wars das für ihn (oder er bleibt solange hängen bis die Opferleiste voll ist). Die Überlebenden werden aber natürlich versuchen ihre Kameraden zu retten.\n\nBevor ich nun zu ein paar persönlichen Sachen komme noch kurz zu den Maps. Es gibt wirklich viele Maps dank DLC´s und Co. Nur leider landet man gefühlt immer auf den selben. Ein Map-Pool mit über 20 Maps und teilweise landet man 10 Runden hintereinander auf der selben. Bisschen Schade muss ich schon sagen. Dafür sehen die Maps teilweise wirklich Klasse aus und es gibt ein paar Echte Hingucker Karten. Gerade die Raccoon City Map finde ich total super (Fans von Resident Evil 2 werden sich hier blendend zurechtfinden). Auch die Wüsten Map finde ich persönlich echt schick.\n\nNun zum Gemecker...Wo ich da allerdings anfangen soll weiß ich nicht so recht. Es gibt soooo viele Dinge an diesem Spiel die mich zum Teil wirklich Ärgern. Sei es nun die Tatsache das man immer und immer wieder die selben 2 Maps spielt, das gewisse Animation einfach unschön und unsauber aussehen oder das Rangsystem weiß einen manchmal doch sehr frustieren kann. Der größte Knackpunkt am Spiel ist aber wohl die Community.\n\nWie in fast jedem Online-Spiel heutzutage ist die Community so dermaßen Toxisch geworden dass selbst Leuten die ein Dickes Fell besitzen zum Teil schon übel werden kann. Sei es nun das man nach der Runde per im Chat als Noob, A***loch oder schlimmeres betitelt wird oder einfach beleidigt wird weil man das Spiel nicht so gut beherrscht wie die werten Damen und Herren es den gerne hätten. Ich gebe zu auch ich bin hier nicht perfekt wie vermutlich alle anderen auch aber zum Teil ist es schon grenzwertig. Das Melde-System ist da wohl eher für den Schlumpf und eine Reaktion von Seiten der Entwickler bekommt man hier sowieso nicht. Auch bei den Killern gibt es hier zum Teil erhebliche Defizite. Die meisten Campen schlicht und ergreifend Überlebende die am Haken hängen ab. Ich persönlich gehe mittlerweile einfach AFK wenn wieder so ein Camper vor meiner baldigen Leiche steht und checke lieber Insta als zuzuschauen wie meine Teammates verzweifelt versuchen mich von Haken zu ziehen und der Killer sich eine Kerbe nach der nächsten in die Machete schnitzt. Auch das Matchmaking ist so eine Sache. Solange ich das Spiel spiele (hab es vorher auf der ps4 gezockt) war das Matchmaking schon immer für die Füße. Profi-Killer gehen Neueinsteiger...Wie man da auch nur auf den Gedanken kommen dass sowas zu einer stabilen Community führt ist mir schleierhaft. \n\nAbschließend noch eine Bitte an alle bestehenden und zukünftigen Spieler: Seit nicht Toxisch, spielt einfach das Spiel wie es sich gehört. Denkt an eure Aufgaben ingame und greift auch mal Leuten unter die Schulter die das Spiel vielleicht noch nicht so gut kennen. Und vor allem an die Killer-Spieler...HÖRT AUF ZU TUNNELN UND ZU CAMPEN! Das sorgt nämlich dafür das man einfach die Lust am Spiel verliert. Wer seinen Spaß daraus beziehen muss ihn anderen Spielern zu nehmen der sollte bei Sims Leute im Pool einmauern.\n","timestamp_created":1654697576,"timestamp_updated":1654976636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.773045361042022705","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116677376","author":{"steamid":"76561198375426638","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1592766617},"language":"turkish","review":"Oynayın

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1654676046,"timestamp_updated":1654676046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513618707656860352","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116666437","author":{"steamid":"76561198860435082","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":57739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1093,"playtime_at_review":51651,"last_played":1660498797},"language":"english","review":"Fun.
