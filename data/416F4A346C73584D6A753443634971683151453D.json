Easy to get into to and has a tutorial to help guide new players.\n2. Addictive gameplay with rounds that generally don't overstay their welcome.\n3. Tense atmosphere lends itself to further enjoyment.\n\nCons:\n1. Can be tricky to find matches as the killer and matchmaking could be better.\n2.

The assymetrical gameplay of Survivors vs Killer is real fun.\nI mainly play killer myself and it comes down to me enjoying trying to spook others.\n\nThe game has it's flaws, but the fun I have overshadow them for the most part.\nMost players are nice but there's a lot of bad eggs in the DbD community, hellbent on making the experience miserable for the opponent rather than fun. This goes for both killer and survivor players.\n\nPersonally I try to adjust my playstyle depending on the survivors. If I notice I keep downing the same survivor with little effort, or even all of them, I will start to just chase for a while and then leave to look for someone else rather than downing them. That way they get the horror movie feeling of being chased by something more powerful but also the feeling they might just get away.\n\nSome survivors play in ways design to infuriate the killer and I can see that the idea is to make sure your team survives, but some like to taunt excessively and such and it just sours the fun. That said, when you finally manage to body that person it feels awesome :D\n\nOverall I'd say the game has more good than bad, there's a rather big library of survivors and killers to pick from now, all their own base perks which can be unlocked so that all survivors/killers can use them. The characters that come with the base game are good enough, the huntress is a lot of fun if you wanna be killer, but I'd recommend reading through the info on the new killers and survivors and pick up their respective dlc pack during a sale. \n\nI rate the game

By Daylight способна затянуть на долгие часы геймплея. Несмотря на всю интересность игры, хотелось бы в большей степени поговорить об отрицательных сторонах, которые сохраняются в этом продукте по крайней мере на данный момент.\n\nПо какой-то причине, играть за маньяка намного тяжелее чем за выжившего. Возможно дело в командной работе четырех выживших, а возможно в недостаточной скорости маньяков, качестве их навыков, но все сводится к тому, что маньяк - это единственный человек, который, играя в игру, действительно отдается полностью геймплею, потеет и нервничает. Получилось так, что маньяк вынужден разгонять выживших, у которых очень немало преимуществ, таким образом игра за убийцу становится сущим кошмаром.\n\nЕще, здесь очень сложно играть в одиночку за выживших. С друзьями игра становится намного легче, ведь каждое действие согласовывается. При игре со случайными игроками, многие забивают на альтруизм и играют для себя, а возможность следить за действиями друг друга минимальна.\n\nЧто в одиночку за выжившего, что за маньяка, разгоняющего выживших, игра очень трудна.\nНа деле, в этом кроется главная отрицательная сторона Dead By Daylight - баланс имеется, но его как бы и нет (в отношении маньяка и выживших).\nЕще есть читеры, неадекватные игроки (благо возможности использовать аудиосвязь в игре нет). В остальном, это игра, пытающаяся быть хоррором, у которой это не получается.

It has some issues that will never be fixed and a very bad and weak anti cheat system. But beside that the game runs well and it's great.\nSecond of all the main reason why this game is so bad are:The developers and it's community.\nThe developers literally deny every bug and issue this game has and they think that it's fine. It's not. With every new DLC new perks arrive and the perks number increase, just like the possibility for more builds. Toxic builds. There are so many toxic and annoying perks in the game, perks that are ruining the fun.\nTalking of which let's talk about the community. Every single soul its toxic af. Every single player and moderator. The chances of stumbling into normal players are beyond any possibility. Every killer relies to facecamp and tunneling if they are weak. Gameplays that are ruining the survivors game. Survivors are using toxic perks which makes the killer either rage quit or running after them untill every gen is done. Gen rushing is a very common thing sadly and you realise it only after you down that toxic player you were running after. I could go on with many other toxic gameplays but I want to mention the 3rd factor that ruins the game :Cheaters.\nSince the anti cheat system is weak, they are in the game swarming every single game and the developers are not even bothering themselfs with them. So we stumble into them. You really can't do nothing against them beside being completely destroyed or just quit but you are banned 5 minutes from playing.\nThe cheats differ from the person running faster, doing gens faster, healing faster. Many hacks can't even be noticed by players. Same goes for killers with the speed and the damage they do to gens when they kick them. \nAnd that's it. If you haven't touched the game yet, then stay away. Far away from it. The chances of staying and playing the game are 50% and even so it will be a love-hate relation.","timestamp_created":1572452446,"timestamp_updated":1643484981,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491264104843139648","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55905960","author":{"steamid":"76561198032776405","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1619031760},"language":"english","review":"A killer first stabbed me, then had a change of heart and carried me to the hatch through which I escaped.

Way too hard to find and track survivors as killer unless you actually find them. If you are unlucky enough to face a team of survivors who communicate, forget being able tio kill them, yet alone hook them and keep them there. No wonder people play as survivors since it gives you a 99% win rate.\nRandomly disconnects from the server so you lose all progress and get no XP.\n\nEdit 1: End of 2020 and queue times are still longer than matches if you play killer.\nLately I've just given up trying to kill the entire survivor team, I just camp the one or two I manage to hook. Devs favour survivors, no question about it. Playing survivor should be a teamwork, if you get ONE good survivor that can clear all generators without failure, killer is done for.

刚买下这个游戏的时候，我是深深被吸引了也破了一些财，在游戏里准备玩好，然后这个游戏流淌进了新血液，现在随着版本的改动，整个游戏内素质环境都乌烟瘴气，玩不起的人太多了，玩不起呢？又想赢 这该怎么办？一些人类玩家就专门钻到你的留言板里来人身攻击，就是有百万种借口不承认自己弱，只对屠夫指指点点，真当自己是回事，\n\n接下来说正事了，首先匹配机制，段位方面老是出错，哎呀，明明有打过的记录，就是不计算段位，段位出错 等你这游戏没发挥好掉段的时候，他就给你掉段，气不气人?还要忍受着玩家之间“友好”的交流，我不是单边玩家，屠夫也好人类也好，我给大家讲解下屠夫吧，排队排一年奖励（血点）一丢丢，只能靠着段位踏过死区，才能来到稍微正常一点环境里，但问题又来了，人类喜欢拔线中赛退出，这会导致你分数不够，甚至掉段，出来后还能骂你，真爽，而我也是在这个游戏里，立下了目标，成为一名护士长，但这次改版把护士削成了白板，我真不知道我玩护士是怎么坚持下来的，里面越是，靠近顶尖的屠夫越容易招来骂声，而越顶尖的屠夫难度就越大，就好比一些能秀的，和实用铁憨憨之间对比，实习护士是真的弱，玩护士的人承受着压力很大，加上人类玩家的谩骂 游戏机制的不公，奖励非常少这种排队排一年，几乎每场都变成了练习局，只要你玩巧了，人类就敢骂你，你坚持下来，你也变强了，那好了，现在好了削弱了Yeah最强屠夫削弱成屎了，人类是亲儿子，屠夫玩家都是npc，竟然都不拿屠夫当人了，人类这边那也有疯狂抱怨的理由，高配守尸打针对还是带处决，有人类高配道具车队强吗？几套道具都砸到脸上了，技能挨个车轮战，“哎呀呀，屠夫打针对 ”毁灭打击 ，钢筋铁骨 ，怀表 自摸4个人一块带哪个不能打车轮战?还有逆天道具呢，逆天道具道具都是爹可惜菜是原罪，技能都不会搭配就出来嘛，就出来断章取义，谁强谁弱?在综合上来说，真的指望4v1，你一个人的平均值顶对方一个玩家?那你队友吃瓜呗，你一个人就是超级英雄，屠夫就是反派，屠夫就不是人活该被欺负，打不过就出来人身攻击，活该被车队碾，然后被迫玩人，唉真是的…凭什么？人类要所有版本都得强势，屠夫不应该受益，加大力度\n","timestamp_created":1572448601,"timestamp_updated":1572448601,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548611104488372803","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55904551","author":{"steamid":"76561198090101777","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":31740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12168,"last_played":1656449447},"language":"english","review":"69","timestamp_created":1572448266,"timestamp_updated":1572448266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55904416","author":{"steamid":"76561198285233778","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22635,"last_played":1657047727},"language":"polish","review":"Fajna
