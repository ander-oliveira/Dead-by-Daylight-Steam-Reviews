The killers all have unique abilities, the survivors all have unique, but powerful, perks. And that's where this game gets ruined: The constant unbalancing of both teams, the lack of developer support for the community that are actually veterans and not level 20s that want everything to be nerfed so that they can win the game. And that ties into MORE problems that I'll get into later.\n\n     The graphics are, well, what you'd expect from this engine. The shadows are soft, the textures are sharp most of the time, and the models have detail and work put into them. The only place the engine and the graphics lack is optimization, in which when you look a certain direction you get huge lag spikes as the engine struggles to render everything in your view as fast as it can. \n      The gameplay and its mechanics are well thought out, but are lacking because of the unbalancing. In theory, this game can never be balanced; the killers are supposed to be stronger than the survivors, and the survivors are supposed to run. But when you give the survivors perks that allow them to cheaply taunt the killer, escape the killer easily and waste their time with cheap tactics, you're in for nothing but trolls. And that's exactly what most of the community is; trolls that use chat programs outside of the game, taunt the killer, use cheap tactics like pallet looping in certain areas some killers can't attack (The survivors tend to go to a pallet and sit there, waiting for you to come to the other side before they simply slide to the other side), and body block the killer, because the developers refuse to listen to the part of the community who actually have good suggestions on how to counter it. The only time I have EVER seen the developers listen to the community is for DLC. Feel free to prove me wrong there, but that's the way I see it. And that gets me into my next point: The neglect from the developers.\n\n     When the game was in beta, it seemed like the developers gracefully took community feedback: improving bugs, nerfing and buffing perks for both the killer and for the survivor when needed. But ever since they got out of beta and released Michael Myers, which is essentially a pay-to-win killer [i]NOT BECAUSE EVERYONE JUST SAYS IT SO THE SURVIVORS CAN WIN[/i], but because of the many buffs he has compared to any of the killers when he reaches level two (Has 1/4 the terror radius, has a very slightly shortened lunge, and REGULAR speed) and level three (1 hits survivors instantly, has an INSANE lunge, has a huge terror radius and increased speed), things have never been the same. It even seems like they stopped trying to make half decent descriptions for non-DLC survivor and killer cosmetics, as they have no punctuation and poor english. [b]Never have never seen a game in my 5 years on steam go from being such an enjoyable game to a competitive faliure like this one[/b], where due to the developers' neglect of the community there is an insanely diverse and douchebag community with scummy tactics, downright cheating with no bans, and an anticheat that [b]Does NOT turn off when you quit the game and tracks your history until you close it[/b].\n\n    Now, you might be asking: am I just being biased as hell? I have tried my best not to be, even though I mostly have played survivor. But I can tell you this: [i]Even if I was the most unbiased person in this whole community, I would still get yelled at by people on either side of the spectrum.[/i] I've been on this community for two and a half years now, and have gained quite a bit recognition for being a great survivor on multiple twitch streams (this game is full of twitch streamers), and I could not care at all what they think. Even if I was the most famous person on this entire game, I would still say that this game is just a shell of its former self. And at this point when this review was made, that's all I can suspect it will ever be as it falls into the abyss of another great game with wasted potential.\n\n  And with that, I bid this game goodbye; for as long as I stand, even if I come back to this game eventually, I will still keep the fact in my mind that this game is not meant to be taken seriously; if they don't take us seriously, there's no point in buying this game anymore. It was already incredibly hard to come to this game as a new player when the halloween chapter came out, and now there is such a steep curve of salt on this community that no one should ever feel welcome here.","timestamp_created":1468271417,"timestamp_updated":1523312117,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505720794200897217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24261788","author":{"steamid":"76561198050282798","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1627602551},"language":"english","review":"After download the update to play online with friends, the game downgradet after buging ingame.

ESTÁS EQUIVOCADO!!!!!.\nÉste juego tiene un fondo de crítica social muuuuy interesante que ahorita relato. Porque los supuestos \"supervivientes\" son en realidad internos (yonkis) del Proyecto Hombre, el asesino es un segurata y el lugar desconocido es el propio centro de internamiento. Lo ves todo tan oscuro porque son recién llegados y están con el mono, la ansiedad, la dilatación anal, en fin, esas cosas que te producen el hecho de no meterte cada hora esas drojas tan divertidas que hacen del mundo un lugar mejor. Pero que mucho mejor.\n\nEl hecho es que tú y tus 3 amigos yonkos, perdón, \"internos\". Acabáis de llegar al centro de Proyecto Hombre y no habéis venido voluntariamente que se diga y claro, os queréis dar el piro del sitio pero YA. Más aún cuando os habéis enterado de que a las 12 hacen una Rave de la HOSTIA en la playa y el Rulas seguro que está ahi. Y si el Rulas está ahí es que se va a liar parda pardísima.\nLa cosa es que el segurata (the killer), no os va a dejar marcharos así por las buenas. Y el muy cabr*n ha cerrado las dos únicas salidas del centro y ha apagao los generadores para que dichas puertas se mantengan cerrás.\nVuestra misión es sencilla. Sólo tenéis que dar al botón de ON de 5 de los generadores (porque hay más) y las puertas se podrán abrir. Lo que pasa es que tras varios años de abusar de metanfetamina os ha dejado bastante jodidos mentalmente (sois retrasaos a más no poder) y no sabéis como darle al botón (suerte de que todavía podéis caminar sin defecaros encima). Por lo que tenéis que poneros a trastear con el generador hasta que, de puro milagro, le deis al ON y pongáis en marcha el generador (uno menos, felicidades adicto hijo de put*).\nSi completáis dicho objetivo podréis abrir las puertas y correr libre por los campos de patatas plantadas por otros internos y seguir endrogándoos a full.\nPero claro!. Ahí anda el segurata, que cobra 250 euros de ♥♥♥♥♥♥ por trabajar 12 horas seguidas (media jornada) y tiene un contrato temporal de 3 meses pero le han dicho que si no se escapa ningún interno se lo renuevan hasta final de año. Y claro, motivación no le falta. \nSi os pilla os dará con una revista porn* enrollada que estaba leyendo (por los artículos de opinión seguramente). Pero como estáis con la ansiedad y depresión fliparéis creyendo que lleva cuchillos, o motosierras. Nada más lejos de la realidad. Si os atiza dos veces caeréis al suelo. Donde os recogerá amorosamente y os llevará a vuestro cuarto (celda). Mientras decide filosóficamente si perseguir al resto de vosotros o (por el contrario) quedarse vigilándoos hasta que os puedan los 76 sedantes que os ha metido en enemas y os durmáis.\nVustros compas podrán rescataros y haceros lavativas ultrarápidas para que sigáis en activo y tener la maquinaria a tope un rato más. Pero claro, eso depende de si son generosos o no, de si les pasasteis el canutillo u os lo fumasteis todo vosotros hasta matarlo.\n\nMu buen juego, te ries, te tensas, gritas y te cagas en todo asustando al gato y a tu novia cuando te pillan o te esquivan.

What's not to like? \n\nWell you can play the survivors too! \n\nI thought I'd hate being a survivor, unable to really fight back against the relentless killer. But it's actually fun when you manage to escape or outwit the killer. It's also a great co-op game that takes on a life of its own when the skill trees of survivors and killers start to develop. \n\nMy only gripe at the moment is the matchmaking, which can see your level 1 killer or level 1 survivor pitted against level 50s. However, even the best survivors have bad days. And in the end if you're the killer and you have a grip on them, they're dead meat!\n\nAt the moment there are only 3 killers, 4 survivors, and 3 arenas to play in. \n\nEach survivor develops different skillsets as the game progresses so each survivor has potential to play differently. \nWant to tear down all of the killer's hooks so he cant hang you? Pick Jake and try sabotaging the hooks. \n\nWant to help your teammates out with speed and teamwork? Pick  Dwight.\n\nWant to be fast and quiet, and be a good distraction while your teammates feverishly try to fix the generators? Pick Meg!\n\nWant to be your team's healer and caretaker when they survive a scrape with the Killer? Pick Claudette!\n\nThe killers also come in three flavors. \n\nThe Trapper is a big, Jason Voorhees type monster that uses bear traps, sheer strength and brutality as well as fear to scare survivors into becoming prey. He's probably my favorite killer to play and definitely the toughest killer to survive. \n\nThe Wraith is a ghostly hunter who actively hunts and roams the area looking for survivors to take down. Wraiths tend to be hard to shake once they get on your trail. \n\nAnd finally the Hillbilly rounds out the cast of killers. He has a chainsaw. That alone makes him awesome. The fact that his chainsaw will allow him to rapidly chase down survivors and take them down in one hit makes run-ins with him even deadlier than the other two killers. The downside is you can hear him coming a mile away (literally) when he revs that thing up.\n\nThe new friends play feature has been added so here's hoping you have plenty of friends to play it with. The low price point of the game helps sell it and honestly it has the quality of a bigger game studio without the EA prices. \n\nRecommended if you can handle the adrenaline rush of fight or flight action and horror.","timestamp_created":1468270168,"timestamp_updated":1468270168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55443340539932251","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24261381","author":{"steamid":"76561198132448650","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1485,"last_played":1596130502},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хороша, но в ней просто до*уя багов.Начиная от застревания в предметах и заканчивая лобби в отором 14 человек.11/10","timestamp_created":1468269879,"timestamp_updated":1468269879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24261346","author":{"steamid":"76561198075060612","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":11172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1720,"last_played":1503059367},"language":"thai","review":"เป็นเกมที่สนุกเกมหนึ่งเลย หากไม่นับเรื่องบัค เกมนี้แนะนำ!!","timestamp_created":1468269744,"timestamp_updated":1468269744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24261306","author":{"steamid":"76561198114612860","num_games_owned":2396,"num_reviews":234,"playtime_forever":2254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1558992964},"language":"german","review":"Jeder soll sich bitte über folgenden Satz selbst eine Meinung vom Spiel bilden: \"Solange die Überlebenden im Kreis um ein Fenster rennen, ist es für den Killer absolut unmöglich, an seine Opfer zu kommen.\"\n\nIst es ein spannendes Spiel? Ja, stellenweise schon. Und ganz selten wird es sogar richtig spannend!\n\nAber ist es ein gutes Spiel, mit sinnvollen Funktionen und Gameplay? Hahahahaha... NEIN!\n\nDas Spiel ist im aktuellen Zustand, so unterhaltsam manche Matches auch sein können, ein Witz. Ein extrem schlechter Witz. Und es wird noch schlimmer (Stand 11.7., siehe unten)!\n\nDie 4 Survivor sind übermächtig. Ja, manche werden sich wundern, aber das sind sie. Solange man selber kaum Fehler macht und man nicht von einem Mitspieler in eine schlechte Situtation gebracht wird (rennt mit dem Killer vor einem her, blockiert Wege, etc.), kann man eigentlich gar nicht verlieren, solange mindestens 2 Überlebende leben. Wenn man als Überlebender gefasst wird und man in einem Team spielt, die sich nicht für die Rettung interessieren, dann ist man immer (außer Fall oben oder wegen \"technische Probleme\") selber Schuld, denn...\n\nRENNT EINFACH ZU EINEM FENSTER! Die Killer können da einen nicht kriegen! (ich empfehle YouTube-Videos von Leuten wie Dhalucard, sieht man hier perfekt). Das Balancing ist ein Witz. Ein richtig mieser Witz. Die Survivor können den Killer verarschen ohne Ende, ohne dass der Killer was dagegen machen kann. Und es wird noch besser:\n\nAls \"Gegenpart\" dazu haben sich die Entwickler wohl gedacht, \"tja dann rauben wir den Überlebenden einfach jegliche Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten\". Funktioniert meiner Meinung nach gut, da man sich so sonst gegenseitig warnen kann. Bämm! Hat sich erledigt. Denn von nun an können Freunde miteinander im Ranked-Modus spielen, sich gegenseitig absprechen, mitteilen wo der Killer ist, wo die Motoren sind, etc. \n\nDer Killer hatte es bisher schwer. Wenn man gegen Überlebende spielen, die wissen was sie zu tun haben (=Fenster!) und die Maps bisschen kennen, war man nahezu chancenlos. Nun kann man es vergessen. Total.\n\nUnd das ist nicht das einzige \"Problem\" was das Spiel hat:\n\n- Die Karten. 4 Orte, je 3 Karten. Hört sich gut an. Problem: Jede sieht gefühlt gleich aus. Okay, auf einer hat man ein Maisfeld, und auf den anderen hat man mal mehr, mal weniger Bäume. Aber vom Gameplay her bleibt es immer das gleiche: Irgendwas dunkles, schlecht texturiertes etwas.\n\n- Lags. Oder Bugs, die vermutlich durch Lags erzeugt werden. Manchmal teleportiert man sich, dann kann man die Überlebenden nicht vom Boden aufheben, dann läuft man mitten in die Arme des Killers, weil der Killer sich von hinten nach vorne teleportiert hat etc...\n\n- Balancing der Killer: Ja, selbst das ist ganz schön misslungen. Auch wenn er kein Sieggarant ist (siehe oben, dagegen ist auch er machtlos), ist der Wraith im Gegensatz zu seinen 2 Buddys weitaus einfacher zu spielen. Man ist getarnt schneller, man kann sich relativ gut an die Survivor anschleichen, etc. Während die anderen beiden Mechaniken haben, die easy gecontert werden können.\n\n- Matchmaking: Finde ich richtig toll, in einer 4x Rank-Level 20 Gruppe gegen einen Rank-Level 5 zu spielen. Oder ich, als Killer, Rank-Level 15 gegen 4 20er, die anscheinend noch nie ein Spiel gemacht haben.\n\nIch könnte noch so weitermachen, hat das Spiel noch wesentlich mehr Fehler (und dabei ist es nicht mal Early Access...)\n\nTl:dr: Im aktuellen technischen (Gameplay-)Zustand absolut keine Kaufempfehlung!

It is definetly fun for both sides and best enjoyed with a full set of friends, but alone online is fun too. \nHere is a +/- list to give you an overview\n\n+++\n- different maps in which the objects are generated at random points\n- \"skill\" trees in which you hunt the most rare and useful perks and offerings\n- Now with party-system\n- different killers and survivors let you choose your playstyle\n- intense gameplay \n- balanced. The devs bring updates even to the smallest balance issues\n\n---\n- Sometimes crashes, although I haven´t experienced it much myself\n- no tutorial and near to 0 videos make it hard to understand for beginners. Especially when trying to figure out how offerings are used and when you should burn them\n- graphics. This isn´t really a negative point but its unreal engine 4 for crying out loud. But still I´m happy with it\n-20$ cost. IMO it is worth but especially if you haven´t played the beta this price might keep you off buying this gem\n- DC´s. Often a survivor isconnects only giving 1250 points for sacrfice and 650 points for quitting. This might be too few to give you the rank up and might leave you frustrated\n\n\nSummary:\nIMHO this game is worth the money. It is not enough for a 40$ game (see verwatch) but definetly worth the 20$. This game doesn´t focus on the graphics but on the balanced gameplay and the sheer fun you can have with friends or alone. And since the game is new I am sure that they will fix a lot of issues and add more killers / survivors and even maps ( They confirmed this if im right).\n\nThis game deserves a 8 / 10 in it´s

This is like the first survival mmorpg out there. The game needs a bit of polishing here and there, there are bugs and game breaking mechanics but overall its still quite solid\n\nSome important issues that needs to be sorted out:\n\nInfinite Juke Spots, they fixed few of them but 7 True Infinite Remains. \n\nWhat is infinite?  Well people can abuse an infinite spot to make it so they can go on a infinite loop so that the killer can't catch them. The ironic thing is that on steam forum quite alot of people actually want infinite to stay in the game. There are even topics \"Infinite Jukes has to Stay\" etc. \n\nThese are:\n\nMacmillan Estate Suffocation Pit\nMacmillan Estate Ironwork of Misery\nMacmillan Estate Coal Tower\nAutohaven Wretched Shop\nAutohaven Bus 50% Infinite\nColdwind Farm Fractual Cowshed\nColdwind Farm Rancid Abattoir\n\nsomeone who is a R1 survivor made all videos to prove they are an Infinite as shown in his channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGuXX_ITGUIls8X7D5-Ia-Q\n\nOther issues:\n\nCheaters - They do get banned by EAC, from time to time you will see ban threads on forum.\n\nM1 Exploit to find traps - fixed\n\nA Rank 20 can be matched against a Rank 1 Killer. Same with Rank 20 Killer gets matched against Rank 1 Survivors.\n\nJoining a game most of the time as Survivor Killers will leave lobbies depends on a player rank, they do this because almost all Rank 1 survivors abuse Infinite spots. \n\nWhen Joining a game sometimes the lobby will glitched out and you have to alt + f4 to restart to fix the game. Not to mention you have to spam Join a lobby non stop which is extremely annoying\n\nKillers can cherry pick his opponents and dodge any lobbies at will with a 5 second cooldown, he can do this as a Rank 1 Killer and get matched against R20 lv1 noobs by doging lobbies for 2 minutes.\n\nBugs and Glitches, like how as a survivor when throwing down a pellet it teleports you next to the killer instead of the other side, unable to be picked up by the killer. Unable to be killed by the Killer on the ground as long as you stand still. Being completely immune to pickup when going in a corner.\n\nOverall despite all critism the game is still quite good and has a very good potential to be a great game.

Dead by Daylight has its ups and downs. On one side you have a fantastic game designed like a playable slasher film that requires skill and teamwork. On the other, you have bugs that cause the game to crash, infinite loading screens (They make Sonic 2006 look good...), falling through the map, killer not being able to kill a survivor (Breaks the game), Unblanced systems with two windows and the surviver being in the middle of them being able to escape the killer easily, sounds coming out of nowhere, BEING STUCK STANDING STILL AND WATCHING YOURSELF DIE WITH NO WAY TO MOVE OR GET OUT WHICH IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING EVER!!!! Overall at the games current state I would not reccomend buying it at 19.99, maybe if the price went down to 9.99 and the bugs were patched it would be decent... But as it is i cant reccomend it to anybody due to it being very broken. Hope this helps!!

Though this downside can be small it can affect your gameplay heavily if your a Killer which leads to the bad stuffs\n\nBad Stuffs:\n\nMatchmaking in DBDL can vary from same levels down to the top tier people, i myself was Rank 19 (Rank 1 is best while Rank 20 is worst) as the Killer and after getting at least 2 kills on 2 different games, i was put against a Rank 1, who 4 high level perks and i only had 1. Not exactly fair if you catch my drift. Even as the survivour if you win too many in a row you will come up with a really high level Killer, and he will kill you without a doubt, high level perks that you have never experinced can do that to you. Enough about that now on the the next bit.\n\nHow to attain Levels and Perks:\n\nSurvivor: Repair generates, escape the monster, explore basement for a long time and rescue people. Easy points easy upgrades, unless of course the hose (Killer) has bad net connection :/\n\nKiller: Kill people....hang em high. Not as easy as it sounds specially with 4 people and only 5 generators.\n\nYou use the blood web which you use your points after each round on, this system is very unique and i like it. Finishing your blood web for your current character earns that character only a level up and a new set of items perks etc you can unlock. Same goes for the Killers.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGame has many positives and only few flaws, those being the terrible matching making. Leveling up system is great, has a good feel to it and looks nice. \n\nThanks for reading this, hopes this helps you decide, i strongly recommend this game with a rating of 8.7/10, and dont forget to play this with your friends. Scare or save the living hell out of them.","timestamp_created":1468250466,"timestamp_updated":1468250466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24254956","author":{"steamid":"76561198297350542","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1419,"last_played":1644061889},"language":"russian","review":"много багов, а так круто","timestamp_created":1468249091,"timestamp_updated":1468249091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501754403114318848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24254935","author":{"steamid":"76561198146171155","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5666,"last_played":1482691419},"language":"russian","review":"игра сырая,очень много багов,лучше пока не покупать пожалейте 500 рублей,частые крэши за которые отнимают по три капли,хотя это вина разработчиков,вывод удаляю игру","timestamp_created":1468249033,"timestamp_updated":1469632213,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24254803","author":{"steamid":"76561198008882969","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1633716997},"language":"russian","review":"Плюсы: \n- Хорошая задумка: 4 выживших спасаются от маньяка, \n- Интересный локации и персонажи.\n\nМинусы:\n- Долгий поиск лобби, либо \"выброс\" из лобби.\n- Долгая загрузка игры.\n\nВердикт: 7 из 10.","timestamp_created":1468248605,"timestamp_updated":1468248605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24254755","author":{"steamid":"76561198169153750","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":32226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27252,"last_played":1651524168},"language":"english","review":"yes kappa","timestamp_created":1468248456,"timestamp_updated":1509792510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499855130910873413","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24254751","author":{"steamid":"76561198029866106","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":17008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1507411252},"language":"german","review":"Manchmal, nach einer Partie, muss ich erstmal auf die Toilette, weil meine Blase den Druck nicht mehr mitmacht, weil ich immer so unter Spannung stehe, wenn mein virtuelles Herz pocht.

Dead by Daylight has a lot of potential, but there are a lot of problems in the game that really turns me off from playing it at all.\n\n-THE GAME NEEDS SERVERS... peer to peer connections are problematic considering it depends solely on the lobby creator, and considering that Queing and Matchmaking are also problems in this game your basically already dead when sent into a mismatch with a killer who is half-way around the world.\n\n-Killer-Survivor balancing... Killers already have increased movement speed and skills to hunt down survivors, but all the games I've played the killer camps the hooked survivor making it impossible to rescue someone. People will say \"then just fix the generators\"... people who say this are fuckers who don't know teamwork. There needs to be something added to the game to make the killer keep moving or an extreme buff to survivor if the killer camps, the moment your hooked, your as good as dead, Its frustrating because It makes waiting to get into a lobby and starting a game is longer than playing the game itself.\n\n-Leavers... If the killer leaves the game, it should be an instant win to the survivors. Thats why I say Peer to Peer type games are problematic because if the Killer (host) leaves when Survivors are about to win, the game is considered NULL/VOID... Survivors are the ones who are affected most when there are leavers... If a Survivor leaves... now you have to fix 5 Generators instead of just 4...

I think its time to explain why I like this game so much.\n\nDead by Daylight is an asimetrical multiplayer game, where 4 \"victims\" need to hide from 1 \"killer\". The \"victims\" must activate a set of generators scattered through the map (randomly generated, btw) to open a set of doors and be able to escape and the \"killer\" must track down, hunt and get the \"victims\" to sacrifice them before they manage to flee.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is amazing. Takes the bases of classic Slasher movies (the killer vs defenseless people, the meathooks, etc.) and puts them in a Lovecraft-like scenario (the fog, the pagan entity, etc.). The character's look, the map's lighting, the soundtrack, all of those thing are composed masterfully and perform a key role in both gameplay and immersion.\n\nAre the gameplay mechanics perfect? No, probably not. Some people complain about the ranking system, some potentially \"cheesable\" techniques as window vaulting or the inability (for the moment) of playing with friends in ranked matches. Personaly I think that the beuty of this game is that it relies upon the inability of the survivors to communicate effectively through the game, creating a constant state of uncertainty. After all, sometimes is better to leave a teammate to die if that implies more time to advance the game objectives... You never know what the other survivors are going to do and if you should be doing something else, being a weird tense \"single player\" experience in a multiplayer enviroment.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game is just a hide and seek reskin. As the victim you'll need to be stealthy, control your stress at all time and be constantly vigilant. As the killer you'll have to work against the clock, thinking ahead of your preys and manipulating them through their fears and objectives.\n\nThe thrill of the hunt as its finest. The adrenaline, the fear and the euphoria of a last minute catch or escape still fill my mind after 50 hours playing!","timestamp_created":1468230810,"timestamp_updated":1468230810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544527590274810791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24250250","author":{"steamid":"76561198095226025","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1534164401},"language":"turkish","review":"Dead by Daylight , şimdi şöyle oyuna ilk girişte bazı pozisyonlar korkutabilir sizi sonrasında gülerek oynayacaksınız onda bir sorun yok rahat olun :D\n\n-Rep olarak söyleyebileceklerim optimizasyon hataları var atlıyorsunuz adamda geç atlıyor vuruyor size vb vb. birde killer olursanız lobi doldurması zor e şimdi onuda nasıl halletsin adamlar herkes katil olmuyor oyunda :D \n(Bu arada bendede 10 lw killer var lobi açıp muzik dinleyince koymuyor beklemek :D )\n\nSon olarak size perk harici verdiği şeyler tek kullanımlık itemler olabiliyor dikkatli araştırırak koyun onları loadoutunuza \n\niyi oyunlar !","timestamp_created":1468230666,"timestamp_updated":1468230666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8cDX7NUCevjAXA=="}
