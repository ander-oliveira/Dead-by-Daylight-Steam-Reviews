But I have watched hundreds of hours of gameplay from both survivors and killers, and I want to share the insight I've gathered so far, as well as somewhat review this game.\n\n[h1]Killers[/h1]\nSome of the killers are much stronger than others, and though there are items/skills that can improve each killer, there is still a gap in capabilities for many killers. That is something that should be looked into by the devs, but at this point, balancing the game is practically impossible. Part of the reason is that players need to play each killer differently, and many of them don't. So, often, there will be a lot of voices clamoring over how weak a certain killer is. That killer could, indeed, be weaker, like the Trapper is often considered, or that killer could be great in the hands of a skilled player otherwise they feel really weak, like the Nurse. The issue is that people need to accept the strengths and weaknesses of the killers, and learn to play around them.\n\nStill, there's still balance to be had. There are some items (for instance, Frank's Mixtape for Legion) that make some killers far too strong. Those items should, and likely will be fixed. People who play killers using those items will still happen, because some people are just afraid of challenge. The devs should be more on top of things like that, but so far haven't been, and that's a ding against them.\n\n[h1]Survivors[/h1]\nPlaying survivor can be hard, especially if you don't know what it's like to be the killer. I'd suggest for everyone to play both sides to get a feel for what to expect. There are a lot of people out there who complain about things like scratchmarks and sounds giving them away, but those people are bad at the game. This isn't to say that they can't/won't improve, but it is to say that a lot of people complain before they get better, and then they leave their complaints up, which makes it seem like killers are always so powerful.\n\nBeing a survivor takes skill, most of the time. You have to learn how each killers plays, you have to learn what your survivor's weaknesses and strengths are (and play to them), and you have to learn how to escape from killers. Just running away, throwing down pallets, and jumping through windows isn't enough.\n\nI have seen many, many games where all the survivors escaped, and they weren't even in voice chat with each other. That brings me to one benefit the survivors can have that the killers don't, voice chat. If you're having problems playing solo and surviving, you can play with your friends and use something like discord to work together against the killer. That, alone, can break a lot of the abilities/skills that some killers use. For instance, if you're lying on the ground after the killer downed you (\"slugged\"), and the killer has a perk to make it so other survivors can't see where you are, you can simply tell your friends where you are.\n\nA final note, expect to sometimes get focused on by killers. Some people aren't very good at this game yet, and the only way they know how to kill survivors is to tunnel (vision) one survivor and camp them on the hook. If that happens to you, let it be. Once you're dead, you can move on to another game.\n\n[h1]The Community[/h1]\nAnd so, we come to the crux of the issue, the community. There are a lot of toxic players out there. Survivors will taunt you when you are the killer. Killers will tunnel and facecamp you when you're a survivor. If other people bother you when they are being jerks, then you should avoid this game. If, on the other hand, you want to get good enough to punish toxic players and rub the salt in their face afterwards, then play this game, get good at it, and dominate the trolls (who typically aren't that good). Of course, if you are a toxic person, you could also get this game, wind up not being good at it, complain on the forums about players who are better than you, teabag/taunt killers who aren't that good yet, and disconnect when a killer dominates you. You make the choice ;)\n\n[h1]New Players[/h1]\nThat brings me to new players, as I'm about to be one myself. I've only played a few hours against friends way back when the game was in beta, but as I said, I've watched hundreds of hours of gameplay.\n\nKeep multiple things in mind when you're starting off. You are bad at this game, and you're going to lose a lot. Some people will even go so far as to make fun of you. But stick with it. Watch videos and read guides on how to be a better killer/survivor. Play around with the different characters but settle on one that you want to get really good at, and learn the game with them. Don't let a few dingbats ruin your experience. Say \"GG\" after each game, or comment on how scary/good their build was, and move on if people are being toxic. Learn from the players who are better than you. If you're up against a killer who you can't escape from, look at how they are playing, and after the round, check out what skills/items they were using. Do the same with survivors that you just can't catch, or even survivors that performed better than you did.\n\nJust remember, it's okay to start off being bad, but if you don't try to improve, why are you even wasting your time?\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nThe game is good, but beware of toxic players. Learn to play before getting frustrated, because you won't start out winning much, if at all. There's a difficulty curve, but once you've got it down, the real fun begins.","timestamp_created":1548435648,"timestamp_updated":1548435648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48546631","author":{"steamid":"76561198104337887","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":52503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":4848,"last_played":1660584038},"language":"tchinese","review":"I need 240hz button in the game","timestamp_created":1548435419,"timestamp_updated":1636521698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48546529","author":{"steamid":"76561198160307355","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":63106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19356,"last_played":1653232709},"language":"english","review":"\"Pretty good job so far.\"\n\nEin an sich einzigartiges Spielprinzip, gepaart mit dem fast unendlichen Potential der Horrorwelt und der Motivation eines, größenteils in einem Ranked-Modus stattfindende,  Multiplayer-Spiels haben mich dazu gebracht mittlerweile vor einer etwas längeren Zeit in diesem Spiel zu versinken. \n\nKein Multiplayer Game, außer MMos, hat es geschafft mich so lange bei sich halten zu können. \nSo viele coole Killer und Survivor will man einfach perfektionieren, gerade wenn man ein Fan von z.B. der dazugehörigen Filmreihe ist, um sie so gut wie möglich ausspielen zu können.

Даже если вы запустили четыре гениратора без потерь, пятый будет для вас испытанием, так как разработчики решили что будет честно поставить  оставшиеся генераторы в радиусе 20-30 метров друг от друга, что для убицы пройти этот промежуток составит около 5-8 сек. это делает игру дисбалансной. Так же убицы слишком имбовые при силовых ударах они не замедляются и несутся быстрее вас, так что убежать от них практически нет шансов.
