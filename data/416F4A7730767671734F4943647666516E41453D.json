Although like every game it has some negative aspects but nothing that ruins the game. There are some instances that will make you really mad but nothing that wont blow over in a minute or two. I play primarily as a survivor and i love it. Running from the killer or working on a generator as the killer is slowly encroaching on your position is the best feeling in this game next to escaping with him right on your ass. The skill checks might be annoying at first but after a couple hours it wont be hard at all. Playing as the killer is easy and loads of fun. Playing as a survivor is much harder than playing as the killer although both sides are easy to learn, yet hard to master. In the end Dead by Daylight is a very fun game with decent graphics and easy controls that holds hours and hours of fun, grab a couple friends and look out.","timestamp_created":1522199554,"timestamp_updated":1522199554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41096105","author":{"steamid":"76561198120013730","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":206849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46971,"last_played":1656335551},"language":"japanese","review":"ソロで野良マッチする時の無言で２つの基本ジェスチャーとなどで意思の疎通を図ったりする所がとてもおもしろいです。","timestamp_created":1522191570,"timestamp_updated":1522191570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50602114200592041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41095667","author":{"steamid":"76561198274260889","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":99239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":295,"playtime_at_review":79958,"last_played":1660604376},"language":"english","review":"dogsh!t","timestamp_created":1522189821,"timestamp_updated":1627713230,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41095569","author":{"steamid":"76561197989960039","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17514,"last_played":1624727230},"language":"english","review":"This used to be my favorite game , specially playing killer was fun!\nNow the game favores survivors so much i stoped playing , from gen rushing to barely any sounds for killer this game is dying and the developers could't care less!","timestamp_created":1522189462,"timestamp_updated":1522189462,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41094262","author":{"steamid":"76561198157350543","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":88730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59393,"last_played":1655063448},"language":"english","review":"Fucking cancer game.

The reason I don't recommend this game to new people it's because the updates have been really boring so far, it gets old after a while and solo it's really not fun at all; It's grindy, the community is toxic, Killers and Survivors will prioritize scummy behaviour and winning over fun for everybody and the game it's really not even close to be balanced. However, if you plan to play this game with friends or really love this type of asymmetrical horror games, I think the game it's pretty damn fun and has a lot of potential and the playing with friends makes the game feel less repetitive, at the latest after you took a break from it. The grinding process also feels rewarding, once you get those items and perks you feel stronger and the learning curve it's pretty good. It rarely gets frustrating if you play with friends (can be super frustrating on solo, regarding of your attitude) and you always feel like you're getting better and the more skilled you are the more rewarded you get by the game (for the most part).\nSo TL;DR \nThe game has a lot of downsides, but also as many upsides.

However, a lot of what I hate about the game does come down to some of the tactics the players use. So I won’t be counting those. For those who might not of played the game, it’s a game where one player is a killer and the other four are survivors and need to escape. Each killer and survivor can be customised with a variety of cosmetics, perks and equipment. I will say right now, this won’t be a full, comprehensive review but I will write one out and exchange the current review for the more extensive one. For the moment, I’ll use some points to address and list the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPro One: Survivor and Killer variety and customisation. There is no denying that there is a lot of variety when it comes to the killers and the survivors and although, a great deal of it could simply be said to be cosmetic and models. The perks and load outs add to the variety and can alter the playstyle of each survivor and killer. \n\nCon One: Sabotage is Useless. Okay, so this is possibly my biggest issue with the game at the moment among a lot of newer issues. As I did take a long break from the game and only recently got back into it. When I first played the game, roughly during the first months of it’s release and maybe a little longer. I played mostly Jake Park, the reason I enjoyed playing Jake was because of one of Jake’s unique perks. Saboteur. Saboteur allowed Jake to sabotage hooks, traps and the like without the need of a toolbox. A very useful ability that has been utterly rendered useless. Before, if you had a good Jake on the team. You were fairly safe from the hooks. As Jake could go around and sabotage them, rendering them useless to the killer and giving the survivors more of an advantage. The issue, is that now hooks regenerate pretty damn quickly. I’ve heard that apparently they regenerate after three minutes. But it feels much shorter, and it renders the sabotage ability absolutely useless. \n\nPro Two: Design of the Killers. Aside from the licensed killers, all killers in Dead by Daylight are pretty well designed. They each look unique and play in varying different ways. The Nurse can levitate and blink making her highly mobile, the Huntress can throw hatchets giving her a rang advantage, the Wraith can turn invisible, the Trapper can set traps to snare unsuspecting survivors. From the design of the models to the way each of the killers play with their unique ability. The game certainly keeps it interesting and always guessing.\n\nCon Two: Speed differences: Now, due to the fact I have been away from the game for a long time. I may be wrong on this one and if I am, please say so. The issue with the speed, and I don’t mean the chase speed although, there have been instances where the Killers have been SO MUCH faster than they probably should of been. I can put that down to certain perks within the game. What I cannot really grasp, are the other times. Repair for generators has always been long and I don’t mind that. But the wiggle, I timed this several time and the wiggle can take anywhere between fifteen to twenty seconds. That might not seem like a long time, but refer back to Con number one. Sabotage is useless. The whole point of Sabotage was to remove hooks and make it more difficult for the killer to begin the sacrifice. Now, without a proper way to remove surface hooks those fifteen to twenty seconds essentially mean, you are guaranteed to be hooked and will require your team mates to rescue you.This also means that the hooks in the basement, the four hooks that can never be sabotaged are basically only used when the survivor goes down close enough to them.\n\nLike I said, this is by no means a comprehensive review and I will be writing one during my free time and, while I do really enjoy this game. I cannot deny that it is frustrating and I cannot avoid the conclusion that. While the game originally favoured the killers only moderately, it also gave the survivors the skills and tools to be able to survive. Was it always fair? No, not at all, however, now the game is punishingly unfair. The uselessness of sabotage and the massive fifteen to twenty seconds needed to wiggle out of the killers grasp. Mean that you are going to get frustrated at the game. I do like the game, I would encourage people to play it so long as they can put up with it’s flaws. HOWEVER, I cannot recommend the game in it’s current state considering how leaning it is to the killers and not more in the middle or, only leaning slightly to the killers.","timestamp_created":1522161967,"timestamp_updated":1522161967,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488230139017105103","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41086529","author":{"steamid":"76561198169241075","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1522252506},"language":"russian","review":"Дбд эта та игра,когда тебя выкидывает из лобби с другом.Очень весёлая и развлекательная,и затягивает на несколько сотен часов.Моя оценка 9.5 всё таки вылеты не приятны.\n","timestamp_created":1522161957,"timestamp_updated":1522161957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41085888","author":{"steamid":"76561198310036829","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":65834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15363,"last_played":1656436481},"language":"koreana","review":"심심할때가끔하기 좋음","timestamp_created":1522160379,"timestamp_updated":1522160379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41085570","author":{"steamid":"76561198348348511","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":41399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23665,"last_played":1556523893},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever.

It's definitely not perfect, but it's doing okay for the size of the developer's company. This game has gotten more popular than it can handle, I believe. People want fixes, and it's just not going to happen as quickly as we'd like. Some patches make the game worse, some improve it.

Imagine my surprise the other day when I overheard my second oldest boy talking about a video game he had played at a friend’s house. As soon as I heard the name “Dead By Daylight”, my suspicions grew and I immediately found myself wondering which body part the game might be referring to.\n\nI rushed to the computer that I keep locked away from my impressionable children, and what I found was truly disturbing. Just 10 minutes of Bing research produced so much evidence that this game was a homosexual recruitment tool that I have now forbidden it. You better believe that I called the other father and gave him a good talking to. As a devout Christian, he agreed with me and has now burned his Dead By Daylight DVD on his barbeque grill to make sure this threat to his family is gone for good.\n\nHere are some of the things I have learned: This game is made by BHVR incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of NAMBLA – the people who invented child molestation. Just the name “BHVR” produces images in the mind of a Christian man that should not be there.\n\nGame play takes place in a forest, where children are encouraged to use their mechanical skills to fix generators to create glory holes. In case you haven’t heard of this filth, “glory holes” are all the rage in gay circles, where sweating homosexuals drill holes into walls and then perform sex through them, without having to show their guilt ridden faces. There is one thing a homosexual hates, and that is for their shame to be seen in the light of day. That is why their bars and bath houses are kept so dark at all times. And believe me friend, this game is dark and shadowy.\n\nGlory hole in the game.\n\nGlory hole in homo-gay forest. Hard to tell the difference, right?\n\nThere are four adorable survivors and one killer. Who doesn’t love this? Kids sure do. Well, these 2 survivors are a homosexual couple. The Jake one is the dominate bear and the Dwight one is the swishing bottom. Even the voices are clearly transexual which is a dead give away. I shudder to think of what life style choices a little child will think is decent after pretending to be one of these two gays. Instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they have glowing orange sparkly lights in their sex area.\n\nAs if that was not enough, there are mechanical testicles and gay saunas around every corner. Not enough? Well this game introduces “Sprint Burst” which help the innocent children slide through a glowing red sphincter.\n\nI could go on, but my stomach is turning at this latest homo-gay invention. There is nothing christ-centered in this game. Protect your children from this latest assault from the gay agenda.","timestamp_created":1522116061,"timestamp_updated":1537318598,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.431203395128250122","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41074412","author":{"steamid":"76561198263796726","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":42895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23679,"last_played":1657078017},"language":"brazilian","review":".","timestamp_created":1522115964,"timestamp_updated":1622314212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41073821","author":{"steamid":"76561198017848479","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":204662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1351,"playtime_at_review":33419,"last_played":1660522379},"language":"russian","review":"Разрабы, пофиксите этих сраных сурвов!
