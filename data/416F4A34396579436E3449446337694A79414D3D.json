Now that I've had an opportunity to try the official release, I can best describe it as: five steps forward, ten steps back.  Full disclosure, I almost exclusively play survivor.\n\n[b]Some good...[/b]\n\nReading the notes prior to the update I was excited.  BHVR does seem to care about taking an objective view of the meta.  Their usage of objective data to nerf the top picked perks—or rework them in to the base kit so as to no longer necessitate their usage, like Borrowed Time—was and still is an awesome idea I wish more devs would pick up on.\n\nThe changes to perks like Lightweight, Hope, No One Left Behind, (to name a few) increases the viable perk options.  Taking old content and breathing new life into it while shaking up the meta like this is smart.\n\nDecreasing the time it takes to trigger the two upper tiers of bloodlust is sensible, the change does not impact the majority of chases, only those where a survivor thoroughly utilizes loops.\n\n\"Conspicuous Actions\" and the accompanying change to how endurance functions removes certain buffs when the chase is over, and the player no longer needs them.\n\nRemoving the bloodpoint multipliers from many perks nullifies overall player progression as a factor in play style.  Now perks are only relevant for what they give you [i]in[/i] matches, not outside of them.\n\nBoth changes to Ruin are nice.  The perk use to be a win condition if the totem was placed well and the killer was competent.  Negating the perk once one survivor dies allows the other three a chance to actually win in that case.\n\nThe changes to progression/prestige, and the addition of matchmaking incentives help keep the meta-game healthy.\n\n[b]...but mostly bad[/b]\n\nIron Will may as well not exist.  Some survivors are [i]much[/i] louder than others (running Jeff or Bill is a handicap), and I [i]do[/i] notice that I can't break chases any more unless the killer decides to quit.  Keep the exhausted part of the nerf, just drop the 25% noise nerf.\n\nIncreasing the time it takes to repair gens, and increasing gen progress loss, and increasing gen kick speed, and buffing Eruption/Jolt all in the same patch is a recipe for over-correction.  Yes, it used to be too easy to gen rush, and at least a quarter of my pre-6.1.0 games I'd escape without being chased once.  Now, they have veered too far in the other direction.  The most demoralizing thing in the world is seeing how easily your progress on a gen evaporates, especially when there are so many perks in the game that block gens or kill progress.\n\nWas survivor speed boost when hit really an issue?  Why does Calm Spirit need to come with a speed debuff now?\n\nI've yet to win a single game against a Thanatophobia Legion.  That combo is a 4k, decided before the game even starts.  Generator nerfs with that killer and perk is gg.\n\nPrior to this patch I escaped at least half, probably over 60% of my matches.  Now it's much closer to half that.  Nobody wants to leave their gens to go get people off the hook cause they take so long to do, and progress means nothing until it's 100%.  Gens are so insurmountable now it isn't fun.  It's so bad that killer mains are complaining about queue times.","timestamp_created":1658942517,"timestamp_updated":1659145918,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548156976699829102","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119587900","author":{"steamid":"76561198215611515","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":11500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11277,"last_played":1659098895},"language":"english","review":"Seems like a good idea.

Я играю за киллеров и за выживших.\n\nDead by Daylight — яркий пример того, как игрок (я) проходит 5 стадий принятия неизбежного.\n\n[b]Отрицание[/b] — ты не можешь понять, почему убийца фейскемпит на 5 генераторах, почему он тебя туннелит, почему в игре есть баги, которые мешают играть и почему ты просто плохо играешь. Почему есть тиммейты, которые спокойно сидят чинят генераторы, пока ты висишь. Вы поняли суть.\n\n[b]Гнев[/b] — ты знатно бомбишь на эту игру, на киллера, на тиммейтов, на себя. Проклинаешь тот день, когда скачал дбд.\n\n[b]Торг[/b] — с опытом ты начинаешь понимать, как работает игра и какие у неё правила. И вроде бы ты уже можешь оправдать и понять действия киллера и твоих тиммейтов и то, как работает игра. Ты на перепутье: с одной стороны опыта и понимания становиться больше, но ты все равно можешь бомбить.\n\n[b]Депрессия[/b] — в очередной раз, когда токсики тебя загенрашили и поприседали в воротах или закемпили и затуннелили ты уже не бомбишь. Ты просто удаляешь игру и забываешь о ней на время. Игра тебя истощила и надо восстановиться. Ты играешь в сингл-плеер игры, в инди или платформеры и со временем тебе становиться лучше.\n\n[b]Принятие[/b] — и вот спустя время ты решил вернуться в дбд. Игра за киллера теперь приносит удовольствие, особенно после нерфа ореха, гы. Загенрашили? Ну и ладно, будет следующая игра. Приседают так, будто сдают нормативы в школе? Пофигу. И я скажу вам, что это офигенное чувство, когда ты не злишься из-за поражения. Что касается игры за сурвов, то тут то же самое, хотя и геймплей поскучнее, чем за киллеров. Просто нет смысла жаловаться на рандомов, потому что они играют не так, как хотели бы вы или не так хорошо. Собираешь пати и играете в дискорде.\n\nВ общем и целом, игра мне нравится. Рад, что разработчики продолжают её развивать. А коллаба с Атакой Титанов — просто сас.\n\nЯ описал свой путь становления в этой игре. Если вы готовы пройти его, то я рекомендую вам Dead by Daylight.","timestamp_created":1658912179,"timestamp_updated":1658912179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566567182540893555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119564715","author":{"steamid":"76561199316844538","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":98,"playtime_at_review":4680,"last_played":1660351072},"language":"french","review":"trash","timestamp_created":1658911391,"timestamp_updated":1658911391,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119564706","author":{"steamid":"76561198834752926","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1966,"last_played":1658995130},"language":"english","review":"this game is the best, i wish i could get my progress from PS4 to here :,) well, more grinding for me i guess","timestamp_created":1658911376,"timestamp_updated":1658911376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476588636636734009","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119564516","author":{"steamid":"76561199236282753","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1408,"playtime_at_review":3011,"last_played":1660563150},"language":"schinese","review":"","timestamp_created":1658911063,"timestamp_updated":1658911063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119564303","author":{"steamid":"76561198821499637","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":17547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4336,"playtime_at_review":11711,"last_played":1660600412},"language":"english","review":"После недавнего обновления большая часть мусора из комьюнити игры яростно вынесла себя сама, ну или попыталась сделать вид.

Vor dem Update war es schon schwer als Solo Survivor überleben. Das Balancing quasi nicht vorhanden. Ich habe große Hoffnung auf das Update gehabt. Aber leider wurde es statt besser noch schlimmer. Die Killer wurden gestärkt und die Möglichkeit zu entkommen liegen bei ca. 20%. Und dann meist auch nur, weil der Killer eine absolute Niete ist und meist nicht mehr richtig spielt. Sobald die ersten Minuten nicht richtig laufen verlassen die Mates die Runde oder lassen sich sterben. Und ich bin ehrlich, ich kann es verstehen. Es wird gecampt, gesluggt und getunnelt wie lange nicht mehr. Die Killer sind gefühlt immer dieselben. Einige Runden sind pure Zeitverschwendung, da diese 20-30 Minuten  dank der Perkänderungen dauern. \nSelbst große Streamer wenden sich so langsam von diesem Spiel ab.
