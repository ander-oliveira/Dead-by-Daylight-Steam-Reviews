If he's tunneling/chasing you when you're in insanity level 3 (Which he easily puts you in as the shock goes through every object/wall), you have little chance of escaping him and snaping out of it without screaming, thus giving you away all over again. Not being able to pallet slam or interact with anything in insanity 3 is rage inducing.\n  \n- The Hag plants too many traps. Annoying for late game with few generators. Especially when they are close together.\n\n- Freddy doesn't work for this game.  \nHe's has too much of an advantage and it's not fun playing against him.\n\n1.) Totally invisible unlike wraith's translucent blob so you can't even tell if he sees you without wasting a perk slot.  \n\n2.) The children humming (terror radius sound) isn't directional so you don't have a sense of where he is or if he can see you. Looking at blades of grass to track his movement isn't reliable because most maps are barely grassy. (Mostly patchy grass here and there among mostly flat ground.)\n\n3.) His putting people to sleep gimick is terrible. He can always see you in dreamland. You have to stay in his terror radius meaning you can't reasonably wake yourself up blowing generators or having someone snap you awake, or self heal without him hearing it. Everything in dreamworld is slower so relying on skill checks isn't happening. He'll easily hear you if you're injured so that makes things even more impossible. If you somehow get woken up, he'll just quickly pull you back to sleep.\n\n- Finding games where killers camp hooked survivours are common.\n\nPerks/Offerings:\n- Hex Ruin is too common and shouldn't apply to all survivors. If you play this game on a wireless network, it's bad enough missing regular skill checks can be frequent. \n\nOther:\n- Hugely annoying: Bad lobby system. \n    The amount of time wasted manually inviting people and telling people to accept their damn invite adds up a lot (Additional time telling people who aren't afk to ready up).  \nDev's need to add an option for people in the post game lobby to to back-out with friends (to a new lobby).  \n\n\n~ Trap door is nearly impossible to hear even with headphones on. (Ambient audio is over-powering).\n~ Generators often spawn in bad locations (often 3 too close together. Unless you're playing with 3 other friends this can get you screwed over late game).\n\nNot a bad game but there's a lot of inconvenient things add up.\nHiding from killers, and being chased/escaping killers is fun but a fair ammount of killers ruin one or both those things (Doctor & Freddy, enemies with too long a range for melee attacks.)","timestamp_created":1508111285,"timestamp_updated":1529599426,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510822534561157227","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35760209","author":{"steamid":"76561198150711341","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1325,"last_played":1657887284},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1508107669,"timestamp_updated":1508107669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35759986","author":{"steamid":"76561198389454163","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":64955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":5534,"last_played":1659904286},"language":"english","review":"ok so to start off this fuck u dead by daylight devs yall banned me for a day and is  harsh wtf. how about u fix this fucking game scums","timestamp_created":1508106709,"timestamp_updated":1508106709,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35759858","author":{"steamid":"76561198392014060","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":131826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":575,"playtime_at_review":5945,"last_played":1660536387},"language":"spanish","review":"Un aplauso a los desarrolladores, un juego barato, entretenido y sobre todo bien realizado, no hay Bugs y la jugabilidad es excitante, más asesinos y supervivientes estaría bien, para evitar la monotonía","timestamp_created":1508106164,"timestamp_updated":1508106164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35759701","author":{"steamid":"76561198418694301","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":68046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":144,"playtime_at_review":15277,"last_played":1660501190},"language":"english","review":"its ight","timestamp_created":1508105529,"timestamp_updated":1588047173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35759185","author":{"steamid":"76561198065077447","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1530058732},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco che va tutto a favore del killer ho tante ore di gioco su ps4 ma dopo l'uscita di myers e leatherface questo gioco è diventato ingiocabile... sti perk trasferibili del cazzo per il killer non dovrebbero esistere a partire da barbeque e chili che come appendono una persona vedono per 4 secondi la posizione di tutti i sopravvissuti (anche se a me sembra che beccano solo me ma vabbè) finchè non ci saranno aggiornamenti che danno la possibilità di vincere al survivor questo gioco non lo rinstallerò neanche morto sconsigliatissimo se siete cristiani se siete atei ve lo consiglio per lanciare qualche bel bestemmione","timestamp_created":1508103694,"timestamp_updated":1508103694,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4797687828540802","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35758947","author":{"steamid":"76561198311262100","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1194,"last_played":1658577468},"language":"german","review":"Bby sagt das spiel ist tuhl also ist es das auch :)","timestamp_created":1508102875,"timestamp_updated":1508102875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35758837","author":{"steamid":"76561198050344070","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":1144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1129,"last_played":1509149600},"language":"english","review":"Good game, though sometimes a bit unfair/unbalanced when it comes to killers [spoiler](The Shape)[/spoiler].

It's great but it has it's flaws, sometimes it can be going down to 8/10 or even 7/10 raiting for you.  The game is a fresh breath of air with it's unique gameplay experience whitch can only be found in another game called \"Friday the 13 th the game\" (as far as i know), just this game is more creative, both of these games are basically an enhanced hide n seek experience. I personally get bored or sick of shooters quite fast and when I play this game you can relax from the intenseness of shooters. The biggest flaws of this game might be the community and the lobbyed connection.  About the community I don't really mind the big russian community in this game as it is not as toxic as in other games like cs go for example, the biggest community toxicity comes from abusive tactics, bad teaming and the dlc content. Abusive tactics mostly come in play as body blocking (where you block a killer or a survivor from completing the task, or walking through a narrow path), advanced jucking (basically a jucking tacktics where you do a move infront of the killer that messes them up) and camping (usually seen in killers when they stay really near a hook so the survivors couldn't save there friend). Bad teaming mostly comes in a form of overcaring teammates (people who play with friends, trying to keep each other alive and rarely fixing any generators) and the teammates that rarely help at all (usually when you get hooked you will see them fixing generators or doing other things while you are dying on the hook). The lobbyed connection (a killer creats a lobby and the survivors join him) is a flaw mostly bassed on ping, when a killer has a high ping you won't have a good time, there will be a lot of rubber banding, killer might hit you when he shouldn't have and so on. The high ping mostly goes to the killers advantage. There are a lot of dlc content which isn't that much pay to win but you can buy some extreamly op killers for dlc money which is a bit pay to win for exaple michael myers, with his op ability. But if everything goes as it should (which happens surprisingly often compared to other games) you are in for a treat, a extreamly good game. I would recomend you to play with freinds if you want to survive, and if you play solo go for the killer becouse you could run into some bad teammates. To sum it all up this game is really good and i would extremely recomend you to check it out.","timestamp_created":1508094199,"timestamp_updated":1508094199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35755680","author":{"steamid":"76561198005086733","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":20420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16222,"last_played":1565139892},"language":"english","review":"Review Nov 12, 2017.\n\nSurvivor side (rank 1)\n\n* bullying killers is extremely easy requiring very little knowledge (just learn bloodlust stacks, dropping pallets and abusing building structures)\n*mistakes are often forgiven in Dead by Daylight, most players run cookie cutter builds (decisive strike, adrenaline or borrowed time.\n*Lobby system is completely busted, it encourages grouping with your online friends and bullying the killers with voice chat.  Unlike other games such as League of legends, Behaviour Interactive has no idea on how \"balancing\" actually works.  Dead by Daylight needs a group limit, but their isn't one.  Instead the developers are making it where survivors can't tell each other about the killers perks.... \n*Map balancing is heavily weighted towards being a survivor, I got to rank 1 just by abusing this system.\n\n\nKiller side (rank 1)\n\n* Endless pallet looping (survivor times bloodlust drops pallet = stack loss)\n* Survivors get way too many second/third chances encouraging mistakes / bad players in higher tiers.\n*Hook placement - I have had on many occasions in high rank survivors deliberately running to empty hook placement spots, to prevent being picked up or hooked exploiting the map balance.\n*Games being held hostage for prolonged periods of time, because survivors can be stupid (at times) and mess up the gen orders. (35 min last time thanks bhvr) \n*Few good map control killers - because of map balance it's made playing the weaker killers pointless (unless you want to be called a camper)\n*gen rushing - because survivors have little objectives your forced to run hex: ruin or kiss your gens/game goodbye, but if they happen to mess up the gen order they have no issues or problems wasting your time.\n*nerfs - killers have some unique abilities, so bhvr tends to swing the nerf bat more towards them because they can.\n*taunted - survivors often taunt killers because they know map abusing is extremely funny, like I said I've done the same thing to rank one, if survivors have time for tea-bagging it shows how \"balanced\" looping has become.\n\n\nSettings/UI/Option/bugs\n*cannot play in window-mode with multiple monitors...\n* nothing is adjustable, because of the offering system.\n*No option for opting out of end game lobby chat (tons of harassment / death threats / and racist slurs)\n* lots of bugs ranging from players getting on untouchable structures or stuck between pallets. (watch tru3ta1ents game being held hostage) https://clips.twitch.tv/FlaccidQuaintOysterWutFace\n* game crashes pretty frequently, (I don't think their error reports do anything or maybe they just don't read the logs)\n*cannot view your teachable perks\n*DBD forums is filled with nothing but trolls, it's more of a tug of war instead of actually taking balancing into consideration.\n*peer-to-peer client, making cheating extremely easy with lag switches.\n\nWhen you take the ratios 4 to 1 the amount of survivor posted topics speaks for themselves, and that's why Dead by Daylight is heavily weighted towards being a survivor main.  \n\nIt's literally 90% of Behaviour's player-base, you don't wanna piss off the cash cow.  I'm glad League of legends is resetting soon, being a semi-high elo player in multiple games this would be the most unbalanced / semi-fun game I have come across.","timestamp_created":1508093666,"timestamp_updated":1510472867,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35755120","author":{"steamid":"76561198257345252","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5761,"last_played":1642354509},"language":"italian","review":"un gioco diversamente bello.... l'idea è buona ma il gioco è PIENO DI FOTTUTI BAG DI MERDA. è una cosa assurda veramente....

Una cosa che fa salire i nervi! \n\nUn altro grande problema è il sistema di host: praticamente il killer crea una lobby, e i sopravvissuti la riempiono. Il problema sorge quando inizia la partita: se il killer ha una connessione buona, potete giocare tranquillamente. Se invece così non fosse, preparatevi ad un'esperienza di gioco a dir poco penosa.\nQuesto perché magari avete aspettato i secoli per entrare in una partita come sopravvissuto e morite subito a causa del lag, ed è a dir poco frustrante.\n\nCapisco la difficoltà di cambiare il sistema di host, però per favore, spero possiate cambiare il più presto possibile.\n\nSe non fosse per queste cose, sarebbe un gioco che meriterebbe davvero un sacco, non che adesso non sia come tale, eh!

Me ha enganchado desde el primer momento y siempre tengo ganas de jugar. Sí que es verdad que tiene muchos fallos, pero desde que salieron las versiones de consola ha mejorado bastante. \nEs muy entretenido, puedes jugar o de Superviviente o de Asesino, el Asesino es el que hostea la partida, los Supervivientes lo que tienen que hacer es procurar no toparse con el Asesino, ir haciendo generadores, salvar a sus compañeros colgados o heridos por el Asesino y una vez hechos los generadores abrir puertas y escapar del juego, también se puede escapar por la trampilla, lo cual da más puntos, pero esta se activa cuando eres el único superviviente restante en la partida.\nEl cometido del Asesino es justo lo contrario, impedir que los Supervivientes hagan generadores y escapen de la partida.\nPor el momento mi Asesino favorito es Myers, es fiel al de la película, su habilidad de ''acosar'' va elevando a medida que va observando a los supervivientes, y cuando alcanza el estado número 3, los puede tumbar de un golpe. \nDe Supervivientes recomiendo empezar con Claudette ya que se oculta bastante bien por el mapa, ella es experta en curaciones. \nEste juego, personalmente, se disfruta mejor con amigos, os podéis echar unas buenas risas.\nRecomendadísimo, pero faltan todavía muchas cosas por pulir, como la conexión, bugs, etc.\nCuando llevaba unas 70h el juego se me reinició, porque sí, y me reseteó todos los personajes así como aceptar el acuerdo de licencia de nuevo. Es un error común, y muy frustrante, que pasa y que deberían arreglar cuanto antes. Es un juego que lleva en Steam más de año y medio y este tipo de errores son imperdonables, más aún tener que estar haciendo copias del archivo de guardado cada día, porque claro, no sabes cuando se te va a resetear otra vez. Me ha pasado dos veces, a la segunda tuve suerte ya que tenía copia de guardado. Cuando esto pasa hay que enviar correo a los desarrolladores, los cuales te contestan amablemente y no muy tarde. Yo con que arreglen ese problema, bastante grave, para mí ya sería el juego

Review-\nFirst off, this game is not your typical horror genre - the schematics of this game are very challenging and the puzzle feature are not warm-welcoming for beginners. The downfalls include no healthbar, no radar or maps and no formal communcation (ie. voicechat, chatbox). Your health is basically just two slots: injured and down on the ground. The only way to recover any form of health is to be healed by a comrad (but wait! there's more if you read further). Here's the puzzle part of the game: the goal is to power up 5 generators and successfully complete skill checks while powering up. If you fail the skill check, your location sets off and the killer can find you easier. Once the gennies are powered up, you must find and power up one of the 2 exit doors. There's also a hatch or exit escape once the criteria is met: can only be accessed if 2 gennies are done and if you're the only survivor. My sincerest luck on finding that hatch btw <3. \n\nThe maps are randomized: you're either trapped in a massive area or a small area. The killer is overpowered as they also have the same downfalls as the survivors, but they do have more add ons or items available to them. At this point, you might feel like rage quitting (and trust me, i've felt that plenty of times), however if you pull yourself together n continue to play this game...you'll feel like million bucks. lol ok maybe a little exaggeration there, but you'll feel accomplished for sure. \n\n-Full Review (spoiler-free)-\nYou can play as one of the 6 main characters (plus DLC characters if bought) n each of them possess 3 unique perks that can be taught amongst themselves. The titular character known as Dwight, contains many support perks such as Leader that speeds up any genny or healing progress when around other survivors. He's a coward and I sense a low inefficiency in his midochlorians 'cause this guy has the worst luck and he eventually gets caught in the game. Meg is a great starter character: she's athletic and has perks like Sprint Shoes, which gives her a short time in accelerated speed when she runs. My favorite perk from her is Adrenaline: full health recovery when all gennies are powered. She's opposite from Dwight and obviously has bigger cajones in that department (see what I did there..) 'cause she is strong & courageous. Claudette is the genius from the group and the most praised, worthy character in the game: she has Self Care (can heal herself) and Empathy (view injured survivors that are nearby) that gives her a significant advantage. She's also quite dorky, but this chick clearly knows what she's doing if she's the only one that can heal herself and view injured teammates....a caregiver w/ a brain that got her shiztaki together (like uh duhh). \n\nNow here's the main reason why I bought this game: Bill Overbeck from Left 4 Dead and best of all - he's a free playable character! He has Borrowed Time perk: he goes for the rescue and if the killer hits either Bill or the hooked survivor, then there's a cooldown meter on health and grants a small opportunity to escape before they fall down to the ground. Brillant man I tell ya...just brilliant this guy is. As we move along, Jake is probably one of the least desirable characters in the game n ofc I will gladly tell ya why. Most of his perks are considered useless, but I will point out that Ironwill is a worthy perk: if standing still, no audio or groans can be heard while injured. Now you must be wondering why this guy is not favorable, well the dude is a monument in scale and can be easily seen by the killer. There ya have it. In total, there's 10 survivors, but I only mentioned the ones I have played.\n\nAs for the killers, there are 5 main characters (ofc DLC killers) n they also have 3 specialized perks. Killers can be spotted by the sound of the heartbeat: the closer they are, the louder the heartbeat gets. Also, killers can only see through first person view n the environment (heavy fog or dark moonlight) may disorientate their view. The main villian, The Trapper, is a bulky-meathead that can set beartraps anywhere in the map. The Huntress, one of the most popular killers, can throw projectile hatchets and her chant or humming replaces the heartbeat. The Hillbilly has a chainsaw and can go into a horizontal, frenzy attack that can instantly down any survivor. The Wraith can go invisible for a short time and hide his heartbeat while standing still. There's also horror franchised, killers such as The Shape (Halloween) and Leatherface (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) along w/ the most controversial of them all, The Nightmare (Freddy Krueger).\n\nHighly recommend this game. Playing with friends via voice chat is the way to go on this game. You're gonna need all the help you need to survive. Game has gone on sale for $12; however, HumbleBundle has offered $9 this year (that lucky SOB of mine). To all my buddies n non-partisans, here are the perks u should seek out as a survivor: Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Ironwill, Self Care, Empathy, Premonition, Spine Chill, Leader, Urban Evasion, Technician, We'll Make it Together. This game still has glitches on the gameplay mechanics and lobby searches, but it's a major improvement from its preliminary stage.

Gerçekten şaka gibi bir ekibe sahip bu oyun o yüzden kimseye önermiyorum bunu oynayacağınıza gidin başka bir oyun oynayın çinlilerin yaptığı DBD çakmaları bile daha iyi.","timestamp_created":1508016273,"timestamp_updated":1652861636,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35729337","author":{"steamid":"76561198367586141","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5385,"last_played":1552062608},"language":"russian","review":"Это игра где маньяки с 3 престижом кемперят.
