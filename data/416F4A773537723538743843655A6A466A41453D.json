Although there are a few disadvantages this is by far one of the best game to play with friends. There are some in-game bugs but you can cope with them. The community is mixed. You can get toxic and selfish (not alturistic) players in your lobby or unsportsmanlike killer like camping you and you are doomed or you can have luck playing with smart and \"taking things for the team\" guys and a fair killer. The Devs are doing good work putting out often good and intersting DLCs. The last update on the \"paced leveling bloodwebs\" is great. Get a group of good friends and enjoy this stuff. You won`t regret it. Devs still pulling out new content and keeps the game

is a game that will make you rage, come with that in mind, you are gonna rage because some hits aren't really hits, because a survivor just teabags all of the match, cause' a bug just breaks your

Besides this, this is a great game, makes you really try to survive or win, even if you don't get really out of It. Sometimes it becomes kinda boring, cause' It's always the same: get camped, you die cause' of your teammates, same killers, same perks, but you kinda love that sensation of winning or raging, that's the true, that's is why I'm with 1,000 hours in this game.
