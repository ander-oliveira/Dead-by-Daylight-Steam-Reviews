Of course this isn't that simple.\n\nCharacters\nThere are 4 characters to choose from and each does have their own unique skills.  I have mostly played as Meg and her skill is to have a burst sprint for 3 sec's.  \nSkill Tree\nThe skills are not yet unlocked. The game impliments a web tree skill.  This leveling will have assortments of items like flashlights and medkits.  The tree also houses the the perk/skill you'll need to survive.  At first my friend wondered why dind't they go with a sphere grid like FFX and have all the skills there.  After reaching lvl 10, the dev implemented the entity mechanic.  This dark entity will actually take away certain items from the bloodWeb.  For me, this will make you choose carefully on what you want to spend and what to obtain first.\nWIK about the killer-\nI have yet to play the killer, but its a 1v4 player match where the killer has to sacrifce the 4 survivers for the higher power(Vince McMan).  If the killer is successful, they are the winners of the match.  There are 3 killers.  The hillbilly(chainsaw massacre) The wraith(predator) and i call the last guy hatchet man(Jasen).  The killer must set each player on a hook.  a time frame or bar will appear under the players name and will indicate how long before you will die.\ntips-\nas the survivor, be aware of making sounds. Do not run unless nessesary.  The killer is able to follow a glowing red path that the player made.  this is only unique for the killer.  Help only if you can.  You can save other survivers from being killed, but be aware of where the killer is or watch out for traps.  Jasen has bear traps, the wraith can be cloaked, and the hillbilly has a chainsaw(one hit and your down).  Use pallets and windows to slow down the killer.  a successful pallet drop can stun the killer.  Killers take a while to walk over windows so try to hide if you're far ahead.   Use lockers as hiding spots.  1/3 times they will look into lockers unless they saw you.  \nGenerators-\nthe killer can see every Gen in the game.  but IDK if they can sense if the Gen is being powered up.  Helping other survivers will speed up the process.  Be careful of the quick time action, failing will stop you and others from fixing the generator and will alert the killer of your location.\nFinal Thoughts-\nThe Game is great, but still need patches or updates to the matchmaking,  you can be pared with an overpowered killer with OP perks.  or if your a first time killer or early lvl you might get higher lvled survivers.  They need a balanced system with matching similar stats.  Also the invite system needs attention.  I don't wanna keep searching matches just to play with my friends(outside of private matches).  This game does have a learning curve towards the gameplay.  A hide and seek sort of way.  If you played outlast or evil within, those games may help you out for this game.  I do recommend this game, but until the devs change the MP matchup or have public invites then yes. I suggest waiting then.\n\n","timestamp_created":1467308180,"timestamp_updated":1467308180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510178089141845703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23960933","author":{"steamid":"76561198139637257","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1625143393},"language":"english","review":"Verry good but should have it so you can go in a group of survivors before joining a lobby and then joining a game with a random killer.","timestamp_created":1467307904,"timestamp_updated":1467307904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23960898","author":{"steamid":"76561198148239769","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1546213182},"language":"english","review":"Wonderful game m8!

It is not a \"win\" if I de-rank for doing so. This is a paradox. A oxymoron. It doesn't make sense and I cannot wrap my head around why this is even a thing..? \n\nIf I win the game, under any circumstance I should NEVER de-rank. May'be so make it if you don't get enough points you don't actually rank up but you don't de-rank either? Only when you lose should you de-rank.

Then most of the time it cannot find a game, so there is a tiny message that will say \"no games found\" and disappear in 10 seconds. But, instead of throwing you into a queue, it just simply throws you out of the queue.\nSo, if you are doing things like me (reading msgs, facebook, etc), you will miss this and realise minutes later that you aren't even queued.\n\nFurther to this, when you actually get in to a match making lobby. Most of the time players will look at my low level ass, or lack of gear, assume I'm a pleb and leave. But, when the room hasn't been filled in some certain amount of time, it throws me back out to the main menu...\nIt will literally take me on average over 10 minutes to find a game.\n\nThen when you get in a game finally, you will still find people will disconnect, or you will get wrecked in a minute or two. I'll get some good games. But, to have to sort through the above bullshit and wait over 10 minutes to find a game that ends in crushing defeat in a minute is taxing.\n\nI want to like this game, but they don't make it easy.

El sistema de emparejamiento es nefasto, mas de la mitad de las perks no sirven de nada, el mapa del demogorgon es horrible para survivor lleno de pales inseguros, y ahora quieren joder la ruina cuando nadie lo estaba pidiendo. Siempre se hablaba de los servidores dedicados, esas maravillosas tierras prometidas, pero cuando las implementaron, resulto ser falacias de un falso pastor. A parte, no han cumplido la promesa de que ya no se pasaria 20 minutos de espera. Esto no seria nada como para echar en cara, pero retrasaron todo tres veces para que los servidores estuviesen bien, y no conforme en eso, cancelaron eventos porque querian centrarse en la salud del juego. Y sorpresa, la estan cagando. \n\nLos survivors llegan a raguear de una manera descontrolada, poniendose orgullosos y chulos perjudicando al resto de su equipo, forzando a jugar en premade. Los killers usan tacticas nefastas para ganar la partida, ya sease campear, o incluso esperar en tu espalda a que se pase el efecto de tiempo prestado. \n\nActualizan, Y que me encuentro?? un sistema para chuparme mas el dinero. Con misiones algunas casi imposibles de hacer y totalmente situacionales. Lo adecuado es hacer misiones que se completen con solo jugar, si, te pueden forzar a ponerte alguna habilidad, pero no forzarte a estar erido y completar ciertos requisitos en una sola partida.\n\nPasa el teimpo y pasa el tiempo, y es mas de lo mismo. De survi, tu unica opcion es ir en premade que sepa lo que hace. Porque si vas solo te encontraras cosas como: Simplemente caminar por ahi, sin hacer nada, ni totems, ni motores y si te descuelgan, tranquilo lo haran con el killer detras. O un survi que campea y no respeta pales, tirandolos sin pensarlo dos veces, dejandote el mapa limpiiito de pales para cuando necesites lupear. O simplemente el survi que repara y no hace nada mas que eso, que te han colgado? bueno espera que me haga 4 motores y te bajo.\n\nEsta bien que de survi te encuentres esto en los bajos, pero cuando estas en morados y rojos, y te encuentras mas de lo mismo, pues se te quitan muchisimo las ganas de jugar survi, porque se te puede dar muy muy muy bien lupear, pero si tu equipo juega siempre 1 vs 4, es totalmente imposible.\n\nDe killer, pffff ya puedes rezar.\n\nSin ruina tal y como la conociamos, un motor esta regalado, y si se lo plantean, asta dos. Es super facil reparar. Y killers que no tienen control de mapa como la cerda, el tramprero, etc. Se quedan como un adorno por si alguna vez te odias a ti mismo y decides jugar con ellos. Esto fuerza a que los killers tengan que usar metodos totalmente sucios, haciendo que literalmente no se juege en partida, ya que campean, tuenlean, sluguean o se ponen mori para acabar cuanto antes, sin siquiera dejar pillar puntos aunque pueda matarte si quiere. Esto hace que se genere mas conflicto y toxicidad en la comunidad del juego.\n\nMi consejo: que se dejen de sacar contenido de pago masivo. Entiendo que los killer de licencia cuesten dinero. Pero cuando todos los killer lo hacen, y encima, te ponen un pase de batalla, que cuesta lo que un DLC, siendo esto un juego de PAGO, me parece nefasto y un timo. Si haces esto asi, hacer el juego free to play, y los que se compraron el juego darles muchas, pero que muchas recompensas. Y dejar de centraros en contenido exclusivo de pago y hacer algo con el juego realmente. Hacer que llegar a los rangos altos valga la pena, que el emparejamiento tenga sentido y equilibrar bien el juego.","timestamp_created":1467289565,"timestamp_updated":1591596060,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530520200729370117","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23953324","author":{"steamid":"76561198098472108","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1505562590},"language":"schinese","review":" 请叫他：   黎明拔线\n\n\n玩的好的就拔线，玩的差的也拔线。\n\n官方也不管管。\n那么多国人入坑，也不出个中文版。\n差评。\n\n\n但是这款游戏还是很有意思的，类似于警察抓小偷。\n而这里的故事背景就是，4个作死的人跑到屠夫家里来偷电的故事。\n然后屠夫捍卫自己家园的故事。\n但是这4个小家伙并不害怕，于是他们展开了激烈的搏斗。\n\n\n人类开局要迅速找到无敌房，或者大魁树，然后再偷偷的修电，一定要注意听声音。\n屠夫请一定要在房子两侧，或者拐弯处放置陷阱，注意，你不可能待到全部的人，最好保守一点，待着一个人杀。\n如果你是大神，那么，当我没说。\n","timestamp_created":1467289380,"timestamp_updated":1467289380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23953263","author":{"steamid":"76561198112245968","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1649183008},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego esta bastante bien en si, va un poco mal a la hora de empezar la partida, y tampoco se puede jugar con amigos, pero en general es un juego bastante bueno recomendado para todos :D","timestamp_created":1467289226,"timestamp_updated":1467289226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496732026338577271","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23953244","author":{"steamid":"76561198263533513","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1138,"last_played":1580744705},"language":"english","review":"This game isn't in Early Access?
