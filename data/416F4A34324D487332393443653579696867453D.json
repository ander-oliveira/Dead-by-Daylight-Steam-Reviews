director Mathiue說的一樣他們做的是服務型遊戲，以服務玩家為主，所以我只有一句話，I think you did a pretty good job so far\n\n不好的地方就是BUG巨多，另外就是匹配系統經常會讓相同段位的新手和老玩家相遇，容易對新手造成不好的遊戲體驗。更值得一提的是現在修理發電機的速度很快，令到大量殺手成為Camper(守屍流)，即使改弱Anti-camp的技能也無法阻止Camper越來越多的事實。\n\n對於新手逃生者：\n1. 先熟悉附近可能的逃生路線\n2. 學會卡殺手的視野盲點\n3. 訓練自己skillcheck按中白色區域\n4. 遊戲得分最快的項目按順序為 被追、砸暈殺手、拯救隊友、維修發電機、逃生成功，治療拆圖騰看情況\n\n新手殺手：\n1. 注意血跡及紅色劃痕的走向\n2. 集中聆聽受傷逃生者的聲音\n3. 追逐時盡量只走直線\n4.

While I stand by my feelings regarding many aspects of the game, I did finally hear from BEhavior. They were effusive in their apologies for the long reply and awarded my wife 830,600,000 bloodpointys to restore her characters. With that said, I have to say that my main gripe has been addressed. However, many of the other issues really need to be worked out and improved. If you submit a ticket to BEhavior, expect to wait a few weeks to a month for resolution of your issue via bloodpoint reward. I can cautiously recommend this game again...with the caveat that you backup your save and, in my case, disable Steam cloud saves.\n\n\nSo here are the facts about this game:\n\nPros:\n-Incredibly addictive, fun to play\n-Great maps\n-Great killers\n\nCons:\n-Developers do not respond when you need assistance. My wife lost her save data due to a well known issue with this game and the Steam cloud. She lost over 1,100 hours of bloodpoints and prestiges over multiple characters. We went on the forums, found the method to ask the dev for help. They replied that they would get back to us and that they appreciated our patience. That was a month ago. Since then we have requested help two more times sending them all the information they asked for...no response.\n-Survivors are lacking in true ethnic diversity. Mostly white. No Latinos,Hispanics, Middle-Eastern people, and no Black men. It has a distinctly Eurocentric myopic feel to it. Not super welcoming to people of color to have super limited options for them to play as people who represent them.\n-Leatherface is a reskin and rehash of the Hillbilly with slightly different perks. Even his weapons are not realy different.\n-The game is supremely glitchy and it gets to be really hard to play if the host has poor internet\n-Plenty of hackers on here who make the experience less than fun far too often\n-Survivors have a bunch of mediocre outfits that offer no bonuses in and of themselves...just looks\n\nWith that said I still play this game, as does my wife, because we have supported it from the beta stage and sunk so much money and time into all of the add-on content; Which was mostly not really worth it. We stuck by this game because we thought the devs were really trying to do things differently. I bought multiple copies of it  for friends and family. But in the end they behave no better than EA, or 2K games. They are only about the bottom-line and could care less about the people who were loyal to them and helped to stuff their pockets and promoted their game at the grass roots. I am extremely disappointed. \n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this game to someone else, knowing how BEhavior treated us as customers and gamers.","timestamp_created":1506394765,"timestamp_updated":1506639324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502050638198852539","comment_count":17,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35214709","author":{"steamid":"76561198119198403","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":38503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":56,"playtime_at_review":5041,"last_played":1660606627},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego muy divertido y viciante, con una buena comunidad y todo c: lo unico que cambiaria es el matchmaking que a veces te empareja con rangos muy dispares al tuyo","timestamp_created":1506394553,"timestamp_updated":1506394553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35214694","author":{"steamid":"76561198385093388","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1618218677},"language":"schinese","review":"人实在是太少了，有时候就匹配不到人","timestamp_created":1506394476,"timestamp_updated":1506394476,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509037256240844727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35214613","author":{"steamid":"76561198007788051","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6851,"last_played":1506443074},"language":"english","review":"Short & sweet I love this fkn game.

Kann die ganzen Meckereien hier nicht verstehen, finde es als Überlebender etwas schwerer, aber nicht unmachbar. Hängt stark von den Mitspielern ab, die manchmal mega dämlich handeln und damit die Runde versauen. Als Killer hat man auch extrem viel Spaß, finde es aber nicht immer leicht mit ihnen. Es gibt genügend Überlebende, die dann nervige Marathonläufe um Felsen veranstalten und jedes Mal 180° Wenden hinlegen. Genau so gibt es aber Leute, die jemanden hängen und direkt davor campen. Das ist nervig.. Kann man nur mit Teamspeak lösen, weil die Anderen es erstens nicht interessiert und sie weiter Motoren reparieren, oder sonst zwei weitere Überlebende Niedergeschlagen werden und die Runde damit meist schon klar ist.\n\nAber so - super Spiel, macht Spaß, vor allem mit Freunden!

The killers were to hard to play for people without experience, so I kinda understood why the devs merfed them.

Thats annoying and not only for me. Many people who I talked to about dbd got bored cause either u get in a match with bad survivors, so u have no chance to survive, without being an asshole and letting the others die, or u get a baby killer, that camps or even facecamps. I played it in the last few days to see, what the new update brought...so well besides that this game is expensive if u buy all the dlcs, no now they have an ingame store where u have to pay even more money, to customize your characters a bit ?!
