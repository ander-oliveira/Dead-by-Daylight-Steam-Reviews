The devs keep adding more DLC and MTX to pad their pockets instead of focusing on game improvement. It almost seems like it is a victim of it's own success. There was a point where this game was reasonably fair and balanced but that is long gone now because every time you turn around they are adding another DLC to generate revenue before they even get the bugs ironed out of the last one.\n\nTo begin, the game is fun. You will have fun with it for the first hundred hours or so. After that you will begin to realize that you are just in a gameplay loop, farming for meta perks, with very jaded/salty/angsty other humans and some low rate twitch streamers who think they deserve special treatment. If you play survivor your friends will regularly throw you under the bus for their benefit or \"funny stream content\". After dealing with this long enough you will eventually become one of these people.\n\nThe game has an unfortunate focus around meta perks that will require hundreds of hours to obtain if you want to \"git gud\". Of course if you want to speed this process up you can always use your wallet to partake in any of the copious amounts of microtransactions and DLC present.\n\nThe game being inherently unbalanced has made it more unbalanced. As they say \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\", and at any given time whichever side of the community is whining the loudest is the most overpowered. Currently it's the killer with many changes being made recently to tilt the scales in their favor. Add that to the many DLC killers who are just flat out broken already.\n\nFor a PC game, there are very limited graphics options and customization. You have 4 settings and a resolution scale. That's it. It's 2019 and we cannot set options for AA, AF filtering, etc etc in this game. If you modify the config files to tweak the game specifically to your tastes, you will be banned. The survivor FOV is so zoomed in now that all you can see is basically your character and maybe 1-2 feet beside them while the killer has perks that will widen their FOV to ludicrous levels. There are models in this game that look like they came straight from a PS2 title. Blocky, low polygon models everywhere. Most textures look muddy and washed out even on ultra. The lighting is pretty good but that's about it. For a game that's so behind the times graphically, it suffers from a lot of performance issues like stuttering, frame drops in certain areas, etc even on high end hardware. And you're locked to 60fps unless you modify game files, which can get you banned. \"Deal with it.\"\n\nThe community as a whole is unbelievably toxic. People changing their steam names to things just to troll. Being extremely salty and spewing verbal diarrhea after every match, whether they win or lose. As a killer there is nothing you can do to prevent this, no matter how you play. There is a specific \"way\" you're supposed to play to appease the whiny survivors but despite your best efforts you will still get flamed 2/3 games. This extends into the survivors themselves as I stated previously. They will throw you under the bus at any opportunity. It's sad to think that these are your fellow humans that you walk the earth with.\n\nSadly this is the only game of it's kind right now so if you want a unique experience, this is your only option pretty much. There's Deathgarden but that game is a huge pile of sh!t made by the same devs. Hopefully something better will come along in time.\n\nWith the latest addition of a \"battlepass\" style system in a game that is not free-to-play I can no longer recommend this game at all. This type of predatory practice in video games is the sad state of the current industry and totally scummy. This game has turned into a money mill with loads of MTX, DLC, and now the battlepass system. They have made the grind extremely lengthy to encourage people to give them more money for no other reason than that they can. Sadly the balance, performance, and other issues that this game suffers will never be fixed as it solely exists now to get you to spend money on it. Time to move on.","timestamp_created":1521350110,"timestamp_updated":1573534407,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40889695","author":{"steamid":"76561198799772363","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2318,"last_played":1542762753},"language":"english","review":"This is the perfect game for me!

You cannot kill them without camping and/or tunneling unless you are very good at the game.\n-Rank reset is problematic because when this happens, all the high ranking survivors and killers get in games with new players which isn't very fun for the new players.\n-I'm a survivor main, but I have to admit that it is easy to let the killer chase you and keep him on you the entire match whilst the other survivors focus down the generators.\n\nAll in all, Dead by daylight is a great game to play with your friends and even solo. If you look past the bugs and sometimes toxic community this can really be a great game for you.

I waste hours of my time on this game and every time I get off I feel like I've gotten cancer from all the trolls and issues this game offers. It's simply not worth it.

There are so many problems with it like the balancing issues (The killers have been nerfed to the point that all enjoyment in playing them has left and the survivors are over powered and there is no skill in playing them anymore.) Just from that issue I have been contemplating leaving the game till it was fixed, but the last straw for me is the banning of so many DBD youtubers for no reason. #unbanNo0b3 \n\nThe bugs can be debilitating (getting stuck in pallets or hooks) though they normally get fixed timely but the Devs won't listen to the player base to fix unfair killer issues and only listen to their casual player base, when they should be listening to the people who have a lot of hours poured into the game (I am not saying you should ignore them completely, just listen to both). The casuals can adapt and learn how to play against harder killers like in any other game, as DBD has a ranked system to try to get you in a game with people your level so you can learn. If the Devs don't start fixing the game so that it is fun for everyone they won't have a player base left.\n\nDon't buy the game till it gets fixed, and don't play it until it gets fixed. Or play it but give back constructive criticism to make it better, it is truly a fun game overall.

Aktuell macht das Spiel auch einen guten Eintrug, was das balancen der Survivor und Killer angeht.\n\nDas einzige was mich noch aktuell bei dem Spiel stört sind, die Bugs, die nach jedem Update zurück kommen, die Toxic Community, die Startunfreundlichkeit für Anfänger oder die Lagswitcher/Cheater die in dem Spiel ihr unwesen treiben. Wobei bei diesen Punkten bereits aktuell nach einer Lösung gesucht wird.\n\nMein Fazit zu dem Spiel lautet: Gebt dem Spiel eine Chance und lasst euch nach ein paar schlechten Runden nicht unterkriegen.
