Como eu disse é bastante divertido o game, acho que o maior ponto negativo desse game é a comunidade que o cerca pois por mais que existam muitos jogadores realmente bons e que jogam de verdade, nao vai ser dificil voce encontar em uma, duas, tres ou mais partidas os famosos campers ou ate mesmo alguns hackers dentro do jogo. Mais mesmo com esses problemas, e alguns bugs ocasionais, dead by Daylight é uma carta de amor aos amantes do genero Horror e Sobrevivencia e posso dizer sem sombra de duvida que ser perseguido pelo GhostFace, Michael Myers, LetherFace, etc...

The learning curve can be pretty brutal, especially if you keep getting mismatched (as a killer I sometimes get into matches with people who are so obviously new I try my best to make them feel like they finally managed to outrun a killer) and there are definitely issues with the game.\n\nI was initially going to leave a long, wordy review but instead I'll leave a list of good and bad things to expect in the game since that's likely why you're even reading this :) Here are just a few of those things from each category.\n\nThe good things:\n\nThe game is really immersive and has enough of a competitive feeling to it to keep you engaged while hunting achievements, leveling up characters or just playing with your friends.\n\nThe game is really two different games given that you can play from either side of the match, either as a killer where you don't have to rely on anyone and you win or lose based on your own contributions and decisions, or with three others as survivors which can be equally fun and infuriating depending on who you play with.\n\nThere are a lot of killers in the game, each with their own power and add ons which gives a wide variety of ways to engage in the game and new killers are added in every few months.\n\nOverall, the bloodweb is a fun way to progress that allows you to choose what you want each level from a randomized list of things. Yes, some people don't like randomization but it's here and it works for what it is and the game would be worse off if everyone immediately had access to all of the things you can get in the bloodweb.\n\nYou can play with a full group of friends and even create custom matches with a killer you know to go against.\n\nThe compendium system is a layer of content that really adds to the game since you can play through all of the content from when the feature was introduced. Basically, there are books filled with challenges you can try to complete from the survivor and killer sides that add a layer of focus to things and reward you with a lot of bloodpoints as you move through the books.\n\nThere are a lot of achievements to collect in the game, with most of them being moderately reasonable and a few that make you wonder how many tries you're going to need to make before the stars align.\n\nThe core gameplay is a lot of fun, even if it's not that deep at the heart. Trying to chase people and put them on hooks or hide/run from being put on a hook is really not super advanced but it's a lot of fun to play out and creates enough desire to 'win' that the game can definitely have you wanting just one more match.\n\nThe game has a lot of maps as well, and various versions of maps, each with strengths and weaknesses when playing from either side of the field and over time they're just familiar enough to learn so that you won't always feel like you're running blind (unless you're one of those players who hates Raccoon City Police Department :p )\n\nThe perk system really changes the game up as well and there are a lot of them. Perks give you special abilities like see where the survivors are at certain times in a match, or speed you up when you could really use a short burst to escape, or even help pull yourself up from the ground when you're dying. The perk system is a bit of a mini game because they do change how the game unfolds quite a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bad things:\n\nIf you play the game for any decent length of time you will almost certainly run into people who are less evolved. Simply put, the game has the odd person whose sole purpose is to make the game unfun for other people and the game system doesn't really give people a lot of ways to deal with these types of people.\n\nAlso, play long enough and you'll definitely find hackers. They're rare but they're there and it can be pretty blatant at times. Overall, it's not an issue for game health, it just isn't fun to get matched with them when they are running around.\n\nI was going to put the mori system on the good side, which is a system that allows killers to kill survivors rather than put them on the hook, using animations unique to the killer performing the kill. This system is a lot of fun but they've been talking about reworking it recently and the early information about the rework sounds like they're going to ruin one of the game's fun elements and make it a lot less interesting.\n\nThe report system in the game is absolutely terrible. It takes you forever to submit a report and there will be times when you hear absolutely nothing back, not even one of those automated messages telling you that your email was received. More than that, you don't ever get to know if the guy who blocked you into a small space for fifteen minutes was punished or not (the way some games would inform you when people are 'actioned' for bad behavior)\n\nInstant afks are a thing in this game, as are afk/botted killers and while the afk killers just let you escape a match (sometimes losing rank progress because you don't get to do enough in a match), the survivors who get upset that they've been caught and either kill themselves on the hook early or disconnect from the game outright just leave their team in a really terrible spot (if you're one of these people, you're not hurting the killer in any way, you're helping them, so please, stop :) )\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the game, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves horror or has even a bit of competitiveness in them, as long as they're ready to lose quite a bit before things click and skill development begins. It's a lot of fun and definitely a game everyone should at least try once.","timestamp_created":1653430174,"timestamp_updated":1653430174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115961964","author":{"steamid":"76561198170179313","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2584,"playtime_at_review":2190,"last_played":1660539970},"language":"spanish","review":"ENTRETENIDO","timestamp_created":1653429643,"timestamp_updated":1653429643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115961903","author":{"steamid":"76561199084089696","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":104,"playtime_at_review":5068,"last_played":1659907071},"language":"english","review":"muc","timestamp_created":1653429528,"timestamp_updated":1653429528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115961785","author":{"steamid":"76561198159391149","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5669,"last_played":1657413419},"language":"english","review":"All

People took advantage of the time period when Epic Games had the game for free and made tons of back up accounts, so nobody cares if they get banned. The worst part isn't even the blatant cheaters, it's the subtle ones. The ones that have given themselves advantages that are hard to detect or only do things when they can't be seen. This, on top of the game being an embarrassing buggy mess, eventually leads to you question everything. Did I actually miss that hit, or are they cheating? Was that heal really that fast or are they cheating? Did I actually lose the mind game or are they using wall hacks? \n\nIt gets to the point where you can't learn or improve without just slamming your forehead into the content thousands and thousands of times because you don't know if any moment is legitimate, which means you don't know if you can use it as information to get better and understand the game. Cheating throws the delicate metrics that DBD is balanced around completely out the window. As an example, there is a survivor perk in the game that creates a limited area where they move 2% faster, so you can see why subtle cheaters giving themselves a 2%,3%,5%, or even more of a speed boost all the time could become a problem and give them a huge advantage.\n\nUnless they somehow find a way to actually fix the cheating problem, I would advise you stay away. Cheating is becoming a more and more lucrative business very very quickly, so chances are it's just going to keep getting worse. Many will claim that it's only a problem in the highest ranks, but how does that make anything better even if it's true? Lots will say that they have never seen cheaters, or that if they have it's only been a select few times. The reality is, many, if not most, will probably not be able to identify the smarter subtle cheaters, and even if they can, it won't be every time. Without having hundreds or thousands of hours in the game that lets you understand from gut feelings that what just happened just isn't right, your just going to be left unsure, and over time this becomes very tiring. Even if you do have those hundreds or thousands of hours it can still be really hard to tell sometimes because the game is just so fucking janky.\n\nI just don't think it's worth it at this point, and if I could go back and spend my 200+ hours playing a different game now that I know what I do now about the cheating problem DBD is suffering from, I would.\n\nHave a nice day.","timestamp_created":1653365262,"timestamp_updated":1653365262,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115926050","author":{"steamid":"76561198433513992","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":412,"last_played":1655277237},"language":"english","review":"Terror.","timestamp_created":1653364993,"timestamp_updated":1653364993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115925660","author":{"steamid":"76561198006888983","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1654709281},"language":"english","review":"It's fun.

It's cool and interesting but I wish there were less DLCS because like a third of the characters are free and the rest you need to buy.
