Mas, o que as pessoas não enxergam é a visão do assassino, porque QUALQUER tipo de estratégia utilizada para MATAR os sobreviventes - que é o seu principal objetivo -, é sempre atacada pelos chorões que NÃO SABEM perder, e também não sabem o quão sofrido é VOCÊ DE ASSASSINO PEGAR 4 CARAS RANK 1, DOS QUAIS OS 4 SÃO DEUSES NA PORRA DO JOGO E TEM PELO MENOS O DOBRO DE HORAS DE VOCÊ.

The game is forever broken in one way or another. Band-aid's are put on broken aspects of the game. Problems are \"fixed\" by the developers but it only seems to cause more problems which can happen with coding something as complex as this game, I understand that much. But other \"problems\" are addressed and \"fixed\" when they weren't asked to be fixed by the community; these problems so minor in comparison to larger issues involving game play itself but those larger issues for months and months appear to be white washed over or brushed aside.\n\nNew content DLC seems to be released on a regular time schedule as much as patches to fix the games less glaring problems, almost as if the company is trying to wave a shiny new thing in front of your face to distract you from the dumpster fire burning directly behind you. There is a reason so many call it \"Broken by Daylight\" or \"Glitched by Daylight\", and it doesn't seem like it is getting any better.\n\nThe game is changed in ways that were never asked for by the community because it is apparently \"better\" for the game but it only seems to cause even more problems. The reporting system post match doesn't appear to be anything other than a complaint forum that looks like it goes unchecked like a bloated and overstuffed mailbox of a long since abandoned house still getting junk mail.\n\nInvolving people who hack the game, there doesn't appear to be a direct way to report your claim. One personal experience I had was involving someone using glaringly obvious speed hacks. Had video proof, the user ID, game time and such. Went to where we were supposed to turn in such complaints and proof involving such and was given a return email of apology from the customer service team stating that there was nothing they could do about people hacking the game. That they couldn't do anything about the individual hacking.\n\nThe community itself can be outright toxic, though not everyone is, there does seem to be a massive sense of entitlement on both sides of the playing field. Yes I play both Killer and Survivor and I'm calling both sides out on their B.S. as there is always an endless flow of complaint pages on forums; page after page of \"This ability is too OP, NERF IT because it's abusive to such and such.\". The Dev's do tend to give in after the constant badgering of such and do so to appease the masses rather than just focusing on making the game they want. It's a fan service game basically.\n\nWhy? Cause of money. The company wants the money, and I don't blame them for it. That's their job, their food, bills, etc. But still there is a line that needs to be drawn where the people need to either just live with the fact that their self entitlement isn't going to get them what they want and they can either F-Off and play something else, or they can shut up and play the game and let the Dev's make the game they wanted to from the begining. Let them focus on fixing the problem rather than trying to appease self-entitled Killers and Survivors.\n\nThis review seems excessively negative, I admit but I'm just telling it as it is. Things need fixed extremely, but the company is too focused on pandering to their player base just to keep the game afloat. Like giving a spoiled child everything they demand just to keep them from crying for years and then one day trying to set down rules and finding that the child isn't having any of it.\n\nSo you might question, if I find the game so bad, why am I playing it? Why do I still play it? Why do I stream it? There are plenty of big time streamers who have said they'd love to stream something other than DBD. That they hate the game ow and what it's become. But they do it because that is where their fan/viewer-base is and what they want to watch being played.\n\nNot to mention that for all its bad, there are good things about the game. The visuals, the unique characters, the thrill of getting out of a situation you know should have ended you whether it be because you were being outplayed by someone else or because you ran into a bug in the game that was seriously hindering your abilities as a player. We're human, we like to overcome challenges and that is what this game is. It's a brick wall we keep slamming into because at one point on impact, we noticed a crack; and another time we saw a brick move just slightly.\n\nBut yes, the game has it's positives that are most of the time, including in the heat of the moment, get drowned in the negatives. But it's simply that, I play as much as others even now because of the challenge and desire to overcome the odds that are stacked against us.\n\nBut there is going to come a point in time where something else is going to be released as the next big thing. Before then, DBD and its developing company need to make the choice of whether to let the game just sink away into the shadows of the bottomless ocean of the gaming world, or they need to plug up the holes in their life boat and do what they can to stay afloat if not going that extra mile to turn their game into something that will outshine every other game that tries to come against it.","timestamp_created":1615050883,"timestamp_updated":1615050883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87966379","author":{"steamid":"76561198229780444","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":64301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59037,"last_played":1635009219},"language":"english","review":"If ye dont like buggy games, I suggest ya turn around right now, cause this game is filled with em like Chernobyl is filled with radioactive cockroaches. \n\nThere is also a decent amount of desync now. Desync basically means the killer hitting ya when he shouldn't have hit ya, you are outside of range but get hit anyway.\n\nThis is a PvP game, with two sides: killer and survivor, whichever you pick, you will get to meet lots of toxic people on the other side of the coin, but there are also a lot of decent players.\n\nThe developer team is actively leading this game down the killer side path lately(march 2021 currently) and I am pretty pissed with that despite playing both sides(killer more lately). Also their balancing of new maps and reworked maps is as good as The Hag's ass.\n\nAs I said earlier the developers are leaning on the killer side so the new perks survivors get are so bad I wouldn't put em on unless someone paid me.

Il y a encore quelques mois je vous aurai dit que ce jeu était très bien, qu'il y avait quelque bug mais que ça aller en s'améliorant. J'ai commencé à y jouer il y a maintenant 3 ans environs. Après environ 1500 heures de jeu voilà mes conclusions.\n\nCe jeux avait tout le potentiel pour devenir un excellent jeu, un principe simple, des personnages interessant, des défis intressants. Cependant, le fait que les developpeurs se tape totalement de l'avis des joueurs donne a ce jeu un gout de cendre bien ecoeurant. Chaque mise à jour ajoute de nouveau bug et de nouvelles façon de jouer cancer. L'équilibre déjà fragile entre survivants et tueurs, déjà fragile depuis quelque mois, est maintenant clairement non respecté et ne va pas s'améliorer. Je joue autant suvivant que tueur, et bien que le jeu à très haut niveau favorise les survivants ce n'est qu'a haut niveau ... A niveau conventionnel, les tueurs vont plus vite que les survivants, leurs capacités sont bien supérieures à celles des survivants, chaque petit espoir que nous avions disparaisse petit a petit. La prochaine mise à jours, en plus de fournir à un tueur (qui semble déjà exagerément fort) trois capacités incroyablement forte, donnera un dernier coup de blues aux survivant en les privant de la protection qu'accordait la capacités \"coup décisif\". Tout le jeu pousse les tueurs ET les survivants à jouer cancer (camping, tunnel, slug, teabag etc.). \n\nPire encore, lorsque l'on soumet au dev une vidéo prouvant clairement qu'un joueur cheat (je vous met la vidéo plus bas pour preuve) ou que l'on propose une idée qui permettrait de supprimer ces comportement cancer, les développeurs vous répondent qu'ils s'en tapent sans la moindre la honte...\n\nDonc pour moi ce jeu avait un potentiel démentiel mais les choix des développeur m'ont dégoutés du jeu, passant d'une moyenne d'environ 200 heure de jeu par mois à tout juste une dizaine. Ce n'est pas sans une certaine mélancolie et sentiment de trahison de la part des développeur que je désinstalle ce jeu.\n\nP.S.: Voici [ url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93hrnBGWGT8\"]le lien[url] permettant de voir la vidéo d'un cheateur que j'ai prise et envoyé au developpeurs du jeu, sans que cela n'engendre aucun retour...","timestamp_created":1615046230,"timestamp_updated":1615046230,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.670415341854095459","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87962192","author":{"steamid":"76561199048237911","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":16372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":608,"last_played":1656614562},"language":"turkish","review":"sanaldan stalkı sevmem","timestamp_created":1615045941,"timestamp_updated":1615561087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627119958400726318","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87961423","author":{"steamid":"76561198859470334","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1994,"last_played":1621125319},"language":"english","review":"thought it was gonna be a horror game so far its a 50/50 weither im gonna shit my pants cause the killer has no heart beat or im gonna shit my pants cause oni's chasing me going mach 30","timestamp_created":1615045122,"timestamp_updated":1615045122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87961327","author":{"steamid":"76561198819322824","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":8857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1644073080},"language":"russian","review":"ДА\n","timestamp_created":1615045018,"timestamp_updated":1615045018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497737526893615723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87960712","author":{"steamid":"76561199032405472","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3121,"last_played":1626931523},"language":"schinese","review":"小号玩了52个小时，说明我二，所以才会被黎明杀机pua，那种你根本无法想象这游戏自己bug把人整掉线了还要算玩家拔了然后禁赛，那种无语","timestamp_created":1615044396,"timestamp_updated":1615044396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534645795822143555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87960030","author":{"steamid":"76561198606858559","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3008,"last_played":1659025740},"language":"russian","review":"Играют одни токсики.Баланс трещит по швам.Игра во👍","timestamp_created":1615043656,"timestamp_updated":1640440533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87958596","author":{"steamid":"76561198114596693","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1647672025},"language":"schinese","review":"好 就是匹配不到","timestamp_created":1615042106,"timestamp_updated":1615042106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523445487022399902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87958261","author":{"steamid":"76561199067034516","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18670,"last_played":1628251206},"language":"russian","review":"пиздататая параша в которой хиты проходят за метр.

I have been watching this game since way before it went on console and have played hundreds of hours (on console) and now that i have a PC It's just better. Now i know that there are some pretty bad problems with this game but i have faith in it since this is just a great game to play with friends and even by yourself with some super creative killers. \nI would say the worst part about this game is the load times, they can honestly be a mood killer especially with friends that don't have the greatest patience and some player can be more toxic than actual poison. IMO i think the good out ways the bad and i hope it continues grow and make the game even more fun for killer and survivors alike.\n\nP.S.
