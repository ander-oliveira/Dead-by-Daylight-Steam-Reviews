Торренты.\n2. Кемперство.\n3. Троллинг.\n4. Комьюнити.\nЭти четыре основные причины горение моей жoпы, и в следствии, задниц адекватных игроков.\nЧто же не так с этой игрой? И что за необоснованные причины? Я постараюсь объяснить.\n1. Торренты: достаточно редкое явление в данной игре, но все же это происходит, и от этого знатно полыхает.\nСуть в том, что хостом игры является маньяк, на нем держится лобби и вся игра, и если с его инетом что то случится, это так же случится и со всеми сурвами, и маньяк может способствовать этому, например, включая торренты и начиная раздавать/качать что либо, как итог, четыре горелой задницы и слитая (в 90% случаях) игра.\n2. Кемперство: суть в защите одного повешенного сурва, достаточно распространенное явление на ранних рангах (20-10 ранги), но на более высоких рангах это контрят, но все же находятся индивиды, сидящие на первых рангах, которые берут буббу(Leather Face), и начинают кемпить. Как итог, одна взорванная задница обеспечена. А может и больше, если сурвы нубы.\n3. Троллинг: я думаю, тут все понятно, троллинг происходит как со стороны сурвов, так и со стороны маньяка, различные блоки, приседания, и прочее, все это бесит, заставляя жoпу дымится.\n4. Комьюнити: около 70% \"Тим\" в дбд, используют 4 топовых фанарика, не давая и шанса взять сурва в руки, и конечно, в конце матча, даже если ты новичок не умеющий играть в игру, они напишут, какой ты плохой человек, и что тебе нужно выпилиться. И конечно жи удалить игру. Как итог, взорванная жoпа маньяка, или лив во время игры.\nВ итоге, мы получаем игру, в который каждый человек пытается взорвать жoпу другому человеку, если вы человек, получающий удовольствие от троллинга, рекомендую вам эту игру, ну, а другим людям, я рекомендую дс 3, там хоть расслабиться можно.\nP.s.

В любом случае играя за выжевшего вы встретите кучу проблем. Например лагающий маньяк (ещё хуже абузер) это просто ужас, очень часто это любители деревенщины потому что под лагами от него невозможно увернуться. Либо у вас команда ссыкливых идиотов, которые убегают если сердце хоть на пол секунды забьется. Им похрен если вы его снимете с крюка, он никогда не спасет вас. Отдельно стоит упомянуть кемперов (не тех которые патрулируют), ведь ему совершенно похрену на победу, на смысл игры, он просто встанет и будет ждать пока его не придут спасать. Есть еще тролли и засланцы со стороны маньяка, которые дают инфу и всячески мешают играть.\n А если вы хотите мяса можете взять маньяка. Но на маньяке пока не получите хоть какие-то перки, выйгрывать вообще невозможно ( но при наличии прямых рук, это не проблема). Выбор маньяков довольно большой, поэтому геймплей можно назвать разнообразным.

Although this is coming from someone who sits around the rank 15-20 mark in the game (low end for people who don't know the game).\n\nFrom what I've seen though, there are some toxic survivors who t-bag and pallet loop for days like it's skill when it's not.

Well as the killer its PVP. you're an unstoppa-....an EASILY STOPPABLE killer.  with a \"power\" which the shit way killers are designed. you almost 100% of the time NEED the power to even get a survivor.  and as its 1v4 any perk you put on is just to bandaid how OP and broken survivor perks are. so you stand a chance. \n\nyour only luck in catching them is if they fuck up. the game is supposed to be balanced so 2 get away and 2 are sacrificed. which leads me to pips and resets. \n\n-- \n\nonline matchmaking works on a ranking system ( PFFFFFFT NO IT DOESNT) so you get matched with people of your rank and skill level ( PFFFFFFFFFFT IT DOESNT WORK THAT WAY ) and every month on the 13th day it resets everyone to rank 20. so you have pro's playing with noobs...makes no sense. so you might be a BRAND new killer not even 30 mins in the game. and be matched up with someone who's a rank 1 top MLG player survivor who can troll you and run you around with broken perks. brand new parts that fix gens in literally seconds. and OP flashlights. (even after the rework) this works both ways against survivors as well \n\n-- \n\nbecuase its a \"competative\" game. and the survivors are so op. the community is about as toxic as a inbred trailer park's septic tank. \ntheres A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of toxic survivors. if you even so much as LOOK at a survivor RIGHT after hooking them. you're camping. \nif you so much as do ANYTHING to stop the survivors from getting blood points and stop them from escaping with their friends ( ill get to that later) you're the most horrible killer and you're being reported. ( which is about as useful as writeup's in factory jobs. useless)\n\n--\n\nalso. BUGS OUT THE FAHKIN ASS. and like EA. instead of fixing the bugs. they release more DLC. now. heres the hypocrisy. \n\nif its a bug that hurts the survivors - i.e. medkits being used FULLY after not being healed by right clicking once. \nits fixed fucking asapity like. like legit it was fixed in 1 hour. \n\nif its a bug that helps survivors. - i.e. the map glitch on the asylum that makes survivors unable to be hit or picked up \n....still waiting on that fix. its been a year + ?\n\n--\n\nalso. to go with the whole \" rank\" thing. you can completely BS the ranks. and play a \"survive with friends\" game. where you can link up with your friends on steam. no matter WHAT rank. and go up against a brand new killer and fuck him over 5 ways to sunday or you can just be their crutch. sounds fun right ? also you can use voice chat this way :D and REALLY screw over the killer.\n\n--\nsome thoughts\n\ni said alot of negative things. and ill say it. i fucking hate this game at times. but. the IDEA of the game is what brings me back. its a great IDEA. if only the dev's weren't survivor mains ( inb4 they say we play both[ which hurrhurr. most people do. but its the main part thats important and the ratio]) and heavily biased against only half of the game. \n\nif you dont support your killers. no one will play them ( Kinda like whats happening now). or if you nerf killers to the ground so hard. all they're gonna do is camp because thats the only way to lock something in anymore. and then no one will play and then the game will die.\n\nthis games play statistics literally lost 7% OVER NIGHT because they fucked over the killers so bad one time they literally just stopped playing. and then they had to patch it or lose anyone playing killer.  ( also. just because someone plays the killer doesnt mean they're a \" bad guy\" when i play killer i like to play freddy. why? CUASE I LIKE FREDDY. idgaf about killing people. ususally ill let them go if they're nice. I DONT CARE ABOUT POINTS. i like the GAME. or rather the idea. stop treating people who play killers like bad people)\n\n-- \n\nnow then.  most of this sounds like i play killer main...............ehhh i used to. i used to play straight up nothing but killer. do you know why i stopped? BECAUSE playing killer fucking sucks. you're treated like shit for being \" the bad guy\" . you have barely any chance to get a surv if they use OP perks. and if you're playing a SWF you get reported for not letting everyone get away. \n\nbut after playing survivor. im also disappointed. its TOO easy. you can literally dick over the killer in SOOOOOOOOO many ways. im not even afraid of the killer. the killer is afraid of ME if i have a flashlight.  im sorry but isnt that ass fucking backwards. im up against a \" unstoppable monster of a killer\" and he's turning and running away from me............................\n\ndevs fix the killers. stop making them pansies. and take the competative edge out of it. theres no reason for it. \n\n--\n\nScore\n\nPlaying as a survivor : 7/10 too easy but could be good if killer was actually scary. can get boring in some parts if killer doesnt EVER find you or even come close to you\nPlaying as a killer : 4/10 too stressful even when you're not taking seriously or just goofing off. you get bullied. beaten. and scared. quite literally in game and out of game mentally. \n\nWould i recommend? ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\nif you want a game to play with friends and troll? BOY HOWDY DO I HAVE THE PERFECT GAME FOR YOU\nIf you want to play as your favorite movie killer or someone new and experiance what thats like? Go somewhere else. you'll feel like a goddamn carebare trying to give hugs in this game as the killer\n\nas again for recommending it? for 20$? fuuuuuuuck no. not worth it. for 10? deffinately worth the trauma. for 5$ its a steal just for the idea alone. so....yes if on sale. no if not on sale. and i know the xmas sale is comming up so....yes","timestamp_created":1513735128,"timestamp_updated":1513735891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38442936","author":{"steamid":"76561198345233109","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1576716543},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo","timestamp_created":1513733970,"timestamp_updated":1513733970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38442809","author":{"steamid":"76561198433450505","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1743,"last_played":1515128035},"language":"schinese","review":"很欢乐的一款游戏(滑稽)","timestamp_created":1513733423,"timestamp_updated":1513733423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509900987148284912","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38442546","author":{"steamid":"76561198427395395","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13197,"last_played":1589646824},"language":"english","review":"Just one thing: Pretty good job so far,indeed.","timestamp_created":1513732218,"timestamp_updated":1513732218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38442537","author":{"steamid":"76561198287666681","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2271,"last_played":1600577989},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo.","timestamp_created":1513732180,"timestamp_updated":1513732180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38442340","author":{"steamid":"76561198438435326","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":48832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6397,"last_played":1652846715},"language":"koreana","review":"갓ㅡ겜","timestamp_created":1513731343,"timestamp_updated":1513731343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38442074","author":{"steamid":"76561198275837074","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1585747113},"language":"thai","review":"Ok very good","timestamp_created":1513730131,"timestamp_updated":1513730131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38441568","author":{"steamid":"76561198322555523","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5549,"last_played":1646931814},"language":"polish","review":"Zaj3bist3*","timestamp_created":1513728118,"timestamp_updated":1513728118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38441544","author":{"steamid":"76561198106547422","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21250,"last_played":1635663443},"language":"english","review":"Good game!
