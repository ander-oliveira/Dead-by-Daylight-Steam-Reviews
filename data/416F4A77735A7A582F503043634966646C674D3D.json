Соответственно про старых маньяков, которые не соответствуют новым стандартам меты, особенно пеших м1 можно забыть, в связи с появлением нового прекрасного перка на бесконечный хилящий тотем, против которого особенно кайфово играть на многоуровневых картах. Сурвы с аптечкой хилятся секунд за 6-8, а всё потому что ленивые жопы БХВР вместо капа скорости хила делают новые свитеры за золотые клетки. Кому нужно переделывать старых маньяков и делать баланс, приблизив соло сурвов по силе к уровню пати выдав им хотя бы перк киндред по дефолту. Но нет, это денег им не приносит.\nХеровая оптимизация. При том, что игра выглядит как мыльная дрисня, на некоторых картах она умудряется пролагивать на далеко не самых старых машинах (привет РПД).\nТоксичное коммьюнити. Разработчики, которые вместо переработки механик повешений и вместе с ней туннеля и кемпа, так долго и так сильно издевались над игроками, что тем стало совсем плохо, и они изливают свою желчь друг на друга, купаясь в ней.\nЧитеры, которые безнаказанно могут делать всё, что захотят. При этом, если читер будет использовать читы на другом, невинном игроке, например хилить его, и это попадёт на видео, его могут забанить. А настоящие читеры, которые с приходом игры в эпике наклепали себе бесплатных акков, будут развлекаться дальше.\nБольшинство перков как у маньяка так и у сурва бесполезны, по большей части вы будете видеть одни и те же 5-6 перков на протяжении всей игры на хай ммр.\nРазработчики уже давно выпускают старых киллеров под видом новых, добавляя им антилуп механики, у них либо закончилась фантазия, либо им просто лень напрягаться, ведь люди и так схавают. Новых механик практически не появляется, за редким исключением (мор, зомби).\nНовый матчмейкинг, при котором выиграв пару каток за мана вы будете встречать исключительно фул премейды с дискордом, заводящие все генераторы 4-5 минут, и вам нужно будет очень сильно потеть, чтобы хоть что-то им противопоставить. Аналогично за сурвов, сбежав несколько каток, вы будете встречать одних и тех же 3-5 манов и не дай бог вы будете играть в соло, игра накинет вам челов, которые упадут за 5 секунд и ливнут, либо выпилятся на крюке.","timestamp_created":1640602126,"timestamp_updated":1640602126,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526875674724578857","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106649568","author":{"steamid":"76561199057687236","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":169,"playtime_at_review":31857,"last_played":1660014731},"language":"koreana","review":"갓겜 500시간만 하면 할만해짐ㅋㅋ","timestamp_created":1640601960,"timestamp_updated":1640601960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599007070064544678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106649308","author":{"steamid":"76561198185453811","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":57951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54618,"last_played":1658749273},"language":"schinese","review":"挺好玩了，玩了很多年了，虽然时长只有不到一千，但是也是见证了DBD机的变迁\n新月一烧，我立刻开始逛大街了/偷笑\n黎明杀机真的很厉害，可以上分为目的，整活为目的，活着出去为目的，现在也联动了越来越多的DLC，放在几年前我们老玩家简直是不敢想的。\n最后说一句，欢迎萌新点我陪玩，手把手教，血点大大的多！快乐大大的多！","timestamp_created":1640601599,"timestamp_updated":1640601599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106648942","author":{"steamid":"76561198275477180","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":50044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":43517,"last_played":1660073470},"language":"spanish","review":"Tampoco tengo mucho que decir, todo el mundo conoce ya el DBD y sabe que es tremendo juegazo.

game is pain when you start playing it killer is always faster and you just don't know how to loop you are sad first 400H bcs you dont even have good perks after that the game starts to be fun for like 200H still talking about survivor you rape killer like a pro rank 1 ez.... oh no now there is good killer and you camped palette like everyone on rank 1 killer is going to try hard like a total bitch and tunnel your ass out (don't forget to complain at the endgame chat) after this you want to fucking die and have a refund on the other side when you start playing killer first 200H you are a god survivor run into walls don't do generators you are your own king however at rank 12+ things get really stupid generators are done in first 3min in a game unless you have the best gen build something like pop ruin and stuff so you are always limited to 1 build otherwise your ass is going to be crushed toxic survivors who got carried by a gen speed are now in your steam profile chat typing that you are noob after this you want to die again after this you play nurse or spirit or something that is not total shit you only know that 1 killer you maxed him up you are pro now are you able to defend those generators? HAHAHAHHA no.... speaking of maps there are some maps like hadonfield that you just load in a game and you go make some coffee or dinner playing hadonfield with toxic survivors with best windows opened will give you brutal depression and can lead to massive alcoholism so in conclusion playing as survivor is unfun while killers want to win so hard and playing as killer is causing depression

Personally, not the biggest fan of playing killer but survivor I could do all day. Although, some things like skin options I feel are a bit lacking on some of the characters. It can be difficult to build up iridescent shards for some people as well, but so far having to actually grind a bit and work to get these types of things can really add to the game and I find it enjoyable and rewarding.

I used to be a FPS person only for multiplayer.  This is in fact my favorite multiplayer game.  For all it's flaws it serves up something wholly unique.  The Additional characters are fairly priced.  The cosmetics are honestly pretty top tier compared to other games I've played.  I don't play super meta killers or survivor loadouts and still have fun.  If you can get some friends together it's great as a survivor.  If you can't you can always play killer.  I do think it is helpful to have someone to tutor you or to watch some youtube videos because the systems are surprisingly deep for a gameplay loop that would otherwise be repetitive.\n\nAt the time of this review I have 110 hours, thats been about a month of playing, my highest rank so far being Gold II\n\nEdit: 450 hours in.\n\nThis game is still this game.  Somehow entertaining.  Always a good fallback.  Will probably continue to be so until hour 1000.  As far as the company running it BHVR seems like they are being more aware.  Doing stuff like the MMR tests.  As always there are balance issues the game isn't perfect.  But that being said it remains fun.","timestamp_created":1640581462,"timestamp_updated":1652380391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106634316","author":{"steamid":"76561198351336350","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3924,"last_played":1642828170},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, can get toxic.

I even got friends and family members to buy it in an effort to make it more enjoyable. The killers can just guard the area where they hook a player and repeatedly attack you to make you die faster. The scratch marks are a very unfair advantage as even if you get away the killer can still locate you. The scratch marks take a very long time to disappear. Once two people die, the game is pretty much over. I like a challenging game, don't get me wrong, it's just that this game seems designed with a primary focus on making it enjoyable for the killers. The killers move at a faster rate than the players and their attacks are very ranged, even melee attacks. They added in that you can't vault repeatedly through the same window but the killer can guard the area where you are hooked indefinitely. Some killers can set traps right next to the hook zone so other players can't get to you unless they stop and try do deactivate them which doesn't seem like an issue but it is time consuming and the killer can guard the area. Fixing the generators takes way too long and there are way too many skill checks while you are doing it. I could go on and on but you don't want to spend 2 hours reading.
