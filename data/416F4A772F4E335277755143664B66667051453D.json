Paga por la cuenta que te trae, como mínimo. Si juegas como Killer ten clarísimo que sin Ruina y Barbacoa no vas a poder jugar en condiciones y más si eres nuevo. Son Habilidades de Personajes de DLCs de pago que no vienen con el juego, asi que añade al precio del juego de 8-10€ y algo muy parecido con las Perks Decentes de Superviviente, así que mucho ojo.\n\n-ALGO IMPORTANTE: Premades y Balanceo de Mecánicas del Juego. Jugar hoy día como ASESINO es saber que vas a PERDER EL 80% LARGO DE PARTIDAS sin poder hacer nada para cambiarlo. En el momento que subes levemente de Rango y hay un mínimo Teamplay entre los Supervivientes estas perdido y si juegas contra PREMADES hacen lo que les sale de los cojones, ellos te acosan a ti en vez de tú a ellos... O solucionan ya esto o la gente no jugara como Asesino y el juego se extinguirá. (Y con razón)\n\nPor otra parte, juego está muy bien y da para echarle muchas horas, pero hay cosas que arruinan la experiencia de juego brutalmente y deben solucionarse para que este juego sea recomendable de comprar:\n\n- Balanceo y Smurfers: El sistema de Balanceo de partidas es sencillamente inexistente/ineficaz casi por completo. En baremo aproximadamente 3/10 de partidas jugadas han sido justas, el resto desbalanceadas y muchas de las mismas de vergüenza ajena.\n\n- Campeo y Tuneleo: Consecuencia directa del Balance nefasto del juego, los Killers campean a los Supervivientes porque no les queda otra opción si esperan tener una partida justa. Esto esta derivando a su vez en una Comunidad más tóxica por cada dia que pasa\n\nHasta que esto no se solucione no recomiendaria la compra de este juego y muchisimo menos si no esta de oferta.","timestamp_created":1531313308,"timestamp_updated":1537808686,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504761934280395508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43463847","author":{"steamid":"76561198404547603","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3933,"last_played":1654547576},"language":"french","review":"Dead By Dailight est un très bon jeu ,il y a beaucoup de choix dans les personnages ce qui rends la façon de jouer intéréssante.
