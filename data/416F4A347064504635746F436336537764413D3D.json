The customization trees for the killers and survivors is great, tons of options to help you play just the way you want. One problem with the game is that it can be difficult to find a match if you party up with people (que times as solo is almost instant whereas with a group of 3 or 4 you might be waiting over 5 minutes). Another problem is the fact that it seems the skillchecks for performing tasks don't always register, but it seems like it has gotten much better. Besides those two flaws I would give this game an 8/10 and highly recommend it if you wish to have some scares and some fun with your friends because nothing is better than teaming up to escape.

Do NOT support this pathetic excuse for a company.\n\n1) They do NOT care about their fan base at all. Toxicity and harassment run rampent and every three matches, someone is going to say something rude or nasty in end game chat. The developers have removed, REMOVED, their report system outside of the game recently, and when sent an email about severe harassment and threats, they replied saying to use their in-game report system, which is woefully incomplete and does nothing to actually report anything. \n\n2) Toxicity on both sides is vicious, with killers actively seeking out specific survivors over and over again to farm and slug, while survivors harass and sandbag killers into just giving up. It's to the point that a tunneled survivor (constantly chased, downed, and hooked no matter how many other survivors try to intervene) will disconnect and lose rank rather than deal with it. Killers that are constantly flash light stunned by toxic survive with friends groups will stop altogether and disconnect, costing everyone the match rather than put up with the harassment (not that I blame them.)\n\n3)The devs focus more on putting out content rather than fixing in-game bugs. The audio is still jacked up on several maps,  killers and survivors alike get stuck in small places and there are several spots where a survivor can stand and not get hit by the killer (exploits.) This is even worse for console players who can't even play some matches the bugs are so bad, and aren't given access to any content on the pre-specified release date. Console players are almost completely ignored in official forums as well when reporting problems. On top of all of this, instead of fixing these bugs and several others, the devs are now focusing on nerfing several perks for survivors and buffing several for killers.\n\n4) Bringing us to perks. There are several perks that are outright broken. Starting with perks, they are nerfing speed perks for survivors, while killers continue to speed up as the chase continues. This means that rather then having a reliable perk to escape the killer with, they are nerfing it while leaving the killer with an already overly inflated advantage. Now, don't get me wrong, a fantastic player can keep a killer busy long enough for their speed perk (there are only three) to kick back in. But killers, as the chase goes on with the same survivor, will steadily pick up speed to catch that survivor. They are also nerfing a skill that allows a survivor, if they can hit a very tiny skill check, instantly escape from the killers grasp. They can only do it once, yes once, a match. The devs have decided it is too over powered and are nerfing it so that it only temporarily stuns the killer rather than granting a survivor immediate escape.\n\n5) Gameplay overall is fun, and the concept is one of a kind, but there is very little variation from match to match, and the new map is a literal reskin of an already existing one. The tournament with a $5,000 cash prize was a sh**show with poorly hired and casted ESport commentators, very minimal and lacking rules that changed TWICE during the actual tournament, and groups from across the globe paired against one another for laggy, glitchy matches that couldn't be watched, much less judged. \n\n6) Finally, the devs themselves. They are unprofessional, and I have nothing good to say about most of them. The game director himself can take no constructive critisicm what-so-ever, and when asked whether or not he was going to have his devs fix a simple game mechanic that was literally gamebreaking, he told people on a live stream to go play Civ V if they were going to complain. He has thrown similar tantrums on two other live streams, being completely unprofessional and nasty to genuinely curious and outright rude and trolly viewers alike. \n\nIf you've gotten this far, good for you. Do not waste your money on this sh**show of a game. Free is too costly for the wreck this has become. I especially don't reccomend it for people with anxiety or depression because the toxicity is only going to make it worse. I have been told on two seperate occasions to \"go die of cancer/aids.\" Reported both of those people and have seen them multiple times since.  \n\nIt is worth no ones time or money.","timestamp_created":1489527706,"timestamp_updated":1529831108,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30514833","author":{"steamid":"76561198306058170","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":79364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39532,"last_played":1654871171},"language":"russian","review":"10 Дуайтов из 10. ;D","timestamp_created":1489526460,"timestamp_updated":1489526460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500263094902038574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30514516","author":{"steamid":"76561198141609129","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3902,"last_played":1596546696},"language":"german","review":"Spielen als Singelplayer ist kein Problem, man findet immer eine Lobby schnell.

Да, новые фишечки, новые персонажи, варианты убийства, способности, перки, карты и так далее, но геймплей остается все одним и тем же. Подобных игр, как эта не так много или успеха не возымели, в отличии от сего чуда. Проиграв в нее очень много времени, я увидел и испытал достаточно. Хочу сказать, что необходимое мне разнообразие геймплея, которое могли добавить, попросту не хватает. Игре уже хрен знает сколько лет пробыла на рынке, и меня удивляет, что игроки не убавляются. Коммьюнити становится только больше. Добавили ранги, игроков оценивают по скиллу. Игра пошла не по той степи, по которой она начинала, а превратилась в компетитив.
