complaint about the PC Port / Spanish and EnglishI tried several times to like this game but I did not succeed, 4 years ago it came out and they still do not fix the problems that the PC version has, forced borderless window fullscreen, forced vsync (deactivating it through the game files does not work, since when running on borderless windows, windows 10 activates its own vsync so you still have input lag anyway), no video options (only high medium low), can't change the resolution, bugs everywhere, it happened to me 15 times I approach a stone and get stuck with the ground (fixed in the last patch), since the game is in borderless window and not fullscreen when you need to click to fix an engine or rescue a partner, you are clicking the windows desktop, not the game, so it does not register any action (if you want to avoid that use gamepad), I died like 10 times because of the windows I don't know why but when you jump over them and get away from them the murderer can still hit you, I don't know if it's a ping or hitbox problem, I got tired, I'll only play it for my friends, but I don't enjoy it, I won't change the review until they fix these problemsEdit: The anticheat already kick me from 5 games, telling me that some file got broken and the game insta-close, and sometimes trying to open the game the anticheat don't open it because for some random reasons 4 files got broken, and then i have to verify the files for a 3 GB download for 4 bad files.Edit2: Since the last update it does not stop kicking me from the groups of my friends saying that there was a connection problem. Edit3: the game keeps broken the files and make it quit from the games and the menu, i can't play anymore, have to verify the files to fix it.Edit4: okay, im done im uninstalling the game, i dont want to play this anymore, if was for me il get it out of my library to never see it again, i got hit through a pallet because the hitbox and lag compensation is awful, bye DBD i wish i never buy you. Pequeña queja sobre el Port de PC / Español e Inglesintenté varias veces que este juego me guste pero no lo logré, hace 4 años que salio y aun no arreglan los problemas que tiene la version de PC, el juego se ejecuta en ventana completa sin bordes de manera forzada, vsync forzado (desactivarlo a travez de los archivos del juego no sirve, ya que al ejecutarse en ventana completa sin bordes, windows 10 activa su propio vsync asi que sigues con input lag de todas maneras), sin opciones de video (solo alto medio bajo), no se puede cambiar la resolucion, bugs por todas partes, me pasó 15 veces que me acerco a una piedra y quedo bugeado con el piso (arreglado en el ultimo parche), ya que el juego está en ventana completa y no pantalla completa cuando necesitas hacer click para arreglar un motor o rescatar a un compañero, estas clickeando el escritorio de windows, no el juego, asi que no registra ninguna accion (si quieren evitar eso usen gamepad), me morí como 10 veces por culpa de las ventanas que no se por que pero al saltarlas y alejarte de ellas el asesino aun puede pegarte, no se si es un problema de ping o de hitbox, me cansé, solo lo jugaré por mis amigos, pero no lo disfruto, no cambiaré la review hasta que arreglen estos problemasEdit: El anticheat ya me kickeó de 5 partidas, diciendome que algun archivo se rompió y el juego se cierra instantaneamente, algunas veces al intentar abrir el juego el anticheat no me permite abrir el juego por la misma razon, archivos rotos, al verificarlos encuentra 4 archivos rotos y debo hacer una descarga de 3 GB.Edit2: desde la ultima update no para de kickearme de los grupos de mis amigos diciendo que hubo un problema de conexion. Edit3:el juego sigue rompiendo los archivos, en la ultima update tuve que verificar cache ya que el juego se me cerraba diciendo que los archivos estaban rotos, cerrandose en el menu, en el juego, no podia jugar. Edit4: Listo me cansé, lo voy a desinstalar, no lo quiero jugar mas, si fuera por mi lo sacaria de mi libreria para no verlo nunca mas, me golpearon a travez de un palet, el hitbox es una porqueria y jugar con otras personas que tiene ping es aun peor, si te toca un asesino con ping, salí de la partida la vas a pasar muy mal, adios DBD ojala no te hubiera comprado nunca.","timestamp_created":1597546208,"timestamp_updated":1604780090,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591536760330200195","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74379609","author":{"steamid":"76561198128380470","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":3910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1504,"last_played":1642124052},"language":"english","review":"get claudette to level 40 then farm bloodpoints\n12/10\nseriously, this game is excellent as killer OR survivor. it's a total blast, highly recommend with friends.","timestamp_created":1597544382,"timestamp_updated":1597544490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74379110","author":{"steamid":"76561198020046281","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":37711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13820,"last_played":1658842417},"language":"french","review":"Bon jeu, avec ses bugs (c'est normal), mais plutôt bien équilibré.","timestamp_created":1597543510,"timestamp_updated":1597543510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74378690","author":{"steamid":"76561198344965180","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1598762691},"language":"english","review":"very nce","timestamp_created":1597542734,"timestamp_updated":1597542734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74378616","author":{"steamid":"76561198981088777","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":21626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14595,"last_played":1619337757},"language":"schinese","review":"现在我的脑子里只有一件事，那就是贴膜","timestamp_created":1597542598,"timestamp_updated":1597542598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74378541","author":{"steamid":"76561198985637730","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1594010864},"language":"schinese","review":"好","timestamp_created":1597542481,"timestamp_updated":1597542481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74378439","author":{"steamid":"76561198188223451","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":27521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12778,"last_played":1658891112},"language":"english","review":"Kool movement","timestamp_created":1597542253,"timestamp_updated":1597542253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74378424","author":{"steamid":"76561199045026821","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1625708469},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy entretenido","timestamp_created":1597542234,"timestamp_updated":1597542234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74378412","author":{"steamid":"76561198370713196","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":46506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3392,"playtime_at_review":9623,"last_played":1660604833},"language":"english","review":"This game is filled with Toxic people And when they are confronted about it they go. \"i wasn't camping, I wasn't Tunneling\" Like if the killers Realized that doing it really kills the game for others then game would have more fun.

The match making was really annoying but overall a bearable and fun experience. So you might ask why am I giving this a negative review. The answer is unfortunately something that should've been a positive but after seeing it in action, I've come to realize that it has greatly harmed the community. I am of course talking about cross platform play. Here is a list of things that has happened to literally myself and every single one of my friends (there's 50 of us) since the cross platform update.\n\n1. Killer constantly camps harder than I've ever seen a PC player do and I've been playing this game since its release. \n\n2. Killer constantly tunnels the entire game, just to camp them when they finally have their target downed. They will even go as far as looking for that specific person even if they lose them.\n\n3. Killer is easily juked.\n\n4. Survivors body blocking survivors.\n\n5. Survivors exposing players they know are in a locker to the killer.\n\n6. Unhooking survivors when the killer is 2 meters away. (acting like they'll maintain social distance)\n\n7. Survivors disconnecting as soon as the killer finds them or puts them in the dying state.\n\n8. Killer disconnecting as soon as there are 2 generators left and no one's been hooked.\n\n9. Players running and vaulting fast thus alerting the killer.\n\n\n\nThis has been happening almost every single game ever since the update. It's to the point where we can predict without even seeing the symbol above their names who is playing on console and who is playing on PC. The best way to describe how it feels is like playing with a bunch of children who are too young to play this game, which knowing consoles, this may very well be the case.\n\nI have nothing against console players and was originally super hyped about this update but ever since it's dropped, it has been a horrible gaming experience. It's so rare for me to even get out of a game alive now because I'm too busy trying to save the other survivors(who are console players) and I end up dying myself. I'm a rank 3 survivor and have been stuck at rank 9 since the update. It's horrible.\n\nI honestly think that this update should be revoked and they should keep the platforms separate. Hopefully they do something to fix this.\n\n\nEDIT\n\nYou can turn off crossplay.

Pode ser um bug ou sei lá mas é bem chato isso.....","timestamp_created":1597523922,"timestamp_updated":1597523922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74367742","author":{"steamid":"76561197999961897","num_games_owned":1243,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":78023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1446,"playtime_at_review":29856,"last_played":1660508635},"language":"english","review":"This game still sucks","timestamp_created":1597523369,"timestamp_updated":1657758634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74367563","author":{"steamid":"76561198042214126","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"playtime_at_review":8842,"last_played":1660586146},"language":"english","review":"a pretty good job so far","timestamp_created":1597523122,"timestamp_updated":1597523122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74367398","author":{"steamid":"76561198909283797","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":59579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":445,"playtime_at_review":6385,"last_played":1660173724},"language":"english","review":"This game is an absolute blast to play!

It's a bit on the expensive side but if you enjoy this type of game I would 100% recommend. It's really fun to play with friends and is just an amazing game all around with interesting maps, lots of different options for skins, exciting gameplay and much more. I never really get bored of this game, it's just such a great game, probably one of my favourites.
