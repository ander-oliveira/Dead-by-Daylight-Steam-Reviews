When you're sneaking through the thick grass that moves when you crouch through it, and you hear your heartbeat (in-game) rise, you will feel that pressure and anxiety induced by the killer yourself. As the killer, the atmosphere changes due to tunnel vision of the first person view, making stalking and ultimately killing a thrilling hunt.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nIt is hard to comment on the balance of the 4v1 so soon after release. \nThe survivors are challenged with fixing the generators in order to open the electric powered fence to freedom, while escaping the grasp of the killer. The killer's goal is to slash his four victims twice, and then carrying them to sacrificial poles spread throughout the level. The game (and it's balance) largely depends on what the remaining 3 survivors are doing during the time that the killer is  hunting one of them. If they act smart and fix generators during that time, balance will be in favour of the survivors (numbers game). If they however slack, the killer's chances will grow with every survivor that is impaled. This is because a set number of generators must be activated before the gate can be opened, making a sole survivor's chances very slim.\n\nThe main problem lies within the game's ranking system. Both the survivors and the killer benefit greatly and perhaps [i] only [/i] by lenghty games. As it is now, you can kill all 4 survivors within 2 minutes of a game (truly outplaying them) and lose a rank because you did not score enough points. This means that winning or losing a game is not a requirement for gaining or losing rank, which in essence can be good, but not the way it's implemented currently.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\nI think that the game as it is makes for a thrilling and addicting experience. The minor bugs and/or ranking issues are things that can be dealt with easily within the first few weeks so I'm not worried there. If you have the $$ (18 euro) around, don't hesitate to buy and try this wonderful game.","timestamp_created":1466066826,"timestamp_updated":1466067076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23593050","author":{"steamid":"76561198083117557","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1490619562},"language":"english","review":"Get a party system for fukng nigahs sake, 99% of bad reviews are because of no party system, you seeing a patern here?","timestamp_created":1466066773,"timestamp_updated":1466066773,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456271588802337646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23593041","author":{"steamid":"76561198096926808","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":51783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1658354915},"language":"russian","review":"Игра заставляет по нервничать , особенно когда ты в напряженке пытаешься разглядеть убийцу в далеке и тут бац , чуть не  обделываешься когда на твоем обзоре с дерева спрыгивает белка!

Overall the concept is great. The feeling of being in a Friday the 13th-esque game will make this a must for when anyone busts out their horror movie and game binge in October. The tutorials covered very basic subjects about the game and seemed to have missed an opportunity to explain the strategy required for higher levels in the bloodweb. Although it has a manual that links you to a more informative webpage, it seems a more thorough coverage of all the mechanics in the game with well flushed vids.\n\nThe lobby still needs tweaking due to all the players that drop and cause the lobby to break. It has been known to just sit in a lobby and have people pop in and out over a 10-15min wait. Not sure if this is due to very impatient people or unstable server connections.\n\nNot sure how I feel about the bloodpoint mechanics yet. Some games there is a real challenge between teams and you can score a good chunk of change, sometimes roughly evenly for everyone. In some other games I would be able to catch 2-3 players and hook them within 2-5 mins of the game, play cat-and-mouse with the 3rd or last man just to have them camp the hatch and end up with a lemons worth of points while the last survivor leaves loaded.\n\nI really like the character progression and ranking system, so much so that it was rough to continue playing in the beta due to the lvl 6 cap. Which tells me that even if i were to reach an amazing rank i would not see the benefit so much if this resets every month. At that point you would really need other friends to play this to continue on. I feel that this is the problem with the 4v1 game genre as no one dev team that i know of really apply a solo campaign. Its nice that they left some lore on their webpage and in bits and pieces throughout the bloodweb, but where is the emersion in that?

Kind of game you could play for hours, or hop on for like thirty minutes\n-Character designs are great, think everyone looks really cool\n-Great atmosphere and an ambiguous supernatural mythology to it\n\nCons\n-A bit repetitive (but it's fun repetitive so I don't mind too much)\n-Wraith is an OP piece of garbage, don't let anyone tell you otherwise; if they are defending Wraith, they're probably the kind of chump to use Wraith and only Wraith\n-The blood web leveling system seems not totally thought out. Things you gain are random which adds some variety to the mix, but it doesn't feel like you can really BUILD a class like the Dev Diary videos claimed, you more just get what you get in a hodgepodge sort of jumbled class\n-Apparently there are already pathetic hack-gamers who have no real talent and apparently only find fun in something when they're ruining it for everyone else.\n\nOverall: 20 bucks?

It has a few balancing issues but that's expected from a game that just released. Give it time and the game will be amazing.

But... devs, my dear devs. Listen to what I'm about to say.\n\nSo you got your game out before Friday the 13th and Last Year, both games aiming to sort of do what you're doing here, great! You got the advantage of being released first, now you gotta make sure you hold on to first place.\n\n-First of all, and you knew this one was coming, allow friends to queue with eachother. I understand you not wanting to create an unfair advantage, but allow at least 3 friends to queue. If they're with a group of 4, the private match option is still there, and it can be done with 3 survivors, but any less is simply no good.\n(The worst part of this is it has the side-effect of lobbies filling up with people looking for their friends, and then leaving again. Lobbies take way, WAY longer to start because of this, and that is aggravating.)\n\n-Secondly, the benny hill theme worthy window hopping. It does not only upset the killer and makes him feel the game is treating him 'unfair', but removes the 'fear' survivors should feel. Now I am specifically talking about windows, the pellets are breakable and thus can be removed by the killer and are not the issue. But being able to keep the killer at bay indefinitely is not the way to go about this. I suggest either one of two mechanics:\n[list]\n  [*]After 3 or so jumps over the window in a short period of time, the vaulting starts to go slower, and if they keep doing it, slow them down even more. This will keep you thinking of your escape, increasing the survivor's fear of the killer instead of feeling you can 'outsmart' him. You gotta stop vaulting, make a run and hide sometime!\n  [*]This is a more heavy-handed 'fix' and I do not like it. Give killers the ability to let the entity cover one window (this has to be channeled), it will remain until the killer decides to put it unto another window.\n\nThese are my suggestions to you, the first part DEFINITELY needs fixing because like I said, it creates issues for people actually trying to just start the game.","timestamp_created":1466062590,"timestamp_updated":1466062590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503553032875061035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592343","author":{"steamid":"76561198033806003","num_games_owned":805,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1466010676},"language":"russian","review":"Игра определенно стоит своих денег.

(Those looking for balancing explanations go to second paragraph)\nThe concept of this game is simple but effective, a killer is among 4 other survivors on the map, he must hunt and kill the survivors before they active all 5 generators; i wont go into any more details seen as though most of you already know this. \nThe game has many things going for it, the atmosphere is great, the feeling of the killer chasing you is shocking but satisfying when you evade them and/or escape to the end. The game features a lot of things that allow it to stay fresh and interesting, 1 of which includes a tool box which allows you to dismantle hooks around the procedurally generated map, these exclude the hooks that are placed in the basement as they are permanent (to allow the killer to actually hook somebody instead of them all being destroyed). The game allows you to keep your item if you escape with it in your hand which I personally think is an amazing feature and really makes sense, the equipment/item also has add-ons which help/increase its use such as allowing the tool box to last longer giving it more uses, or i creating its speed. Perks also in the game (permanent) give it a very unique style of gameplay, allowing you to change the way you play around them, an example would be a certain perk allows the skill check on generators to be larger if you can sense (through heartbeat) the hunter making it easier to land, others allow you to dodge traps or even seen the hunters location for a short amount of time after all the generators are open. This parred with a few other features (that i don't want to go into detail about) make the gave very exciting and somewhat different every time.\n\nOnto the balancing and complaints. Many MANY people have complained about the lack of a party system or communication in-game (there is the ability to talk in the lobby just before the game start to fellow survivors (hunter cannot see the messages) incase you have a few words of wisdom or plans you wanted to tell them), of course this is appalling on the developers behalf, there is reason why this feature is not in the game YET; the hunter works off of the survivors lacking each-others whereabouts until they are caught, this means its more of a \"hunting\" style rather than chasing a school of fish that disperse when you go near them. As for the party system, same reason - 4 people can simply work together and out-play the hunter giving them an EASY advantage as if they are good players they will be able to communicate their location AND the hunters, making his perks such as 0 heartbeat radius completely useless as it requires the hunter to stand still for 4 or so seconds to be off the radar and if 1 survivor see's them, they can just tell the others he is there and nobody will fall for that trap or that style of play making the perk close to useless and no fun at all. The lack of party system also means that massive amount of points cannot be farmed by 2 friends, i wont say how this is possible incase people find lobbies together and exploit it, but it is simple and possible with just 1 other friend with you (even if you aren't the killer). \n\nNOTE: The developers have actually said they will add this feature soon into the game for hunters that WANT a larger challenge with survivors that can communicate and/are friends, this will also be a ranked type of game mode once they release the ranked game mode to make matches more even based on your survivor/killer rank.\n\nThere is of course no excuse for the lack of control variety/ability to change keys for actions the game has, I too would like to see this implemented and changed. Many have also noticed that the skill-check is a little delayed, I have noticed this since the start and am unsure if it is intentional, if it was then it would make sense due to adding to the difficulty of getting the \"perfect\" zone and making it harder because the survivors actually scared and delayed, but if it is unintentionally although it is a good \"accident\" in some cases, many people prefer the easy option and nobody seems to notice that certain games have become too easy and hand-fed to them, the whole point of a feature like that would be to add difficulty or else everybody would be nailing it first time easy boring game, but this way you actually must focus on repairing as well as looking around, adding to the atmosphere and intention of the game. My personal opinion would be to leave this in, it adds difficulty and makes sure the people who want everything hand-fed to them stay away from the game as these are usually the type of people who get put on a hook 2 times in the space of you saving them 10 seconds ago, and expect you to save them again.\nThis brings me onto my next point which is teamwork. I've seen many reviews complain about lack of teamwork between survivors, however there is nothing FORCING you to be a team player, the developers themselves said you can be a team player or risk it out on your own, there are bonus points/rewards for helping people, but its obviously not compulsory, just like in a real life scenario. (You can also see it in the intro cinematic, a survivors runs past another 1 that is trapped, and refuses to help and carries on running).\n\nAll and all this game is great, of course needs some work, but its getting there. I would highly recommend this game especially if you can get a private group of 5 friends with you, its a ton of fun.\n\nIf anybody has any further questions or concerns feel free to comment them or message me privately :)","timestamp_created":1466060517,"timestamp_updated":1466068003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500640213489532471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592132","author":{"steamid":"76561198157028520","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1466036517},"language":"english","review":"Boring not my game!\n","timestamp_created":1466060488,"timestamp_updated":1466060488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518506646156311035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592120","author":{"steamid":"76561198065644862","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1585233126},"language":"schinese","review":"官方说会出中文 放心入吧","timestamp_created":1466060379,"timestamp_updated":1466060379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592107","author":{"steamid":"76561198002092948","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1584234634},"language":"french","review":"Le concept est sympathique, mais je ne me vois pas jouer plus de 10 heure sur ce jeu","timestamp_created":1466060249,"timestamp_updated":1466060249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592024","author":{"steamid":"76561197985032007","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":8804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2778,"last_played":1518622357},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Read this Review before you buy[/h1]\n\nThis game has some really good potental. It is a buy that its cheat at the moment and hopefully will get better once developers get their heads out of their asses and fix some common sense things. The game is geared towards competive play but at the same time it punishes you for wanting to play the game in general due to the massive wait times in lobbies. This is not the main for many players but for those who just play solo and all dont press \"Search for Lobby\" at the same time you will get paired with randoms who will either quit on you because they didnt  get in their lobby with their friends OR they quit because they think the team is scrub which increases the wait time as a killer by 10 fold [b](average time waiting for a match as killer can be from anywhere from 15 minutes to 50 minutes)[/b]\n\n[h1]Playing as Survivor[/h1]\n\nPlaying as survivor is fresh and fun and requires coordination to sucessfully escape, however you [b]CANNOT[/b] communitcate with your team unless you 'purchase' the map using in game currency and use the gold bead item. There is no form of text or voice communication when you are near other players which I find [b]Very Dissapointing[/b] for an online title. Sure you can communicate at the lobby but its only for survivors and 80% of the time no one stays long enough to formulate a plan. As of the current release build the only meta to win or play the game as survivors is to gain the self sustaining perks that allow you heal and sabotage without the item.\n\nMost 'Expendables' labeled offerings are very miniscue and do not aid the survivors much other then the pure darkness offering which leaves all other items useless (even the score booster ones) The only way to escape the killer is to toss objects in his way or meta around him using cheap tactics that are honestly cheating in my opinion. Constantly vaulting around windows and kiting the killer while playing to god that your teammates are fixing generators (which 9 times out of 10 their not).\n\n[h1] Playing as the Killer[/h1]\n\nEveryone plays the killer, there are so manny killer started lobbies that sometimes wait times to find a lobby that will actually stay and is not trying to random into a friends lobby will take the killer [b] 15 to even 50 minutes to locate a match[/b] and even when you have enough players theres always 1 person who disconnects from the game and ruins it for everyone becuase when they leave it causes every player to 'de-rank' and reduce their overall ranking which makes people NOT want to play. Alot of killer mechanics are very good and a majority of them are really bad, for example anytime a player sprints and performs an action he can be seen by a killer through a form of sonar. this prevents Call of Duty style hit and run tactics and requires players to walk around and play stealth. Common meta for the killers is to play Chuckles (Trapper) or the HIllbilly because they have the ability to one hit down the players with no concenquence.\n\n[h1] Reccomendations to the developers before I offer my full support[/h1]\n\n[olist]\n    [*]Allow friends to play with eachother in ranked matches, even if its 2 friends maximum at least theres some form of teaming up so there can be competive play.\n    [*]UNless the Entity causes everyone to be mute why can players not communicate with eachother in area chat or some type of communication. There needs to be some form of communication allowed otherwise this game will die fast.\n    [*]Penalize players who quit the game and offer bonuses for the survivors when they quit such as a certain percentage of repair/sabotage boost for example 1% = 1 Disconnect 2% = 2 Disconnects etc. If the Killer quits then the game should be a draw and no rank and a fraction of points can be earned such as 1/3.\n    [*]Add a action cooldown for things such as vaulting and sprinting. more often then not players will just constantly vault the killer and meta them to victory.\n    [*]Make kill animations for both front and back of downed chatacters (with the Skull offering for killers) Meta for survivors is to constanstly spin around to prevent insta kills from the killer due to the animation requiring ample space and approach from behind fallen players)\n    [*]Increase the chance of coming unhooked from the altars for non basement hooks. IF the killer takes his time to march you down to his hidey hole man cave it shouldent be easy enough to break out of.\n    [*]THe Skill check circle has too high of a trigger and more often then not even getting a Great skill check (white bar) will result in cauing noise cause of server/host lag.\n[/olist]","timestamp_created":1466059748,"timestamp_updated":1466059748,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499359816312789917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23592008","author":{"steamid":"76561198163574171","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":23880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13466,"last_played":1587076152},"language":"spanish","review":"esta muy entretenido el juego  si cumple con lo suyo lo que seri la musica de suspensa esta genial, de vez en cuando te da un susto,  te mantiene entrenetino por un buen rato y mas si juegas con amigos pero  tiene muchas contras por ejemplo tarda la vida en cargar una partida","timestamp_created":1466059643,"timestamp_updated":1568484883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591994","author":{"steamid":"76561198074394191","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2160,"last_played":1531079015},"language":"russian","review":"Городские.
