Allerdings bin ich mehr als frustriert und sauer, da durch einen beschissenen Bug meine gesamten Spielstände auf Level 0 gesetzt wurden.

Somit warte ich seit dem 19.12. auf eine Antwort und Bearbeitung meines Problems. Es macht sich meiner Meinung nach keiner die Mühe etwas zu unternehmen.

Oh wait a second this is full release. \n\nThese are problems that should have already be solved. Instead of making new characters and dlc to add to the game why don't you get it to a stable point first, so everyone can enjoy it. I would also recommend announcing that you go that route just so that we know that is what you are doing. It will really help everyone if you keep us informed and tell us that you go this route that would be awesome. I love this game, but hate seeing it in the state it is in. Please take your time to fix it. The community will understand if you tell us, but if you act like nothing is wrong and there are only minor bugs to work out just look at half of the negative to see that there are plenty of people having as rough time with what is going on. For me it hasn't been to much, but I have seen my friends have problems like rank reset happening mid season.\n\nI would recommend this game when things are fixed, but honestly right now I can not recommend it to anyone else until the problems are fixed. (Btw dedicated servers would be nice.) Also, I played a match while in the middle of writting this and the Nurse after she telported and downed me looked like she was stuck in that position and then magically got out of it. It really confused me and the rest of my group. Also, during that same match the killer picked up the person as he escaped and was able to hook him and get the credit as a kill, but the person still escaped.

In the lower ranks, the killer is heavily favored to win, and at the upper levels of play the survivors are favored, a flawed model of balance in my opinion.\n\nNew players and experienced players get regularly lumped in together. Pitting four experienced survivors with maxed ultra rare perks versus a perkless killer turns the match into a waste of all the player's time, as large amounts of points are best earned when both sides have to work hard for victory.\n\nThis game is also very unfriendly to new players. Be expected to put in 50+ hours just to get the basic perks for good play.\n\nOnly play this game if you can slog through dozens of hours of defeat before you can accumulate enough bloodpoints to rank up and start winning.","timestamp_created":1483401493,"timestamp_updated":1483401522,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28960395","author":{"steamid":"76561198050028912","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2708,"last_played":1564577805},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая задумка, но реализация хромает.
