Нужно ли брать?\n\nИгра своих денег стоит, за выжившего нужно думать, предполагать и наедятся что маньяк не наделает в тебе кучу дырок для удобства висения на крюке.\nЧугунные же маньяки, ну корме медсестры, особого адреналина не вызывают, бегаеш от геника до геника и машешь топором.\n\n2. Командная игра.\n\nЗдесь увы люди показывают не самые лучшие результаты, человек с фонариком может выпрыгнуть на маньяка, что-бы тот уронил жертву, и драпать с ним в разные стороны, после уже лечиться, но нет, все бегают с ним как со священным самотыком - использовать нельзя, как и тиметы с аптечками, пока не исполнишь брачный танец лечить не будут. Особенно добивают случаи когда двое крадутся к уже повешенному и нет бы одному отвлекать другому снимать, чуть маньяк приближается у всех включается стиль тараканов.\n\n3. Игровой процесс от самого себя (от первого лица, если угодно).\n\nЗа маньяка играть легко, что с перками что без как в реале глаза и слух самые верные помощники, разглядел жертву дальше предполагай куда может рвануть.\nЗа выживших сложнее - даже усыпив птиц, не оставляя следов, максимально быстро прыгая с крюков и чуя капканы, матч представляет из себя рандом - можно быть рукожопом и с хорошей командой выбраться, а можно наткнуться на мансящих и смазать крюк первым.\n\n4. Баги и патчи.\n\nЭту часть пришлось сократить..., но баги все еще имеют место.\n\n5. Разнообразие.\nХотелось бы увидеть новые карты, например карту с водяным доком или ангаром, соответственно выжившим после открытия ворот или же до необходимо притащить к лодке детали для починки двигателя, соответственно добавить перки ремонта плав средства и вождения, карту с самолетом который тоже сперва нужно починить, маньяку же добавить средств борьбы с плав средством и самолетом. \nНеплохо было бы увидеть маньяка с дробовиком или даже с огнеметом, самодельным конечно.\nЭтому маньяку неплохо бы подошла карта с обрывом, куда он загонав выживших заставлял принемать решение - сигать им в обрыв или нет. Полет с обрыва, точнее его результат сделать рандомным, например один сиганул и \"сбежал\", следующий споткнулся и \"помог\" маньяку своей смертью.\n\nЛегенду можно нарисовать такую:\nОн не был сыном богатых родителей, не искал лучшей жизни, он был простым фермером(механиком, плотником и т.д.), нужное подчеркнуть.:)\nЕго призвали на войну, но когда он с нее вернулся то мысли его остались на поле боя, любой резкий звук (запуск генератора, ломание крюка) вызывает у него ассоциации с боевыми действиями, любой человек это потенциальный противник. На фоне этого у него в доме всегда есть огнестрельное оружие, гранаты, шашки...\nДо ухода на войну у него была жена, но после возвращения о ней никто не слышал, говорят это была его первая жертва.\nСаму жену можно, как вариант пририсовать ему в партнеры, некий тандем.\nЕще есть идея со столом и циркулярной пилой, к столу прикручивается выживший (для разнообразия висения на крюках) и уже деятельность союзников, а именно запуск этих самых генераторов приводят в действие эту пилу, например 1 генератор дает старт и минимальные обороты, каждый следующий удваивает, утраивает скорость, к пятому генератору выживший, если его не сняли со стола, сам наедятся что маньяк всех перережет.\nВыжившим добавить средств борьбы с маньяком, например особо буйным выжившим установки своих ловушек типа растяжка, пусть без взрыва, но для замедления, группоаое нападение, например втроем уложить маньяка и отобрать оружие, после веселый спринт куда глаза глядят. Для пироманов свето и шумовые гранаты, дымовые шашки, для карт с генераторами может слишком пафасно, но если добавят двухэтапные карты это было бы кстати.\nШкаф для выживших тоже можно было бы пофиксить. Например среди обычных шкафов зарандомить шкафы с кольями (один или два на карту), фактически от обычного ничем не отличается - выживший забирается в такой шкаф и его там протыкает, сразу половина хр, кровотечение и если такого выжившего находит маньяк зависание на крюке для него фатально, и наоборот, повисев на крюке и неугадав со шкафчиком выживший отбрасывает копыта.\n\nИ еще, хотелось бы наедятся на самый важный и очевидный фикс - возможность ручного подбора соперников и команды, ну и маньяков бы неплохо жестко привязать к их родным картам...\n---\nИ что означает слово \"Стакается\", от слова стакан что-ли? Есть нормальное слово \"Совмещается\"","timestamp_created":1473785203,"timestamp_updated":1474918030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25496588","author":{"steamid":"76561198079399088","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6606,"last_played":1510857480},"language":"russian","review":"БЕСТ АТМОСФЕРА","timestamp_created":1473784856,"timestamp_updated":1473784856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528907954692840576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25496428","author":{"steamid":"76561198294003444","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1640151027},"language":"spanish","review":"uno de los mejores juegos para divertirce con amigos!!!","timestamp_created":1473784167,"timestamp_updated":1473784167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25496388","author":{"steamid":"76561198192771771","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7986,"last_played":1487184212},"language":"japanese","review":"日本人の方一緒にやりましょう","timestamp_created":1473783999,"timestamp_updated":1473783999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25496318","author":{"steamid":"76561198254131184","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":51784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5475,"last_played":1657943492},"language":"english","review":"Awesome","timestamp_created":1473783701,"timestamp_updated":1473783701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25495871","author":{"steamid":"76561198121094437","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":15797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4074,"last_played":1636829763},"language":"thai","review":"so many bug killer use auto click find room with my frd so long 3-4 min found 1 room omg...","timestamp_created":1473781598,"timestamp_updated":1473781598,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25495714","author":{"steamid":"76561198174348198","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":41754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1644329245},"language":"russian","review":"Кто любит бегать и наёбывать людей это игра для вас!","timestamp_created":1473780944,"timestamp_updated":1473780944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25495662","author":{"steamid":"76561198285762554","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1528,"last_played":1654018137},"language":"german","review":"Macht viel Spaß und sehr empfehlenswert!","timestamp_created":1473780752,"timestamp_updated":1511437000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477261960506439209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25495545","author":{"steamid":"76561198050934104","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":88896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2621,"last_played":1655570994},"language":"english","review":"So far, so Great!

The matchmaking is extremely annoying. It can take forever to find a game and every 10 seconds or so, you need to ready up again instead of keeping you up in queue. Sometimes it finds a game, but only a handful of your team ends up in the lobby, the other ones are kicked. So you need to leave, reinvite, ready up again. When you find a game, the killer is rank 1 and has 4 level 3 perks while you struggle to level up. If the killer has the crows perk, you're going to have a hard time. Either the killer is really strong and is going to find everyone instantly and proceed to murder them, or he's going to be some beginner whom you'll end up farming points from. I almost never had a balanced game. If those matters would be solved, this game would be a lot more entertaining, but it feels like an unfinished product so

by Daylight at it's best moments is a heart pumping, nerve racking, panic inducing game. In these games, Dead by Daylight captures the very essence of survival horror. A well-used library of sound effects, and a haunting soundtrack really add to the wonderfully made enviroment. Visually the game is very good, the color grading techniques bring that cinematic quality of today's horror films. \n\nUnfortunately, there is an element to the game that really crushes its design, that design is in the player interaction with the objects in the game. More often than not I have played the role of the 'killer' to run upon a hapless survivor working on repairing a generator, I take my swipe, and they are propelled forward at lighting speed, in which they can flip boards and jump through windows. Sadly some people have taken this as a means to exploit the game.\n\nThe killer moves slowly through objects such as climbing over obstacles and climbing through windows. Survivors fly through them like parkor experts. The exploitation of this happens when a survivor finds a room where they can continually circle windows and barricades making it quite easy to escape the killer. This comes from poorly designed maps and players who don't mind taking advantage of the issues.\n\nI've played this roughly 11 hours at this point and I enjoy most of the games as a survivor, but playing as a killer leaves a lot to be desired. As a player there are many advantageous situations which leaves the killer baffled.\n\nThere is a ton of potential for this game, and I feel they have all the right elements to make this game fun for a long time, but there are many fixes and map adjustments that need to be done. As well as a matchmaking system that needs work, which is a constant complaint in the community.\n\nOverall though, I really enjoy this game and I think the potential is there, and the developers seems to love their project, so hopefully they will make the fixes needed.","timestamp_created":1473718464,"timestamp_updated":1473718632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477657228708267212","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25485317","author":{"steamid":"76561198298516083","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1886,"last_played":1628230270},"language":"english","review":"have alot of fun on it","timestamp_created":1473716662,"timestamp_updated":1473716662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25485172","author":{"steamid":"76561198168102896","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1556929226},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun overall.

You might have probably noticed, that 4 maps were created and developers are same gamers, who make us fixing \"generators\", and to tell the truth, I'm getting bored about it. The map - is the forest (you have the picture as well). There will be 2 houses on the map. 1) Main building, made from wood. There will be stuffed fished everywhere, staghorns and a basement, where dead animals will be. 2) A store, usual metal box, where some kind of instruments, boat motors, old boats etc. will be. The grass on the map will be of different kind: near the main building - it will be low, near the store - high (marshland) - it would be cool to add moor, where you can hide. So, you have two boats on the map and they are blocked by the gates, which you need to open. To open the gates you need to find some parts of the boat, e.g. a motor. There are big chests on the map or something, and you need to look for the details there. After you find all 5 details, you can go straight to the gates. The man-hole or another slot which is suitable for man, will be in the same moor, which I described earlier (it leads to the main river).\n\nAdditional ideas: In order to open the gates you will need not only 5 details, but also a key, which every survivor will be able to find (since there will be not only 5 chests). To open the gates you will need 2 survivors for each of both gates. For example, they will be opened faster, unlike those where only one survivor is.\n\nThe maniac - is a forest hunter. Of course, I would like to add traps like by trapper, but I've got something other. The maniac will have an axe in his right hand, and the left one will bear a black glove and a big raven, which he will be able to drop to 12, 24 or 36 m (he will show survivors, who are busy doing something).\n[/b]Gamers please, like and support this idea[b]","timestamp_created":1473704994,"timestamp_updated":1473705061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25482483","author":{"steamid":"76561198022662010","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":107617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2507,"playtime_at_review":12836,"last_played":1660600044},"language":"russian","review":"Есть две игры по типу выживание против маньяков в 4 или что такое.
