I can always pair up a group of friends or just have me and my boyfriend play together. A lot of people complained about toxicity I believe... To me I don't really understand how a game like this could be toxic if you can't even communicate throughout the game. The only sort of communication you get is before the game (you get a minute to ready up when there's a whole squad of survivors) and after the game if you stay. \n\nI haven't played as a killer yet because I'm scared of the result, but I think I'm going to go for the tutorial and try playing as a killer after this review. Honestly, for the price I got it for (10 bucks for the sale), it's totally worth it. Once it goes back up, I recommend really thinking before you purchase, considering some factors:\n-some people may disconnect the game\n-some people may have no idea how to play\n- some people may intentionally have you get killed.\n(Could be considered still as toxic/frustrating, but could easily be flipped over if you got some cool buddies to play with)\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game because it is fun to play with friends or other people. I'm more of a person who enjoys to play with other people. If you like Deceit, I recommend this game.\n\nP.s: Don't complain about a game being toxic when you can't even communicate throughout the game and your biggest threat is another player disconnecting. And, what game doesn't have any toxicity?\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nPlaying as a killer in this game is pretty rough, you do get a lot more currency though to upgrade characters. I can see the toxicity towards the killers because of the perks (if the killers chose to unlock their perks). I did realize in my first game I wasn't able to kill anybody with one character, so I tried another. In my second game I did kill and \"sacrifice\" three individuals. At the end of the game a few told me that camping isn't the right way to win a game, (Ironically, I ran across the whole map multiple times like an idiot). After explaining to them that this indeed was my second match as a killer and my first time using this killer they apologized and laughed about it with me. \n\nCommunication is key during the game at the beginning and most certainly at the end. I could of got reported or worse, but luckily I didn't. I also realized that the game does crash on you so you will disconnect, it's not like people intentionally disconnect. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my

que par exemple un allié quitte dès le début hors si cela est fait la game est clairement perdue mais par contre si tu quittes tu auras la même \"pénalité\" que celui qui a quitté ce qui est
