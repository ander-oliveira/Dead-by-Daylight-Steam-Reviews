sufficiently realistic visuals, though I must admit that I run the game with ultra res on a relatively high performance gig. With in-ear headphones, the breathing sounds as the killer approaches kind of tickles your ear, enhancing the horror aspect.\n\nIs it scary: initially, yes. But you get used to it after the first few games, once you're familiarized with the game mechanics and the available maps. I'm saying this as a person who doesn't dare to watch horror movies on their own. However, some killers are built on stealth, meaning that they are intended to sneak up on you instead of purely chasing. Such killers can easily jumpscare you, if you are not paying enough attention to your surroundings.\n\nGameplay: for those wondering, the game is more tag chasing than hide and seek. To avoid getting caught by the killer, various mechanics are available for the survivor running away. However, these often require quick thinking and fast internet. If you're unfortunate enough to play in a region where other people constantly use VPN, the game can be very frustrating - a 1 second delayed response will easily cost you the game. I know this to be true for Southeast Asia, since the game is banned in China but we constantly get Chinese VPN users.\n\nReplayability: since you earn in-game currency to progress your characters by playing matches, the first few matches are somewhat frustrating. You essentially have nothing to boost you, and it takes a while to earn those upgrades. After you get through the grind and upgrade the characters you like, you start losing your sense of purpose. The game is probably more satisfying to grind if you like to play as killer, or if you play with friends - both scenarios allow you to contribute to game strategy like a competitive DotA match. Playing as a solo survivor, though, is cancerous - you have little control over what dumb shenanigans or amazing tricks your random teammates pull, and every match is a battle with luck.\n\nOverall: the game promotes chasing rather than hide and seek, which you may or may not enjoy. And you might want to find some friends to play with, if you don't want to be the killer. Not recommended if you have laggy internet.","timestamp_created":1632471359,"timestamp_updated":1637511248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99873259","author":{"steamid":"76561198145644696","num_games_owned":559,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2168,"last_played":1632867275},"language":"english","review":"I OPENED THE GAME...\n\nAND I CAME!","timestamp_created":1632470393,"timestamp_updated":1632470393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99873076","author":{"steamid":"76561199032932228","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":27857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":116,"playtime_at_review":4655,"last_played":1660249381},"language":"english","review":"its pretty bin chillin","timestamp_created":1632469990,"timestamp_updated":1632469990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99873067","author":{"steamid":"76561198269114703","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":32279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":208,"playtime_at_review":13499,"last_played":1660058193},"language":"english","review":"Never in my life have I met a more toxic fanbase.","timestamp_created":1632469978,"timestamp_updated":1632469978,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99873037","author":{"steamid":"76561198047582683","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":130257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3759,"playtime_at_review":80154,"last_played":1660587085},"language":"english","review":"[b] PROS : [/b]\n1. Extremely Good Game Design\n\n2. Extremely High Replayability\n\n3. Constantly New Update Every Few Months. Original Designed or Licensed Character ( Survivor / Killer )\n\n4. Developers are very responsive and actively fixing bugs and doing improvement.\n\n5. Well Balanced Gameplay ( Not flawlessly but good enough to say it is balanced )\n\n6. Super Fun to Play with Friends or Solo on both Survivor / Killer. ( I Prefer Solo with No Comms )\n\n\n[b] CONS : [/b]\n1. Survivor side can be very annoying : Survivor Friends ( SWF ) with Comms ! Because the game suppose to be playing under no comms and it ruins the fun for the Killer side. Don't get me wrong, you still can win as a Killer playing against SWF but you have to be extremely good with decision making on every move.\n\n2. Killer sometimes can be very annoying which is Face-Camping at the very first hook. It ruins the fun for the survivor gaming experience.Killer sometimes will tunnel the same survivor till death even though there are other survivors around. ( If the survivor is not good enough to loop, it will definitely ruin their experience and then [spoiler] b*tch*ng [/spoiler] about the game is not balanced but the matter of fact it is a fair game and the killer is just not very skillful and survivor is not good enough to survive. )\n\n3. Both Survivor and Killer can be very toxic. Sometimes no matter what was the result of the match, they still will be rude or toxic on chat. Just keep that in mind, Toxic players are everywhere. But DBD community still has tons of good players. ( At least you don't have to worry that much and don't let these dumb*ss players ruin your day. )\n\n\nMy Honest Rating For This Game Is 9.5/10.\n\nThe only reason I don't give the 0.5 is because Survivor Friends ( SWF ) on COMMS are nasty and it is not fun to play against.

Now I know some of these issues are gonna sound like personal issues I have with the game and I will tell you this: you're right! Some are exactly that, but I can guarantee that I am not the only person with some of these issues. I'll start with the more common and somewhat minor issue. \n\n*DISCLAIMER*\nI used to play this on XBOX instead of Steam. Most of my issues come from that version but a few are still present here on the Steam version as well.\n\n1. Slow Load Times\nSometimes the game loads pretty quick. It will take maybe 30 seconds to a minute to load into a lobby. Most of the time however, it takes just as long to load into a lobby in this game as it does to load into anything on GTA V. There has been times that I have timed how long it took to load in. The longest so far was 12 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n2a. Unbalanced (One-Hit Downs)\nI am not the only person that thinks this game is super unbalanced. I have friends that say the same and I have read blogs and articles and stuff online that have stated many of the reasons why this game is unbalanced. Like I said before, some of these issues are more my opinion than an issue that everyone has with the game so just bare with me on this. One Hit Downs are super annoying. I understand that the killer is a strong and scary character and that's fine, but does there seriously need to be so many abilities that cause the \"Exposed\" Status and cause you to go down in a single hit. It makes it to where the survivor doesn't have a fighting chance at all since THE KILLER IS FASTER THAN THE SURVIVORS BECAUSE OF \"BLOOD LUST\" AND WILL ALWAYS CATCH YOU. Sure players can get really good at the game and manage to juke out the killer or have an ability like \"Unbreakable\" that will allow the player to get up after being downed, but for us players that are not try-hards, that are playing the game for the first time ever, or just want to play a game to have fun, one hit downs kind of take that ability away since there is no way to get away from them.\n\n2b. Unbalanced (Leatherface)\nChainsaw ability is a One-Hit Down that the player has better control of movement wise and can go through Pallets. Plus \"Blood Lust\" and remember when they buffed him a few updates back? Need I say more?\n\n3. Timing Out Sometimes Wastes Add-Ons, Items, and Offerings. Also Gives me \"Left Before Game Ends\" Penalty\nThere have been times when an internet issue (whether on my side or Killer/Host's side) has cause me to time out or disconnect from a game either before it even loads in completely or part way through the game. I can understand why it would use the item, add-on, offering up if the game had started, but the times that the game never started and it went from the initial loading into the game screen and then immediately to the end of game leader board is a different story. I shouldn't have to worry about my equitables disappearing on me because someone lagged out before the game even got a chance to start.\n\nThere have also been times where I or the Host would have connection issues and the game would end or the loading screen would cut straight to the leader board and when I clicked to go back to the menu it would give me the \"Quit Game Early\" Penalty and ban me from playing for the amount of time it says. I DIDN'T LEAVE THE GAME! I TIMED OUT, THE HOST TIMED OUT, ETC.\n\n4. Camping Hooks and Tunneling the Survivors\nThis isn't Call of Duty. If you want to go and camp, please go play COD and stop camping the survivors when they are hooked. Many times I have loaded into the game and spawned right next to the killer and then I get hooked and they camp it. It takes all the fun out of the game when you get 2 seconds of play time as a survivor because the \"Shit for Brains\" Killer wants to make sure that the 1% chance of you getting yourself of the hook doesn't happen. Killers complain that the Survivors have it easy and are able to get generators done too quickly? Well maybe if instead of standing at the hook and watching me bleed to death, you went around the map and looked for the other survivors. Maybe they won't get the generators done as fast now!\n\nNow the other common bullshit Killers like to do, Tunneling a Survivor. For those that don't know what it is: Tunneling in Dead by Daylight is when a killer spends all their time going after a single survivor and ignores the others. I have been on the receiving end of a dumbass killer that decided to tunnel many times and just like the camping issue, it takes the fun out of the game when the killer clearly sees 3 survivors that haven't been attacked, hung, downed, etc. in front of him working on a generator, but then decides that he wants to go after the survivor that has been hooked twice already and is in the dying state that is further away. In a way, it is a form of bullying really.\n\n5. Lack of Gore, Horror, etc.\nFor a horror game, this game is not very scary. Maybe a survivor will get jump scared when they run into a stealth killer like Ghostface around a corner, but other than that this game has zero horror. Also when it includes a character from the Saw films, has two killers that use chainsaws, a giant pyramid dude that stabs you in the groin during his mori, etc. there is no gore. Sure when you get hit, there is some blood. The amount of blood from that is very minuscule however. Anytime I get hit I just think that I got a little cardboard cut and my finger is bleeding very very lightly. When Leatherface uses his mori, he cuts through the survivor's body with his chainsaw. Their body should be in multiple pieces, but when they fall over and die it looks like nothing had even happened. It just feels like lazy game design.\n\n6. Press Button to jump into Hatch... Doesn't Jump in and dies\nSo in a game I just played, I was the last survivor, and I had found the hatch. The killer was Spirit. The second that I heard her teleport ability activating, I pressed the button to jump in the hatch. Instead, my character just stands there, she appears, and downs me. I am willing to chalk this problem up to lag, but my connection wasn't having any issues. My internet isn't the best but I hardly ever have issues so it was either an internet issue, a bug that needs to be fixed right fucking now (but won't be), or the killer was using a hack. Those are the only possible explanations for it. I pressed the button to jump in the hatch with plenty of time before she appeared. No reason I should have stood there and died instead.\n\nNow I have many more reasons on why I am giving this game the bad review but I would rather not write an entire novel about it. There are plenty of other reviews or blogs, articles, etc. that have more reasons that are not personal opinions. Just know that on paper, this game does have its good moments and in some ways is a very fun game. However it has a ton of issues that can be easily fixed but won't be since the devs are too busy making more killers with broken as fuck abilities instead. If you are still wanting to buy this game, wait for it to be on sale. Save the money and potential headache.\n\n\nLets make an addendum shall we. I decided to give the game one last chance. One last chance for me to actually have fun playing this steaming pile of garbage and shit. I played a total of 12 games. Out of those 12, I survived a single game. Out of those 12 games, I spawned very close to the killer and went down within the first 10-20 seconds in 9/12 games (of those 9 downs, 6 of them were single hit downs, 1 of them was due to a major lag spike, the other 2 was just me being dumb). Going back to the single hit downs I talked about above, THEY NEED TO BE SOMEHOW NERFED. I had a total of about an hour of play time total out of those 12 games and yet I had the game going for a good 5-6 hours total (I took a well deserved mental break about 3 hours in). Most of that time was all just loading into a lobby.","timestamp_created":1632456622,"timestamp_updated":1633468027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99867128","author":{"steamid":"76561198431188689","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":48414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":216,"playtime_at_review":25620,"last_played":1660582332},"language":"schinese","review":"屠夫完全不需要游戏体验是吗？屠夫方bug不修复，阴间匹配机制，玩屠夫全都是人皇队，我自己玩人类时候全是萌新屠夫，真就人类玩家钱好赚，屠夫就不重要了，hhhh四百小时，我是傻逼","timestamp_created":1632456126,"timestamp_updated":1632456126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99866872","author":{"steamid":"76561199032484840","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5828,"last_played":1649651799},"language":"english","review":"good game\n","timestamp_created":1632455578,"timestamp_updated":1632455578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99866808","author":{"steamid":"76561198295680965","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":71232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":70700,"last_played":1660585001},"language":"english","review":"Game turned in Repair Simulator.","timestamp_created":1632455422,"timestamp_updated":1632455422,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99866710","author":{"steamid":"76561199076521496","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":37570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1559,"playtime_at_review":1692,"last_played":1660437875},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, What can be said for the game.
