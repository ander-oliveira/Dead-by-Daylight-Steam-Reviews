If this game was a full price $60 then I wouldn't recommend it but for $20 on the standard edition and $30 for the deluxe? As the killer, certain tactics the survivors utilize need to be nerfed or what they are using to utilize this tactic to either be a shorter walk to them instead of playing a futile game of cat and mouse where the survivor can cheese the killer for days, especially if they are the last survivor active in the game.\n\nGame settings are rather limited as in you cannot individually tweak settings and they are lumped together under the presets of low, medium, high, and ultra as an example. There is not a separate slider for music and all sounds are lumped under a master volume bar. V-sync is on by default which may dissaude others but personally I like V-sync to be on. Game forces borderless full screen beware of having Skype on in the background.\n\nAll and all, you get a decent game but still has it's issues and options that need to be present. But still I think it's worth the $20 at the very least.","timestamp_created":1466159211,"timestamp_updated":1466159211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23611562","author":{"steamid":"76561198043797182","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1635109644},"language":"english","review":"So probably by glancing at the reviews you've already seen people complain about the lobby system. People jumping in and our and ridiculous wait times. I found it was a fit eaiser to jump into games when your a survivor. but you can still expect some kind of wait time normally. But if your like me you bought this game to play as the killer. Which oh boy there were some crazy wait times. I actually put on the tv and watched it while i was waiting. There was actually one time where finished an entire episode before i actually got into game. Now it wasn't always THAT long. But it was pretty much at least a 5 minutes wait if not more then that. Its not because its slow but because people keep jumping in and out and all you can do is wait. there needs to be some kind of party system or something done so your not just sitting there wait and waiting, Ive seen people encounter lobby errors, but i havn't encounted it myself. Nor was i ever been disconnected while finally in game.\n\nSInce it is day one I did encounter two glitches. One where one of the survivors was just invisible to me. I didnt realize this until they were hiding in one of those hut things and i opened it, nothing was there but i got the animation for picking them up and only could see them when they were put on the hook. i guess its possible the person cheated some how? but i think it was just some kind of glitch. Again while being the killer i had someone on the ground up against a wall. when i picked them up neither of us could move, totally stuck in place. Still stuck even long after they should of been dropped.\n\nAND YET\nAll that being said i still recommend this game. Yes, the lobby is an issue. yes i encouted a bug or two. but i love this game so much that i will would yes to this game. The game play is addicting and i love the leveling up system. it drives you to just go one more round just to get to the next level and see what you'll get.Enviroments have some really cool details when you get the time to look around. my favorite is the one with all the animal corpses, very creepy. This game is so fun, and so addicting.  If anything I might suggested waiting a little bit. Im sure they will fix everything i mentioned prior (especially since everyone is complaining about it) give it time I am sure it will improve. but if you can deal with the wait time i say go for it, its a blast. other wise maybe wait until they fix things a bit.","timestamp_created":1466159007,"timestamp_updated":1466159007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23611516","author":{"steamid":"76561198076583404","num_games_owned":505,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":84480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1205,"playtime_at_review":3053,"last_played":1660356622},"language":"english","review":"Fun game.

ALTHOUGH you CAN play a private match with your friends however no XP is rewarded, as can be expected.\nAlso the Killers are great, however I don't like the idea of the wraith, the fact that he can go invisible is kinda OP(however the player is alerted when he goes invisible by a bell tolling and he cannot interact or attack when invisible, which kinda makes up for it) but overall I think the character itself is a little OP.\nAlso - and I think alot of people would agree, when you are hung up on a hook, most killers, if not ALL, will just camp the hook, which in my opinion is kinda bad because it's basically setting you up for a GG, although when the killer camps the hook it allows for everyone else to fix generators and escape, thus making a \"loss\" on the killers part.\n\n[u]Overall[/u]\nIs a great game and is worth its money, you could play hours on end without getting bored as each map variant offers great advantages and disadvantages to killer and player alike - You will NEVER always win at this game, teamwork is KEY, however you could pull a sneaky Shane on Otis from TWD and escape alone :D.

Frustrating to say the least.\n\nMatchmaking has a laundry list of problems: failing to join, joining as a ghost, joining as a glitched model that crashes your game, flat out being kicked from matchmaking for no reason among the most noticable, as well as being placed with people who have items/perks that outclass you by miles. Not very new player friendly.\n\nIn game glitches include: not being able to interact with anything, not being able to be interacted with, clipping into map objects unable to move or be hit, not being able to die, game objects not loading in properly, random disconnects. The list goes on.\n\nDay 3 and there is hacking abundant. Among the hacks I've personally noticed, teleportation, player tracking, instant kills, instant wins, ridiculous speed(crossing the map in less than 5 seconds).\n\nCertain common game mechanics are in need of work or are just left out. Your character constantly makes noise, regardless of what you're doing: heavy breathing, whimpering, grunting. What this means, is hiding near the killer is almost entirely futile, you need to be able to hold your breath, at least for small amounts of time.\nHealing, not too bad implementation, it needs to be slightly more intuitive, as well as medkits should have durability as a counter, not a meter. Reasoning is you can be 95% of the way through healing when the kit is destroyed, making it an entirely useless endeavor.\nRepair skill checks are entirely too random, not a horrible thing, but you can get anywhere from 0-20(most I've cared to count) on a single generator. Since they are directly linked to how fast you complete the task, 0 is nothing but frustrating.\n\nLastly, killers camping the hooks is becoming a problem, only made more problematic by the inability to comunicate. You could possibly include a small bonus to the remaining survivors repair speed whenever someone is hooked. Call it fear determinant if you must. This will add a reason for the killer to want to leave the hooked person and stop the others from repairing, and prevent the unknowing from walking into an ambush because the would like to help, as is a very promoted tactic in the game.","timestamp_created":1466152719,"timestamp_updated":1466153249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528735637664794922","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610394","author":{"steamid":"76561198031806997","num_games_owned":1011,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":6374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1660063873},"language":"english","review":"[h1][b]TL;DR if you can't be bothered to read:[/b]Game has a great concept and good gameplay but is riddled with too many game-breaking bugs and missing important gameplay mechanics. Takes up to 1 hour to find a match and can't play with your friends as survivors. These bugs were present in the beta (which people reported) but Devs seem to be more concerned about $$$ than fixing bugs. Don't buy it, avoid it. Score would be 3/10[/h1]\n\nThis game has fantastic gameplay and the concept is great but the mechanics and programming are bug-filled and just horrendous.\n\nWhere do I start...first off, there are 2 missing things in the options menu. Changing resolution (game screen size) and rebinding controls. Before you start saying some games don't have this as well, keep in mind that this game costs [b]$20[/b] and is [b]NOT[/b] in Early Access.\n\nSecondly, there is currently [b]no way[/b] to play with your friends as survivors vs a random killer, which is causing issues in joining lobbies as randoms just join and leave to see if they can get into the same lobby as their friend.\n\nThirdly, match-making is just horrible. They pair you up with people who have absolutely crap internet and whom live on the other side of the world, giving you 500+ ping considering this game uses a very unoptimized P2P (Peer-to-peer) connection. More importantly, you [b]will have to wait up to 1 hour[/b] (I'm not kidding) to finally find a match and start one.\n\nLast but not least, the game is riddled with bugs and a horrible mechanic. There is a ranking system in this game but whenever the survivors are about to win or the killer is about to win, the players who are playing as them leave. This is a huge issue as a) the killer is host and b) it causes you to either [b]gain no points or lose a rank[/b]. Plenty of players are doing this and its making it nearly impossible to rank up. As for bugs, I have encountered many such as the game not ending when everyone has died, resulting in me having to quit and gaining 0 points. I have also encountered lag benefiting survivors allowing them to actually move faster than the killer, another issue.\n\n[b]So, do I recommend this game?[/b] No. Not in its current state. As I said, it's missing plenty of important mechanics and features and the shocking part is the developers seem to be more concerned about marketing and promoting their game than actually fixing the bugs. [b]Simply look at their Twitter post here:[/b] https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/743103751150407681\n\n[b]\"No friend's mode in #DeadByBHVR ? That's right ;) surviving E3 first and then taking care of this feature!\"[/b]\nThey seem to not give a damn about the community and even can lightheartedly joke about what is making the community angry. Mind you, I don't believe 90% of the devs are important people/representatives/PR that need to be at E3.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b]Please [b]don't[/b] buy this game. The devs aren't bothered with you and care more about $$$ and the bugs have been in place [b]SINCE THE BETA[/b] (many people reported them too). It's not a game worth your time, nor your money. Instead, wait for the upcoming Friday the 13th game or the \"Last Year\" game, which would undoubtedly be better than this. Unless you have gotten used to the bugs or don't mind the bugs, it's not worth it.[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Overall score: 3/10[/b][/h1]","timestamp_created":1466152690,"timestamp_updated":1466156070,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542758524417877197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610380","author":{"steamid":"76561198008671384","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1569196747},"language":"spanish","review":"El único problema pero grave es que se pasa mas tiempo en el lobby que en partida, tarda una enternidad en encontrar partida como superviviente, porque como asesino no fui capaz ni de jugar una.\n\nDespués de casi 1h 30m. de \"Juego\", logre jugar 2 partidas solo.\n\nNo merece el timepo de espera, pese a esatr bien el juego, al final pasas mas tiempo esperando que otra cosa\n\n","timestamp_created":1466152620,"timestamp_updated":1466152620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610281","author":{"steamid":"76561198130833683","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":25065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18474,"last_played":1598043778},"language":"russian","review":"Афигенная хоррор игра","timestamp_created":1466152045,"timestamp_updated":1542885328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436507940292358398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610210","author":{"steamid":"76561198162226813","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1519032621},"language":"english","review":"I've never left a review on a game before, but for a game this good, I'd have to be cold hearted not express my love for it for all to see. Dead by daylight is a highly addictive 4v1 game where you're either chilling and killing as the murderer, or you're fighting for your life as a survivor to turn on 5 generators and escape the hell-hooks that await those too slow to outrun the killer. In my opinion that game is a 4.5/5, it has it's little bugs and cons, but it's fun, worth the money, and overall it's a game i reccomend you play with friends for a better experience\n\nPros: A little addicting, Pretty cheap\nCons: Every now and then, you get a game where the killer puts you on a hook and just camps there rather than going for the other survivors, and it's pretty nerve racking.","timestamp_created":1466151582,"timestamp_updated":1466151582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553156018257141113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610136","author":{"steamid":"76561198018356567","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":48622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32160,"last_played":1630719843},"language":"english","review":"Played 30 hours. I'm not good at this game, but while the first few hours were fun, I quickly came to realize that at the lower ranks, this game is basically repairman simulator 2K16. It is  very possible for 2-3 people to easily win at the lower ranks at the cost of the other 2 simply because the game encourages the killers to camp the hook they put a survivor on (at the lower levels at least). The entire 30 hours of my gameplay were either grab all the generators while other people are being killed, or try and save them and end up dying myself because the killer literally stands in a corner watching the hook or runs around in circles around the hook 80% of the time. \n\nAs a killer, its very possible for a survivor to literally jump through windows or slide across boards continually to avoid you. Not only that, but unless you're the trapper, there is literally nothing you can do if you decide to stop camping a hook; if you want to guarantee yourself enough points, you basically have to camp the hook otherwise its possible for everyone to escape. \n\nThe game is also a buggy mess. It's very hard to rank up because sometimes even if the post-game lobby shows you gaining rank, you can end up losing rank somehow. I was rank 19, got a win with 14k blood points, and I thought I would get progress toward the next rank. Turns out I didn't, and I went back to rank 20.  This happened about 8 hours in and similar problems persisted for the rest of the experience.\n\nThe game can be laggy as hell sometimes too, messing up your skill checks and can make it frustrating. And if you DC during the game, you lose rank as well. \n\nMost of my review is frustration not only because the ranking system is so broken. If you don't really care about ranking, then it will be very easy to overlook most of this review; this game probably seems like a game that you can easily enjoy by just having fun with your friends. Unfortunately, there is also no group queue, and the game probably isn't balaned for group play but it's okay because the devs were streaming while enjoying E3 and promised to work on it in a few weeks.\n\n*EDIT*\nNow that I've played a shit ton more and hit rank 1 both as killer and survivor, without using infinites or bp burrito or self-heal as a survivor or camping as a killer, I'll add some more.\n\nThere are 3 types of high ranking survivors: legit good ones (10% of them), infinity users (50%), and people like me (selfish dicks who only help after getting enough points); 95% of high ranking survivors got there using sabotage and sprint burst. Pretty much the key to ranking up is either being a cheeser by abusing map design (using infinites) or not being the 1st guy caught.\n\nThere are different types of killers depending on which one they are regardless of rank, since every killer should get to rank 1 eventually unless they have a legitimate mental problem: the hard camper who legit face camps you with or without insidious (most likely a hillbilly); the sxyhxy who \"patrols\" around hooked survivors yet always seems to be within 6 seconds of the hook and never breaks sightline or has an obstacle between them and the hooked survivor, and of course the guy who never camps but either doesn't care since he's gonna get enough BP anyway (wraith) or knows you're going to run into his trap soon (trapper/me). \n\nThere's still no good matchmaking system but they've added Survive With Friends, which is still super buggy and you'll be lucky to find a game after 10 minutes. \n\nOverall, they have made the game much better, so I'll change the negative review to a positive one, but don't expect a great or balanced game.\n\nEDIT\n\nAnother update after the Last Breath. I hit rank 1 as Trapper when the trap shows instantly. Not only does it take a second for traps to appear to survivors to interact with (disarm/sabotage), now you also can't sabotage a trap without disarming it. Not only does this make trapper even more overpowered, it also encourages even less team play. Disarm a trap = trapper knows where you are = you don't disarm traps = your teammates run into traps. This is honestly compeltely retarded, I would be shocked by these devs but after watching them play I realize they're just shitters. Stay away from this game, stay away from these devs. 2 months and the game is even less balanced than before.\n\nEDIT\n\nMud DLC Update. Have over 500 hours in this game now. They just nerfed hillbilly, a killer no one wanted changed, and buffed camping trapper again, which is a killer everyone wanted nerfed. These devs try hard but they suck so bad at balancing this game.","timestamp_created":1466151109,"timestamp_updated":1481115626,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610130","author":{"steamid":"76561198310091267","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7167,"last_played":1517100437},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.

Что могу сказать спустя всё время, что я играл. Если вы зашли сюда, чтобы купить эту игру и получить удовольствие от игрового процесса, то я искренне не советую этого делать. Игра крайне сырая, в ней присутствует ОГРООООМНОЕ количество багов, которые игроки крайне часто юзают. Разрабы всё это знают и не фиксят. Немогут или лень. К примеру: \nВместо 4 выживших в лобби используя баг может зайти второй маньяк. Этот баг был со времён ЗБТ, кстати.\nОдин из маньяков может взять оружие другого маньяка и использовать его. А если он особо наглый, то сможет использовать перки выживших, что позволит ему видить всех игроков, быстро бегать и т.д. \nТак же крайне не советую играть одному. Ибо из-за ранговой системы у Вас разорвёт пердак так, будто в него запихнули пару осколочных гранат. Вы спасаете челека с крюка, лечите его, тратите редкий аддон? Поздравляю! Вас вешают на крюк, а эта псина с 2 даже не пытается спасти Вас и сразу сваливает. \nЕщё есть маньяки аутисты. Ты маньсиш от них всю игру, пока твои товарищи чинят все геники. В итоге он кладёт тебя ноедом ( перк, который позволяет ваншотить, после того как все 5 геников заведены) и начинает фейс кемпить, а при выходе в лобби пишут, что ты нуб и это твоя вина. И ты такой * Втф, ты не мог поймать меня всю игру, а под конец кемперил, дабы хоть кого-то убить*\nИ ещё кое что. Иногда, когда играешь за маньяка и вешаешь челика на крюк, попадаются \" люди\", которые сразу бегут на спринте, дабы заныкаться поблизасти, после чего, ловят хит и начинают мансить около крюка с жертвой. После чего говорят, что ты кемпер. \nЭта игра напрочь выводит из себя. В ней тупо всё. 80% комьюнити, баги, разработчики, которые знают о их существовании и кормят завтраками в прикуску с надеждами о их скорейшем фиксе. Могу сказать им спасибо за то, что один из багов они обещали пофиксить с самого начала выхода игры. А фикся определённые геймплейные элементы и \" избавляя\" их от багов, они делают ровным счётом нихуя. Если раньше, маньяк мог скинуть тебя и ты проебёшь этот осколок, то сейчас ничего не поменялось, ибо если тебя скинут во время скиллчека, то осколок всё ещё проёбан.\nПоговорим о плюсах. Вы можете следить за мегашикарнымиохсyкакаконихороши стримами разрабов, которые говорят о том, что они добавят в следующем патче ( нет) \nИногда Вам может попасться реально хорошие тиммейты, которые будут спасать и лечить тебя. Это кстати приводит к тому, что маньяк включает режим статуи и начинает любоваться тобой, пока ты весишь на крюке. \nА ещё, мы тут ждём фикса багов, годную обнову, а в итоге получаем футболки с петухами. \nФух, высказался.","timestamp_created":1466150268,"timestamp_updated":1486404438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":51,"votes_funny":16,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511552155017852783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23609960","author":{"steamid":"76561198066404395","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1582147540},"language":"french","review":"Jeux vraiment sympathiques si on joue seul, dommage qu'il n'y est pas d'autre mode de jeux .\nLe multi et pas mal assez bien de monde y joue, on peut même jouer avec des amis ( par d'xp ni de point) mais sait sjr sa .\nce jeu est donc destiné aux personnes qui souhaite jouer seul et se faire une petite frayeur .\nl'ambiance et le décor sont vraiment intéressants on est très vite immergé dedans .\nMon seul critique est les modes de jeux et les différents tueurs ( manque de compte-nu).\n\nJe le conseille tout de même amusez vous bien . \nPS voila une petit note que je lui attribue  7/10\n","timestamp_created":1466150024,"timestamp_updated":1466150024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465723484754562378","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23609941","author":{"steamid":"76561198140396186","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":36234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33417,"last_played":1624698907},"language":"russian","review":"играю за маньяка 14-ый ранг и кидает к 1-ым (ок, вопросов нету), а на 10 вообще никто не заходит (и на сурве к 20-кам на 1-ом ранге кидает).

Basically, after 2 hours played I've seen 2 different maps (which actually look almost the same) both focused on the survivors starting generators to open a door. Every single game feels the same. The game's settings are horribly lacking. The only audio setting is for all audio, you can't turn down the music which often overwhelms other audio, especially when you're trying to listen for breathing and footsteps. The controls are completely non-customizable, and the only graphics setting is a general quality slider that runs from low to ultra, and the game doesn't look great even on the highest one. Poor textures, very poor anisotropic filtering, dodgy antialiasing, but still an overfocus on volumetric effects like fog that makes the framerate drop considerably at times.\n\nThere are 3 different killers, each with different secondary skills, but there is only one of them worth using whatsoever (the hillbilly's chainsaw). Especially the wraith's invisibility bell is worthless, as you can't attack while invisible and exiting the invisibility takes just as long as entering it takes, several seconds, during which you're required to stand still. The trapper's bear traps aren't useless but they're really not worth the effort, and you yourself can get trapped in them if you walk too close. That's another issue, the position tracking for multiplayer is dodgy. This was especially evident as a survivor, as in the third person perspective, your player model glitching around while moving is extremely jarring. Even entering a locker to hide in will often have a bug where the animation plays out to the side of the locker. If a killer has downed a survivor and is picking them up, the model of the survivor's body being picked up will also glitch into the killer player's field of view so they can see inside the model.\n\nAbsolutely just an unfinished game. Can't understand how this is already touted as a full release. I had some fun, but mainly due to the people I played it with. Can't wait to see how the similar game Last Year is going to handle this, at least they're promising a lot more varied maps.","timestamp_created":1466148164,"timestamp_updated":1466149583,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496732026338577271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23609647","author":{"steamid":"76561198035820408","num_games_owned":361,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":18196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5156,"last_played":1657953013},"language":"english","review":"8.5/10\n\nPros\n- Great suspense\n- Great maps\n- Procedurally generated every time\n- Great concepts\n- You can survive with friends\n- Good upgrades and skill tree for both survivor and killer\n- Daily challenges\n- Creepy killers\n- On point dev team who frequently fix and update\n-FREE maps\n\nCons\n- Sometimes, the suspense and tension which I like, tires me out of playing the game more than a few rounds.

However I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.\n\nThis is far from being in a full release state. \n\nSeeing as I bought this game under the impression it would be, that's unacceptable.\n[list]\n[*]It's glitch, surprisingly glitchy. I have become stuck on objects countless times; I've had a few CTD errors; and on numerous occasions interactions that should be possible are not, and events thats should have triggered have failed to.\n[*]The matchmaking is god awful and unfinished. There's no ability to search with friends, although it is incoming, so people come and immediately leave lobbies constantly. [strike]Plus there seems to be concensus on some forums that there's a bug that stops once full lobbies from requeuing even if a survivor leaves.[/strike] (Apparently fixed last patch) Also Please for the love of god let me stay teamed with the people from my last match, they were amazing. I watched them somehow pull off a rescue that involved distraction and exquisite team timing. I want those people watching my back. At the very least let me have a post game chat with them, I want to build some friendships dammit!\n[*]Multiplayer is done via a host, aka peer to peer. This isn't 2002 anymore, I'm not sitting in my PJs boasting about how good I am at Halo. Stop doing this. Get some severs on it.\n[*]On a personal note, I'm really not a fan of some of the gameplay descisions. It feels like they were never exposed to the community for feedback. Why is so much of my levelling dependant on RNG? Why do killer upgrades dissappear after one game? What's the point in giving me an ultra rare drop if I can only use it once? Why do survivor items dissappear once I die? I spent 6 hours and 10s of thousands of points to unlock that toolbox with those upgrades; you matched me with 3 people whom have never played the game before; why am I being punished?\n[*]Also killer and survivor rankings need to lighten up. One survivor got away, they were all very good players with the rarest perks. I shouldn't go down a rank. Just let it stack none of this you can go down a level.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, expect this review to change as they get it closer to finished state.

However, there are some issues that need to be addressed, but I'll also try to address the pros.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- Fun style of gameplay with different randomly generated maps makes it more interesting as you can't just find one spot that's hidden well all the time, or camp the trap door.\n- If completeing all the generators is too hard as the last alive, you can find a trap door as a second route.\n- Multiple types of killers (only 3 at the moment of writing this) makes each game a bit different based on how the person behind the killer plays.\n\nI definitely do enjoy this game, but there are things that need to be fixed which are easier to list. Don't take the number of cons as a bad sign necessarily.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- No party system, so the only way to play with friends is a private lobby.\n- If Steam servers go offline during a game, you remain connected but cannot move. You continue to see everything changing in the server, but cannot interact. Waiting for it Steam Servers to reconnect does not allow you to play.\n- If someone disconnects from the game due to an internet issue, the trap door will not appear.\n- Killers don't have incentives to not camp the meathook you're on. In public games, this causes issues with the killer watching you die so you can never be rescued. Kind of unfair.\n- Sounds sometimes broken. When playing with friends privately, we've had issues where someone isn't able to hear the Wraith's bells ring, which while not completely game breaking, does affect gameplay.\n- The flashlight will claim to have blinded the killer and give you points, however multiple times when I have received this notification, the person who was the killer will still follow and track me, claiming they were never actually blind.\n- It feels like there are quite a lot of meathooks. Rarely am I actually able to wiggle away from the killer, which with camping killers, makes one down end game a lot of the time.\n\n[h1]Things worth mentioning:[/h1]\n- There are more pros and cons to this game, if I think of any others I will add them to this review. However, right now the pros do not outweigh the cons for public play. In private games, I tend to have a lot more fun because we can sit in a voice server and hear reactions/taunting, as well as yell at people for doing something unfair. If someone is camping, we can ask them not to do it, which they tend to listen to. This makes private games the way to go.\n- You cannot earn XP or anything in private games, which I can understand would be to stop someone from boosting their level, but for those who want to play seriously and with friends, can be a bit annoying.\n- The recovery system after being downed and left on the ground by the killer is annoying because you can't fully recover. I understand it is to make the healing process for a friend faster, but when you're last alive if you get downed you're basically done.\n\nRegardless, this game is still fun, and I do enjoy playing it privately with friends. However with the current state of the game, public play can be a hit or a miss. I'd still recommend it if you can get a group of people to play with.","timestamp_created":1466143710,"timestamp_updated":1466143815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56493079662322998","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608946","author":{"steamid":"76561198054493034","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":809,"last_played":1475526799},"language":"english","review":"Before I start my rant let me say I had participated in the beta so i've experienced both side of survivor and killer gameplay for hrs.\n\nNow there are quite a few reasons I absolutely say Not to buy this game yet. Granted this game is fun and will be amazing given a few more months of polishing and bug fixing so lets get started. The rank system is broken at the moment you either win games and lose pips(every rank has a certain amount to need to reach before rank-up) or win games and don't gain pips or rank up at all even though the score screen shows you ranking up.\n\nAs for general gameplay the game is plagued with disconnect issues where you just randomly drop from the game doing whatever in the game, as well as sometimes the game seems to hiccup entirely and disconnect itself from steam and boot you out the game completely not allowing you to start the game up because it will auto boot you again saying steam is offline when it not and then you have to restart steam to get it to work again.\n\nThere are some game breaking bugs that have been said to the developer multiple times since beta began and still has not been fixed. The developers keep saying they are aware of it but give no issue to when a possible patch might fix any if at all some of the bugs that exist in the game. Also recently the game has encounter speed hackers it not many at the moment but when you do encounter them it sucks all the fun out the game.\n\nThe game has no chat support so it hard to communicate with other players to find out where the killer is or if your hooked to warn that the killer is camping them waiting for players to help their fellow players. The ranking system in the beta was too easy for people to rank up so they over nerfed it and made it brutal for every player to have a chance at ranking up even if you win you have a 50/50 chance of deranking because you didn't accumulate enough points to not derank.\n\nWith all the problems this game has 6 to 7 months down the line when everything fixed this game will be amazing. This game has some great moments when you 1st start playing as a survivor that get your heart pumping or fist pumping into the air because you made the most epic escape from a killer. It really give that do or die feeling in getting the objectives to escape and win. Honestly I really enjoy this game alot but the current state it's in lead me to say Don't Buy This at least not till it more stable.","timestamp_created":1466143438,"timestamp_updated":1466143438,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608930","author":{"steamid":"76561198154568542","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":15992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1287,"last_played":1655977244},"language":"english","review":"Love this game so far, few glitches in it tho but its still a great game.","timestamp_created":1466143314,"timestamp_updated":1466143314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608898","author":{"steamid":"76561198082340805","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1509477066},"language":"english","review":"I love this horror game.","timestamp_created":1466143073,"timestamp_updated":1466143073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500085234642028809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608878","author":{"steamid":"76561198105420686","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1158,"last_played":1561570765},"language":"schinese","review":"好评！","timestamp_created":1466142910,"timestamp_updated":1466142910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608811","author":{"steamid":"76561197980322021","num_games_owned":587,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":40794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10696,"last_played":1633466106},"language":"french","review":"This game is kind of really good, but... ranked system is one of the worst i have ever seen. To win rank you need to achieve some actions in the game, that would be fine if those action were calculate in group and not for a single person... One of those things is to \"facecheck\" the killer (WTF) and no reward if you totally avoid it. Ranked system need a REAL rework allready told what could be nice in a comment.\n\nFirst of all, p2p instead of dedicated servers... is a REAL issue in this game!\n\nNot even talking about bugs like:\n\n- Steam not connected, when actually i m in the steam shop (wtf)\n- Some DC from my side cause of first bug.\n- If the Killer DC when you play as a survivor well guess what you win! But you lose rank cause you wasn't able to achieve enough of those \"crapy\" action you have to do in a game...\n- Some perks aren't working, good example would be Spine Chill, was facing a window the killer just in front of it looking at me, the perk was just there standing still, nothing happening at all... could even feel the killer breath...\n- For some reasons, played all day long one game after the other and now only being able to join 1 game on 10, cause of loading putting me back in menu or just \"unable to join\".\n\nSome feature that are in ALL games (well at least good ones), are totally missing:\n\n- Graphics settings, they could have put a slider with: Ugly / Low / Medium / High / Ultra would have been the same no real changes possible\n- Keybinding... well i hope you guys aren't left handed cause you can't change your keybinds at all! Not even switch between QWERTY / AZERTY\n- Fullscreen... well i guess they forgot about it, took me a moment before finding that actually the \"fullscreen\" was in fact: \"borderless screen\" fine for me cause i allways play borderless, but for some people that's a problem.\n\nMeeeh things:\n\n- No COOP at all, you can't play with friends, well you can but you won't win any XP. If you want to play with only one other person you have to join & join & join & join many rooms before finding your mate (they said they will do something to let people play together, but now it's not here at all)\n- Ranked system need a rework, as i said before.\n- Progression is ok but not the best i have ever seen, for each character you need to level them up, things you get in the \"bloodweb\" the thing that unlock items / perks and so on. Well there is atm 3 killers + 4 survivor each can reach level 50 so hey 350 levels. Really bad if like me you nearly allways play survivor but want to give a shot to the killer gameplay but have no perks at all... this syteme is there to \"keep players playing their game\", but well that doesn't keep people playing a game, it's the game itself that does that.\n\nCOuld tell much more about this game, but atm that's allready enough. Will wait one week and see if anything change, if not i think that i ll report that game, cause actually it's near unplayable, spending 30 minutes to succeed to connect in a room to be able to play.\n\nDon't miss understand me the game can be really good, but devs need to work hard to correct all the connection issues, all the bugs, add \"normal\" features that are in every single game, a real coop and rework some things.\n\nEDIT: forgot to tell that i lost my save 2 times now... 1 cause when i launch the game on steam directly it ask me to accept the contract, but it has erase my save and create a new one... and if i launch shortcut well guess what same troll... 2nd one was cause for some game i have so savegame that i replace, did a mistake in the folder so i took the save of the game out of the folder, when i saw that i did a mistake i put it back and when i launch the game accept contract... and the anti cheat is Easy AntiCheat, a anti cheat i really dislike not to not letting us cheat cause i m not for that at all, but because it a sort of \"spy\" you never really know what it makes, a VAC would have done the work and i think the anti cheat might cause those connection problems (but i can be wrong on that)","timestamp_created":1466142512,"timestamp_updated":1466554402,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608706","author":{"steamid":"76561197982740443","num_games_owned":2098,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1013,"last_played":1487096274},"language":"french","review":"J'écris cette review en réponse à de nombreuses reviews négatives qui se plaignent de choix fait pour l'équilibrage du jeu.\nJe vois par exemple beaucoup se plaindre du fait qu'il n'y a pas de possibilité de communiquer entre survivant dans la partie.

If a Killer d/c's then he keeps whatever points he earned if he sacrificed any Survivors, and wins by default.\n - Have to ACTUALLY click \"unready\"/\"ready\" to get Survivors to join!\n - Survivors join then either leave looking for friends, or get D/C, sometimes at the last second making it [3 v 1].\n - Survivors can just pull debris in front of killer, or jump through windows that NOT ONLY slow you down, but make the camera get locked looking upwards too long for you to regain movement.\n - Can't use Keyboard & Mouse with a controller plugged in, because while using keyboard, you get onscreen command for 'RB' only, and M2 will not work.\n\nNow, I don't even want to take a chance on Friday The 13th Game either.

At launch the game has no way of finding a match with friends, this needs to be fixed for me to honeslty say i recommend this... because out of all my hours played in matchmaking i would say 2 hours is lobby hopping trying to find my friends..\n\nThis short paragraph is more for dev's, but give it a read! The game lacks feeling like a finished product. i think there should be alot more items in the game, along with partying up and joining a game with friends. i would like to see more enemy characters, and i would like to see more outfits for survivors. More interactable objects like the pallets (maybe boxes you knock over, But you cant climb over them only break them!) I would also like to see newer objectives instead of just generators, just a random new one to mix up the game.\n\nPros:\n-Atmosphere\n-Randomly generated maps\n-Animations are clean\n-Gameplay feels good and finished not too bugy\n-Fun to play as both sides\n-XP system is very fun, i wish there was more content inside it.\n\nCons:\n-Can't queue with friends in online match (not talking about private matches)\n-No in-game communication\n-Game mutes steam chat microphone (THIS SUCKS)\n-Can't lower in-game music without lowering all sounds\n-Flashlight is garbage\n\n","timestamp_created":1466138749,"timestamp_updated":1466138749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608219","author":{"steamid":"76561198310604373","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1622364957},"language":"schinese","review":"如果能多点模式玩法会更好玩。","timestamp_created":1466138513,"timestamp_updated":1466138513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608186","author":{"steamid":"76561198028790389","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":82,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1466138212},"language":"english","review":"A neat little game that packs a few good rounds of fun if you're bored.

From being stuck on the killer's back, to not being able to pick up downed survivors because they are crawling in circles, to being insta-killed while trying to struggle your first time on a hook.\n-Can't queue up with friends, means people are constantly bouncing out of game instead of readying up. Sure you can use the 'Kill your friends' option, but what if you have a couple buddies and want to try and survive together?\n-Trying to join a game lobby? Hope you don't get a million 'failed to join' errors. You didn't fail to join? Get what seems like 'instant booted' from a game lobby instead, the loading tally marks pop up and you are back to the 'join' screen.\n-Character progression issues!  Sometimes, you don't get that perk because we leveled you up for no reason between the last time you opened the blood web, and this time! \n-Got pips towards getting a better survivor rank? Better hope you don't play SUPER GOOD because if the killer leaves the game early, you're gonna lose that progress pip.\n-Try going to the support website? The steam link sends you to the dead by daylight main page! There's no 'contact' option there. You have to use their steam forums... good luck.\n\n\nTo be completely honest, when the game works the way (I assume) it's supposed to, it's a good game.  Being a survivor is frantic and being a monster is satisfying.  The problem is that it doesn't work often enough, I'm sure fixes are coming.  At least, people keep telling me that they are implimenting some kind of group idea, so you can survive with your friends, but there's still a veritable sea of problems and bugs that should have been fixed during beta (yes I played beta, yes there were many of the same problems).","timestamp_created":1466137600,"timestamp_updated":1466272071,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608055","author":{"steamid":"76561198205390669","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1495686437},"language":"english","review":"It is a bit glitchy sometimes and needs a pretty good computer to run but it becomes very addicting very fast","timestamp_created":1466137549,"timestamp_updated":1466137549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23608007","author":{"steamid":"76561197999689673","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":49575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":46,"playtime_at_review":30088,"last_played":1660361377},"language":"english","review":"FUCK legion and hag skip...","timestamp_created":1466137121,"timestamp_updated":1591541166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23607969","author":{"steamid":"76561198215696252","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1482806186},"language":"english","review":"B\n  E\n    A\n       T\n         I\n          F\n           U\n             L   \n","timestamp_created":1466136823,"timestamp_updated":1466136823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465919315814971924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23607918","author":{"steamid":"76561198123394602","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2417,"last_played":1592439995},"language":"spanish","review":"Actualizando mi review me sigue pareciendo un juego excelente una muy buena dinamica y un gran gameplay me da tristeza que no tenga tanto apoyo como otros juegos basura de grandes compañias que no lo merecen este juego es una pieza de arte, te mete miedo, y si es con amigos las risas y diversion nunca acaban de verdad compralo te va a gustar, la constante actualizacion de personajes y mapas mantiene el juego vivo.\n\n\n                    PUNTOS A FAVOR:\n                -Gran gameplay\n                -Variedad de personajes y mapas\n                -Diversion asegurada\n                -Buena dificultad\n                -Cumple su objetivo\n                -Gran comunidad\n\n                    PUNTOS EN CONTRA:\n                 -Mala conexion con el host\n                 -Desequilibrio en los ultimos 2 DLC \n                 -Uno que otro bug \n                 -Abuso de personajes Faciles de usar\n\nYO LE DOY UN 9/10","timestamp_created":1466136490,"timestamp_updated":1516771674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511726260185241699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23607863","author":{"steamid":"76561198062702148","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1531894153},"language":"russian","review":"Нет пати лобби, опять снайпить приходится и очень и очень долго находить лобби, в основном выкидывает и надо заново поиск начинать","timestamp_created":1466136049,"timestamp_updated":1466136049,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5294189453125","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23607824","author":{"steamid":"76561198062382192","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":371,"last_played":1469675535},"language":"english","review":"Hell of a fun game with tons of replayability and depth.

The matchmaking is bugged, expect many disconnects.

Fix some generators, open a door and escape while evading a killer. Some variety would be nice. \n\nSome additional balancing should be done on both sides. It can be difficult to get lost as the hunter if the survivors are very coordinated. The game gives some visual cues, but I feel like there could be some more to aid the killer, especially when there is only one survivor left.\n\nSmall details like giving the survivors more emotion are missing. When struggling on a hook and having a neutral blank face detracts from the mood. Some idle chatter would be helpful with the lack of VOIP. The most there is are panicked cries when injured. \n\nI  really want to recommend this game, but in its current state, I just can't.
