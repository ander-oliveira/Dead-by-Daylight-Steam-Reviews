была прекрасна до последнего обновления. Поиграв с новыми анимациями и интерфейсом игры на ПТБ, считала, что этот кошмар поправят до его выпуска в основную ветку игры. НО НЕТ! Они просто взяли и сломали всю игру нахрен, введя это обновление. Анимации выживших максимально убоги и неестественны... Прямая стойка, медленные повороты, падение, словно сурв из пластилина. Старые анимации были куда лучше и естественнее. Они добавляли игре динамичность, резкость. Ты мог хорошо чувствать персонажа. А сейчас? Без слез не взглянешь на все это.\nОтдельное слово про новый интерфейс. КАКИМ МЕСТОМ ОН УДОБНЕЕ И МИНИМАЛИСТИЧНЕЕ СТАРОГО!? Был прекрасный интерфейс, вписывающийся в игру. Вся информация в одном месте. А сейчас: чтобы посмотреть количество генераторов, которые осталось починить - посмотрите вверх; посмотреть  всю информацию о других выживших (кто помер, кто жив) - в левый верхний угол; хотите посмотреть сколько осталось зарядов вашего предмета - в нижний левый угол. Никогда не пойму решение разработчиков добавлять ещё иконки с отображением вашего персонажа со словами: «Теперь не придётся гадать: кто Дуайт, а кто – Клодетт». И как это поможет, если в команде 2 или все 4 Клоддетки? Хах? Красную шкалу с прогрессом крюка уменьшили, все значки уменьшили! Сейчас при спасении с крюка даже не сразу понимаешь, есть ли у тебя часы или нет, а пока вглядываешься в поисках этого значка (на правую часть экрана, кстати)) тебя уже положат. Иконке с усталостью так вообще плохо. Мало того, что она практически вся красная из-за чего не видно сколько осталось времени до отката спринта, так она ещё также уменьшенная... Новые обозначения раненых сурвов так вообще произведение искусства. Изначально думала, что теперь так показывает умершего товарища, но, как оказалось, нет! Бегают, мансят ещё. \nПриступим к переработанным картам... полных багов, но это не самое страшное. Психлечебницу, которая была одной из моих любимых карт, убили блеклой цветовой гаммой, палет на ней, кажется, стало в 3 раза меньше. Убрали главный инфинит этой карты в основном здании, воткнув туда двери, которые ман может сломать. Конечно! Что это сурвы бегают там по 40 секунд и маньяк не может их поймать! Срочно ломать это место! \nГидеон не так плох стал, учитывая, что добавили больше сейвовых палеток. Но обязательно было втыкать выбиваемые Маном двери на 1-м этаже ВЕЗДЕ? Куда не побежишь - тупик!\nВместе с тем добавили огромное количество багов. Стоит ли говорить, что если раньше маньяки пробивали через окна и палеты, то теперь их выпад увеличился на корпуса 3! Вчера наблюдала за бежавшим за мной маньяком, который в метрах 5 от меня махал ножом, потому что удары с такого расстояния проходят! Застревание в генераторе, невозможность снять товарища с крюка, сломанная карта Автохевен....\nВ общем, ужасное обновление, просто слов нет из-за большого разочарования. Вы убили игру этим обновлением.","timestamp_created":1613107641,"timestamp_updated":1613117403,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484855860471725464","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86443480","author":{"steamid":"76561198408706980","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1656052687},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bien logrado el juego. 10/10","timestamp_created":1613107289,"timestamp_updated":1613107289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86443401","author":{"steamid":"76561198051031593","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16962,"last_played":1642100968},"language":"russian","review":"Инь и Ян, Свет и Тьма, Орел или решка. Эта игра уникальна тем, что она содержит две противоборствующие друг другу стороны. Сегодня ты выживший, которому нужно убежать, а завтра ты маньяк, который должен принести в жертву четыре невинные души, причем многие выбирают одну сторону и чаще всего играют только за нее. Если вы участвовали, например, только за светлую сторону выживших в течение долгого времени, то игра за темную сторону убийцы может показаться вам удивительной, вроде бы все знакомо и незнакомо одновременно. Нужно учиться догонять и бить выживших, приносить их в жертву сущности и ломать генераторы. В то же время, из-за опыта за выживших, знания карт, ты чувствуешь по интуиции, что чинят генератор где-то \"в той стороне\" и выходишь на 2-3 выживших внезапно и неожиданно для них, либо с легкостью угадываешь, в каком шкафу спрятался Дуайт, потому что эти человечки уже до боли знакомы тебе и ты ощущаешь будто ты зашел за темную сторону \"поиграться\" с ними и добавить кирпичей. Как бы не жаловались на DBD разные игроки, разработчики все это время стараются сделать баланс между сторонами. Всегда выжившие будут жаловаться на то, что у убийц явное преимущество, в то же время убийцы будут жаловаться на то, что очень быстро все починили и убежали. Эту игру нужно прочувствовать самому, этот уникальный опыт за обе стороны даст вам самим решить, как вам эта игра. О навыках. В принципе у выживших даже в стандартном наборе без DLC хватает хороших перков, чтоб собрать набор для себя и приспособиться играть с ними иногда меняя и миксуя разные перки. Научившись тянуть время вокруг окон и досок, ты сможешь давать своей команде драгоценное время для починки генераторов, плюс, если грамотно использовать фонарик, ты можешь слепить убийцу, пока он ломает доски или спасти своего \"коллегу\" с плеча. Что касается убийц, то тут каждый убийца уникален и интересен, у каждого своя тактика на игру. Например играя за Тень, ты можешь всю игру копить Зло и когда останется починить последний генератор выжившим, на последней стадии зла ты можешь просто разнести всю команду неожиданно для них, что они и не успеют притронуться к последнему генератору. А играя за Охотницу или Стрелка, ты можешь стреляя направо и налево не давать им спокойно чинить генераторы и при должном навыке стрельбы, перестрелять их еще раньше. Охотник и Ведьма с их ловушками и капканами, при грамотном расставлении ловушек в дверные проемы, под окна или подвал, дадут огромное преимущество в поимке выживших. Играя за Клоуна или Доктора, с помощью бутылок тоника и электричества, ты будешь контролировать доски, и ловить выживших раньше времени. В общем, чтоб понять эту игру полностью, нужно побыть на обеих сторонах одной медали и самостоятельно прочувствовать опыт этой поистине уникальной и интересной игры.

What once had a learning curve is now so stupidly easy for new killers to get a 4k because they got rid of the learning curve. they made the killers much easier to use and made survivor even dumber with useless new things.  The mmr is a joke.  And should be the final nail in the coffin for this game driven into the ground by its own devs who cant even play in top tier matches.
