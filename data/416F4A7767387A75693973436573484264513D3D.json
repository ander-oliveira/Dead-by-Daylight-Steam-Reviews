The concept itself is pretty fun,  the game WAS fun for both sides, specifically during  the 2018-2019 era, dbd was at its peak, the game was flourishing, there was a few imbalance issues here and there for both sides but overall the game was in the best state it has ever seen. Then towards the end of 2019, heading into 2020, was when things started to go downhill. \n  After stranger things chapter, which was pretty good chapter, the game began its transition to dedicated servers, when it was previously peer to peer,  and that is a huge migration. Dedicated servers created a whole new plethora of issues, namely desync between the two roles of survivor and killer, in many cases, your attacks as a killer would go  through survivors, some powers would straight up bug out, hits on survivor looked wonky, list can go on. They got overwhelmingly negative feedback that dedicated was going to be bad for this game, but the developers were complacent, the success and attention dbd was getting got into their heads, and they stopped listening to its players.\n  Reflecting on my last statement, the developers continued on  this trend of ignoring community feedback entirely because of how well the game was flourishing,  and moved on to bigger projects like cross-play, allowing switch, ps4. ps5, xbox1, steam, playstyore, etc to play together, which seemed like it was an amazing change at first glance, but created a lot of game breaking bugs and glitches that to this day, still are not fixed and cross play is nearing its one year anniversary of being released.  After this endeavor, comes the \"realm beyond\" \n  The realm beyond is a phase that the game is currently going through, where every content cycle (  3 months, Dlc, mid-chapter patch, then dlc, etc ) A realm is revisited and receives a massive graphical overhaul, another  thing  that sounds great, if it was done correctly. The developers again, receive OVERWHELMING negative feedback regarding the realm  beyond, such as  dead zones in the map where survivors don't have anything to work with, objects have weird collision where you just get stuck on e.g  crotus prenn asylum, macmillian being too dark, autohaven losing its nostalgic value because they changed the color scheme of the entire map, meat plant is pretty survivor sided, but they can always fix that, so that leaves the meat plant and badham as the only good realm beyond updates they have done. \n  Now the patch that put behaviour in a dark spot, would be the most recent one, 4.5.0, where the changed survivors animations that used to be smooth, realistic, felt really good, to what we have now that feel awful, and feels like we're playing on 220 ping all  the time. They changed the in game HUD, when all the information you needed was at the bottom left, it was compact and concise, all the information was there, and ended up move everything to the top of our screens and scattering other information, and make status effects really small on our characters UI so you don't even know how much time you even have left on the hook anymore, the UI shows it to be about 7 seconds off. Here's the thing though,  all  these bad changes that I talk about, and when I say they get a lot of bad feedback on it, its because all this stuff is tested on the public test realm for every player to test. In reality, all the test realm is really used for now is here is a sneak peak of the bugs you're going to be dealing with for a year, xoxo, and there is even more bugs that come to live. \n  I'm going to end my review here,as I think the point is across, but here is the TLDR; The developers became complacent with the games success, they won't listen to feedback, and a lot of people have quit after this recent update as its been a down hill trend for almost 2 years now. The community managers are pretty snappy too when it comes to complaints about the game, when in reality they should be pretty humble considering all the bugs,  glitches ,etc are thrown at the players that still continue to give them money despite all of this. I hope anyone who is considering to buy this game waits till a new one like dbd is out, or find a different game because dead by daylight is a pretty bad game now, and I say that with almost 4.5k hours on my name.

don't\nnow when i got it it seemed like a FANTASTIC game that i could play, oh it was such a interesting change from what i normally did! \na 4v1 to help me get over evolve, actually getting that whole feel of adrenaline or whatever else came with the game that had the word \"horror\" stamped on it\ngod\ni was a complete jackass\n now the problem is with all this is simply that there's one core element to this game that drives the whole reason why we play it and of course, why its failing horribly \nthe killers. or, lack thereof. \nnow as a killer, your gonna spend more time screaming \"WHAT THE FUCK\" and wondering why in gods name you spent your money on this sinking ship that looked seaworthy but ran into an iceberg rather than having this maniacal look as you chop down survivors and sacrifice them to your hardly explained god \nnow fair warning, this is a opinion fueled by the bad times with this game and the fact that the steam refund system sucks\nstarting with the fact that no one wants to play killer\n\"but why don't people wan't to play as the killers! they're powerful or whatever, can't they whack those peons where they show??\" \nyeaaaah but here's the thing, you can have more fun playing as a monster in evolve (fun fact: game that is no longer being updated is much more fun than this) than you do playing killer \nnow you have 5 killers to pick from but since i have spent so little time with this i only played 3. the only thing really setting these people apart are movement speed and abilities and by god you need to be about as inescapable as the Blair witch to even stand a chance of WINNING as a killer to begin with, which further supports why the que times suck. no one wants to play as a killer if its absolute hell to do so \nnow when you do get to play, it's honestly the most fun you'll-oh did i say fun, well fun if your a SURVIVOR\nas a killer, it makes learning how to play as one hell since the survivors are either \nA: invisible or hidden far too well to be seen\nB: turning engines on and disappearing into oh so magical mists as soon as you investigate\nC: waiting at the exit to taunt you one last time as you hit them because apparently there's auto revive at the exit. joyous.\nits so mind numbing and aggravating to even start playing as a killer to even get the idea of playing it more after that. not to mention how most of the abilities don't seem to work for you, hell a BLINK can fail you more times than once because the nurse apparently gets seizures from doing so and staggers as soon as she gets out of teleportation, causing you to flail around like a moron yelling \"where is he! he was right there!!\". not to mention all those goddamned PALLETS. this is such a filthy and disgusting part of this poor excuse of a game that i cringe whenever i actually see one of these as a survivor. its a get out of jam free card and it is ALWAYS beneficial to use a pallet \nkiller on your tail? PALLET\nkiller seen? RUN AROUND THE PALLET \nkiller just doing anything in general? PALLET\ni'm amazed they dint make a function to chuck the damn things at the killers yet\n now as a SURVIVOR on the other hand, this game is somewhat enjoyable \nthat is of course your a troll who loves nothing more than fucking about with the many issues of this game rather than actually playing the game the way its-oh whats that?\nthat's how all survivors play?\nwell damn \nto be honest, as a survivor at a high enough rank, its not very challenging. the killer is normally almost always on tilt flailing about as you slink away without a problem, pallets always have your back, the killer is always further on tilt since you freed a survivor from the clutches of a hook 4 times already, you have a back up hatch for when the time calls and you of course always look forward to waiting at the exit to say \"MISSED ME JACKASS\" as the killer lets a rage fueled charge for you as you run into the mist as the killer is given a disgraceful defeat \nthis is the game\nthis is ALL you ever do and nothing more\nthat's my basic honest to god opinion on the game anyway. waiting sucks, no one wants to play the class that people bought the game for anyway and your gonna end up being a survivor main \nnow go ahead and spend your 20 bucks if you have any faith left in this or the developers, which i have lost long ago\norrrrrrrrrr spend it on this instead \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/481510/\nnow i know what your thinking \"is this a link to night in the woods?\"\nyes it is\ndo i expect you to get the game?\nof course not, just offering a better use of 20 dollars\nanyways, have fun.","timestamp_created":1490885994,"timestamp_updated":1490885994,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30834511","author":{"steamid":"76561198283898005","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8632,"last_played":1601571125},"language":"schinese","review":"这是个好游戏啊我XXX你信吗？","timestamp_created":1490885228,"timestamp_updated":1490885228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30834493","author":{"steamid":"76561198327364644","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":42215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35792,"last_played":1645807586},"language":"schinese","review":"黎明杀机，真是牛逼\n四黑光头，手电红衣\n奈何护士，四趴倒地\n守一跑三，杀四放一\n拔插透视，刷点挂机\n测试想法，屠夫福音\n削弱弹射，砍掉打击\n恐怖游戏，游戏本意\n再削人类，请给差评\n-我们修复了一个导致逃生者无法打开大门的BUG-\n-大概不用修复了，还有机会活到开门？","timestamp_created":1490885168,"timestamp_updated":1531828981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30834380","author":{"steamid":"76561198356132699","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10814,"last_played":1653749812},"language":"english","review":"Meh.","timestamp_created":1490884817,"timestamp_updated":1583335207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30833144","author":{"steamid":"76561198019320273","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1889,"last_played":1531354100},"language":"german","review":"Vom Spielprinzip her Top.... jedoch funktioniert die Lobbyfunktion nicht wenn man mit Freunden spielen möchte.

Singleplayer funzt einwandfrei aber da ich das Spiel gekauft habe um hauptsächlich mit Freunden zu zocken kann ich dieses Spiel leider nicht empfehlen. Trotz vielzähliger Beschwerden von anderen Spielern (über Monate hinweg) haben es die Entwickler dennoch nicht geschafft das Lobby-Problem zu fixen.

И потому я просто опишу достоинства и недостатки данного проекта СУГУБО ПО МОЕМУ ЛИЧНОМУ МНЕНИЮ. Мне сложно осуждать проект, который игроки сами загоняют в гроб своим поведением и манерами. Мне тяжело критиковать те аспекты игры, которые комьюнити само активно разрушает и нивелирует на фоне своего желания быть первым даже если это добыто не честным способом.\n\nP.S. Дальше-плюсы и минусы.\n\nПлюсы:\n\n+Шикарная задумка разработчиков о противостоянии маньяков и выживших в ситуации накала страстей и высогоко адреналина.\n\n+Маньяки и выжившие, их разнообразие и факт того, что некоторые из них были взяты из фильмов и комиксов. ЭТО ПРОСТО БОМБА.\n\n+Прекрасная задумка по поводу наличия разных талантов и особенностей маньяков и выживших, что разнообразит геймплей с тактической точки зрения.\n\n+Красивые карты и не самый плохой LVL дизайн. Который в купе с динамикой игры заставляет исследовать новые места для побега от маньяка.\n\n+Динамичный геймплей, в котором не стоит сидеть на месте, а всегда думать, как помочь себе и своей команде выжить и сбежать.\n\n+Не плохая визуальная кастомизация персонажей обеих сторон.\n\n+Отсутствие доната влияющего на геймплей и силу персонажей.\n\n+Низкий порог вхождения в игровой процесс из за присутствия обучения за обе стороны конфликта.\n\n+Возможность создавать закрытые лобби для игры с друзьями.\n\nМинусы:\n\n-Плохая оптимизация с точки зрения отсуствия возможности управления настройками графики игры. Нет возможности отключать многие эффекты и мелкие детали, которые смогли бы сэкономить FPS на слабых ПК и ноутбуках. Потому иногда случается так, что игра на 60 кадрах вдруг замирает на секунду и потом снова продолжается. Возможно это повоцируется сетевой состовляющей о которой позже.\n\n-Сетевая составляющая, которая по сути является схемой \"4 players to lobby connect\". Что означает, что 4 человека грузятся в лобби к маньяку и он становится сервером игры и именно на его железе обсчитывается вся информация. Сами понимаете, что идея говно... Так как не у всех хороший интернет и не каждый может хостить лобби. Плюс имеется возможности использовать программы для поднятия пинга и провоцирования лагов, для порчи игрового процесса.\n\n-У игры до сих пор нет своих серверов.\n\n-Дисбаланс перков и способностей маньяков по отношению к перкам выживших. Некоторые перки вообще не работают в данной игре. Если на перке написано, перекрывает способности убицы видеть вашу ауру - это не значит, что так и будет... Стои т пологаться больше на игровой опыт, нежели на то, что вам там накалякали разработчики через Google Translate.\n\n-Наличие обузных такик и талантов, которые не фиксятся разработчиками и не перерабатываются.\n\n-Наличие читов и хаккерских сборок читов. \nОб этом можно говорить ооочень долго. \nDBD стала той игрой, в которой разнообразие читов, как в магазине цветов. В следствие чего, спешу вас заверить, что античит системы тут нет. Вы можете свободно пользоваться приватными читами не самой высокой стоимости и быть счастливы.\n\n-Токсичное и порой животное комьюнити игры, которое и является основной проблемой медленного развития проекта... Конечно же после безалаберных разработчиков, которые не особо то спешат, что то исправлять.\n\nИ во всем этом разнообразии \"ЗА и ПРОТИВ\" меня удерживает и тянет к игре тот факт, что я не один провожу время в этой откровенной помойке. Что я играю за персонажей моих любимых фильмов. Что я могу прочувствовать их особенности и способности...","timestamp_created":1490804128,"timestamp_updated":1535817817,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30816242","author":{"steamid":"76561198119681897","num_games_owned":833,"num_reviews":141,"playtime_forever":15378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13851,"last_played":1639313124},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хоть и зачетная.
