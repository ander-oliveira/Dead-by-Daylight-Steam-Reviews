Для новичков: в игре присутствует система прокачки. У каждого выжившего и маньяка есть как я называю \"blood line\" кровенная линия, где ты качаешь своего выбранного персонажа до 50 уровня. Есть рандом в вещах - в которых могут упасть очень крутые плюшки. До 50 уровня у вас будут открываться перки, как и за маньяка так и за выжившего.

All the fundamentals are fine, Graphic and Sounds are good and of course the Gameplay is simply amazing. If you are into horror movies and love the excitement of a \"Hide n Seek\" game, this game is perfect for you. \nUnfortunately this game has still a LOT of problems even though we are 2 months after release now. Matchmaking Problems, Server Problems, Bugs n Freezes etc and I don't even want to talk about the balance, because this is IMO a whole different thing. If you can't fix the fundamentals to make this game enjoyable for everybody, why the hell do you even bother making new content first? The devs should use all their ressources to fix the problems, instead they are making new free content (which is awesome), but nobody will play their content if they can't fix the game first.\nIf the devs manage somehow to fix the server and matchmaking problems I think more people will play this game, and everbody will be happy and can only whine about balance (like in any multiplayer game).\n\n\n+ Very fun and exciting Gameplay. Nothing is more satisfying than \"outsmart\" or \"outjuke\" your opponent. Nothing is more scary and exciting at the same time, when the killer is literally passing by and you just hide behind something and walk around the obstacle so he just can't see you, even though you think you've been spotted. \n\n+ Different Perks for different characters, different Killers with different abililties, different maps with kind of a randomized system. \n\n+ Lots of stuff to do if you are into a littl bit of grinding (Getting every character to max level, getting all the perks and items etc.)\n\n\n\nContra:\n-Server Problems\nWhy do I have to hit literally 10-50 times the ready button, before I can join a game (as survivor)? How hard can it be the make it search on its own like in ANY other game I know so far. SWF Mode is NOT PLAYABLE in the evening for me. Even in the morning, I have to click and pray the ready button for average 5-10 minutes to get into game. After that I have to pray again, that the Killer will not leave the lobby, because if he does, I can wait another 5-10 (sometimes or even longer than that) to get into a lobby. How is this NOT an issue? It doesn't matter how good a game is, if you can't get into a game.. well. \n\n-Matchmaking Problems\nMatchmaking is not fair. I have a very competitive background and this ranking system and how the system throughs random people with different skills/ranks/perks into a lobby is ridiculous. Just think about any competitive team game you've played so far and how do you feel if your team is not evenly matched?\nThis also makes the game not enjoyable. I don't want to get carried and I don't want to carry everybody all the time. This game is supposed to be a team game as survivor, but that will only work if a) the survivors are even in skill, and b) the killer is evenly matched with the survivor as well. \n","timestamp_created":1471434213,"timestamp_updated":1471434213,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24971448","author":{"steamid":"76561198059186026","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":38065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7079,"last_played":1657117100},"language":"tchinese","review":"遊戲不錯  可惜4排/3排等鬼太久了","timestamp_created":1471431918,"timestamp_updated":1471431918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24971391","author":{"steamid":"76561198161093485","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4274,"last_played":1626536087},"language":"tchinese","review":"Luv this game","timestamp_created":1471431662,"timestamp_updated":1471431662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24971350","author":{"steamid":"76561197985956344","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1504,"last_played":1496583108},"language":"russian","review":"СУКА ОТКУДА ТЫ УЗНАЛ ЧТО Я В ЭТОМ ШКАФУ!","timestamp_created":1471431488,"timestamp_updated":1471431488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508896768093109131","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24971338","author":{"steamid":"76561198053013524","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1634479510},"language":"schinese","review":"竟然 更新了简中 绝对良心好评而且还免费更新好上加好！","timestamp_created":1471431434,"timestamp_updated":1471431434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24971061","author":{"steamid":"76561198033591177","num_games_owned":425,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1572028712},"language":"english","review":"If you never jumped from you chair before well then give this game a fair try!

I couldnt have gotten luckier with buying this. Now that is not to say that it is not a pretty and polished finished project. There are still issues that need to be fixed, but that said, that game is still very fun!!! This game when from something I would play occasionaly to one of my main games. ( I dont think there are many others out there that can say the same thing with a price tag of $20) The only warning that I can give to those who are looking to buy this game is that it HIGHLY and I mean HIGHLY FAVORS THE KILLERS. This does not mean that playing survivor is not fun, but it is easly more a challange, which in my opinion makes the game much more fun. Think of this like dark souls only you cant fight back, you can only run. If you are looking for a great game on a budget, then give this one a chance.
