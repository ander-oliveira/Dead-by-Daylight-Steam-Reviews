The grind for perks / teachables is insane, and if you're somebody who would like to have the most commonly used perks on all your survivors  / killers then you best quit your job and start playing DBD full time. I can not recommend this game until BHVR comes up with a better way of reducing the grind needed. I've managed to level up one character to 40 in ten or so hours. Seeing how many killers / survivors there are it strikes me as out of touch to require hundreds and hundreds of hours in order to enjoy a casual game with the loadout you want. \n\nHere's an easy way of fixing this: Unlocking a character automatically unlocks all their teachables for the rest of your characters, without the need to dump BP into someone who you're never going to play but want their perks. \n\nOf course that's not going to happen, because the grind ensures player retention. Ironically, if I didn't need millions of BP to get the perks I wanted, I might actually buy more content. As it stands, I'll probably require hundreds of hours of gameplay just to get the base killers / survivors leveled up. Kind of makes it hard to get excited for new content.","timestamp_created":1639444380,"timestamp_updated":1639444380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105793273","author":{"steamid":"76561198141345794","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":2350,"last_played":1659848639},"language":"english","review":"gud game","timestamp_created":1639444107,"timestamp_updated":1639444107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105792666","author":{"steamid":"76561198949743268","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":9404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":475,"playtime_at_review":6815,"last_played":1660420275},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyundan 100. saatlerde gerçekten keyif almaya başladım.

You can have a lot of fun playing either side, Killer or Survivor. One side will give you a power fantasy as you predict what the players are about to do and punish them for being predictable or bold. The other you'll try to fix the objective your friends while remaining alive.\n\nHowever, when you're in the game, things will be different. Sometimes you'll have a great pairing with the other team and have a decent game, all things considered. Sometimes you'll get one side that is sweating hard trying to get the best scores/ranking and they'll do all that's possible to ruin your game. It's a toss-up. My best recommendation? Don't take the game seriously. If you notice that the other team is playing extremely competitively, just do your best and let whatever happen, happen.\n\nThe game's progression is tied with perks that are usually unique to a killer/survivor, until they become unlockable for every killer/survivor. The base perk loadouts of certain killers are sometimes fantastic, and sometimes very meh. The real game starts when you can mix/match these perks with any characters you want. Survivors are just a template for base perks eventually : you can unlock every perks and the gameplay will remain the same. Killers are different: even if you unlock every perk, the killer's special abilities remain unique to said killer. Obviously, that's also where the game can get competitive and min/maxy. A lot of perks are extremely powerful and can make the game a living hell for either side.\n\nThe game is most fun when both sides are experimenting and testing stuff, learning their classes and making some mistakes. Try to stay in the averages and you'll have the most fun. Avoid the high ranks where people sweat to keep their rankings, and the low ranks where people either smurf or don't play the game whatsoever.","timestamp_created":1639442739,"timestamp_updated":1639442739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105792097","author":{"steamid":"76561199120238099","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11267,"last_played":1653669571},"language":"english","review":"very yes","timestamp_created":1639441993,"timestamp_updated":1639441993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105791670","author":{"steamid":"76561198126189895","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":21141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21102,"last_played":1642457720},"language":"english","review":"gggggggggggggggggg","timestamp_created":1639441210,"timestamp_updated":1639441210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48267325758934021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105791629","author":{"steamid":"76561198048854680","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4383,"last_played":1653343019},"language":"english","review":"Fun game solo as killer, or with friends as survivor.","timestamp_created":1639441113,"timestamp_updated":1639441113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105791574","author":{"steamid":"76561198058497458","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":27584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27526,"last_played":1657379473},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, mas falta 4k","timestamp_created":1639441049,"timestamp_updated":1639441049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105791360","author":{"steamid":"76561198167093360","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2543,"last_played":1639529214},"language":"portuguese","review":"Viciante nas primeiras 40 horas\n\nFacil de entender, dificil de masterizar.","timestamp_created":1639440641,"timestamp_updated":1639440641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105790733","author":{"steamid":"76561198404817721","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":8496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2744,"playtime_at_review":1524,"last_played":1660537253},"language":"english","review":"Made my pp scared all the time","timestamp_created":1639439514,"timestamp_updated":1639439514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48267325758934021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105790240","author":{"steamid":"76561198120590429","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":554,"playtime_at_review":5181,"last_played":1660511668},"language":"english","review":"Enjoy this game a lot.

How are things now you ask? Well... They do whatever they want, when they want. And if you don't like it well here's some bloodpoints. Boon totems were a nice idea but were horrendously implemented and are now just another obstacle to waste the time of both parties. This is not the sort of game that should have skill based matchmaking or MMR. It takes away the random aspect of getting a good or bad team/killer and reduces every game to a sweat fest. The balancing for perks is practically none existent, you will only see about 10 perks out of the plethora that's there. I just hope that BHVR learn from their mistakes and start giving a shit again.
