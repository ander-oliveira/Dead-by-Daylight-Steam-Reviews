game is actually great and a lot of fun. There is a nice variety of characters with something for everyone. The basic premise of the game makes for exciting matches, and the details provide interesting tactical nuances. You have 4 survivors going against a killer. The killer is trying to sacrifice the survivors to a supernatural entity called \"The Entity\", and the four survivors try to get generators running to power a gate which they then open and escape. Every survivor and killer has their own unique perks (later unlockable for your other characters) and there are several generic perks you unlock and level up over time, and there's a nice variety of maps. The atmosphere of the game is great.\n\nHowever, some maps have huge balancing problems, some are severely killer-sided whereas others are severely survivor-sided. Some are well-balanced though.\n\nI am also not impressed by the pricing of the add-ons. This isn't a ruthless robbery like mobile P2W games, but the price is pretty hefty, especially because the system paywalls unique unlockable perks, directly affecting the gameplay experience. However, everyone can play on the DLC maps if they come up.\n\nMost damningly, as of the time of this writing, there are loads of toxic players (particularly survivors) in the game, who ruin the fun for the others. I've had someone who hid out camping the hatch (some kind of emergency exit that normally opens when one player remains) when they felt survivors started to lose, not aiding the team at all; I've had a high rank survivor play with low rank friends trolling me as the killer with constant teabagging and wasting everyone's time by teabagging me for about a minute at the end half a meter away from the exit, instead of exiting and winning the match; killers refusing to play the game and just standing around doing nothing (this is a highly regular occurence); survivors DCing before getting killed to rob you of your points; all within the span of less than 20 hours playing the game, about half of which was spent in menus and having a blast playing with friends instead of random publics.\nTL;DR; the playerbase is a fat pile of horse manure.\n\nIf you have friends to play this with I can wholeheartedly recommend it. Preferably four friends, so you can fill all slots yourself and never have to rely on pubs to play the game properly. This has the added boon that all perks and items are unlocked and levelled in custom matches, so you don't even have to bother with the levelling grind. If you don't have any friends or can't find them, forget this game and don't look back, it's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1613094896,"timestamp_updated":1613094896,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86434795","author":{"steamid":"76561198419223348","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":66814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1174,"playtime_at_review":3080,"last_played":1660561626},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然制作组逐渐用脚，但是这游戏还是很棒的","timestamp_created":1613094885,"timestamp_updated":1613094885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86434794","author":{"steamid":"76561198835142810","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5737,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1660604382},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾","timestamp_created":1613094884,"timestamp_updated":1613094884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86434724","author":{"steamid":"76561199085167586","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4226,"last_played":1655180864},"language":"schinese","review":"nb","timestamp_created":1613094773,"timestamp_updated":1613094773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86434399","author":{"steamid":"76561199057053449","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7281,"last_played":1610803274},"language":"japanese","review":"今購入するのはおすすめできない．この運営はユーザーの声を聴くつもりがなく，PTBも意味をなさない．UIの改悪，アプデの度に増えるバグ，キラーナーフ，エトセトラエトセトラ...\nユーザーへの運営からのコメントも真摯であるとは言い難いどころかユーザーを小馬鹿にしたようなものばかり．\n今はとてもまともに遊べる環境ではない．","timestamp_created":1613094293,"timestamp_updated":1613094293,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516577243804931641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86434349","author":{"steamid":"76561198067154162","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":28985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24820,"last_played":1652220060},"language":"english","review":"I recommend the game* On the condition that you have people to play with or don't expect it to be perfect.

It's so simple and effective: 1 killer, 4 survivors. A spread out objective, and a race to escape before you're all dead.\n\nHowever... over the years this game has become worse, and worse. I am now almost 100% sure that the original developers have been replaced, as any change is questionable at best and downright gamebreaking at worst.\n\nThe game IS getting better over the years. Some weird changes, but in the end they make it work enough to retain players.\n\nNowadays though, there is a public test build that should help the team get insight in what players do or do not like. Or what glaring bugs are present.\n\nDo the devs use it this way? No. They just throw it in anyway.\nThere is a famous meme ''Pretty good job so far'' and it is still around to this day because it is still true. \n\"You don't like it? Tough luck, suck it up 'cause it's going in either way.''\n\nThe latest killer was riddled with bugs, GLARING bugs, and was still released. It still has bugs and imbalances today.\n\nThe latest update has actually made me lose the last grain of hope for the game. \nI actually liked the idea of new character animations, and I'm all for these improvements to the game. But if what I get is outright ridiculous hitboxes (getting hit from a mile away, or unable to move through a bus in an unchanged map), and a middle finger when players point out that a UI is in no way an improvement (any UI designer would be able to tell you) and throw it in anyway.\n\nI talk this in depth, because I LIKE this game. I love player killer or playing survivor with my friends. But killer is stressful, because there are a lot of things going on at a time. If I want to ''win'' as a killer I should be efficient, but not too efficient or I'll get punished. Never made it to rank 1 as a killer, because it always got too stressful and unfun for me starting at green ranks (9/20 or so) when I start going against full red teams (2/20 or so).\n\nI'm here for fun. Updates should encourage fun. But the devs seem to not know what is best for the game. And any experienced player that could help, or voices ideas or improvements that actually would make sense... only get rewarded with another middlefinger.\n\nCurrently, I played a few games with friends as survivor and I can't use any ''skill'' I learned over my 800+ hours of gaming, because of glaring bugs. Walking through walls, getting hit from way too far off.... and I'll be damned if I have to be forced into meta perks or abuse game glitches to get through.\n\ntl;dr.\nThis game was great fun with friends, or for the thrill of playing a killer with unique powers and tricks you could learn. But the developers seem to do their utmost best to turn as many players away from this game as possible. \nThis game can still be fun, and I hope it becomes it once more in the future.... But I'm encountering aggravating things in each and every game right now, and it feels like there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nDon't buy it.","timestamp_created":1613090395,"timestamp_updated":1613090395,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604089856147766113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86431654","author":{"steamid":"76561199017926350","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12752,"last_played":1637192387},"language":"english","review":"It is discouraging how clear the disconnect between player and dev is with this game.

It's really not difficult. This usually wouldn't happen because tunneling is very rarely a sound strategy. \n\nThe only positive is the changes to Hex: Undying and the future change coming to matchmaking based off skill of playing a certain killer rather of rank.

I have a lot of hours as the game was fun at the start. Introduction of DLC has slowly worn down the game making bugs and imbalances alike come to show. If you're looking to unlock all perks on all survivors and killers, expect a couple of thousand of hours in the game before you have unlocked it all. Devs won't change this as they are blinded and think everybody is 'enjoying this progression in the game'\n\nThe devs really aren't interested in the community in this game. \nPTB's are purely for them to get free bug testing, they don't care about impressions from the community\nUpdates will be rolled out regardless of what the player base thinks of it, they are never rolled back despite bugs being game breaking (hit boxes, broken perks, stuck animations etc)\nDLC is prioritised over bug fixes\nTime estimates are rarely given on when these bug fixes are coming.\n\nDespite there being over 160 perks between killer and survivor, only around 20% of these are used so once you get to high ranks (which is based on playtime, not skill) you'll continue to play the same killers running the same perks. Same for killer, you'll come across survivors using the same perks, the gameplay becomes quite stale.\n\nThe devs takes ages to respond to perks that are considered overpowered and in need nerfing. They tend to modify perks nobody uses for the worst. Sometimes nerfs for perks nobody uses either, how strange.\n\nIf you do want to get this game though, grit your teeth and get your shit bucket because it's going to be a long one.\n\n","timestamp_created":1613081988,"timestamp_updated":1613081988,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86425804","author":{"steamid":"76561199029937011","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":27189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":125,"playtime_at_review":14133,"last_played":1659578437},"language":"spanish","review":"Yo venia de LOL sabiendo que ser toxic@ es cuando t insultan y te dicen hasta de lo que va morir tu y toda tu familia, en DBD aprendí que te conviertes en toxic@ simplemente con llevar un item/perks del juego, como llave, linterna,noed, mori, entre otros. Y los lloriqueos abundan. Pero la verdad la comunidad no afecta la jugabilidad que es lo k se supone nos interesa, ya que no hay comunicacion alguna dentro del juego, a menos que te quedes como mazoquita a ver k t escriben al final de la partida, para luego ir a llorar a facebook.
