А когда сам зашёл в игру и решил испробовать то получил массу положительных и отрицательных впечатлений:\n\nЗахожу в игру долго не мог войти, и через некоторое время я мои товарищи по выживанию начинают играть, пока мы чинили генератор за это время успели повесить какого-то чувака на крюк, Запускали - запускали это невезучий генератор маньяк нас услышал пришёл и схватил рядом со мной чувака я пытался Маньяка отвлечь но он смотрел на меня как на дурака и стоял возле чувака лежащего рядышком от себя, я решил забить на всё и идти дальше чинить генераторы и сваливать от сюда. Откуда не возьмись появляется манья думаю всё мне пипец, он меня успел ударить я бегу от него понимаю что всё конец все свои мышцы которые есть на моём теле я напрёг от волнения и тут меня ударяет ещё раз маньяк и я лежу, у меня паника я стучу по клавиатуре лишь бы вырваться из его жирных потных лап. Но вижу что он меня тащик куда то не туда, вижу Генератор убегаю от него и думаю нафига он меня сюда принёс...???. В этот момент решил рискнуть и подойти к нему по ближе аккуратно, но он меня спалил поймал и сного принёс к генератору и до меня доходит что он хочет мне помочь я его чиню боюсь его что он меня убьёт, а тот стоит себе спокойно и смотрит на меня я на него и при этом ремонтирую генератор, то меня хватает как куртизанку какую то и тащит к другому генратору в этот момент я был в шоке, что Маньяк - такой добрый был ни когда такого не встречал. За это время которое меня таскали как ша ла ву, накопил 21к очков, я так был рад что меня не выкинуло как могло произайти.\n\nНе помешало бы добавить по больше различных Экипировок у персонажей:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=736188531\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=736188564\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=736188589\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=736188632\n\nВ самой игре приятная качественная графика не требовотельная полностью уникальная в своём роде, на удивление сама игра не надоедает, в какой то момент даже ещё больше хочеться в неё играть после многих часов геймплея, да есть лаги, недоработки порой даже жуткие ты стараешся много очков опыта зарабатываешь а тут раз и тебя выкинула и сделала такую подставу.

The idea of having to hide from a killer as you have to power up generators is an awesome idea and it has some other awesome editions like finding chests that bestow an item that can help you survive. But that's where the pluses end. Horrible balancing, frequent lag spikes, extremely unstable matchmaking system, falling through maps, nonsensical point system, and much more. \n\nIt's a common occurence where I have to mash the \"find match button\" over and over since it can never find a game. I don't know if that's the servers not being able to handle it, or if the game is just poorly made. When I finally get in a match, it turns out I didn't just instead that my character model is stuffed inside another and now I'm forced to restart my game for a third time to find a match. Then when I finally get into a match I have a team of 2 other level 20 players, a level 19 player, all of us pinned against a level 1 killer. I don't even know how that happens. \n\nWell when I finally manage to get into a game that's balanced skill wise and isn't lagging all over the place, there's the semi frequent chance that when the killer swings at me, they clip under the map. This of course ends with them leaving, so the match ends and I lose a pip since a match was completed but I didn't get enough points to earn a pip. How could I since the match went on for 40 seconds. Oh, and that offering for a 75% bonus for survival? Yeah now that's gone too. \n\nBut in the off chance you manage to avoid all these problems and have a stable connection and a balanced team, because of how the point system is laid out it's not uncommon to find a killer who just looms over you and doesn't swing since they get points for \"Chasing\" you so that experience you were excited to get isn't going to happen this match. You can disconnect if you want but you'll lose a pip of course so instead you just have to meander along for the rest of the match and hope you get a normal game somewhere down the line. \n\nThere are other things I don't like about the game that are just personal dislikes (Such as a perk system similar to Call of Duty making it horribly unfair for new players since they will go against people who have been playing longer and have in game bonus effects helping them on top of just experience) but those are personal dislikes and not fundemental bugs that shouldn't be in a game. \n\nOverall this game is kinda fun with friends, but the inconsistent hitboxes (Like that one flipping rock on that hill that has a massive and invisible \"hitbox\" so when you try to run from the killer you get stuck on it) and SUPER buggy lobby system can make it get old pretty quick. Overall, this game is a fantastic concept and somewhere down the line can be made to be pretty good, but this game is in NO WAY worth any money out of your pocket in it's current shape.","timestamp_created":1470135086,"timestamp_updated":1470135086,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518423318862915039","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24667657","author":{"steamid":"76561198108997374","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":72255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":24525,"last_played":1660074177},"language":"english","review":"it's ok i guess","timestamp_created":1470133624,"timestamp_updated":1511612633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24667545","author":{"steamid":"76561198188004506","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1978,"last_played":1522605521},"language":"russian","review":"НЕ ПОКУПАЙТЕ ЭТУ ХУЙНЯ \nПУСТАЯ ТРАТА ДЕНЕГ И СВОИХ НЕРВОВ \nВЫ ПРОСТО НЕ ПРЕДСТАВЛЯЕТЕ ЧТО ЭТО ЗА ПАРАША \nМАНЬЯКИ С ВХ \nТИМА ДОЛБАЕБОВ \nЛИВЕРЫ ОБОССАНЫЕ \nНАБРАЛ 10К ХЕР ТЕБЕ А НЕ КАПЛЯ \n-2 КАПЛИ \nХЕРНЯ ЕБАНАЯ ЗРЯ ПОЧКУ ПРОДАВАЛ","timestamp_created":1470133070,"timestamp_updated":1470133070,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.435801297426223755","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24667457","author":{"steamid":"76561198189847606","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1648851087},"language":"russian","review":"зашел в игру \n._.\nВыбрал маньяка\n._.\nначал игру \n._.\nбежишь за негром \n._. \nи тут ловишь маслину в своем же капкане\nс:\nпоймал негра \n:(\nнегр сбежал \n._. \nвылетел инет \n\n\n\n10000 негров из 10\n","timestamp_created":1470132687,"timestamp_updated":1470132687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.44651949405670166","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24667332","author":{"steamid":"76561198284928951","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1668,"last_played":1497558069},"language":"english","review":"Love this game.

But that potential is not there just yet. I have a laptop with 8 quad core i7s and even on the lowest graphic settings, I can get 25 fps (tops!) And although that is a personal issue, there are many issues in-game that can easily ruin every game you play, all relating to the survivor. First off, if you get downed as the last survivor and the killer decides to dance around you, there is no benefit to healing up your character, nor moving anywhere. You will be trolled until you bleed out. Secondly, and this is a big one, when the killer puts you on a hook, the killer will puppy guard your dangling body, waiting for either you to die without anyone nearby, or for someone to try to rescue you, which will get you and that said player killed... not fun at all. And while on the topic of being on a hook, attempting to pull yourself off said hook is a joke! Out of the multiple games I've played in Dead by Daylight, I have only seen ONE guy free himself. and he had a perk to help him. Enough of hooks *shudder*. The last thing I feel needs to be improved is the teamwork, or lack thereof. Teamwork implies a group of people  (the survivors) working together to achieve a common goal (escaping). Playing with random people usually means they will not help you. They will 3/4ths of the time stay away from hanged people and, if the killer is after them, try to put the weaker players in the killers crosshairs. If you are unsure if you want this game or not, my answer is do not get this game NOW, but always keep an eye on it. With the right patching, this game can be the next great horror game. But as I mentioned at the beginning, this game has a lot of potential. To give a good comparison, this game is like Tom Clancy's The Division's the Dark Zone after the gear score update, and could be much better with the right tweaking. \n\nDon't make this review a final decision for if you want this or not.

However, there is a very large problem that I have with the game.\n\n1. The release\nThe main problem I have with the release of this game is that it was more or less full priced. $20, to be exact. and although that may not seem like a lot, it is using the skin of a finished game instead of actually finishing itself before being sold as a completed product. This means it comes with an insane amount of bugs, glitches, exploits, server issues, and a few other odds and ends like map design that inherently supports either the survivor, or the killer.\n\nA good example of this is the many, many times that I've thrown a barricade down behind me - only to suddenly appear behind it, my back against the killer and being very much flustered at my predicemant. And there at least were many times that I had been \"juked\" as the killer with the survivor simply moving in an infinite loop of windows; thankfully this has been patched in the map design so it's nowhere near as easy or prevelant.\n\n2. The Killers\nNormally I don't care about classes or what they do since I usually just grin and bear it, but I feel that it has to be addressed that the Killers offer a pretty wide - for what is available - selection of gameplay for the player who is doing the slaughtering. Stealth, strategy, or balls to the wall violence. And I personally can say this is definitely a good thing.\n\n3. The Survivors\nAgain, with the classes I normally don't mind - especially in a game where 'class' is so loosely defined - but it seems that the Survivors almost always can outclass the killer when it comes to skilled players. This includes juking, perks, healing, and the entire shabang. Even if it's intentional, I don't like that the survivors can quite literally just stand in the way of the killer and heal eachother so quickly that they cannot be touched (As told from a friend, two Claudettes simply blocked his path to their dying friend so they could get out).\n\n4. The Maps\nAlthough the maps are a tad varied in their own right, they have many, MANY different bugs and issues that come with it. They all have exploiteable spots, though thankfully the developers are working on them. Even so, I feel it's good to mention that they are simply too favoring for the Survivors, or the Killers depending on the map. A good example is that the farm maps almost always end up being a killing spree since there are very few obstacles to actually get away with. Now some might say that's a good thing - but, how in the world are you supposed to get away with such a small amount of running space? A lot of the time it's near-impossible to get away from a Hillbilly who is chasing you through the fields, or a Wraith stalking your every move while you're forced to be out in the open. And then there's the McMillan maps that have consistent and always obscuring obstacles at every turn - which only make it easy for the Survivors that can move and weave so much insanely more powerful.\n\n5. Blood points\nOf course, currency systems. At least there's no paid scams in this, so I can't complain too much. However I feel that the game slowly becomes a grindfest around the level of 20 and onwards unless you get near-perfect scores (which, at least for me, is very hard to do without purposefully farming). And even besides that there's some essential problems still prevelant in this. After all, if a Survivor leaves the Killer gets points - the other way around, the Killer can potentially de-rank a Survivor simply because they can. And that's terrible.\n\nOverall:\nI think this game is good - but not as a fully released game. It should've stayed longer in beta to fix more of the constant and buggy problems so it isn't so hard to enjoy. Do I recommend it? Not in it's current state. Am I still going to play it? Yes, because I have it and I may as well try to enjoy the silky sweet milk of the idea before it sours for me, because in truth it's a solid idea with a good base that simply is failing to top most of my other multiplayer games.\n\nEDIT: I've been playing it a bit more, but I got exhausted by the fact that the servers seem even more broken than before, making it near-impossible to get in a game in the first place. At this point, I've stopped playing until they fix the issues that literally prevent me from playing. Even then, the bugs don't seem to be stopping any time soon and to be honest I'd refund this if I could. It's a great idea worked poorly and a mess of a game in it's current state. A definite 'no' from me.","timestamp_created":1470113450,"timestamp_updated":1471639454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505882382392883301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24664245","author":{"steamid":"76561198097456070","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":547,"playtime_at_review":5383,"last_played":1660184054},"language":"english","review":"joke perk.","timestamp_created":1470113386,"timestamp_updated":1470113386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494117677211761475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24664185","author":{"steamid":"76561198139717304","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":15186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2775,"last_played":1631478680},"language":"russian","review":"Раньше игра была лучше....

This game is full of bugs, glitches and a really unbalanced game as a whole. I really wanted to like this game but I just can't.\n\n1. Good luck finding a lobby, you can spend 10-20 minutes trying to find a game becauase of Failed Lobby errors and the ones you do find there is probably a 70% chance the killer is going to back out.\n\n2. Matchmaking is horrible in this game. If you are a new player rank 20/level 1 be prepared to get slaugtered by a rank 1 killer with full perks on a consistant basis. so much so that you will wish you never bought the game so save your salty tears.  \n\n3. Team play is virtually non-existent, The game is supposed to support team play but it never really happens... get hooked? chances are you are not getting saved.. working on a generator? chances are your the only one becuase.. one teammate is playing dwight and hiding in the basement locker.  one is doing nothing but runing around trolling everyone trying to work in generators and the other one is just crouching in a corner waiting for everyone to die so they can take the hatch.\n\n4. Game play is really unbalanced in favor of the killer. its understandable that the killer is supposed to be scary, overpowering and survivors should use stealth to avoid the killer but once the killer sees you just consider yourself caught 70-80% of the time as they have nerfed most of the things available survivors can use to get away.\n\n5. Glitches galore.

Let me adress some of the pros I feel this game has; this game can actually be pretty scary, I have let out a few screams as jump scares are eminant in this game. Also, as people may say this game is repititive I must disagree, I feel that each match played will be different as you end up with a new set of players every time, sometimes you may luck out as other times your teamates will not help you at all if you are placed on the hook. Next at the current state the game is in, I belive there is many changes the Devs could work on for the future. First, the ranking system the ranking system frustrates me to no end, I feel as it should be easier to up your survivor rank instead of the agrivating pips. Next, hook camping, this is a major problem that ticks me off so much. PLEASE come out with some system to where the killer cannot sit at the hook making it impossible for your team-mates to get you. Lastly, I want to let you guys know, that this game is loads of fun despite the few problems it has, I hope you will purchase this game as it is constantly being updated! I cant wait to see what will come in the future! And feel free to add me if you wanna play together!\n\n\n\n\nEdits: I stand by the review, game is much more polished, a must buy.","timestamp_created":1470106247,"timestamp_updated":1518760304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24663079","author":{"steamid":"76561198037525211","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1500,"last_played":1569112926},"language":"english","review":"Game is great when playing with friends...

Slow, and clunky at times.\nOVERALL\nDead by Daylight is by far my favorite horror game. The maps you play on randomly generate the locations of the objectives, the objects you can use to escape, and the spawn points for every game. More importantly, you are running for a person, not an ai, meaning there is much, much more to contend with. The game is fairly easy to pick up and play, but new survivors should be ready to get reamed, and new killers be ready to struggle to catch your prey. This game is all about paitence. If you have that, you can learn. If you can learn, you can play. If you can play... Well then...

And since then, I found myself playing it again and again.\n\nThe Feels:\n\nAs the survivor:\nFrom initially playing the game for the first 5 minutes as the survivor, I was able to instantly relate to every horror trope the ‘victims’ deal with in most if not all horror themed multimedia. The constant dread of a being more powerful then you lurking within the shadows, able to strike at a moment’s notice. What was meant to be a moment of triumph turns into pure fear as I failed the skill check, I can feel the gaze of the killer right on me, even from across the map, as I scramble to hide I can hear him, I can feel him, but I cannot see him yet I know he is close. I hold my breath as I see him searching for me and unfortunately captures one of my comrades and hooks them. And next I have a swirl of feelings, the need for survival and altruisms for my team mate, all of which I have made fun of watching the actors/actress in horror multimedia who ran into the same issues. There are times I have swallowed my fear and charged against my need to flight to save my comrade, at times it is successful and other times I find myself dangling on the very hook I rescued them. But then again, running away for freedom with my tail between my legs has its own reward, even if it means leaving my team mates for slaughter. \n\nAs the Killer:\nAs the Killer I am felt with this mix of power and excitement, like a twisted game of hide and go seek, I run past the areas in search for the survivors, trying to anticipate where they would go and hide. My field of view may be limited to first person but I am granted with power to harm them. I curse out their names when they power up a generator or dismantle my hooks, and nowhere to be seen at the location. Yet, a grin cracks on my face when they fail a skill check, I watch them crawl around or fall into one of my traps, I run over with intention to pluck my prey from there mortal plane. Even for sheer joy I rev my chainsaw/bell for the full sake of making the survivors uncomfortable, so they are aware that I am ever present and looking for them.\n\nEnd of Feels\nThe Good:\nI have found the controls to be responsive on both keyboard and game pad, however I noticed that the game pad controls are limited to only the gameplay and not the menus. \nThe sound design is horribly wonderful; this is the kind of game to play with headphones on where the subtlest sound cues can alert you when the killer or survivor is nearby. The sound track perfectly matches the mood for both players alike, without being repetitive. \nAlso I’m in the camp that I enjoy the randomization of the leveling unlock system, each character (killer and survivor) have their own dedicated level. You level up by gaining blood points by acting on the objective and aiding your team mates. And you can spend your points anyway you see fit, if I gain blood points while playing The Hunter I can spend those points on the Survivor Meg. \nWith the blood points, you use to unlock nodes in the blood web, these nodes can unlock perks, items or one-time game boosts. However, what the blood web has to unlock is randomized for each and every character and level, so what 5 players of the same level will not have the same perks/items unlocked.\nPersonally I like the randomized nature, in my view the perks and items are not game breaking, I have seen people win with 0 perks and items and fully decked out characters lose. \n\nEnd of Good\n\nThe Bad:\nThere are technical and balance issues within the game:\n-\tTimes after a match I will have to force restart the game before I can connect to another lobby.\\\n-\tThe game will lag out causing the FPS to go all the while from 10 FPS to 60 fps even though I am rocking 20 mbps and a computer that has a GTX 980 Titan, I7 processor, 16 gbs of ram and a SSHD.\n-\tThere was one instance as the killer I hit one of the survivors (Typically 2 hits and you are down, but after 1 hit they get a speed boost for a few seconds) and they were launched right across the map from the opposite end were I was standing, fortunate for the survivor they lived, unfortunate for me I had to find them again: I didn’t.\n-\tThe killer is the host for the Lobby, so if you are in a party with friends and want to swamp out the killer with a different player everyone has to leave the party and rejoin with the different killer.\n-\tNo Dedicated Servers: You are at the complete mercy of the killer’s internet speed if the match will be stable or laggy.\n-\tAlso I would caution you not to play past 12 am, that’s were I have noticed most of the trolls start to come out, but that has been my experience.\nEnd of The Bad\n\nIn the end this is a fantastic game, that pulls you by the scruff of the neck and fully immerses you with all the emotions someone would find in a horror flick. There are technical and balance issues abound yet the developers have twitch videos often and take community feedback to heart.\n I still want to play this game when I get the chance and I fight for my life as a survivor or take away their lives as the killer.\nThis is the game to play with your friends, enemies, coworkers and loved ones \n","timestamp_created":1470070790,"timestamp_updated":1470070790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24654931","author":{"steamid":"76561198285198699","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1537863633},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾，一直卡在Launch Error这，如果点取消进游戏在准备界面就会无限闪退，试过各种办法，我还把系统升到了WIN10，还是没卵用，这游戏时间将近6个小时就是我一直尝试的后果，现在还是不能玩，连款都退不了，擦擦","timestamp_created":1470069830,"timestamp_updated":1470069830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl66/o9YCc8WGXg=="}
