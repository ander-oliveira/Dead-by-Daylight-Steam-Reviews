Easy to understand mechanics, and an in-depth talent system to customize characters the way you want to play them.\n\nCons: This game features the most toxic community I have ever encountered in my life. There seems to be a common trend of survivors bullying killers post-game, especially if a killer wins. Since the game can be somewhat scary (at times), I've wondered if mob mentality or bullying is actually a coping mechanism for survivors to \"stand up\" to what they're afraid of...? Maybe? In any case, this game requires some tough skin to play. Would not recommend to anyone looking to have fun.","timestamp_created":1590619631,"timestamp_updated":1590619631,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622713208198547363","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69912956","author":{"steamid":"76561198162697550","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":146880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1133,"playtime_at_review":13438,"last_played":1660340338},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy divertido para jugar entre amigos y poder jugar en equipo","timestamp_created":1590619328,"timestamp_updated":1606424216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506688416004180908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69912761","author":{"steamid":"76561198256851639","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":14010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1095,"last_played":1645911908},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom\n","timestamp_created":1590618999,"timestamp_updated":1590618999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69912346","author":{"steamid":"76561198178068635","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":38087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":649,"playtime_at_review":33345,"last_played":1660505928},"language":"english","review":"I started this game right in the beginning and I have to say that through the years of experience it truly is a good game.

all the hate that you can think of about Servers, bugs, and game being un balanced when someone doesn't want to play like the others. Well This game can be frustrating although there is the other side. It's a great party game, that being said it's not competetive but it can be challanging if you wan't to learn looping and builds.\n\nThat's why you may spend a tons of hours in the game. And still get more with new content, released always on time. It's just perfect if you want a good Coop game with regular month-to-month updates. They are keeping player base healthy even if some problems will never get solved. I still like and appreciate the time I've spent in it.\n\nPerfect choice if you want indeepth horror-coop game based on perks, but relatively easy to get into. Well just be prepared to have some free time unlocking all may take a while... if not forever. Most of the DLC characters can be obtained without buying DLC, so just play the game.","timestamp_created":1590606492,"timestamp_updated":1590606650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69904283","author":{"steamid":"76561198217373029","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1328,"last_played":1654718238},"language":"greek","review":"camp is annoying but the game is awesome","timestamp_created":1590605953,"timestamp_updated":1590605953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/pbgq/ICe/nUigI="}
