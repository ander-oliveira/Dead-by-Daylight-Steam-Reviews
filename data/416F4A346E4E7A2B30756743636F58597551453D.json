There are so many bugs in the game, hitboxes make me want to die, and the lack of help from devs is kinda pathetic. Killer is only fun at low levels when survivors are clueless, but if you find someone who knows how to run you around the whole game, then you will finally knock them down, as all 5 generators are done and you've already lost. Not to mention, most killers are immensely underpowered, and any killer who has a power that is not good at \"the chase\" has basically no hope for winning in higher ranks. As a survivor, it always feels like if the killer swings, you will take a hit. The hitboxes are broken, the mechanics for escaping are atrociously flawed, and if you aren't teamed up with 3 friends, you are likely to be grouped up with clueless people who can't tell left from right. If you find this game on sale for $1, then by all means try your luck, but don't expect much out of it.","timestamp_created":1549059414,"timestamp_updated":1549059414,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516148686408996582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48698718","author":{"steamid":"76561198137894027","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":425755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5083,"playtime_at_review":340736,"last_played":1660595880},"language":"english","review":"If I were to rate Dead by Daylight out of ten, it'd be around 8.5/10. I've been playing the game since the first month and at that time it was about a 10/10 cause i loved the idea of the game when it first started. I've been playing Dead by Daylight since the 1st month of it being released.\n\nDead by Daylight right now is top selling in horror and it has a good reason.\n1. It has added a bunch of scary killers along with movie killers.\n2. The maps make the gameplay more scary with the OST and the sound effect.\n3. The game itself is scary but for those who have played as long as me don't get scared often.\n4. Blood and Gore in the game with amazing mori's showing off the killers final act on a survivor.\n5. The thought of being trapped forever suffering from the entity while you try and escape but there isn't a real escape out.\n\nDead by Daylight isn't perfect, but it's far from bad. The game just needs to lay off updating the game with DLC's, and focus more on fixing the bugs in the game itself. My opinion for Behaviour is still stop giving us new DLC's every 3 months since it's just adding more bugs such as when console people couldn't play the game for like a week without major lag and crashes.\n\nI've been playing dead by daylight 1/3 of my life and almost reaching 6000 hours shows that I enjoy this game still, yes i hate the game sometimes, but it's a love-hate relationship. If you want to buy this game, please buy it. It's a fun horror game, since they added perks, killers and survivors can have different builds which can make this game last forever. (even though there isn't a story mode in this game.)\n\nYes, I believe this game is good and dare I say \"PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR.\" but this is where i met my best friend of 4 years and i don't think i could give up this game. I've put a lot of my time into this game and I've been accepting the new things Behaviour adds into the game. Please buy this game if you have the money, I promise, it's worth your $20 or however much the game is.\n\nI understand those who disagree with me, and you all can make good points, but this is my opinion and I stand by it. Have a good day to those who read this review and good night.","timestamp_created":1549058230,"timestamp_updated":1648167170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48698588","author":{"steamid":"76561198217456291","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":186524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113956,"last_played":1641067897},"language":"english","review":"best game ever","timestamp_created":1549057738,"timestamp_updated":1549057738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517259359359741211","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48698518","author":{"steamid":"76561198213873732","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":7334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":47,"playtime_at_review":3548,"last_played":1660412416},"language":"russian","review":"-","timestamp_created":1549057475,"timestamp_updated":1551544646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48698419","author":{"steamid":"76561198398617765","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":86103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13585,"last_played":1585496583},"language":"german","review":"drecks spiel, nur bucks eckelhafte laggs und idiotische spieler, nicht empfehlenswert;

     这款游戏于2016年上线至今，大环境下的游戏体验多半是良好的，上手难度不算特别高，对萌新玩家友好许多，BUG也相较以前也少多了。游戏模式相对来说较为单一，但是可玩性较高，许多人屠玩家都提高对自己的要求来增加游戏乐趣，比如：信仰锯、人皇不倒翁、手电救命俠、双飞无配件....等等等等，随着玩家水平的提高，游戏竞技感就越强，开放商也积极的平衡人屠之间的差距，在单排路人局的时候能感觉到团队合作方面越来越强了，许多人类玩家（不是好友的路人玩家）在游戏中仍会优先救队友，并不盲目只为自己的利益。虽然这么说，但仍存在不好的游戏数据，在游戏本身没有约束的情况下，有个别玩家选择极端玩法，破坏游戏本身的体验，自己也没有乐趣也破坏了别人的体验，这无疑是自私的，比如：贴脸守尸（皮脸是我个人遇到贴脸守尸概率最高的屠夫）、无作为拔线、人屠双排（人类中有屠夫的好友并使用其他外置语音沟通或使用人类技能给屠夫报点）、不参与任何团队合作或是救助行为（在需要他救助的情况）的队友等等，这都影响了其他玩家的游戏体验，希望这些都是个别现象也希望这样的个别现象能逐渐减少。\n你可能是因为被这样不好的体验打击了，自己也变成坏玩家，但是你的队友并不一直都是坏玩家，总是有好的队友在为你努力，也请你坚持做一个好玩家~\n可能你是一个萌新，还不懂得如何救人，结算界面可能会被队友抱怨，没关系的，每个萌新都是这样来的，也请你努力变成一个可靠的队友~","timestamp_created":1548998945,"timestamp_updated":1548998945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48682745","author":{"steamid":"76561198884045789","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":29509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":258,"playtime_at_review":2506,"last_played":1660435092},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1548997723,"timestamp_updated":1548997723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48682674","author":{"steamid":"76561198152176630","num_games_owned":768,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":215209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":878,"playtime_at_review":78886,"last_played":1660431440},"language":"schinese","review":"有很多差评说的是关于bug以及存档及加载的问题，虽然这些都很糟糕，但我个人更反感这个游戏的核心。\n\n简单来说，就是游戏双方玩家所需要的付出差距问题。\n这个问题在2.0更新后变得尤为显著，原本的版本人类爱皮，喜欢逛一逛大街，所以整个游戏下来没什么问题。但现在板子要比原本少了，逃生者有了一种危机感，所以问题变得明显了。\n\n一个逃生者在游戏中需要完成两件事，修机和躲避屠夫。修机要做的，就是找到一台高十几米标志性的发电机，坐下来，按住鼠标左键，完成偶尔出现的带声音提示的qte。运气好的话，你一整局下来可能都会在干这个，而这个怎么看都和“技巧”靠不上边的任务就是你通往胜利的绝对车票。不过，要注意的是，要小心一个叫毁灭的厄咒。不过要解决它也很简单，你只要绕着地图跑一圈，看到一个燃烧的骷髅图腾，然后按住左键就ok啦，这个甚至不需要qte。而且，如果是玩过一段时间的玩家，找这个想必很快把。如果和朋友一起玩耍的话就更好了，只要有一个人带一个叫“狩猎经验”的技能，大概平均一分钟就能搞定这个（屠夫四个技能中的一个位子）吧。\n\n那么躲避屠夫要怎么做呢？你要做的就是听到心跳后跑到一个板子后面，如果时间充足的话，再和他围着板子绕上几圈，最后一击砸烂他的狗头。只要不是少见的短板，他就是再拼命追你，一分钟以内也碰不到你。没办法，他还是选择把板子踢了。而他踢板子的时间，绝对足够你跑到下一个板子前了。另外，如果你稍稍有点经验的话，你还可以板子窗户一起下，反正所需要做的也是一样的，不要犯傻被骗，按着shift和wasd来到窗户前，按一下空格，任务完成。不需要反应力，不需要身法，不需要枪法，只要你对地形记的熟，还可以试着闭着眼睛遛！看身后的大块头屠夫跟头笨猪一样翻窗踢板，是不是超有成就感！！什么？你不小心上钩了，没关系，游戏里每个逃生者（大概）都有三次机会！下了钩咱继续遛！\n\n我们来看下杀手（除了护士）想玩的好要做什么。\n\n你要对地图有个较为详细的了解，清楚哪里可能会有人。你要掌握基本的追人技能，包括何时翻窗，何时踢版，怎么套路，怎么假动作，怎么藏红光，怎么逼走位。你要熟练使用你的右键技能，陷阱类的学会在哪里藏陷阱，追逐类的何时哪里开技能。你要点出适合屠夫的技能。和人类不一样，屠夫的每个技能都非常关键，并且没法一套通用，得学会自己搭配。你要掌握自己技能的配件，以挑选这一局适合的玩法。再进阶一点，你要有全局的掌控力，保住哪几个电机，怎么样走位不会暴露图腾但又可以守护图腾。你要学会选择你的目标，辨别哪个会玩哪个不会玩，怎么给所有玩家施加压力......\n可是，即便如此，没有高墙你面对板子还是套路不了，还是要踢，还是要来到下一个板子前重复一样的乏味枯燥且没有精神奖励的一系列动作，还是要追着逃生者完成三遍机械式的翻窗动作。即使你心里清楚让你来逃生你也能做到这些，你身为杀手还是要硬着头皮追，因为你没有选择。有选择的是逃生者。\n\n作为一个非对抗游戏，我主玩杀手时，却在一遍遍的重复追逐中，质问自己究竟谁才是那个非对抗中的弱势。看着对面势力的四个大脑，他们轻松休闲的任务目标，再看着我一个人在这绞尽脑汁，想方设法套路，试图掌握那一个个困难的右键技能，而最后看着总结画面制作人对我努力所表达的由衷赞赏：“恶灵失望”；我实在搞不清这个问题的答案。\n\n这个游戏分明有12个杀手，其中却有2/3甚至3/4的杀手都要面对这个问题。\n\n为什么？分明我是杀手，为什么主导游戏的并不是我的技术，而是得完全依靠对面的失误？为什么看似这么多的选择里只有护士（也许有个怨灵）才能完全依靠自己的技术来主导游戏？\n\n这个问题的最终答案，也许就在护士里：在很多时候，一旦逃生者遇到了一局开场就砍翻全场的护士长，会选择集体拔线。他们这样激进的外在行为反应的是一个更深层次的矛盾，那就是自己怎么选择怎么逃跑怎么遛，面对护士都没有还手之力的无力感。怎么样？是不是听上去很惨？是不是可以理解我们冠冕堂皇的逃避行为了？\n\n你在高段所遇到的每一个走地屠夫，都面临着这种无力感。\n\n可是他们不能拔线，他们在看到一群会玩的逃生者时没法用那么方便的借口脱身。\n\n而结果，就是把把处决，把把护士。人类和杀手挨个体验自己的技术无处可用的脱力感，有的掉段去新手区虐菜了，有的上来就开始qte模拟器了，有的开始守尸了，有的把把带上顶配红处来物理上提升自己的“上限”了。恶性循环。\n(不过我有一说一啊，护士对逃生的碾压要比逃生对走地的碾压公平些许，好歹人家是“优秀技术碾压弱者”，而不是“普通技术但简单难度碾压弱者”）\n\n大多数成熟的游戏机制，是竞技的双方考验着同样（至少基本类似）的技能检验：枪法，身法，团队配合，意识等。而即使像求生之路对抗那样的完全不同的技能测试（我们都知道人类玩的好要比感染玩的好重要），最后就结果来说也是每队都得当一次人类跑过同样的图。\n\n再看看这个。\n\n不要以为你叫非对称对抗说真的平衡非对称了，相反，你这类游戏最难搞也最需要的就是一个平衡点，因为一旦有问题，双方都会因为体验和预想不符而感到失望。\n说真的，物理上来说，当你看到一个竞技游戏的核心是绕板子跑和qte时，怎么想都很有问题了吧？你真的以为非对称是什么流行概念吗？十几年前的马里奥聚会就有1v3模式了，你以为为什么到两年前才开始有人做这个？因为害怕平衡性问题呗。\n\n不过嘛，就目前来看，大多数玩家才懒得考虑那么麻烦的东西，弄点什么花哨酷炫的人设和衣服这些大家都最喜欢的东西，咱们肯定也一脸高潮地把钱交出来了吧，游戏设计那种东西谁在乎啊。\n\nP.S：哦，还有一点，这游戏玩家平均素质和pubg差不多，大量巨婴出没注意。\nP.P.S: 想体验双方都有趣但又公平的不平衡对抗的朋友，可以去别的游戏那试试运气。比如那个进化...哦，凉了。那看看十三号星......嗯......或者试试我们国人的灵魂筹码......实在不行，等去年噩梦上steam看看吧。","timestamp_created":1548997371,"timestamp_updated":1555851910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":90,"votes_funny":16,"weighted_vote_score":"0.72809678316116333","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48682555","author":{"steamid":"76561198392165070","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":20401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14190,"last_played":1656757449},"language":"thai","review":"เจอเเต่พวกเฝ้าไล่เเต่คนที่พึ่งโดนเเขวน
