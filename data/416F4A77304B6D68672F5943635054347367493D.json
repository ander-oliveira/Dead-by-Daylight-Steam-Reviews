[/b] Depuis quelques mois, les développeurs ont eu la soudaine idée d'appliquer un matchmaking basé sur le skill, d'où le nom \"SBMM\". Sur le coup, il n'y a rien d'alarmant. Le problème, c'est que le temps d'attente, qui était déjà assez long et chiant, est encore plus long et chiant. Ils arrivent à rendre pire la situation, si ça ce n'est pas génial ! On tombe aussi sur les mêmes personnes vu que le MMR trie les joueurs donc si on tombe sur des toxiques, c'est la boucle ! Et puis c'est censé se baser sur le skill, hmm j'en doute fort car le nombre de joueurs incapables de réparer un générateur sans louper un test ou qui ne veulent pas jouer (WTF !?) que je croise est affolant. [u] Donc le MMR, c'est non. [/u]\n\n- [b] L'équilibrage. [/b] En effet, l'équilibrage des deux camps (Survivant, Tueur) est à la ramasse. Par exemple, les survivants ont la capacité d'annuler les compétences de sorts des Tueurs en purifiant le totem associé (la compétence sera donc annulée de la partie actuelle). À l'inverse, le Tueur peut annuler les compétences de bénédiction des Survivants en \"éteignant\" le totem associé (la compétence peut donc être réactivé sur le même totem). Vous voyez le problème ?\nL'équilibrage des compétences, c'est pareil. Un lot de 6-7 compétences revient à chaque partie au niveau des deux camps. C'est dommage parce que le jeu propose une multitude de compétences mais certaines sont vraiment faibles ou même inutiles alors que d'autres sont utilisées à chaque partie. Des compétences sont parfois pétées et sont réajustées un mois plus tard, c'est donc vite chiant.\n\n- [b] Les bugs. [/b] D'accord, il y a en a dans tous les jeux mais là, ce n'est juste pas possible. Des bugs de collision, des bugs au niveau des menus, des bugs sonores, des bugs visuelles etc. Et pour qu'ils soient corrigés, il faut être patient et encore, certains sont toujours présents depuis un bon bout de temps.\n\n- [b] BVHR en personne. [/b] Je me demande sincèrement si les développeurs nous écoutent. Pour sortir du contenu qui n'est pas nécessaire ou que la communauté n'a pas demandée, il y a du monde. Pour sortir des skins toutes les deux semaines à un prix absurde (je m'en fous, j'en achète pas), il y a du monde. Pour corriger les bugs (un Tueur non disponible pendant un mois etc.), il n'y a personne. Pour couronner le tout, quand il y a un problème majeur comme un bug qui impacte le jeu, les développeurs ont la bonne idée de nous passer des codes de points de sang (monnaie en jeu) pour \"compenser\" l'erreur de leur part. Ah bah c'est super ça !\n\n- [b] La communauté. [/b] Pitié, c'est quoi ce truc ? Les survivants qui t'insultent en fin de partie parce qu'ils ne se sont pas échappés, les tueurs qui t'insultent parce que tu as fait une action qui ne va pas dans leur sens et j'en passe. \"Ok, bah réduit la fenêtre du chat\" - Oui donc mais il n'y a pas que ça en fait ! Les joueurs qui jouent n'importe comment, les joueurs qui ne veulent pas jouer, les joueurs qui se déconnectent pour des raisons ridicules (\"oh non le tueur est sur moi, je vais me déconnecter\"). Dans le jeu et hors du jeu, c'est vraiment infâme.\n\nAprès 700 heures, je me lasse du jeu, les décisions prises par les développeurs me déçoit (NFT financé par un DLC, financement d'un jeu de société par la communauté, une quantité importante de DLC etc.), la non-optimisation du jeu et les corrections tardives/inexistantes des bugs ruine mon expérience, la communauté me dégoûte. Que ce soit pour les anciens joueurs ayant abandonnés le navire et qui souhaitent revenir sur le jeu ou pour les nouveaux joueurs, [h1] je ne recommande pas Dead by Daylight.

There are still issues with the game, even though I started out as a \"Killer main\", over time playing killer overall became less fun, and I would be considered a \"Survivor main\" now, but I still want to see the dev team give the killer more tools to end some chases quicker, also doing something about potential \"infinite loops\" that would occur if they took out Bloodlust as well, a lot of the current maps would have to be reworked to make this work.\n\nAs far as the community, I have streamed this game for many years and have met a lot of small and large streamers throughout my 4 1/2 years of playing and have made a lot of friends in the community. Obviously there are bad eggs out there (And some very toxic streamers too), if you want to avoid it however it is fairly easy since you can disable after game chat and just not watch streamers who you feel are \"toxic\".\n\nMy only other issue was something that happened to me personally with my Legacy when I lost my save file a few years ago, I was told in the email they sent that I would get bloodpoints to compensate the levels I lost, and I would eventually get my Legacy Trapper and Jake back. After they made all the rare cosmetics available for everyone (I actually had the very expensive Purple Ace Hat owned beforehand), they said they would not be giving anyone their legacy skins back, which upset me quite a bit as I now lost a unique item I had and was not getting the other back after being promised I would. It has always kind of left a bad taste in my mouth and as I work in a customer service industry, was definitely not handled properly, as I also had screenshots to prove my Legacy skins.\n\nSorry review went on a little longer than expected, so the TL:DR version is Overall: Good Game, always adding new content on a schedule which is nice and at least changing up perks every once in a while to spice things up is nice, upset a promise was broken about Legacy which meant a lot to me and takes my opinion of them down 1 notch.\n\n","timestamp_created":1606431692,"timestamp_updated":1606431692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532640933990478516","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80478544","author":{"steamid":"76561198202383088","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16022,"last_played":1651793101},"language":"russian","review":"Классная игра только страшно че то :D","timestamp_created":1606431612,"timestamp_updated":1606431612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80478181","author":{"steamid":"76561198211157517","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3596,"last_played":1628279205},"language":"english","review":"top","timestamp_created":1606431499,"timestamp_updated":1606431499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80478101","author":{"steamid":"76561198320153627","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":21492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":135,"playtime_at_review":21056,"last_played":1659593356},"language":"english","review":"The most recent update has destroyed everything I enjoyed about the game.

Tho the goal of this game, stopping survivors from repairing the 5 out of 7 generators or on the other side attempting to repair those 5 generators whilst being hunted by the killer is on the surface level quite good on it's own, but ultimately this game is about a cat chasing a mouse. And that is brilliant. Brilliant, because the game developers made sure that every cat and mouse would have a unique way of chasing each other.\n\n[h1] And here's how they did it:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Introducing new Killers/Survivors/maps every 4 months with unique abilities and perks that spice up the game with every update. Thus making the game not stale and easy to pick up for new or returning players.\n[*]Making said Killers have distinct powers and playstyles like ambush, stealth, ranged, zone-defense with different types of traps, etc.\n[*]With new perks added to the game both competitive and casual players can match and create new builds that let them play in their own style.\n[*]Having a high skill cap that keeps pushing players to become better than others sometimes leading to game changing revelations.\n[*]Not to mention the best part of a successful game - it's replayable as hell. With every chase you think how to improve so next time you would last longer ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Unfortunately this game isn't perfect, here's why:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]No idea why, but there still is no separate casual and competitive modes! Implementing these changes would fix crying about \nexperienced players having to play with newcomers. Competitive players could rest easy knowing that casuals wouldn't interrupt them. \n[*]Sadly there are no statistics. Such as: \nescapes, percentage of victories, kills, escapes, heals, kills with the help of memento, pallet stuns, pallet drops, average playing time of specific Survivors or Killers, statistics of praise.\n[*]Ranking system was not created for competitive play (i can't go deep in this discussion because it's a thread of it's own).\n[/list]\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]\nIf you are a competitive person this game should definitely be in your library. Putting aside all the secondary things (bs bugs and poor matchmaking/ranking system) this is a very satisfying game with a unique twist on a game of cat and mouse.","timestamp_created":1606427794,"timestamp_updated":1606427794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508928596973419189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80465908","author":{"steamid":"76561198802599918","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1606428157},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, в которую играет 4 долбаёба в катке\nПозже я понял, что долбаёбов в игре 5","timestamp_created":1606427791,"timestamp_updated":1606427791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80465725","author":{"steamid":"76561198102443530","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20281,"last_played":1636988559},"language":"tchinese","review":"齁勝","timestamp_created":1606427739,"timestamp_updated":1606427739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80465668","author":{"steamid":"76561198226159916","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":144070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":859,"playtime_at_review":104984,"last_played":1660586833},"language":"czech","review":"Super rage hra :)","timestamp_created":1606427725,"timestamp_updated":1606427725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552238762378692627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80465644","author":{"steamid":"76561198047959024","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14183,"last_played":1605157392},"language":"english","review":"This game is over 4 years old and I keep coming back because of the great updates and endless fun.
