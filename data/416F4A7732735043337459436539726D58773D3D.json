Terrible execution. Since when did it become acceptable for studios to publish broken games?\n\nUnfortunately for the developers, their idea that \"in order to counteract one over powered game mechanic is to add anohter\" isn't sustainable and makes for an overall unenjoyable experience. Many times players are left wondering why such stupid mechanics exist.\n\nThe game has alot of potential, but I really do wonder what goes through the developers heads when they are creating mechanics for this game. No, a killer shouldn't be able to teleport through walls because that destroys the whole premise of the game \"escape from the killer\". No, a killer shouldn't be able to go invisible; premise destroyed. No, surviors shouldn't be able to see each other when one gets put on a hook; premise destroyed.\n\nFinally, the absolute failure to implement basic game functionality is very dissappointing. Note that this game is NOT in early access; this is the full game. With that being said, you might expect a form of match making, the ability to create lobbies and the ability to queue for matches? You'd be wrong.\n\nAll in all, the game could do a whole lot better by simplifying and focusing on what makes it a cool idea. Get the basics right, then work from there.","timestamp_created":1472096698,"timestamp_updated":1472097008,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524020731449127197","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25125179","author":{"steamid":"76561198000359152","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":978,"last_played":1473346665},"language":"english","review":"First off, let me say that I never review games. But this game... hot damn, I'm throwing in my 'thumbs down' for this one!\n\nStarted off buying this game during the recent sale. I thought, \"Wtf, why not? For $16 this game looks hella fun!\" At first, it was... I could live with the glaring bugs (my killer got stuck in a plank once and couldn't move... AT ALL... imagine how fun that was!), the occasional & incredibly one-sided matchmaking, and the douchebaggery of the general populace that plays games like these. Surprisingly, despite all of those things, the game was still actually a blast to play!\n\nBut then two days later a patch hits. And it literally changes everything.\n\nLet's get something straight: the game was enjoyable, but it's like... meeting someone with a seductive voice wearing a paper-bag over their face. Eventually the mystery bores you and you rip off the bag only to let out an ear-piercing shriek that would make even Jamie Lee Curtis proud.\n\nIf you buy this game, here is what you can expect:\n\n- You will start off totally new at Rank 20 and every character at Level 1 (derp).\n- You will waste hours upon hours in a Korean-like MMO MF'ing grind-fest to get shit perks (all of your perks are RANDOMIZED!!! You can go MANY levels and get nothing but shit-tastic perks over and over again)!\n- You WILL DEFINITELY be paired up against Rank 1-10 players whose characters are Level 60+ with 4 Very Rare Perks that will either gut and skin you like a one-eyed GDMF'ing doe, or they will run 3x faster than GDMF'ing Usain Bolt--YOU WILL -NEVER- CATCH THEM.\n- There are glaring balance-issues on both sides of the coin--but none of that matters when you're facing people who have sunk 300+ hours into this game and have abilities that will DESTROY you.\n- Failing all this BS, if you want to play a Killer, the ONLY way you'll level up is by being a lame-ass camper. This will lead to a few things: 1) You being bored out of your GDMF'ing mind, 2) People will whine and bitch worse than fat-ass pigs strung up by their puny corkscrew tails in post-game chat about how you have no skill, insulting your mother, your heritage, and just about everything else you can imagine (AKA: entire community must play this game when they're not busy playing League of Legends or DOTA), 3) You will get jack shit for Bloodpoints (EXP) and it will take you hundreds of hours to level up before you can try ANY other kind of strategy. \n- This game is obviously skewed towards players who want to sink 600+ hours into a game. Unless you're that fucking dedicated towards a $20 game, don't bother.\n\nDid I mention that EACH character/killer has their own level? Want to try someone new? Cool! You get to start that whole damn cycle all over again and suck for another hundred hours!!!\n- BUUUUUGS!\n- You find out quickly that the developers cannot seem to even remotely catch the majestical & mythical unicorn named 'Princess Balance.' Everything is skewed to high hell.\n- After the excitement of buying a new game wears off, you'll realize very quickly that this game is actually an Early-Steam Release game, disguised as a Full-Release game and the quality is nowhere near what you expect from a fully developed/play-tested game.\n\nNow, is this game fun? It can be. But 70-80% of the time it really isn't--whatsoever. Because of glaring bugs, heavy back-handed game changes, and mind-blowing matchmaking issues (the likes of which I have NEVER seen in ANY other game that even claims to have one), it's just not even worth the investment IMO.\n\nBut hey, why not just waste $20 and decide for yourself? Then you too can leave a review for this bug-ridden game that has no semblance of actual matchmaking!\n\nHey... I'm only pointing out that now you can't say that your wingman didn't warn you 3x over about taking the well-endowed girl with a paper bag over her face home.\n\nHonestly... what did you really expect was under that bag anyway?\n\n(edit 8/24/16: NO--matchmaking is NOT fixed.

Progressiion is being lost for some (800 hours). The game has a lot of critical failure bugs, which force a person into a large disadvantage.  Its very much a strange game because it has a ton of success, but is largely floundering under its own self inflicted wounds. They really need to get a new QC department. As the current game is in a sad sape. \n\nHere is a list of the monsters you will face and the bugs the have.\n\nNurse: -broken- Can't blink in a lot of maps her core ability.\nShape:-Broken- Can't focus on players who are partially obscured.\nBilly:- Broken- Hit box doesn't perform correctly.\n\n\nThese are just the ones i've verified. But what is most flabergasting about all of them is that the game creators and developers, say \"We are having a hard time re-creating that error\".\n\nOriginal review:\nBasically the developers fix the game and then break it in a new way. However, the game remains fun. They have also worked out a lot of the kinks from the release. \n\nThere are still issues but I don't feel like they are grame breaking. People get salty, but you get used to it and eventually will enjoy the flavor.  \n\nWhat makes the game instresting is that it is possible for all 5 players to win and all 5 players to lose. The killer is kind of like the \"drama\" you chase people put them on hooks and wait for them to die for points. However, it is far more profitable to let them get saved and chase them again. So there is this kind of eb and flow to the game that makes it very intresting and unique.","timestamp_created":1472093130,"timestamp_updated":1526831708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25124557","author":{"steamid":"76561198087565754","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1471076206},"language":"schinese","review":"辣鸡游戏，不如彩虹","timestamp_created":1472092335,"timestamp_updated":1472092335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527891159057617188","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25124500","author":{"steamid":"76561197990496166","num_games_owned":502,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":63906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13169,"last_played":1635111962},"language":"english","review":"Hide and Go Seek: Not Its Must Die Edition","timestamp_created":1472092025,"timestamp_updated":1472092025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25124370","author":{"steamid":"76561198134423132","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1577573197},"language":"english","review":"FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME AND LET ME FIND A MATCH FUCKING FAGS BOOMBALAGS","timestamp_created":1472091309,"timestamp_updated":1472091309,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495495498180389404","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25124369","author":{"steamid":"76561198084557612","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1647892879},"language":"english","review":"plz fix before i hang a nigger","timestamp_created":1472091301,"timestamp_updated":1472091301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25124337","author":{"steamid":"76561198131699504","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2455,"last_played":1644015991},"language":"english","review":"90 percent of the time i try and play it says no matches found please fucking fix this now untill then the game is trash its fun when you can actually play but thats only like once a hour.","timestamp_created":1472091151,"timestamp_updated":1472091151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25124285","author":{"steamid":"76561198066969626","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":154851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2222,"playtime_at_review":21343,"last_played":1660540409},"language":"english","review":"Is the game fun solo?

I'm writing this review at 00:56 as my brother play's it and constantly keeps getting \"Failed To Join Game, Failed To Join Game\" As he Clicks Find Lobby I find this quite annoying but despite it's choppy gameplay and loading, it certaintly is making improvements, for now I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to deal with things I've said above, this game can certaintly scares the life out of you when you play it at night with friends, now that I've typed what I think, let me get in to what I think the Pros And Cons of what the community of this good developing game thinks. (Note: This is an extremely long review)\nPros:\n \n- Super Fun To Play\n\n- Let's you play both sides of the game (Killer Or Survivor)\n\n- Terrifyingly good (Really Scary).\n\n- Fun to play with friends.\n\n- Quick and easy to enjoy.\n\n- Excellent design on maps.\n\n- Excellent detail on the killers\n\n- Has a story which most games like these don't have\n\n\nCons\n\n- After a while and many years (If you play for that long) you will probably get bored of the same thing. (In other words they must add a different gamemode to play)\n\n- (As Said above) Choppy gameplay and loading. (Depending on your computer)\n\n- Killer constantly camps you giving you no chance to escape or do anything.\n\n- People leave the lobby just to annoy other players. (Note: Probably should disable that option to leave for killer and survivor)\n\n- (Note: This is a new dlc available now as you read this) Added it purely to make the game better yet it needs to focus on more important updates (Which are all said above)\n\n- Has a story but doesn't have much of a backround to it (Which people need to know otherwise the cutscenes at the beginning when you load up Dead By Daylight are really just cutscenes with no meaning)\n\n- Needs to have new ways to escape other than repeating the same old thing (Maybe a way to kill the killer by using some form of weaponry, It'd be cool to see the killer's status say \"Perished\" or maybe using some form of gear or crafting to climb over the gate? Note: Only trying brew ideas around the community, not saying this will happen)\n\nWell folks it's now 1:36 and I think I shall be heading off, either way this has been an extremely fun game but needs to strive for improvement, for now I'm leaving this a not recommended game until they mend the proper things that need to be mended, I'm not saying you shouldn't get this game, I'm saying you shouldn't get it if you don't like experiencing buggy gameplay or just irrotating simple things that just get on your nerves, either way it's fun to play, scary, can play with your friends, and most of it's designs (Maps and killers) are well thought out and looks nice when playing which any horror game needs, this has been fun to review and I certaintly hope this shall help developers and the community in the near future for this well thought out game, Good Luck!\n\nUPDATE 29/04/17:\n \nFantastic! The DBD developers has listened to us, and fixed lag! The only reason you would most likely have lag now is because of your PC, but to the people with good PCs, are finally able to play the game on Ultra, they've added tons of new content/DLC, which gives some backround on the new killers and survivor, plus including all the things the abilities do! I'm so happy to see that people can finally play the game with some enjoyment, now there is really only one thing left to fix, camping seems like it ruins gameplay and not many people should do it, and maybe even add more ways to hide so it will decrease chances of camping happening every game.\n\nNow there is only one thing left to say before I put this review how it is, my brother (talked about above) can't play, everytime it loads up, it crashes, he has tried defragging the PC, doing CCleaner and all that stuff I have no clue about, we did detect something, its something to do with system32 files, which we can't delete or change (obviously), if community developers or anyone knows how to fix this, please get in contact with me or my brother, bye for now :D.\n\nBrothers profile link: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032560245/\nMy profile link:  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077759514/","timestamp_created":1472085558,"timestamp_updated":1493463602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502543151378631592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25123175","author":{"steamid":"76561198140215490","num_games_owned":473,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1299,"last_played":1536955992},"language":"english","review":"Do you like wasting your time?

Probably second place to Rocket League for me when I rank games I spent 20 bucks on and have had hours of fun.  Content is consistently uploaded too.  If I had one bad thing about this game to say, it would be matchmaking system.  You'll go into matches as a low level player against killers that have 2-4 perks unlocked as a higher level killer.  Not very fair, and super frustrating to be on the hook within the first minute.  \n\nI'd like to see the developers add in voice chat (whisper) when you are within a few meters of another survivor.

Dazu kommt noch, dass dadurch „normale″ Gruppen, die sich eben nicht über Skype unterhalten, benachteiligt werden, da meist mindestens 2 Überlebende abgelenkt werden und zum Haken gehen und derweil eben nicht an einem Generator arbeiten können, um die Zeit so gut wie möglich zu nutzen.\n\nGlitches: Sie gibt es immer wieder und werden gefühlt nie gefixed. Gerade bei der Anzahl möchte man manchmal Glauben, dass die Entwickler ihre Updates eigentlich nie testen, sondern dann einfach abwarten bis die Community anfängt zu schreien.\n\nEs gibt zwei Dinge, die ich insbesondere ansprechen möchte:\n- Wenn dir Killer direkt nach dem Spielstart das Spiel verlässt, bekommen zwar alle Überlebenden 5000 Punkte für das Entkommen, aber sie verlieren trotzdem das mitgenommene Item und die Opfergabe. Bei der Opfergabe ist es halbwegs nachvollziehbar, aber das mit dem Item ist absolut ***. Ich hab z.B. schon einen grünen Werkzeugkoffer mit einem sofort reperatur Zahnrad verloren.\n- Außerdem stört mich, dass der Chat abbricht sobald der Killer nach dem Match die Lobby verlässt. Manchmal möchte man sich eben noch mit einem anderen Überlebenden unterhalten. \n\nBalanzing: Ich glaub bei den Entwicklern läuft sowas try and error ab. Fangen wir aber mal gegliedert an: \n-Maps: Die meisten Maps sind relativ ausgeglichen und haben auch ihre Eigenheiten, aber da gibt es ausnahmen: Hoodenfield! Diese Maps hat so viele Probleme... Das erste ist, dass sie einfach viel zu klein ist. Sie ist zwar auch viel verwinkelter, als alle anderen Maps, da fest jedes Haus mehrere Stockwerke hat, aber das ändert nichts daran. Eines der ersten Probleme ist, dass es dort im Vergleich viel schwieriger ist Generatoren zu finden, da man nicht so einfach nach den Masten Ausschau halten kann. Das führt dazu, dass man einfach wie blöd jedes Haus durchsuchen muss. Dazu kommt noch, dass die Map eben zu klein ist, denn der Radius indem man die Generatoren hören kann ist trotzdem derselbe (Geräusche werden eben nicht von den Mauern beeinträchtigt etc.). D. h. der Killer muss eigentlich nur auf der Hauptstraße im Zickzack laufen bis er einen Generator hört und tada! Des Weiteren sind die Maps auch für die Killer sehr unausgeglichen. Das Gedankeninstitut zum Beispiel ist für den Kettensägenmann ein Horror, wobei der Fallensteller einfach unschlagbar ist, da es dort sehr viele enge Türen und Durchgänge gibt, die mit einer Falle einfach Blockiert werden können.\n\nMike: Ich weiß nicht was in den Köpfen der Entwickler vorgegangen ist, als sie Mike released haben. Im Vergleich zu allen anderen Killern hat er einfach schon viel zu viele Fähigkeiten. 1. Das Schleichen: Vergleichen wir das mal mit dem Geist. Bei beiden Skills kann der Überlebende den Herzschlag nicht mehr hören. Mike kann aber sofort aufhören zu schleichen und damit auch sofort den Überlebenden schlagen. Der Geist hingegen muss ersteinmal ein, zwei Sekunden warten, um sich wieder sichtbar zu machen, und dabei ertönt eine laute Glocke, die den Überlebenden sofort vorwarnt, so dass dieser Weglaufen kann, bevor er den ersten Schlag abbekommen hat. 2. Der aggro Modus?: In diesem Modus kann Mike jeden Überlebenden mit nur einem Schlag niederstrecken. Vergleich zum Kettensägenmann: Mike muss sich 3 mal Aufladen und hat diese Fähigkeit dann für 60s. Der Kettensägenmann muss sich für jeden Überlebenden extra Aufladen und wenn er dann nicht trifft, weil der Modus relativ schwer zu steuern ist, dann muss er sich wieder aufladen. Außerdem 60s??? Das ist einfach viel zu lang. Wenn man das mal mit der durchschnittlichen Zeit pro Match vergleicht (in etwa 10 min) dann sind das 10% der Zeit. Bei zwei Aufladungen sogar schon 20%. Wenn Mike sich auflädt, einen niederstreckt und aufhängt und dann Campt. Bis die Fähigkeit abgelaufen ist, ist der Überlebende schon halb Tot und hat damit keine Chance mehr ein zweites Aufhängen zu überleben. Und jeder versuch in früher Abzuhängen führt nur zum eigenen verlust einer Changse. Als Nächstes hat er mit seinem kleinen Messer eine verdammt große Reichweite. Ich glaube sogar die größte Reichweite von allen Killern. Und zu guter Letzt: Mike wird angezeigt, wenn ein Überlebender in seiner Blockrichtung ist! So kann er z.B. Überlebende finden, obwohl der Spieler den Überlebenden eigentlich nicht gesehen hätte.\n\nIch würde mich sehr Freuen, wenn die Entwickler endlich mehr Wert auf Balanzing und Bugfixing anstatt auf neue Inhalte legen würden. Heute am (11. Mai 2017) wird schon wieder ein neuer Killer und ein neuer Überlebender erscheinen und ich will gar nicht wissen, wie viele Fähigkeiten der Killer diesmal haben wird.\n\n########### FIXED 19.

If you love horror like I do, and you love the idea of being hunted by a killer, you will be able to appreciate this game and what it is trying to be!","timestamp_created":1472050755,"timestamp_updated":1480118143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25114067","author":{"steamid":"76561198043285755","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":21468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5407,"last_played":1658265844},"language":"english","review":"The TL;DR Version: This game is AMAZING, worth far more than its price for its insane replayability, but needs dedicated servers to prevent Killer tampering issues, and some ****MINOR**** balancing issues.\n\nSo, personal overview: I got this game because a really good friend of mine had raved about how much fun it was and how much he liked the concept. I did my research, read reviews, watched gameplay, and although it was all mostly positive, it did NO JUSTICE to how much fun this game is. Even when really stupid things happen and I have to take a break from it for a day, I still get super excited to come back to it. \nPROS: \n-The Killer is a real player.\n-So are your allies.\n-Objective Diversity is great (I'll go into that later.)\n-Character Diversity and Balance are relatively refreshing.\n-Real Terror.\n-A Horror Game where you can play as the terror.\n-The Game gets better, and more replayable with experience.\n\nCONS:\n-The Killer hosts the game, so lag and lag-switchs are a big problem (for now)\n-Some unique character perks are pretty bad. (I'm looking at you, Dwight.)\n-Some perks are broken/do not work. (I'm looking at you, Iron Will.)\n-As the game is in its early stages, some glitches are still pretty bad. (I'll go into that too.)\n-Useless item: Flashlight. (I'll mention why)\n-Matchmaking system needs some work, but is \"aight.\" (Worth the wait, tbh.)\n-Killers are often pretty rude. (Not a proble mwith the product though! I'll mention this.)\n\nOk, so things about the game that are really important to know before getting into it, in a little more depth:\nThe objective diversity can be different depending on the player, killer, and how you feel.\nThe primary objective of the game is to get generators done and escape without dying, but there's also the role of sabotage and plundering. Sometimes you'll have someone who will spend the game destroying hooks so that the killer can't actually kill you without a special item or getting you in the perfect situation (under perfect circumstances for the sabotaging player), and you may make your primary objective finding the chests around the map to leave with a new item, and focus on finding the trap door instead of working as a team. This is a selfish victory, but you get a lot of points for it. Every game you'll find a different mix of 4 players picking one of those three primary roles. You'll also find the altrusitic player who's entire role is getting ready to save people from hooks, but that role can go with any of the previous 3.\nSo onto the most annoying issue with the game. Killers host every game. There are no dedicated servers (yet?). So when a Killer wants to use a lag-switch or anything like that, it's REALLY easy. It'll always be super obvious, and you can try to report them, but they still ruin a match and lower your rank. Also, cheating aside, some killers are just SUPPER laggy. You can have the craziest most amazing connection, but a killer's connection will get you stuck on a window for 30 seconds while they hit you twise really easily, and put you on a hook while your frame is still on a window. Since timing is everything when escaping a Killer, you need a reliable connection, and the lag does not effect the killer nearly as dramatically as it effects the player, so you'll find that the killer benefits from lagging, while you crash and burn and lose rank. :( This problem, however, could be easily fixed by dedicated servers, so we can cross our fingers this gets taken care of before too long, and thus does not ruin the game.\nSo, onto glitches. There arent all that many, but the few existing glitches are pretty rough. The worst of which is that some games, you'll pop in without any of your perks, and you'll be able to see your item going up your arm instead of in your hand, and you can not use it. Thankfully, if you put your item in a chest and pick it up again, it will function and not just get deleted when you escape, but you will still have to function without perks. That's the worst of the glitches, the others are very minimal, like Killers phasing through objects thrown down, but that problem isnt too huge since they still get stunned, and it doesnt completely screw you over(most times).\nAs a whole, items are actually really balanced and great. The most stupid ridiculously powerful item, the Skeleton Key, is incredibly rare, and therefore not too much of an issue, while the Toolbox, Medkit, and Map serve their purposes PERFECTLY in a balanced manor. However, the flashlight is a completely useless item. You can stun the killer if you shine it in their eyes for at least 5 constant seconds. The only problem with that is that you have to be pretty close to the killer to do it, and he can just down you in that time, or look in another direction and down you without any problem. The purpose of the flashlight is for multiple people to use it at the same time, but there is not enough of a communication system in the game for that to be in any way functional, so it's just a useless item.\n\nAll the nasty bits put out to dry for everyone to see, the game is actually still absolutely incredible. Everything that's wrong with it right now will probably be fixed, and the game will be crazy wonderful from that point on. A lot of issues like these in most games are problems with the premise or concept of the game, and aren't nearly as fixable as the issues with this game.\n\nWith the glitches, I give the game a solid 8/10\nWithout, it s without a doubt a solid 10/10.\n\nI would with no doubt or hesitation reccomend this game to anyone who could remotely appreciate a good survival horror game.","timestamp_created":1472050509,"timestamp_updated":1472050509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25114027","author":{"steamid":"76561198281115314","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":29075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9894,"last_played":1659162157},"language":"latam","review":"ta weno el jueguito ste shetao","timestamp_created":1472050372,"timestamp_updated":1472050372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2sPC3tYCe9rmXw=="}
