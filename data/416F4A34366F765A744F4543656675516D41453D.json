Il est meilleur de jouer avec ses amis en survivant mais si vous jouez en solo il est préférable de jouer tueur.

(ou troll en faisant des 360 ou autres choses mais après c'est vous qui voyez)\nPoints Négatifs:\n-Le jeu est rué de bugs (Le personnage qui ce tp parfois, la barre d'action qui disparaît lorsque l'on soigne quelqu'un, etc...)\n-La connection en jeu dépend de la connection du tueur qui souvent lag.

latest version I played was 5.3.2 (2,214.1 hours on record)\n\nTo make it short: I highly advise to not support these developers unless they finally fix the issues many players are complaining about for years. I would really like to see these developers to run out of money so that they finally hand over Dead by Daylight to actually competent developers. To summarise the average impression of the developers: High incompetence, low interest in the community and greedy for money. There are so many issues that I can't even list them here. It seems they designed DbD to allow player to harass and insult everyone they want without any consequences.\n\nARCHIVE [ TOME / RIFT ]\nChallenges can be selected to unlock points, backgroundstories and progress in the Rift to unlock cosmetics. Without a 10$ Pass you can only unlock about 20 cosmetics. About 45 cosmetics are locked behind the Pass including the 10$ in ingame currency which you can only fully get back if you reach level 69 of the 70 levels in the rift which takes a lot of time. With the Pass you also unlock the ability to invest more money to buy levels.\n\nAIMASSIST\nThere is actually an aimassist for the killer in DBD. It doesn't always work and if it works I may work in various ways. The aimassist may target a different survivor than originally aimed for, may cause the killer to run into an object beacsue the aim assist makes the character move directly towards the survivor even with an object between or makes the attack hit a survivor that would have managed to evade the attack. \n\nBAN/-CONDITION\nMaybe the best examples for the developer incompetence are banconditions. Playing really unfair and toxic seems to be no reason to be banned, which is the way the developers support toxic players. Instead players are likely to get banned, when the developers screw up a mechanic/perk/etc. again even when there was no problem for many patches and a player is getting WITHOUT realizing an advantage. Players searching for bugs or trying to reproduce them in PRIVATE and UNRANKED matches are also at risk if they are just fooling around with some bugs/glitches no matter if the do so to contribute to bug reports. Based on what I have read and seen they just push the fault to their customers instead of improving themself.\n\nBUGS\nWay to many bugs and glitches. Less than in the past but still far to many. With 5.0.0 a new map was released and was basically immediately removed from the matchmaking.\n\nCOLLISION/HITBOXES\nThe hitboxes in DBD are larger than the actually characters. Only very few times an attack visually connects as there may be still a meter distancebetween weapon tip and the survivor but the hit still counts. These hitboxes combined with the broiken collsion detections results in further frustration. Many times already I have noticed players getting hit only because the got stuck.\n\nCOMMUNITY\nThe community turns more and more toxic with the support of the developers which appear to not care the slightest.\n\nDEVELOPERS\nFrom my point of view the developers don't care to get DBD finally balanced and mostly free of bugs. DBD was released more than three years ago. It still seems to be an alpha version. If they would have announced what DBD would become I would have requested refunds immediatly. Every time a new patch is released new issues are present as well. The amount of issues fixed may be equivalent to the amount of new ones. I personally intent to avoid every other game thses developers work on.\n\nDLCs/ADD-ONs\nThere have been many new survivors and killers been added to the game. The licensed one much be purchased with money while original characters are either free or purchaseable ingame. To actually get all achivements players are forced to spent more money for new characters. It's not wrong to provide add-ons in general but with the lack of new gameplay and the many issues more content should be free.\n\nEAC EASY-ANTI-CHEAT\nDBD is using EAC which caused my trouble many timess already without using any cheat/hack. I had many game crashes where I lost items and had to deal with EAC error messages prevent my game from starting. Lagswitching is still working and isn't uncommen but EAC seems to not do something about that. In short: Trouble for those who just want to play fair.\n\n\nINPUTLATENCY\nInput latency hardly predictable so some times your inputs are resposive but the next match they may be delayed so that skillchecks (mini event where specific zones must be hit to prevent action regression and maybe getting a bonus) are getting unfair. Inputs may also be stored shortly. No longer pressing an action button may still let an action trigger unintentionally. Sprint through a window makes a noise and gives a notification to the killer. Sprinting to a window but vaulting slowing would be silent. It may more or less often happen that the sprint key is no longer pressed a fast vault is still triggered. \n\nMATCHMAKING/LATENCY\nThe current matchmaking still connects experienced and inexperienced players together resulting in very unfair situations that ruins the fun for both types of players. Leaving a lobby results in a five second cooldown before a new lobby can be opened or getting connected to a lobby. A lot of players leave because of a terrible ping (300 ms or more) and get punished by the result of developers deciding to not use servers but P2P. Servers were announced for Summer 2019 but the should have been in use a few years ago to avoid lagswitching or a lot of delay related situations. I expect the servers to be malfunctioning for weeks if not months. There are latency issues about every second match.\n\nOFFERINGS\nOfferings (items that may influence points, maps, starting positions) are used once the match loadingscreen starts instead of the real match start. Since many players crash during the loading screens a lot of offerings are lost. These items can be expensive ingame as well as being rare. Some killers like to dc just to let survivors loose their offernings.\n\nSUPPORT\nThe support ignores most e-mails and the answers I revived were mostly insufficient. I asked several times for technical support as well as a few times for a statement related to the way issues are getting addressed/ignored and got absolutely ignored. With several other players I wrote a mail stating several concerns, bugs with media proofs, possible solutions to many issues players complain about for years and the clear intention to improve the game without any ill thought. Ignored without any response.\n\nRANKING/EMBLEM SYSTEM\nSurvivors and killers have four different categories they get emblems for. As the killer the highest emblems are awarded when the killer prevents the survivors from repairing gens, keep chases short and sacrifice all survivors. As Survivor you get the best emblems for repairing generators/opening the exit gates, keeping all other survivors alive, don't get downed and stay hidden from the killer/escape from the killer. The last emblem about staying hidden is very unfair as the emblem requires an offensive playstyle instead of a defensive one. I already had a few times escaped without being seeing by the killer but I only got a bronze emblem (worst < best: No emblem, bronze silver, gold, iridescent). A certain value of emblems is needed to rank up.\n\nVERDICT\nWhile the main concept is still interesting this \"developer\" team seems to be highly unfit to actually use the potential. There are by far too many issues and only few matches are actually fun to play. I recommend to not buy it unless it's really fixed or wait for it to be f2p.","timestamp_created":1517990271,"timestamp_updated":1636736543,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564822733402252197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39903624","author":{"steamid":"76561198312679139","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":81726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38415,"last_played":1659353421},"language":"english","review":"Each match is very fun, thrilling, and suspenseful.

Each match lasts about 15-20 minutes so that's about 400-450 matches.\n\nThe game is awesome in most respects, but the only variation you get is really from killers.  Survivors have some interesting perks that change them up a little, but for the most part they're all the same.  One survivor might give you increased healing speed when healing others, one might have a faster crouch movement, but all in all the variation isn't much.  Picking your perks is what gives you a little variation, which can help you in interesting ways during the match, but isn't really enough to keep the game feeling fresh.\n\nKillers on the other hand is mostly what makes the matches feel a little different, for a while.  One killer can lay traps, making them dangerous to you even when they're a good ways from you.  One killer can throw hatches to hit you from a distance, etc.  And most of the time you won't have any idea which killer you're facing until you're in the match and either see them or hear their special effects\n\nThe game is very fun, and jump scary when you're new b/c you're still being taken off guard, however it gets old repeating the same things over and over again.\n\nWhat this game needs, more than new killers and new survivors... is new game modes and match types.  Every match is currently the same.  Map might look a little different each time because object placement on the map is randomized, but it's still the same map.  Your objective is also the exact same every match.  Repair a few generators which power the exit gates, open the gates, run out, don't die.\n\nWhat might make the game fresh again is a new game mode where rather than repairing generators, you're piecing together clues spread around the map which give the survivors an ability to kill the killer.  The more survivors that survive and team up with all the clues, the more powerful they are, the fewer survivors that survive to find all the clues, the more difficult it is to kill the killer.  No exit gates.  Play till you kill the killer, or get killed.  Something like that.  Maybe a match with 2 killers under different rules, where not only are the killers trying to stop you, they have to fight and compete against each other too.  Like Jason vs Freddy.\n","timestamp_created":1517973673,"timestamp_updated":1564362013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39900274","author":{"steamid":"76561198426237196","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14254,"last_played":1590331404},"language":"koreana","review":"고인물 겜인줄 알고 망설였는데 생각보다 데린이가 매우 많습니다.큐 잡으면 너나 할 것 없이 의존하기 어려운 플탐 50 시간 아래의 친구들이 모여있음. 처음엔 공포에 떨다가 나중엔 살인마 찾아가게되는 즐거운 힐링 게임.","timestamp_created":1517971669,"timestamp_updated":1517971669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39900188","author":{"steamid":"76561198365190384","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1654351019},"language":"schinese","review":"现在真的一言难尽","timestamp_created":1517971379,"timestamp_updated":1627388952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39898183","author":{"steamid":"76561198024823888","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":31554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6428,"last_played":1649109371},"language":"english","review":"A unique assymmetrical pvp game that has the depth of mobas like LoL or Dota but have lower match time, distinct teamwork requirement (survivor) or game sense (killer).

Пусть не всегда они отвечают максимальной прорисовкой, но всё же масса карт сделана просто восхитительно. Одни из моих любимых локаций: Гнилое Болото (Бледная Роза) и Красный Лес (Обитель матери). Сам игровой процесс интересен своей неожиданностью. Даже зная карту на 100% вы не можете предугадать тактику игры противника. Первое время игры было даже не немного пугающе :), а первые часы после покупки игры периодически подскакивал от неожиданности происходящего :). В Dead by Daylight достаточное количество разносторонних персонажей для игрового процесса предоставленных после покупки игры. Но если вам захочется чего то более эксклюзивного, то вы можете приобрести дополнительные DLC так же предоставленные разработчиками (впрочем, я так и сделал :)). На днях мне прилетел страйк с обидой, что я кого то из игроков оставил висеть на крюке (хотя кажется, в этом раунде я принял такую же учесть :)). Не вижу смысла обиды в данной сложившейся ситуации. Ведь игровой процесс рекомендует играть командой, но не обязывает. Тут выбирать только вам: быть одиночкой или играть с командой, но не забывайте о том, что если вы плюнете на общество, то общество утрётся, а если общество ………:)\nНа мой взгляд, разработчики внимательно относятся к исправлению багов (я в этом не спец, но при каждом обновлении с интересом читаю перечень исправлений и изменений). Безусловно косяков в игре хватает, но всё же игра от этого не становится менее интересней . Так же приятно, что поддержка данной игры продолжает реализовываться и проект не заброшен на ранних стадиях.\nВ целом я думаю, что на момент написания данного мини обзора я отыграл достаточно мало (72 часа), что бы понять и увидеть все прелести игры.\nP\\S.
