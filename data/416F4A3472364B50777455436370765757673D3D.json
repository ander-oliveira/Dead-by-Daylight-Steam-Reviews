The game only just came out and I am really enjoying it so far, I've had lots of fun and lots of moments where I wanted to smash my keyboard (but didn't). \n\nThere is not that many bugs as you'd expect. Sometimes in stead of using your steam account as the character it picks up your computer as the character, made me think that I lost all my progress but really just had to sign out and sign back into steam. That is the only bug I have ran into so far.\n\nThe fact that you can not play with your friends in a public match made me a little mad. Yes you can play a game with your friends in a private match but you don't get anything toward your level and it's not as fun as playing public match. So if they could implement it where you can play with friends without having to play a private match that would be really cool. \n\nIn all the game is incredible and if you are thinking about buying it you really should.","timestamp_created":1466828042,"timestamp_updated":1466828042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547816991806030273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23778737","author":{"steamid":"76561197987098772","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2150,"last_played":1616648246},"language":"english","review":"It's a fun game.\n\npros:\n- you get to play as survivor or killer (There is a small selection for both survivor and killer).\n- There's a rank system and you can get various items. However, they do get used when you enter a match.\n- The maps are big and creepy.\n- This game made me spill my coffee and burned my crotch. It was an intense moment when the killer is near you.\n\ncons:\n- Minor lag in a match sometimes. But it is not a severe issue for me at least.\n- The maps tend to be an outside environment.

However, the way they've implemented some aspects of it is completely broken. \n\nThere is a lobby system, where you get put into a random lobby. There is no matchmaking beyond this. If you're new and playing as a survivor, you can be put together with 3 other new survivors and have to escape from a monster player that is very experienced, with many hugely advantageous perks, items, and offerings. You'll have none of these, and you cant even see the killer name, rank, perks, anything until after the game, so you can't simply try to switch to a lobby more balanced for your level. This brings me to my next point. . .\n\nMost perks have a very clear advantage (more speed, less cooldown between attacks, break down barricades faster, see downed survivor outlines, etc for monster, faster healing, healing yourself without medic, sprinting, etc as survivor). If all perks were available for all players in the same lobby, I wouldnt find this an issue. But if you're a new player (and you can only equip 1 perk as a new player, and you'll only have a few common ones to choose from) and you're put against someone who has 4 ultra rare (read:ultra powerful) perks, your chance to win, and chance to have fun drop like a rock. Think that's enough? The high ranked players you can randomly be put up against can also equip offerings and items with attachments. Most of these are harmless, like add slightly more charges to a medkit or toolbox, or increase the chance to get a certain map. Some of these can be completely broken, including one killer offering that allows you to kill all survivors when they're downed instantly. This is basically a free win for any competent killer, as downing someone is mostly trivial, but keeping them on a hook is where the real challenge for a killer is. Do you camp the survivor on a hook, or try to stop more generators going up? None of that, because the killer used an offering that basically gave him a free win, with no counterplay, except. . .\n\nJuly 3 update - A patch fixed most of the broken perk issues. Section removed.\n\nSpeaking of winning games, there is a ranking system in the game. The most poorly made one I've ever seen in a video game. I've survived a round, activating 3 generators while distracting the killer for a decent time, and still lost a rank due to only gaining 9.7k points (you need 10k to rank up, any less and you rank down instead. 3k for 3 gens, 5k for surviving, the rest miscallaneous for skill checks, being chased). Instead, people have to rely on cheeseing the game to have a consistant way to rank up, such as purposefully getting hit by the killer for a few extra points, or purposefully allowing a survivor to wiggle free and regrabbing them due to being point starved if you instead go for the objective and try to kill the enemy team as efficiently as possible. It has been one of the most frustrating experiences in all of my time playing when I deranked after hooking all 4 survivors, but because a few of them disconnected before i got the 'sacrificed' points I didnt earn enough points to reach 10k. Quite frankly, getting blasted in the face by a spinbotter in CSGO is more enjoyable.\n\nAnd on to my last point... The bugs. Downed survivors can become ungrabbable, so you're forced to just watch as they crawl their way to an escape hatch while they're effectively invincible. You can also get stuck if a survivor drops a wodden pallet perfectly on you, ending your game. These wouldnt be a problem if they didnt occur so frequently.\n\nThe very, very worst part of this game, to me, is that there is actually something really, really fun and addicting in the game. Hell, I'll probably play the game some more over the week. However, I can't possible recommend this to anyone because, quite frankly, I've seen random free to play korean trash make better balancing and design decisions. I'd love to edit my review in a few weeks time for the positive, and I'd love to switch my recommendation from a \"No\" to a \"Yes\" because the concept really is fun and fresh.

The good parts of this game have slowly been drowned by an avalanche of terrible mechanics and decisions by one of the most embarrassing developer teams I've seen maintaining a competitive multiplayer game. There are many perks, characters, maps, offerings, systems, etc. that are just completely unfun to be on the receiving end of. Survivors are usually at the mercy of the killers decision to allow a fun match, especially at lower ranks where new players start out. Playing competitively will often mean denying the survivors a fun match because of the terrible ranking system. The truly fun and competitive way to play is enforced by the community, not the game. That is, if the fun parts even work correctly - which is not as often as it should be. It's especially terrible in this game where every second in the match is so precious. It's not uncommon as a survivor to get downed a few feet away from a window or from behind a pallet, or to have your exhaustion perks not function as they're supposed to. As a killer, it depends on which character you play. Some are worse than others.\n\nThis game does have a deceptively high skill ceiling and there's a lot of streamers who are really good at this game, watching them play can be very impressive. This game blends game knowledge, skill, macro play, and teamwork really well whenever it's allowed. It's a shame that the good parts of this game seem so hard to find. It makes me sad to have such negative opinions on this game because I used to think it was great - I bought it on release.

También podrás tomar el papel del psicópata tu propósito es proteger tu hogar de los extraños y si es posible asegurarte de que se reúnan en el otro mundo.\n\nLa mecánica es simple, tendrás dos formas de escapar la primera es poner a prueba tus dotes de mecánico y reparar 5 generadores, para así poder abrir una de las 2 salidas del sitio y huir, la segunda es esperar a que maten a tus compañeros y buscar una trampilla en el suelo por la cual escapar por la alcantarilla como la vil rata que eres.\n\nTras ser el primer título que juego de este estilo he de decir que es divertido, pero no llega a ser algo más allá de un juego regular, y es que al pasar un par de partidas el juego parece ser una beta pese a que steam y los desarrolladores digan lo contrario, y no me refiero a ello por aspectos técnicos (por que tiene muy poquísimos bugs y su optimización es aceptable al igual que sus graficos). Lo que lo hace parecer una beta es la poca variedad que se encuentra en el juego:\n\n[list]\n [*] 3 mapas que se generan aleatoriamente cada partida, pero son completamente iguales, solo cambian los sembradíos de trigo por rocas, árboles y por pilas de chatarra.\n\n [*]Las habilidades de los supervivientes son solo una tontería como que te dan 3% más de velocidad al correr o un 10% para acertar en lo quick time event, y su equipamento algunas veces inútil como llevar una lámpara para segar al psicópata tras apuntarle 4 segundos al rostro (ni te imaginas de lo difícil que es mantener enfocado el haz de la luz en su rostro durante 4 segundos eso sin contar que la lámpara solo será útil durante 8).\n\n [*]Hablando de los quick time event creo que fue uno de los peores desaciertos y es que se presentan para reparar el generador de energía como para curarte a ti o a un compañero donde si fallas harás ruido suficiente para atraer a el psicópata (y no critico esto de llamar la atención del psicópata).\n\n [*]La mecánica por parte del psicópata es igual muy monótona y es que basta con dejarlos incapacitados y colgarlos de un gancho hasta esperar su muerte.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b]No pueden hacer un juego tan pobre en mecánicas teniendo tantas ideas plasmadas en el cine.[/b][/u]\n\nY es que pueden darle más variedad al juego creando un escenario de una mansión muy obscura donde el asesino vaya alumbrando los rincones para encontrar a los supervivientes mientras estos traten de escapar de ella explorando la mansión tratando de buscar herramientas que los ayuden a salir, abriendo puertas y toparse con un cuerpo colgado que fue serruchado por la mitad a manera de screamer, darle terror al protagonista al oír el ruido de sus botas en el piso de arriba, reinventar mecánicas de trampas más allá del cepo tanto para el sobreviviente como para el psicópata (sin llegar a ser mortales para este), como romper un vidrio para que al pasar por ahí nuevamente se genere ruido o colocar la alarma de un despertador para que oculte los demás ruidos que se puedan hacer, cambiar la forma de arreglar los generadores dejar los quick time event atrás y hacer un sistema como el de skyrim o thief para abrir cerraduras y de esta forma que hacer que dependa de habilidad y suerte el poder arreglar un motor, que el asesino no solo los cuelgue para matarlos si no que les corte un brazo y ellos puedan escapar tratando de buscar a un compañero para que les haga un torniquete y evitar su muerte. \n\n[b]Hay tantas opciones que pueden hacer un juego terrorífico y esta gente se a quedado cortos de ideas.\n\nComo conclusión el juego es divertido, pero si no innova en cuanto a mecánicas está destinado a que en un par de meses quede en el olvido, pero por el precio al que esta es una compra aceptable.

Ich bin total verliebt und kann mich abends immer nur schwer davon los reissen. \n\nMan kann zwischen 4 Überlebende wählen, die alle unterschiedliche Perks lernen können oder eben auch wählen zwischen 3 Killern die ebenso ihre Perks haben. Man levelt jeweils mit dem gewählten Charakter und muss Blutpunkte investieren, die man während des Überlebens, bzw. des Spiels, für verschiedene Aktionen bekommt. Dabei ist es egal ob man entkommt oder eben nicht, die Punkte werden angerechnet.\n\nMan hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht 5 Generatoren anzuschmeissen, die überall auf der Karte verteilt sind, dabei ist wichtig, dass man ein wenig Teamplay beherrscht, da man oft nicht weit kommt, wenn man sturr den eigenen Weg geht und den anderen Überlebenden nicht hilft. Kommt es doch soweit und alle Teamkameraden sind getötet worden, hat man die Möglichkeit die restlichen Generatoren alleine anzuschmeissen oder man sucht die Geheimtür (Klappe im Boden)\n und flieht somit schnell. Allerdings ist die oft recht gemein auf der Karte versteckt. Das geht auch nur wenn man der letzte Überlebende ist, ansonsten ist die Klappe zu.\n\nDie Maps wechseln mit jeder neuen Spielrunde und man kann die Wahl der Map nur mit Opfergaben (die man im Blutnetz bekommt) beeinflussen.\n\nCONTRA:\n- Lobby mit Überlebenden Freunden ist nicht möglich, nur wenn man selbst einen Killer spielt kann man seine Freunde einladen, die dann logischerweise Überlebende sind.\n- Keine ingame Konversationsmöglichkeit, weder Chat noch Voice (vielleicht ist das aber gar nicht so schlecht)\n- Überlebensrang ist wahnsinnig schwer zu halten (Da wäre eine Überarbeitung notwendig)\n\nToll wäre auch, wenn an dem Spiel noch mehr Charaktere, Spielmodi (was anderes als Generatoren anmachen), neue Maps und diverse Kleidung hinzufügen könnte. Man kann aus diesem Meisterwerk noch soviel machen und ich freu mich schon sehr drauf, sollte das auch kommen.\n\nKlare Kaufempfehlung!\n\n\n#EDIT#\n- Man kann nun mit Freunden in einer Lobby spielen\n- Hacker/Cheater gibt es leider trotzdem vereinzelt im Spiel\n- Man sieht nun nicht mehr in der Lobby welcher Rang und Level andere Überlebende haben (Pluspunkt!) sondern erst nach der Runde\n- Erstes großes Update mit neuem Killer, neuer Map, neuem Opfer - TOP!","timestamp_created":1466805399,"timestamp_updated":1473006434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":55,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.794698417186737061","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23770742","author":{"steamid":"76561198074499614","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":44633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":48,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1660357491},"language":"spanish","review":"Una arena 4v1 donde los sobrevivientes intentan escapar de las manos de un asesino.
