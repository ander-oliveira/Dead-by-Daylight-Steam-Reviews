There are a lot of bad killers out there that will tunnel or camp the hell out of you. The ones I really don't like are the ones that stand at the hook and just hit you while you're dying for no reason. That said, with friends, the game is fun. \nWhile playing solo - you're going to get frustrated with the tunneling and the face camping. This is why no one wants to play survivor and killer queues are long. Changes need to be made to re-balance the game play.

Game can be fun and has a knack for being addictive in bursts, community lets it down by quite a high margin.\n\nWith over 700 hours balanced fairly evenly in both Killer and Survivor, I'd say I've experienced pretty much everything the game has to offer reaching max rank over and over on each side.\nIf you have friends and want to have fun this can definitely be a game for you, I see a lot of complaints about this game being unbalanced or not fair, just like every game yes it has those moments of maybe a swing shouldn't have hit you, maybe the killers lag makes it impossible to correctly predict movements and counter efficiently. But with over 700 hours I can say those moments were few and far between for the most part (some updates broke the game at points but were patched and fixed pretty quickly) yet I feel a lot of people who play this game regularly, are those with not a lot of mental fortitude. People seem to hold onto that one bad game and use it as a precedent for the entire game. Some people are just bad at the game which is fine, but cant admit that to themselves and instead decide to talk abusively to anybody who dares give them constructive feedback.\n\nIve also never quite understood the whole killer vs survivor balancing discussion, now im pretty good at both sides and like every pvp game in existence at some point youre gonna get stomped. But never did I feel like I died as survivor or lost as killer because of unfair game balance. Im pretty decent at the game but thats because I chose to learn it on more than a surface level. As survivor its important to learn killer powers and movements to predict their next move and counter on the spot, as killer you need to understand your power and look for survivor queues for the perks they are running. Is the survivor looking back constantly? bait out the dead hard, did you just unhook a survivor and they jumped straight into a locker or ran right back upto you? Decisive Strike it is. This games best gameplay is moment to moment and its a shame that the community lets it down so often. There seems to be a massive split of talent in this game, either people are really good or really bad, there sint really a middle ground and most of the time youll find a lot of the talented people are chill, they will gg you after a game if you run them well as survivor, or alternatively they will tell you the good job you did blocking loops if you outplayed them as a killer. The biggest problem in this game (not exclusive, talented people like to stroke their egos also but its a lot less frequent in my experience) is those that struggle with the games mechanics and who will die consistently through their own actions, yet will report you, abuse you in the end game chat and its just baffling that instead of learning the game on a fundamental level, they resort to racial slurs and abuse.\n\nYou'll find great people playing this game, that I can pretty much assure you, but you will without question run into people who will not be pleasant to interact with in the slightest. If you do decide to pick this up, go in with a carefree attitude and try to have fun learning the basics. Find a few people as survivor or test out multiple killers and watch yourself improve quickly.

The community is toxic (streamers are the worst) and the game has several exploits and ways to play around letting others play the game.  If you're into suffering and misery, by all means, play this game, but the fact that I have to play the meta to \"win\" is it really winning?  The devs know this is a problem and maybe I'll recommend this game after many many many patches and updates but as for now I do not feel like this is a good game.","timestamp_created":1657694413,"timestamp_updated":1660328228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118732767","author":{"steamid":"76561199121983629","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":603,"playtime_at_review":3115,"last_played":1660273693},"language":"english","review":"nvm this game the shit.","timestamp_created":1657692850,"timestamp_updated":1660024549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118732608","author":{"steamid":"76561199036206925","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2564,"last_played":1658480472},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mt bom, porém meio desbalanceado.","timestamp_created":1657692482,"timestamp_updated":1657692482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118732090","author":{"steamid":"76561198146375447","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":247,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1660219029},"language":"english","review":"respectfully worse than Wriday the Whirteenth.","timestamp_created":1657691409,"timestamp_updated":1657691409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118732048","author":{"steamid":"76561198087304846","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":14261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":206,"playtime_at_review":12972,"last_played":1659983407},"language":"latam","review":"abundan los tramposos que usan hacks y los desarrolladores no hace nada.
