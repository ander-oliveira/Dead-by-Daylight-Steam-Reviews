There are no winners here. Now we all get to sit in our booster seats and feast on Elmer's® Glue-All while watching how many rolls of Duck Tape® that they are going to go through while patching this together until the next pipe bursts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game by itself is solid so this review will disappear once the servers are of more stable quality. However, I get the strange feeling that there's a better chance of my alcohol / Full Throttle® dependency going away first.\nsmug_pizza_birdtrap.jpeg\n\n\n11/02/2019 - \"Dedicated servers will save this game!\" Fantastic. I knew this wasn't going to be implemented right, competent people on the BHVR team probably knew this wasn't going to be implemented right, some streamers knew this wouldn't be implemented right; so why in the fuck did the circlejerkers think that this idea would work.\n\n\n\n8/3/2020 - The newer devs are retards, gg.\n\n\n\n8/11/2020 - Consistent memory leak issues almost soft-locking pc on exit/crash, gaslighting myself into thinking my left click is stuck/broken when holding down for an action, INSANE killer queue times to the point where you could probably finish an Age of Empires II multiplayer match before getting into a lobby. Fucking hell, just burn it all down at this point and try again why don't you, BHVR? You would probably have an easier time rebuilding this from scratch than trying to pull out all the strands of spaghetti stuck in the haystack. All I wanted to do was grill and maybe play the videogame. We live in a society.\n\n\n\n3/31/2021 - Come back to manifest as a nightmare incarnation of piss-fueled Jimin only to see that there's chat filters now. In a game where you can ram your rod through someone who's prone on the ground, use said force of rod to lift them off the ground, only to then blow your load out their mouth. Where you can also pounce on someone, straddle them like a cowboy, then rearrange their guts. I can see why we needed to censor the naughty words. No swearing in my christian La Tomatina festival recreation. But to be fair if I had to say one nice thing about BHVR its that **** *** * ***** ** ********** ******* ** *** ** ** ******* **** ***** ******.\n\n\n\n7/28/2021 - BHVR, your newer artists seem to have a persistent issue not present in your previous art department team. They seem to lack the ability to actually make the assets they are assigned to actually look nice (exception is the Hobgoblin face change), not to say they aren't trying, I'm sure it's a very difficult and challenging task, but perhaps someone needs to check up on them every now and then to make sure they aren't dozing off too often in your lax work environment of friendliness and happy feels. What I'm trying to convey is that they took a fucking carving knife to Kate's face. Holy fuck and a half she looks like she chain smokes five packs of Winston's a day (Winston^tm tastes good like a cigarette should.). Also on a final note towards BHVR, SOUND CARRIES. Or rather, it is supposed to. The engine your game is built on has a natural sound occlusion that isn't bad but somehow you fuck it up. I mean, I'm glad you hired a third-party outreach program that hires deaf programmers but I don't think this was an appropriate task to give them. The cracked pipes held together by Silly Putty^tm and chewed gum are now falling apart, it's just a matter of time until it all comes undone.\n\n\n\n11/04/2021 - I want whatever the hell the art department is smoking. That carving knife spun around and made its way straight to everyone else. Christ all mighty and a half they look like bootleg Dishonored characters on meth. Art is hard I get that but that doesn't mean you have to make obvious changes. Sometimes subtlety is best. Also, it's not like you don't have references as to what they should look like, you have the perfect models in your fucking trailers.\n\n\n\n1/26/2022 - Why I haven't checked in on DBD in some time, I've been busy with other games I wonder what is happeni- OH GOOD HEAVENS. Holy shit, RUN. The developers are targeting individuals who are criticizing their decisions through the recent Q&A and invoking retaliation by removing account cosmetics. When your community is already on the breaking point and is only remaining from cost-sunk fallacy or ignorant optimism of a hopeful future and you pull this stunt? What the fuck are you doing? Criticism is a normal part of game development and striking back against those who speak out, (not even in an acid spitting manner mind you) is baffling at best and a manchildren's tantrum at worst. I normally don't say these types of things but go outside, hug a tree, sit on a park bench, feed the ducks, go for a jog, try that local bakery, feed the ducks, go into that history museum, feed the ducks, go back home, try stress release exercises, feed the ducks.\nWhat I am trying to say is that you should REALLY feed those ducks.","timestamp_created":1572473030,"timestamp_updated":1643226498,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55914044","author":{"steamid":"76561198336294922","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":680,"playtime_at_review":2286,"last_played":1660249894},"language":"english","review":"I take back my review.
