I was hoping the game would work seamlessly and thought I'd have fun playing this with friends, however I was horribly wrong. This game barely has any options, and while I understand that grass and fog have to be the same for everyone to avoid an unfair advantage, I'm pissed about not being able to tune the antialiasing method or motion blur, as this game appears to use either TAA, which I hate, or a terrible FXAA that makes everything slightly blurry even on the highest graphical settings. Not only that, but I found out that keybinding options are lackluster to say the least, and in a game that requires stealth there's no option for crouch toggle, meaning I have to hold down a key for minutes on end without any other option around it. Worse, devs had promised they would address the terrible control options on June, DURING 2016. It's been more than one year and after several paid dlc they haven't fixed any of the issues I've mentioned.

A good waste of money.  1. community is low for a supposed  Online MG which makes matchmaking difficult. 2. all players play together so high level skilled players with advance blood trees play with low level players whom dont know much about the game(since it doesnt give out an in game tutorial on how to play the game... yea cuz just reading about how to do it is gona make me a boss at the game....) which make it an unfair advantage for low levels since you dont get any blood point if you die.  2 since most high level player dont even play survivor, you only got high levels playing killer against a bunch of low levels but im sure if you put them in to different catagory's you would lose even more players because of it 3.alot of the killer characters are a little OP'ed especially The Nightmare.  Good news, 1.Great graphics and gameplay. 2. solid spooky atmosphere, and neatly made","timestamp_created":1509496829,"timestamp_updated":1509496829,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36179570","author":{"steamid":"76561198016566494","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":117216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42377,"last_played":1658831879},"language":"japanese","review":"購入はフレディが修正されるまで待つべき\n","timestamp_created":1509496436,"timestamp_updated":1509496436,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451398462057113647","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36179322","author":{"steamid":"76561198398356297","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":152335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":102,"playtime_at_review":12660,"last_played":1659798417},"language":"schinese","review":"其实刚开始让我评价的时候我是拒绝的， 第一，因为你不能让我评我就马上评，至少你应该让我试一下，我不想评价的时候，加了很多特技，说我用了该产品有多厉害，“咣当”一下，很假、很虚伪等等……这样其他买家看了一定会骂我，根本没有这样的效果，就证明卖家那个游戏是假的。后来我知道他们好评是有返点的，那么试了一个月以后，觉得还不错，我自己现在还每天都在玩，还介绍给我的朋友一块儿玩，来来来……大家一起来玩，后来我在评价的时候也要求他们也不要加特技，因为我要让其他买家看到，我玩完之后是这个样子的，你们玩完之后也会是这个样子的！","timestamp_created":1509495336,"timestamp_updated":1512984896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36179024","author":{"steamid":"76561198331890401","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":62239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":1713,"last_played":1659556573},"language":"spanish","review":"es un jugeo muy divertido , contiene todo lo que me gusta de un juego de terror  suspenso,miedotodo","timestamp_created":1509494145,"timestamp_updated":1509494145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36178901","author":{"steamid":"76561198062959844","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":65132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2875,"last_played":1639432441},"language":"french","review":"J'aime les petites parties.

Armutszeugnis nachdem es so lange so gut geklappt hat, dass es zumindest halbwegs spielbar war (da manche Bugs echt den WIllen wecken sich die Haare einzeln vom Kopf zu reißen).\nIch habe selten ein Spiel so abstürzen sehen. Zu Beginn war es mega spannend und schockend und man hat kaum genug bekommen und neue Killer/Überlebende haben einen neuen Spielaspekt mit eingebracht der echt interessant war. Meistens wirkte es am Anfang auch immer so,  dass der neue Killer ja viel zu stark sei, doch meist hat es nur 3-5 Runden gedauert bis man raus bekommen hatte worauf man achten muss, damit man eben bei genau diesem Killer eine Chance hat... bis Freddy kam. Dann hatte sich taktisches Denken und der Versuch ruhig zu bleiben auch erledigt.\n\nEs ist einfach nur grausig das Freddy jemanden nicht nur ohne Probleme verfolgen kann während man einschläft, was faktisch heißt das sich der Zeitpunkt an dem man das erste mal getroffen wird nur verschiebt, denn sobald man in der Traumwelt hängt man sofort die erste Schelle bekommt, nein es wird noch schöner! Sobald man es dann mit größter Mühe und Not geschafft hat zu entkommen muss Freddy nur warten bis man sich auch nur einen Meter zu weit entfernt dann weiß er auch schon wieder wo er suchen muss. Es ist also praktisch unmöglich diesem Killer zu entkommen.\nJetzt könnten ja wieder gewitzter Klugscheißer sagen man muss einfach nur aufpassen das er einen gar nicht erst bekommt... Das wäre ja tatsächlich machbar, wenn man Freddy überhaupt sehen könnte, was ja leider auch nicht der Fall ist. Und sich NUR an der Musik orientieren zu müssen ist schon fast etwas Utopisch.\n\nNaja aber es ist generell anzumerken das \"Pay-to-win\" hier ein Zuhause gefunden hat. Jeder Killer der kostenlos spielbar ist findet seinen Meister in einem DLC Killer. Die Krankenschwester beispielsweise ist in der Lage sich zu teleportieren und das ganze drei Mal hintereinander! Allerdings ist zu erwähnen das sie natürlich um Überlebende zu treffen genau so weit teleportieren muss, wie der Überlebende weg ist und die Richtung muss natürlich auch passgenau sein. Und dann lernten wir die Hexe Lisa kennen... Sie lacht nur über die Krankenschwester den Skill brauchen nur jene die nicht mit Geld um sich schmeißen. Die liebe Lisa (Hexe) macht nämlich einfach nur ein paar Fallen wild auf der Map platzieren (richtig wild, da muss man nicht mal großartig durchdacht ran gehen, man hat ja 10 dann klappt das schon) und warten bis einer dummer Überlebender einen Fehltritt macht....\n\nDas gleich kann man auch für: \n-Hillbilly und Leatherface\n-Geist und der Wandler\n\nAber mit Freddy und seinen DLC-Kumpels alleine ist ja nicht genug... Am meisten erfreue ich mich an den Bugs die einem dann noch den letzten Funken Spielspaß rauben. Sobald der Host einen schlechte Internetverbindungen hat kann man sich auf ein lustiges Spiel voller Magie erfreuen, welches selsbt alle Teile der Harry Potter Reihe weit in den Schatten stellt. So kann es beispielsweise passieren das man als Krankenschwester mal aus der Map fliegt und dann durch das \"Nichts\" segelt, oder man als Überlebende an Orte kommt die eigentlich nicht begehbar sein sollten. Sieht ganz schön aus im ersten Moment, bis man merkt das man da nicht mehr wegkommt bis einen der Killer zu Kleinholz verarbeitet. Aber am liebsten sind mir die Momente in denen der Bilschirm aller Mitspieler freezt und der Killer aus mehreren Metern Entfernung trotzdem in der Lage ist jemanden zu verletzen.\n\nEs wäre schön wenn sich da mal was tut, denn die Bugs sind seit dem das Spiel draußen ist da und langsam nicht mehr lustig sondern nur noch nervenvernichtend.","timestamp_created":1509481623,"timestamp_updated":1509481623,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458333343267440796","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36175222","author":{"steamid":"76561198393091235","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":16993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":1427,"last_played":1659668707},"language":"english","review":"Good game for the first 20hours after...
