Das dies auf beiden Seiten nicht immer einfach ist sei klar, jedoch fehlt mir noch etwas Abwechslung, als Beispiel:\n\nDer Überlebende hat nur zwei möglichkeiten, Generatoren anschalten und Fliehen oder warten bis das Team tot ist und dann durch eine Geheimtür entkommen. Natürlich bieten die kleinen Quick Time Events ein wenig Abwechslung beim Generator Anschmeißen oder Erste-Hilfe-Kasten benutzen. Dem Killer kann man Blockaden in den Weg stellen oder mit der Taschenlampe blenden. Jedoch fehlt mir da persönlich noch etwas mehr. Man sollte in der Lage sein mehr tun zu können, dass in einem Team gewisse Rollen eingenommen werden können wie das einer Ablenkt und rest Generatoren macht, doch ausser \"laufen, über Hindernisse springen\" bleibt einem Survivor nicht viel übrig. Dem Killer Fallen stellen zu können, die Ihn kurz Bewegungslos etc. machen das wäre was.\n\nAls Killer wiederrum ist es sehr Eintönig. Typ zwei mal Hauen, auf den Haken werfen, zusehen wie er Stirbt damit das Team Ihn nicht befreien kann. Es könnte so viel mehr Potenzial dahinter stecker was man mit seinen Opfer machen kann. Wieso muss es immer der Haken sein, so oft sieht man Kreissägen etc. auf der Karte, wieso nicht ein einmaligen Kreissägen Kill einbauen oder andere dinge. Als Killer finde ich es Persönlich dann doch ziemlich Fad. Der Haken soll eine Methode sein seine Freunde anzulocken jedoch zeitgleich ist es auch die einzige möglichkeit einen Spieler zu Töten und diese beiden Eigenschaften beißen sich dann doch ein wenig.\n\nZusatz:\nWas dem Spiel ungeheuerlich fehlt ist die Funktion mit einem Freund, zwei, Drei oder eine volle Gruppe gegen ein Killer anzutreten. Immerhin heißt es doch RANKED SYSTEM. Und darunter verstehe ich Teamplay, Absprache, Koordination und nicht mit Random Mitspieler in eine Gruppe geschmissen zu werden und KEINERLEI möglichkeit haben miteinander zu Kommunizieren. Natürlich gibt es eine \"Privat Lobby\" funktion doch darauf angewießen zu sein mindestens 4 Freunde (Killer mit einbegriffen) ist weniger angebracht. Ein VoiceOverIP wäre ein Großer Schritt für das Spiel, der jedoch eine gewisse Reichweite hat so das man in der nähe sein muss um sich zu hören und nicht über die ganze Map Spricht, der Killer jedoch sollte ebenfalls in der lage sein in der nähe Spieler sprechen zu hören. Dies alleine würde der Atmosphäre, die sorge das der Killer einen vielleicht hört, einen mächtigen Sprung nach oben verleihen. \nLaut Dev's soll die Funktion, mit Freunden eine Lobby zu joinen, wohl bald folgen. Es bleibt abzuwarten.\n\nFazit:\nUm es kurz Stichpunkt artig aufzuführen.\n\nGrafik: 8/10 (Es ist kein Next Gen aber eine schön anzusehende Grafik\nAtmosphäre: 5/10 (Persönlich gesehen da ich nicht die möglichkeit habe es mit Freunden zu genießen. Doch ich bin mir sicher das die Atmosphäre mit 5 Freunden eine 10 ist.\nSpielspaß: 5/10 (wegen selbigen Grund wie mit der Atmosphäre)\n\nSchlusswort: Derzeit würde ich das Spiel, wer es versucht mit nur 1-2 Freunden zu spielen, abraten da einige Funktionen Fehlen. Wer jedoch solo ins Abendteuer springen möchte oder 4-5 Freunde hat, ist dies ein klare Kaufempfehlung! Ich Werte das spiel jedoch doch auf \"Nein\" da man in der heutigen Online-Multiplayer Zeit in der Lage sein sollte, mit seinen Mitspielern zu Kommunizieren (Randoms) oder mit nur 1-2 Freunden das Spiel gegen andere genießen zu können.","timestamp_created":1465996806,"timestamp_updated":1465996806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":56,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617573142051696777","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569438","author":{"steamid":"76561198309524080","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1514885350},"language":"schinese","review":"没有办法玩","timestamp_created":1465996798,"timestamp_updated":1465996798,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809492588043213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569429","author":{"steamid":"76561198147742529","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":261,"playtime_at_review":10719,"last_played":1660091171},"language":"english","review":"i enjoi","timestamp_created":1465996775,"timestamp_updated":1636966650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569426","author":{"steamid":"76561198122297105","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1596380568},"language":"russian","review":"Faild  connection to server  10/10","timestamp_created":1465996770,"timestamp_updated":1465996770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569408","author":{"steamid":"76561198177519354","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1982,"last_played":1658524678},"language":"english","review":"holy crap let me just say this is one of the best games, yes games i said ive played in a while i will be putting a lot of hours in but... there is one problem. everytime i go into the game everything resets i was on the vurge to #1 and this happens once you get this fixed ill be sure to put alot more hours in thanks devs and anyone who is looking to get this game why are you still reading this GET IT!!!","timestamp_created":1465996695,"timestamp_updated":1504892340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489261895418167114","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569373","author":{"steamid":"76561198097470279","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":61500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17562,"last_played":1621974084},"language":"german","review":"Mit dem neusten Patch-Release und der riesigen Vielfalt an Killern ist ein Survivor-Nachteil Gang und Gäbe.\n\nSehr gutes Konzept, keine Frage! Leider ist das Release verfrüht, die Beta reichte gerade mal, um einen Grossteil der Bugs zu sammeln und für uns, diese zu erkennen.\n\nKaum war die Closed Beta nach gut 2 Wochen zu Ende, war gestern das Release. Meine Erfahrung wurde gestört durch neue Bugs, die nicht einmal in der Beta vorhanden waren: Meine zweite Spielrunde konnte nicht abgeschlossen werden, da man unsichtbar in den Hooks hing, und das Spiel den Sieg des Killers nicht anerkannte. Anschliessend warteten alle Überlebenden, bis der Killer schliesslich nach rund 10 Minuten das Spiel aufgegeben hat, um nicht für den Quit bestraft zu werden.\nAusserdem gibt es nicht wenige Bugs im Lobby- und Matchmakingbereich wie z.B. Freezing, nebst dem an sich schlecht konzipierten Lobby-System.\n\nDa ich gerade darauf zu sprechen komme:\nDas Lobby-System: Mit seinen Freunden online spielen zu können, wäre rein entwicklungstechnisch keine Sache, vorallem nicht wenn man nur zwei Wochen für die Beta einplant, da ja bereits alles so wunderbar funktioniert! Auch wenn es nicht für das Release angekündigt wurde, ist es schlicht inakzeptabel, dass das Feature zu diesem Zeitpunkt fehlt! \n\nAusserdem fehlen die Deluxe-Produkte, allesamt noch nicht fertiggestellt. Die Entwickler erinnern irgendwie an faule Schüler, die ihre Abschlussarbeit nicht rechtzeitig abgeben können. Wenigstens eine Verschiebung des Release-Zeitpunkts wäre doch nicht so schwierig gewesen, das hätte einige Verluste erspart.\n\nFazit: Zu diesem Zeitpunkt ist das Spiel noch unausgereift und macht wenig Spass mit Freunden, die Erfahrung wird stark gestört von fehlenden Features, vielen Bugs und der Tatsache, dass einzelne Produkte erst noch geliefert werden müssen. \n\nDer Preis ist fair, gemessen an den Spielstunden, die dieses Spiel wohl generieren wird, wenn es erst mal fertig ist.

I can't recommend anyone play this game after three years and several thousand hours logged.  The devs stumbled into a win with the tried and true asymmetrical competitive format by taking the next logical step into the horror genre.  They have just been riding that wave since launch.  The devs don't know what they are doing and have been phoning it in for a while.  They are slow to fix even simple problems and often don't even agree with the playerbase that something is a problem, even when nearly everyone is in agreement that a change is needed.\n\nEvery seasonal event is pretty much the same with the same rewards and a few new skins.  They haven't added any new game modes or items in three years.  I have three firecracker items with different names that all do the same thing in game.  They are all seasonal items that are pretty much impossible to use due to the near constant mechanic rebalancing.  The last event had a double blood point offering that gave 103% bonus instead of 100%... so it's technically not the \"same.\"  You get where I am going with this.  They're just reusing mechanics and content and have been for quite some time.  Anyone who played this game three years ago will have a few hours of, \"oh they changed this,\" upon returning but not much more than that once they cycle through the new killers a few times.\n\nYes, there have been improvements along the way but most of the quality of life changes were trivial.  The one exception to that is \"end game collapse.\"  They fixed the end game stalemate where people could literally stand around for hours in a hatch stand-off or hold the game hostage forcing a killer to leave.  I'll give them one Kudos for that change, maybe a few other small victories along the way but every time they \"fix\" something, they invariably break something else along with it.  Bug list at the bottom.\n\nThere isn't a matchmaker and if you start playing this game today, you will see people with thousands of hours more experience in your first night.  This isn't even rare.  It happens every time I play.  They haven't been able to find any balance here.  It's either 20 minute queues with *sometimes* better quality games, or just a mess of new and old players thrown together into the same lobby.  This is a huge part of why the game is so imbalanced and frustrating, one way or the other, depending on your perspective as a killer or survivor main.  You will run into teams on discord as a killer that just walk all over you with ease and then the next game, have idiots running around in circles who can't complete a single objective.  As a survivor, you will see killers who know every angle and cutoff and how to perfectly use the killer power to strangle your team out early on.  You will learn to play against those killers and think ten moves ahead all the time but the next game, you will see a brand-new-to-the-game killer and trying to strategize against them is actually detrimental.  Trying to mind game against a new player will likely get you killed.  There is no consistency.  You will see both ends of the spectrum in a single evening.  There is no punishment for disconnecting from games.  You start a game with three team mates, one gets found first by the killer and instantly leaves, mad cuz bad, it's now a 3v1 instead of a 4v1.  No penalties for griefing.\n\nDedicated servers should fix a lot of the problems with lag and exploits that everyone complains about but who knows.  These devs always find a way to turn an “improvement” into a net neutral change.\n\nThere are countless examples of them just breaking the game.  In no particular order, the ones I remember experiencing:  begrimed chain bug, wake-up bug, windows blocking after a single vault, killers attacking through walls, dozens of unintentionally impassable or exploitable terrain glitches, basement rubber-banding bug, stepping into traps that you just disarmed, bugging bloodlust to never fall off, characters falling through the map(killer and survivor), characters getting permanently stuck to trees and pallets (still happens and it's been around since day 1), killers/survivors getting stuck inside dropped pallets, graphical glitches that give an advantage (seeing through walls, character textures phasing through obstacles, seeing survivor outlines through the generator/hook glow, etc), killers blocking the stairs and going afk for an hour to grief, survivors crouching on the stairs so they can’t be hit by the killer because until recently you couldn’t swing down, constantly snagging on invisible obstacles, lag switching and hackers galore, bloodweb and bank file abuse to get skins and items for free, infinite offering bug, 2 killers in the same game, starting the game with 3 people and 5 gens, starting the game on top of the killer, hitting decisive strike but not getting a dismount, dying with borrowed time still on, not being able to mend out of borowed time (just have to wait to die first), bugged deliverance, infinite loading screens in various menus, dead hard going off after you’ve died and are on the floor, having to swing once as the game starts to be able to lunge attack, inconsistent killer hit boxes, hillbilly chainsaw connecting with the survivor but not doing any damage, survivors running over set traps that do not activate, activating the flashlight forcing you to stand up from crouching, survivors stuck in crouch mode to start the game, survivors stuck in crouch mode after letting go of a gen, exit gate permanently stuck closed with opening sound constantly playing upon completing the progress bar, killer stuck carrying disconnected survivor, survivor permanently bugged out after trying to cleanse a totem next to a trapper trap(unable to move, finish the cleanse or be hit/picked up by the killer.  Just have to leave game), survivor unable to make any inputs upon game loading, survivors and killers moving before the spinning camera intro finishes, hag traps causing permanent loss of character control, survivor unable to recover or be healed while on the floor, survivor blinking back and forth bug, surbvivor/killer flying after dropping or being hit by a pallet, survivor flying outside the map when another survivor is hit next to them on a second floor.","timestamp_created":1465996065,"timestamp_updated":1563181770,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439689189195632935","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569241","author":{"steamid":"76561197983645480","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":14438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1529255172},"language":"english","review":"Seriously this game is awesome! had some difficulties to hide at first, but I think I'm getting good now\n10/10 would buy\n(only issue I had was steam getting disconnected the release day... so it's not even DbD's problem)","timestamp_created":1465995900,"timestamp_updated":1465995900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524381458759307861","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23569229","author":{"steamid":"76561198003497492","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1611236427},"language":"german","review":"Ich schleiche mich durch den Wald und achte auf jedes Geräusch.

Playing as the killer can be loads of fun if you don't let the survivors distract you while the others turn on generators. Get the quick swipe of your weapon, hang them up and go on finding others.

Daher gibt es bis auf weiteres ein Negatives Review von mir bis diese Fehler komplett behoben wurden.","timestamp_created":1465994501,"timestamp_updated":1465994501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423882007598876953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23568947","author":{"steamid":"76561198068421556","num_games_owned":624,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":15693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6158,"last_played":1594719524},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Crash","timestamp_created":1465994422,"timestamp_updated":1502042234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509494662284851074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23568873","author":{"steamid":"76561198025826262","num_games_owned":390,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1627676946},"language":"english","review":"Changed my review now, It's getting a lot better and they are gonna fix so players can play with their friends :)\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing and has always been, right now with these changes I highly recommend this.","timestamp_created":1465994001,"timestamp_updated":1467035890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23568863","author":{"steamid":"76561198051455453","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1543778482},"language":"english","review":"Step 1: Be killer\nStep 2: Invite friends\nStep 3: Play\nStep 4: Use a voice changer to make you sound demented\nStep 5: Kill your friends\nStep 6: I have no friends now","timestamp_created":1465993954,"timestamp_updated":1465993954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":393,"votes_funny":1336,"weighted_vote_score":"0.654152393341064453","comment_count":33,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23568862","author":{"steamid":"76561198086329635","num_games_owned":481,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1468741465},"language":"english","review":"This Game is gold, anyone who doesn't have it needs to get it, nuff said","timestamp_created":1465993951,"timestamp_updated":1465993951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492957741022109985","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23568848","author":{"steamid":"76561197962710289","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1560043512},"language":"english","review":"Market a game as co-op and even have a pre-launch deal for a 5-pack.

Beyond that, the gameplay is extremely repetitive, with the only real variation being whether you play as a \"survivor\" or \"killer\". And both get old, quickly enough.\n\n   How anyone could have over 200 hours up on this already I have no idea, but a glimpse at other reviews tells me such persons are out there. Left 4 Dead 2 will perhaps always be the reigning king of horror-themed multiplayer games, at least as far as yours truly is concerned, and that one barely even TRIED to be frightening. You think that maybe, just maybe, multiplayer may only be suited to \"action\" games, when all is said and done? Hmmm...\n\n   Not to say that this is a \"bad\" game by any stretch, although it does have a few glaring bugs so far (more than once now, my character-on-a-meathook has found him or herself hanging off nothing but MID-AIR)! Beyond this, it's all passably decent \"fun\", but certainly no great shakes.\n\nC'mon, let's be honest here: there's better team-based multiplayer games out there, and there's worse.

The survivor has to turn on two generators, so even though he's pretty much dead if he gets caught, he can run from generator and generator and evade the killer.  Its as balanced as it can be, and you're playing with friends, so its just as fun as multiplayer in my opinion.\n\ncons:\n-there seem to be a lot of people wanting to play as the killer.  This would work, but it gives us the choice to be either a killer or a survivor (similar to the evolve matchmaking system), and there aren't always four survivors to every killer, meaning waiting times can be a little long if you wanna play the killer.\n\n-game seems just a little bit buggy\n\n-the tutorials don't go into much detail\n\n-as with all horror games, its not that frightening after a while.  However, there are always really scary or tense moments, regardless of how long you've been playing the game, but don't expect to play a pure horror game.  its almost more of a strategy game, like assassins creed, where one person is always pursuing the other four. (not really a con)\n\n-limited cosmetics\n\n-no matchmaking system yet (as of 6/15/16)\n\n-progression system has some bugs\n\npros:\n\n-I rarely lag\n\n-you can usually find a match pretty quickly\n\n-pretty scary.  not in a shit your pants way, but its tense and I'm generally very intimidated by the killer.\n\n-decent graphics\n\n-amazing sounds, very immersive, as with many horror games\n\n-playing the killer is a totally different experience.  people dont tend to go into this, but you actually feel like you're in the shoes of the killer, everything you do seems slow and powerful, and chase scenes are intense.  you feel like a killer in a movie, slow, but unstoppable and persistent, totally in control.\n\n-the animations feel natural\n\n-immersive\n\n-fun gameplay\n\n-maps are a little altered each time, you can never really \"learn\" them as a whole.  Its like a puzzle.  you can memorize each piece, but don't know how they fit together.\n\n-HIDING ACTUALLY WORKS.\n\nOverall, the game has its flaws and bugs, and it may have been released a little too early, but its a hell of a lot of fun.  It may not be as polished as a AAA game, but it makes up for it with originality.  Totally worth the low price.  I definitely recommend buying it.
