: Da giocatore non competitivo (CHE GIOCA SOLO SURVIVOR CON AMICI)  ne con troppe ore in gioco questa è una recensione di cosa IO penso sia l'esperienza media. \n\nIniziamo dal fatto che ci sono i soliti 10 perk sbroccati dove è la meta, non li equipaggi e sei una m3rdh4. \nDal lato Survior, abbiamo Borrowed Time e Unbreakable. Entrambi ottenibili da Bill , il pensionato di L4D/1/2.\nIl killer non ha nessun modo per capire se chi viene tirato giù dal gancio sia affetto da Borrowed Time, il survivor potrebbe semplicemente baitare un colpo oppure fare finta di avere il borrowed, tanto il killer non lo sa finchè non colpisce il survivor appena staccato dalla macelleria.\n\nDead hard è un'altro perk che rompe il c4zzho dove il killer deve sperare che il survivor non lo abbia equipaggiato, datochè come al solito non c'è nessun avviso prima dell'attivazione del perk.\n\nDal lato Killer nel frattempo, la cosa più frustrante di tutti sia assolutamente il NOED, dove se qualcuno viene preso ad endgame e viene facecamperato, azzardati a tirarlo giù dal gancio.\nL'icona non è visibile finchè il killer non colpisce qualcun'altro. Quindi due ganci di facecamping mega cringe. \"Basta togliere tutti i totem\". Non mi interessa, io non spreco 10 minuti della mia vita per cercare dei BASTONI con dei TESCHI.\n\nIl Ruin per i Generatori è solo fastidioso, ma almeno il totem è illuminato quindi bene o male lo distingui dallo sfondo.\n\nNurse Calling invece è qualcosa fuori di testa , capisci di essere in pericolo quando ti stai curando troppo tardi, datochè con il prossimo hit andrai atterra e vedrai il killer fare un 180 su di te solo perchè ti stai curando e quindi ha IL DIRITTO di sapere dove sei. \n\nMicheal Myers al livello 3 infinito. Direi che non c'è niente da dire no? Un killer dove per tutta la partita con un colpo manda i survivor a terra. Funny? Non penso.

If you're just here wondering if the community is as toxic as everyone says it is ... well, yes, it is. I wouldn't say it's any more or less toxic than the communities you'd find in CS:GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. ... but post-game chat can definitely frighten off a new player.\n\nIf you're new to the game, I highly recommend playing it with one or more experienced friends who can coach you. If you don't have a thick skin or much patience, playing solo right off the bat will likely make you rage quit. That being said, a lot of people will only have fun with DbD if they're playing with friends. And that's okay and completely fair. The basis of 4v1 gameplay is cooperation, and you can't guarantee that a random is going to have your back.\n\n\nI'm a survivor main, but I enjoy playing killer every once in a while. I think it's extremely important for every DbD player to experience playing killer. You'll have toxicity in-game and post-game when you're a survivor, but there's really nothing that can prepare you for post-game chat when you're the killer. I tend to minimize the chat so I don't see it, or I change my username to something friendly (which no one should have to do, but I'm a lover, not a fighter). While playing killer can help thicken your skin against the community, it's really helpful in learning to be a better teammate while playing survivor. There's also a killer for everyone. While I want to be the best with every killer in the game, I've succumbed to the fact that it's just not a possibility for me and tried every killer until I found one that matched my play style.\n\nMany players have a lot of gripes about the developers: Every update seems to fix something but break something else, server lag is atrocious, and, lately, matchmaking is a complete joke (you're supposed to be matched with players on your skill level, but it's really not unusual to be shoved into a lobby with players way below or way above your skill level anymore). Certain perks are broken, hitboxes are not functional, and you'll be kicked from lobbies, menus, and matches, requiring you to have to restart the game completely.\n\nIf you need a friendly face to play this game with, you can add me. I'm serious. There are kind and gentle players in this game, and they're honestly the ones who kept me around when I first started playing. I'll never forget my first time playing killer in a public match. I was nervous and played terribly. Post-game chat, a more experienced player encouraged me: \"You're a good killer - just watch your tracking.\" They hung around and gave me some advice for practicing. Granted, every post-game after that was toxic ... but that energized me enough to keep trying. I try to reciprocate that to newer players when I can.","timestamp_created":1634461217,"timestamp_updated":1634461217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595369160175323486","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101187318","author":{"steamid":"76561198937749573","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":28412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19333,"last_played":1652444242},"language":"english","review":"This game makes me want to cut my nutsack open, flip it inside out, slap it on an ironing board, iron it, hit it with a fucking mallet, feed whatever is left of my balls to the developers who thought spirit was a good idea then have a fist fight with all the developers involved in the creation of survivors (fuck those guys).

Entonces ahi ya no los podes matar, porque nunca vas a llegar a un gancho, literalmente, nunca, no dan los tiempos matemáticamente hablando, para agravarlo, hay addons que hacen que haya menos ganchos, etc.\nComo killer lo unico que podes hacer es intentar que se desangren, pero no te dan puntos por ello, osea que si fuiste capaz de dejarlos desangrar durante una partida de 35mins, esta la posibilidad de que ni siquiera subas de rango, un asco.\nLa verdad intenendible, que siendo que los survs ya estaban muy chetados, por los pallets, perks, premades y loops infinitos, pongan esa perk asquerosa a disposición.
