I love the Charachters, the Lore, the general Concept, the Graphics the sound everything is fine. So why do I write a negative review? Dead by Daylight is SO unbalanced its unbelievable. For the Killer side for sure. I had Games were i got gen-rushed in 2 Minutes this is no joke. 2 Minutes. No killer in this game, has the abillity to hook every survivor 3 times in this little amount of time. Killer is just pain to play, because u get shit on by survivors 90% of the time. U get bulllied in after chat, for killing everyone but isnt this the point of a KILLER. I mean the gameplay is really fun, there are a lot of Killers too choose, but u cant play 75% of them, because u get just destroyed if u do. The Developers NEED to take a look at the Speed, at wich generators get completed. If they would give killers more time to play a single match, both sides would have more fun. In its current state, the killer side of DBD is just a mess, the only Killers that can really Destroy survivors are nurse and Hag in my experience, without Ruin (before its change). Ruin. its so sad that they changed this perk, without even taking one look at the reason why everyone plays this perk. I have the Feeling the devs lost the connection to the Killer side of the community. Even tho, the game has its balance Problems, its still enjoyable. Survivior is pretty fun, but its getting boring after some time because its so easy to play as them. If they balance gen  repairing time, Dead by Daylight will be a great game. It really hurts, to give Dead by Daylight a negative review because i really love this game, but the unbalancings are too bad, to ignore them. I really hope, these problems get adressed and fixed.

It has that type of atmosphere. This game goes free on certain days constantly for new player to play and buy as they are guaranteed to go past 2 hours. It's a genius marketing idea. Why is this game bad?\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\nTwo sides, survivors and killer\n\nSurvivors: \nThere goal is to complete gens, help people out, and most importantly escape. \nKiller: \nThe killer, kills survivors. And makes sure they don't do gens.\n\nThis game does have much more depth than that, it's sacraficing and not killing... and 3 hooks and you're sacraficed where you need to wait for a new game. And it has perks to make it more interesting and a better experience along with addons to make killers and survivors stronger.... sounds good right? There are some problems.\n\n[h1] Survivors have too much compared to killer [/h1]\nIf you have read anything by anyone with a brain, this game is survivor sided. And it's true, survivors can do to much to the killer. Such as pallet loops;\na way to run the killer is by looping a pallet, which is dropped and the survivor can slide over and stun the killer if drop on them. They are strong, but not a problem... as the killer can break them, okay.\n\nBut you also have windows which survivors can vault faster than the killer... why is this a problem? Most if not all vaults are a safe transition for survivors. And two windows across from each other is impossible for killers to deal with.\n\nWhy are these bad? There are some spots such as the killer shack and any major building that the killer can't catch you in.... Most vaults spawn by pallets which are nightmarish. The killer does have a trick, bloodlust; if a chase has gone for a while the killer moves faster... and it does help, but here another problem\n\n[h1] Gen Speed [/h1]\nIt's too fast, 80 seconds is too fast.\n\nSurvivors have to do 5 gens, okay... easy. It's 80 seconds, okay... still easy. There is a term called Gen Rushing which is simply constant gens completed, problem. IT'S THE OBJECTIVE. That's all survivors have to do, gens. And a chase with killer is usually 90 seconds, meaning 60% of your objective is done while theirs... 8%. And those addons, survivors can bring toolboxes which increase gen speed, okay... and the more people the faster they go.... the fastest gen pop possible is 18 seconds. So, if we put that chase situation in here; one person might be good at chasing and chase the killer, the other people are bad at the game. Gens only require you to hold one button. So if one person is good, you're letting awful players win which I hate in a game.\n\n[h1] This game is frustrating and boring [/h1]\nMost survivors have said it, this game is boring... and killers; frustrating, because it is.\nThe objective is done too fast, and killers looking for a good game will always lose, no matter what.\n\n[h1] Camping & Bad Teamates [/h1]\nRemember 3 hooks and you're out? It's timed for 2 minutes so sometimes one hook and you're out. Because the killer, will just camp you, which can be catagorized as boring.. BECAUSE IT IS. Will anyone save you? No, they don't want to be camped! Than to make it better, you might be alone... without friends; random people will aid you. And sometimes they just won't help, even if the killer is across the map... doing gens may be a good excuse; but hiding in a bush isn't. People bring friends for a reason, but winning all the time isn't fun is it? \n\n[h1] The Variety of Killer is BORING [/h1]\nThere are currently around 30 killers in the game... wanna hear the good ones? Here we go!\n\n*Spirit.\n\n{THE END}\n\nSome killers that could reach that strength have no chase game or gen rushed easily.\n\nHillBilly: Can oneshot and zoom the map, but gens are still too fast for him... what is he going to do in a chase? NOTHING\n\nNurse: Nurse use to give survivors actual good games, she patched the game! But NOPE! NERF!!! And now she has bad addons and a cooldown. She's the best at chases with skill, but pressure doesn't exist anymore as her.\n\nDemogorgon: He was almost perfect, but he suffer from something called setting up, which takes time... so setting up = 3 gens.\n\nHuntress: Is only strong on three maps which one got a recent rework\n\n\nEVERY OTHER KILLER IS USELESS.... THESE ONES CAN BE SOMEWHAT THREATENING, BUT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT\n\nOut of all of the killers, only one is powerful enough to get two kills against MODERATE players. You know those people that reached red ranks? They fought BOOSTED PEOPLE, AS IN ALL 4 PLAYERS HID IN BUSHES WITH NO CHASE EXPERIENCE. What does Spirit do that makes her so much powerful to other killers? Impossible mindgames, and yes; she and nurse are the only time killers have gotten a necessary nerf... but they went overboard with Nurse, Spirit got a good treatment. Spirit also has good map pressure on the small maps... which is another problem\n\n[h1] The Maps [/h1]\n\nSanctum of Wrath is the ONLY good map because it's small with few pallets and risky vaults which makes it a good map. Azarovs Resting Place is huge with awful gen placement much with every other map in the game.... Even if you get a good map.\n\n[h1] Claudettes Broken Player Model [/h1]\n\nYou can't see her and is why everyone picks her. Instead of a smart move like an experienced player will do, you can duck by a gen and *POOF* You're gone. Other characters like Adam and Tapp are similar to her, but have exposed clothing making it much harder for them to do so, meaning they can't. Claudette is literally camoflauged. To make it worse\n\n[h1] Imbalance of Perks [/h1]\n\nKiller has a horrible treatment of perks compared to survivors. Killer can ONLY use meta, which consist of\nBBQ & Chili\nPop Goes The Weasel \nDark Devotion\nSave the Best For Last\nBlood Warden\nNOED\nNurse's Calling\nThere are 60 killer perks, and these are the only good ones\nSurvivors, what makes them good is no perk survivors are still stronger than meta perk killers. I've won almost all my games as survivor using Sole Survivor, Slippery Meat, Solidiary & Vigil against \"Red Rank Killers running meta\"\n\nThese are weak perks, meaning alright survivor perks are overpowered. You will see\nDecisive Strike\nSprint Boost\nBorrowed Time\nUnbreakable\nSounds like a problem... wanna hear something else\n[h1] Devs Survivor Nepotism [/h1]\n\nDEVS HATE KILLER, DESPITE THEM GETTING DESTROYED AS THEM THEY STILL NERF THEM.\nThe only nerfs killers got that was needed was Moris, Nurse and Spirit. THAT'S ALL.\nOni was the best killer at one time, very strong... but he was \"overperforming\" so now you never see them at all, EVER. That goes with Nurse too. \nThese easy players say that \"survivors got nerfs too\"... like what? All of them were required. \nMettle of Man was overpowered, an additional free hit?\nDecisive Strike is still the best perk in the game.. last time you couldn't hook anyone with it.\nExhaustion is needed for balance, strong perks are okay.. they shouldn't be seperate\nBalanced Landing caused literal infinites.\nFlashlights were a free escape.\nWHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.\n\nLet's compare some perks, Yui to Oni... lets compare them\nKiller: Oni:\nZachian Tactics: You can see vaults and pallets. Only good on Clown (who is the worst killer in the game)\nBlood Echo: Injured Survivors suffer exhaustion for 45 seconds when someone is hooked (Useless)\nNemesis: every killer interuption turns you into the obsessison, and you suffer oblivious for one minute. Can be usable.\n\nSurvivor: Yui:\nLucky Break: First injure prevents blood, 3 minutes; one use. Very strong, easy first escape; but balanced.\nMotorcycle: Wiggling is 20% faster on other people, and you move 10% faster.. stacks. Free Escape.\nAny Means Necessary: Didn't Break the Pallet? Lift it and re use it. More infinites.\n\nWill, a free survivor. comes with the best perks in the game. No killer favor at all\n\nWanna hear the devs response? \"Go play Civilization V.\" Licensed killers keep the game alive","timestamp_created":1579908562,"timestamp_updated":1579919337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423430472612380981","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62350355","author":{"steamid":"76561198068984316","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3564,"last_played":1658288963},"language":"english","review":"I like the game because it is fun to play with friends.","timestamp_created":1579908237,"timestamp_updated":1579908237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62350219","author":{"steamid":"76561198067561557","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":9624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1645548017},"language":"hungarian","review":"Nagyon nehéz, de nagyon jó és izgalmas játék :D eleinte nehéz megszokni a dolgokat, sőt, még így 5 óra gameplay után is :D a gyilkosok egyszerűen nagyon erősek benne..

Half of that was on an Xbox account,\n\nThe devs are inexcusably lazy, out of touch, and incompetent when it comes to almost every factor of game design. They routinely take multiple months, sometimes almost years, to fix problems that the community has known about since the creation of the problem, and suggested multiple ways to at least start to fix it. They release new content every 3 months, with a patch in between, instead of just fixing the broken pile of garbage they currently have, although to be fair, they are attempting to fix their maps, and even though I think they're failing miserably and it's pushing me even further away, I commend them for trying. The amount of changes per patch is laughable considering the amount of things requiring changes. Perks have been at the cusp of usability for the entire time they've existed and never been touched. They are deathly afraid of shaking up the meta so every new perk is either terrible(90% chance), broken(8% chance) or, very rarely actually usable/ fun(2% chance). The killer power design has gone down steadily in quality over the years, with each new killer having a fun new way to avoid actually having to deal with the general game-play loop, and having an extremely skewed ratio for the amount of skill required to use them and the results they give. I could go on and talk about things like how they released a killer that COMPLETELY ignored the general game-play, nerfed that killer into the ground, and then never touched them again, or how they nerfed one of, if not the most fair killers that had ever existed for no reason, in a way that did nothing but discourage people from trying to learn him, while barely affecting people who knew how to play him, or how they refused to nerf add-ons that completely skew the match in the killers favor instantly, while repeatedly doing just that to survivor add-ons(not saying they shouldn't nerf BNPs and whatnot, but if they can nerf BNPs, they can nerf Iri Head). My only hope is that some other studio comes along to make a game that can compete with this, and that either forces the devs to finally work on the game, or the game dies. .","timestamp_created":1579901549,"timestamp_updated":1649819396,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49032256007194519","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62345936","author":{"steamid":"76561198360884652","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":42786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":544,"playtime_at_review":15413,"last_played":1660370545},"language":"brazilian","review":"esse jogo e incrivel com ctz o melhor no q se propoe claramente ja passou da hroa da empresa colocar ele de graca porem o jogo ainda vale muito a pena sendo o melhor jogo q eu tenho de mais 70 jogos na minha conta\n","timestamp_created":1579901477,"timestamp_updated":1579901477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62345915","author":{"steamid":"76561198355025974","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":27098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":644,"playtime_at_review":7959,"last_played":1660169119},"language":"turkish","review":"İYİ","timestamp_created":1579901445,"timestamp_updated":1579901445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62345882","author":{"steamid":"76561198943825600","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2022,"last_played":1657313741},"language":"russian","review":"ммм найс","timestamp_created":1579901396,"timestamp_updated":1579901396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62345782","author":{"steamid":"76561198274345851","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":14485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4355,"last_played":1655810448},"language":"polish","review":"Ta gra jest kozacka 0 toksycznego ykm ykm community i kozaki gameplay (gdy nie trafisz na campera killera).

I'm never in favor of one or the other. Just game balance)\n\nI own this on console, W10 and now on Steam. \n1v4 (Survivors vs Killers). At it's core survivors try to finish 5 generators and then open a gate to escape while staying away from the killer. That's the main objective. Core Killer concept is to find the survivors, down them and hook them. This is just a very base premise of the game. There are more fundamentals that I won't go into because that would take a lot more effort and senseless writing. If that doesn't entice you then your best bet is to look for another game themed around the 1v4+ format. Anyways, onto the pros and cons.\n\nPros & Cons List:\n=============\n\n+Killer Music is pretty great. There's two different styles. One for radius and another for chase.\n+Perk builds are pretty diverse on both sides.\n+Graphics are alright. Not the most modern but not dated.\n+Easy to wrack up the in game currency used for cosmetics. (Some do require micro)\n+Tons of feedback and support from devs. \n+Great game to play with friends.\n+No friends? No Problem! Killer is just as brutal and entertaining!\n+Events (though not too game changing or additive.)\n+Can unlock survivors/killers without buying them for actual money.\n+Newly added Archives gives a bit more lore to the game.\n+\"battle pass\" doesn't pressure you into spending money. It's not a game you feel forced to play so you can progress in tiers. You WANT to play this game when you play it.\n\n\nCons:\n-Game is heavily player driven. There are no 'rules' to really follow for either role.\n-In the current state the game will often error post-game or DC resulting in having to reform the lobby for group play.\n-No option to toggle unlocked perks in customs. You either enable all perks at tier 3, or no perks at all. Would like to see that change.\n-Not too much diversity in the perks people use unfortunately. That's being worked on but it still gets a con for the time being.\n-Rank system is severely flawed as is the matchmaking with it.\n-No other game modes or event modes. So the game is what it is right from the start.\n-Quite a bit of DLC you'll feel forced to purchase (I know I said you could unlock them. Some you can't. Others it takes a while.)\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe game's worth getting/playing. Especially at sale price. It can be frustrating and there is a learning curve. Stick with it and once you dive a bit deeper you'll enjoy the game a bit more. Dying in 1 minute of the match starting is to be expected. Not killing anyone as killer your first match is to be expected. You'll learn as you go.

Took a long break after the ui and animation changes solely for the reason that they disabled custom icons. I came back now so my thoughts on the game are going to be based solely on what it feels like to play now with just a bit of a mention of how things used to be. \n\nFirst things first, your going to pay money for some of these dlcs. Both killer and survivor are fun to play, however killers are imo the more fun part of dlcs, since they have unique powers unlike survivors. The favourite part of the game to me is trying to progress through the characters bloodwebs to get as many teachable perks as I can. It's my favourite part of the game because the variety of builds you can create is amazing and you can have lots of fun going for stupid builds. If you think this will be your favourite part of the game too then like I said, you are going to have to buy some of these dlcs if you don't want to spend thousands of hours grinding out in game currency to get stuff. \n\nI would recommend buying the game, and maybe some of the licensed killers that interest you during a sale if your trying to get into it. From there you can figure out if you enjoy it and what interests you the most. Be wary of a few things though. The queue times to find a match as a survivor are fine, but trying to find a match as a killer at a low rank is RIDICULOUS. Have a youtube video ready to alt tab to at all times. The games icon on the taskbar will flash when you find a lobby so no worries about missing the match. The community can be toxic as hell on both sides, but just end every match with a ggwp and maybe a few compliments or questions if the other players are nice as well. In terms of learning how to play, I recommend reading the perks that players were using at the end of your matches, and watching Painrelivers if your trying to learn survivor or Otzdarva if you are trying to learn killer or watch some crazy builds on killers. There are a lot of other amazing youtubers as well, however I would say those 2 are the best for those sides of the game respectively. \n\nWhen you start getting into the game more it can be worth buying more of the dlcs however I would always recommend just waiting for a sale for that. In general just try having fun with the game and if your focusing on grinding anything out, focus on the characters bloodwebs. Every character (both killers and survivors) have 3 unique perks to them. When you get the characters to level 30, 35, and 40 on each level they will have those perks as teachables. Meaning that you can unlock them and have them appear on other characters bloodwebs when leveling, which is how you make fun builds. \n\nFor those of you who are getting into the game now, just remember the devs are probably going to continue to make terrible and good decisions seemingly at random. I'm completely used to the new ui changes and animations. To be honest the only reason I took a break was because they disabled custom icons with the new ui changes, however they came back so I was happy to return to the game. At this point the game is a lot more balanced. In general there is always something you can learn from a match and there is always something you could do differently to have won a match if you lost, or to have performed better. \n\nI've always been interested in this game since release yet I never thought I would experience the memes and the dreams that I have since I started playing this game. \nJust remember that at the end of the day, Nea is the entity, you have to follow the survivors rulebook, you tunnelled even if you oobed out the map after hooking, and there's no such thing as doing gens efficiently in this disgusting genrushing meta. (I'm just kidding...probably)\n\nIf your interested in playing this game for the first time and read through this complete guide, you did a pretty good job so far.\n","timestamp_created":1579888172,"timestamp_updated":1624502896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62335964","author":{"steamid":"76561198313860580","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":10347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1655577281},"language":"russian","review":"Классный геймплей и графика + игра с друзьями что может быть лучше?","timestamp_created":1579887881,"timestamp_updated":1579887881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62335856","author":{"steamid":"76561198408526190","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1646437748},"language":"brazilian","review":"JOGO FODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MT BOM PRA JOGAR COM OS AMIGOS","timestamp_created":1579887747,"timestamp_updated":1579887747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62335771","author":{"steamid":"76561198091252583","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":92345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":384,"playtime_at_review":70480,"last_played":1660567417},"language":"portuguese","review":"It may have some problems but it is one of a kind.","timestamp_created":1579887647,"timestamp_updated":1579887647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62335413","author":{"steamid":"76561198855822305","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3695,"last_played":1638653210},"language":"polish","review":"podoba mi się w niej to że jak wisze to debile trolluje gierke i umierają przede mną i bym im chentnie wyjebał w ryj ale tak w sumie to do dupy gierke polecam \nlecz najlepsze jest to że ta gra mi pozwoliła pierwszy raz dotknąć kobiety w życiu.Co prawda toporem jej ywjebałem ale zawsze coś\n","timestamp_created":1579887220,"timestamp_updated":1579887220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62334876","author":{"steamid":"76561198309363862","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11855,"last_played":1658262622},"language":"brazilian","review":"(Aviso, texto escrito imparcialmente explicando o ponto de vista de um main killer).\n\nDepois de ter jogado pelo menos 200 horas de Dead By Daylight e ter pego rank 1 de killer (somente, pois sou main killer e tenho desgosto de jogar de survivor e acho que o máximo que peguei de survivor foi rank 10), sinto que tenho uma ''autoridade'' mesmo que mínima para comentar sobre aspectos X e Y desse jogo, que em alguns momentos pode ser extremamente divertido mas já em outros extremamente frustrante. \n\nÉ impossível começar a falar de DBD sem dizer do MM do jogo, um dos aspectos que quebram toda a minha vontade de jogar é esse formador de partidas totalmente desbalanceado que coloca jogadores de rank baixo com rank alto e vice versa. É frustrante ter que como killer jogar com sobreviventes com rank normalmente de 1 até 8 mesmo estando no rank 13 ou coisas do tipo, é absurdo como o MM consegue quebrar TODA e qualquer capacidade de aprendizado de qualquer novato no jogo, e isso foi algo que justamente aconteceu comigo. Normalmente isso acontece em horários principalmente depois de 12h AM, que é normalmente o horário que os jogadores de rank alto param para jogar (foi o que eu percebi, pelo menos).\n\nFalando em curva de aprendizado e desbalanceamento o DBD consegue ser um ótimo exemplo de como um jogo recompensa mais aquele que exerce a capacidade mínima (caso esteja de sobrevivente, isso não se aplica a killer, obviamente). O jogo é desbalanceado, quando se trata de curva de aprendizado o jogo dá um leque extremamente aberto para os sobreviventes que dominam sua role, e isso é certo, quanto melhor você é e quanto melhor você consegue desfrutar dos recursos que o jogo te dá mais rápido você sobe, o problema é que atualmente NÃO existem recursos inconsistentes para sobreviventes, qualquer jogada minimamente feita por um sobrevivente com 2 dígitos de qi pode acabar com a partida. \n\nO jogo da X e Y ferramentas para os jogadores bons utiliza-las e acabarem com o jogo, literalmente. Algo a se comentar que é PERFEITAMENTE perceptível é a diferença de habilidade dos ranks, é óbvio que quanto mais em ranks menores piores vão ser os jogadores, ou seja não tem noção de loop, build de perks, não conhecem os mapas e nem sabem como ganhar a partida (praticamente) ou seja, para você que joga de killer é um prato cheio (praticamente um ticket grátis de ida até os ranks roxo) o problema é quando ambas as posições são drasticamente invertidas, a necessidade de masterizar um killer que seja MUITO complicado começa a ser exigida (pois muitos dos killers contam com um problema chamado falta de mobilidade, capacidade de stall do jogo e posicionamento no mapa). Enquanto isso do outro lado temos os sobreviventes que quando jogam bem são capazes de abusar de meta perks, de loops e segurar o killer até os 5 geradores serem feitos.\n\nE falando em geradores, algo muito frustrante e comum é o tal do ''Gen Rush'', poucas são as estratégias para counterar a habilidade incrível dos sobreviventes de ficarem na frente de um gerador e apertarem m1. Como eu havia dito, o jogo beneficia muito aqueles que são capazes de exercerem 100% de um killer como nurse enquanto desprezam aqueles que não conseguem (ou só se recusam, pois preferem jogar com outro killer por X motivos) tornando o jogo um ''High risk high reward'', por exemplo, enquanto você tem que meticulosamente ouvir os passos de Spirit, saber baitar os loops com a habilidade dela, ter noção do quanto você pode, e deve se movimentar e o tempo de movimentação em um loop, os survivors tem apenas que correr, ver sua red light e saber counterar isso, que você pode pensar que é difícil mas acredite, não é. Tudo isso que eu acabei de dizer é counterado por apenas um perk chamado Iron Will ou Calm Spirit, pois a movimentação inteira da Spirit se baseia na sua habilidade que a deixa incapaz de ver os players, apenas ouvi-los, divertido não é?\n\nFalando em perks, é impressionante como o jogo da uma gama ENORME de capacidades de builds para os sobreviventes que não tem uma habilidade fixa (como os killers tem e que necessariamente precisam saber como usa-la efetivamente). Enquanto o Gen Rush acontece em quase todo o game a primeira solução que passa na cabeça dos desenvolvedores para resolver esse ''problema'' (entre '' pois eu não considero isso uma estratégia de jogo) é nerfar um dos únicos perks que antigamente poderia resolver esse problema (Hex Ruin, que atrasava de forma grotesca o avanço dos geradores, mas ainda sim é um Hex). E por causa disso, temos exemplos como o youtuber/streamer de DBD Otzdarva tomando um gerador nos primeiros 27 segundos de jogo (que normalmente sem coisas como toolboxes ou Prove Thyself demoram mais ou menos 1 minuto).\n\nIsso sem dizer dos killers, tenho que admitir que são bem feitos, tem habilidades únicas e divertidas, MAS devido ao meta do jogo ser extremamente engessado você é necessariamente forçado a jogar com killers que estejam dentro do meta (a menos que jogue EXTREMAMENTE BEM, acimado que seria necessário com outro killer), e mesmo os que estavam antigamente dentro do meta, são nerfados por motivo nenhum. Acha que eu to brincando? Um exemplo claro é o HillBilly, provavelmente o killer que antes do nerf era o mais consistente, quando melhor seu desempenho melhor a sua recompensa, mas que agora depois de um nerf sem sentido que o INCAPACITA DE USAR SUA HABILIDADE caso você não se preocupe com a barra de resfriamento da motossera, o torna mais e mais fora do meta, restando menos alternativas ainda a serem jogadas.\n\nEm relação aos killers em si, eu gosto praticamente de todos, todos tem bons designs, histórias e atualmente eles tem sido desenvolvidos com ferramentas que tem os ajudado a existir na partida (mais ou menos da época do Demogorgon pra frente), algo que trouxe um balanceamento pro jogo, mas nada que seja uma arma secreta para os killers, pois tudo é counterável nesse jogo.\n\nNão posso dizer que não recomendo DBD, é um jogo que eu já me diverti muito jogando, principalmente com amigos, mas devido aos motivos que eu citei acima (além de coisas como toxicidade que é muito comum no jogo) e por ter pego rank 1, decidi dar uma parada para desestressar.","timestamp_created":1579886484,"timestamp_updated":1605823321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62334560","author":{"steamid":"76561198448528863","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2767,"last_played":1625102334},"language":"polish","review":"Gra jest świetna","timestamp_created":1579886046,"timestamp_updated":1579886046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62334517","author":{"steamid":"76561198825664117","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5051,"last_played":1606230578},"language":"russian","review":"За маньяка играть страшнее чем за сурва -_-","timestamp_created":1579885993,"timestamp_updated":1579885993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62334415","author":{"steamid":"76561198419025476","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":20854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17305,"last_played":1655911628},"language":"tchinese","review":"很刺激 和朋友一起玩會很嗨\n但遊戲有時會不平衡\n以及有一些質素差的玩家(拔線，守尸等行為)","timestamp_created":1579885818,"timestamp_updated":1579885818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62334054","author":{"steamid":"76561198438783814","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4560,"last_played":1658427907},"language":"thai","review":"เกมส์อ่ะสนุกอยู่นะ เเร้งนิไม่มีความสมดุลเลยยยย ฆ่าตกรเเร้ง19 เจอเซอ เเร้ง 9 7 8  ไล่เเทบตายก็ไม่ได้ฆ่า","timestamp_created":1579885355,"timestamp_updated":1579885355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/6ug7O8Cdsbk7QE="}
