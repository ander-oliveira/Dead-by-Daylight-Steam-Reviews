A gente paga caríssimo pelo jogo e ainda paga pelas DLCs, cosméticos e afins e o suporte é medíocre. Tá muito mais divertido jogar customizada do que se aventurar pegando algum doente com a internet lixo nesses servidor dedicado mal feito.\n\nToda atualização é a mesma coisa: arrumam bugs de killer e quebram o jogo pra survivors. Se tem bug pra killer arrumam praticamente no mesmo dia, mas se aparece qualquer bug que prejudique survivor, demoram meses pra arrumar (hitbox toda zoada que o diga e já vão fazer 2 semanas e nada de arrumarem). Ou quando é bug que faz a empresa \"perder\" dinheiro, como naquela vez de algumas pessoas estarem recebendo algumas poucas auric cells (cash do jogo) e eles resolveram o problema em menos de 30 minutos!!!\n\nSe você abre ticket reclamando de erros como o de perder PIP/rank mesmo pontuando alto e ganhando medalhas, você recebe a b*sta de uma resposta automática dizendo que já sabem do problema e vão resolver (sabe-se lá quando).\n\n- Você tem DS é tunnelado, se não tem é tunnelado também.\n- Mapas novos sem pallets em lugar algum.\n- Killers hitando através de janelas mesmo você ja estando longe delas.\n- Perks para survivor não funcionando ou sendo nerfadas sem nenhuma necessidade.\n- Você leva disconnect do jogo e é penalizado pq a m*rda do servidor do jogo é hospedado em uma batata já apodrecendo.\n- Se survivor da disconnect no meio da partida ela continua (deixando o jogo mais difícil com menos 1 até 2 ou 3 a menos), mas se killer da disconnect no meio da partida pq não conseguiu enganchar ninguém, aí a partida termina e você ainda tem uma probabilidade de perder rank por causa disso. E se você leva facecamp até morrer também é penalizado com perda de rank por causa do killer imundo que usa uma estratégia medíocre. \n\nAlgum psicólogo behaviorista podia estudar os doente que são os main Bubba, porque eles devem ter o QI do porquinho que é esse hunter, pelo menos uma vez por dia dando facecamp. Fora a choradeira dos main killer brasil a fora, misericórdia. Não pode levar a m*rda de uma chave que é o fim do mundo, mas o bonito toda partida com addonzinho rosa.\n\nEnfim o jogo é uma m*rda e precisava de uma DLC Spring Break igual do Friday The 13 (E COM EMOTES DE DANÇA) porque se for pra passar raiva, que seja pelo menos as menina de biquíni dançando no basement.\n\nResumindo: o jogo não vale a pena no estado em que está. A empresa só quer saber de lançar skin e dlc's pagas e f0da-se os jogadores. Game cheio de bugs que as vezes impossibilita a gameplay e diversão.","timestamp_created":1613535612,"timestamp_updated":1613535612,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86851207","author":{"steamid":"76561199051584153","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":106422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5515,"playtime_at_review":1551,"last_played":1660576111},"language":"english","review":"Good and scary game\n","timestamp_created":1613535214,"timestamp_updated":1613535214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850849","author":{"steamid":"76561198347852183","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13949,"last_played":1633012812},"language":"russian","review":"///","timestamp_created":1613534730,"timestamp_updated":1613534730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850806","author":{"steamid":"76561199000908040","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":80,"playtime_at_review":4362,"last_played":1659752823},"language":"schinese","review":"进不去\n","timestamp_created":1613534675,"timestamp_updated":1613534675,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850663","author":{"steamid":"76561197992584681","num_games_owned":394,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":62405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":214,"playtime_at_review":17525,"last_played":1660262235},"language":"english","review":"Finally, an update that changes the meta and massively reduces the grind for perks on new characters.","timestamp_created":1613534490,"timestamp_updated":1657305788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502380967140197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850501","author":{"steamid":"76561199014238564","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":525,"playtime_at_review":2700,"last_played":1660184978},"language":"schinese","review":"我是傻逼","timestamp_created":1613534295,"timestamp_updated":1613534295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49101412296295166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850419","author":{"steamid":"76561198168786658","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1658790081},"language":"english","review":"bad but good","timestamp_created":1613534190,"timestamp_updated":1613534190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86850397","author":{"steamid":"76561198389727394","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11136,"last_played":1640009711},"language":"english","review":"There are some bugs.

Also, the game feels really laggy for some reason, again that could just be the new changes to the movement of survivors. The HUD for both killer AND survivor are really unnatural/over the top now.

latest changes to the game have pretty much destroyed it. The ui update, even with the proposed changes in the next patch, are awful and take up a ton of real estate. The new animations are unrealistic and take away from an immersive experience in the game. The continuous inability to fix bugs while pushing out more broken content is driving away players. I have over 1000 hours in this game and now I don't want to log on because it is so broken. Most recently its the hitboxes, the ui, and the emblem system constantly deranking players unless they survive a match (the unbroken emblem is currently not giving points or pips). I want to be able to play this game again without any of these issues. I wish the developers would focus more on fixing what is broken than pushing out new pay to play content and features. The vast majority of the community didn't ask for this HUD update and now we're stuck with it and the vast majority hate it. \nThis is a persistent problem with this game, not fixing the things we've been asking for and trying to add new shiny things we did not. Unless of course a dev is heard on stream saying something isn't important (e.g. the colorblind accessibility of the game), and then suddenly its a priority. I know gaming communities gripe a lot, but when the overwhelming majority is saying something, maybe you should listen.","timestamp_created":1613517423,"timestamp_updated":1613517423,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86837882","author":{"steamid":"76561198095213368","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":8416,"last_played":1660114010},"language":"english","review":"some times the perks broken sometimes you get a face camper and theres little you can do about em overall 8/10 the games fun but challenging.","timestamp_created":1613517410,"timestamp_updated":1613517410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86837788","author":{"steamid":"76561199139219507","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":52572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":927,"playtime_at_review":2133,"last_played":1660268408},"language":"english","review":"game is broken and in its worse state ever","timestamp_created":1613517291,"timestamp_updated":1613517291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583006143569946289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86837645","author":{"steamid":"76561199048251635","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12115,"last_played":1646263370},"language":"brazilian","review":"AMO O JOGO!!!!!
