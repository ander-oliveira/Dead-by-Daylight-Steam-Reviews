Es macht Spaß, es ist ausreichend spannend und ausreichend taktisch zu spielen. Es gibt viele interessante Fähigkeiten, mit denen man herumspielen kann. Das Spielprinzip ist zwar nicht neu, aber es ist trotzdem effektiv. Sein eigenes Slasher Szenario auf dem Bildschirm, blutige Killer austricksen- das alles klingt sehr ansprechend. Allerdings habe ich einige Anmerkungen, die meiner Meinung nach das Spiel nicht empfehlenswert machen. \n\n1. Geldgierige Developer\nDavon mal abgesehen, dass das Spiel alleine schon 20 EUR kostet, kommen dazu noch diverse DLC's mit wenig Inhalten (Meist ein Killer und 1-3 neue Survivor) für einen unverschämten Preis. Da man aber Charaktere (bzw. deren Fähigkeiten) brauch, um in Dead by Daylight Spaß zu haben, fühlt man sich oft natürlich wie von den Entwicklern erwartet, gezwungen weiteres Geld für extra Inhalte auszugeben. \nNatürlich gibt es auch die Möglichkeit in Game \"Schillernde Scherben\" zu sammeln, um Charaktere ohne DLC freizuschalten. Der Zeitaufwand dahinter ist jedoch einfach zu viel, man erhält immer nur sehr geringe Mengen. Nach fast 50 Stunden fehlen immer noch 20% bis ich das erste Mal einen Charakter durch Schillernde Scherben erwerben könnte, auch Freunde von mir erzählten mir, dass sie nach 200 Stunden Schillernde Scherben im Wert von 2,5 Charakteren sammeln konnten. So etwas kann man bei einem Free to play Game von mir aus raushauen, aber wenn man 20 EUR für ein Spiel ausgibt, sollte man zumindest ein besseres reward system erwarten dürfen. \nWas ich noch schlimmer finde, als jemand der viel Wert auf die Ästhetik seiner gespielten Charaktere gibt, sind die unglaublich frechen Preise für Skins. Um die zu erwerben gibt es natürlich noch eine zweite Währung, die man mit echten Geld kaufen kann. Manchmal bin ich versucht, aufgrund der geringen Auswahl an äußerlichen Anpassungen zur Brieftasche zu greifen, aber wenn ich dann sehe, dass mich EIN EINZIGES Outfit (kein gold glänzender super Skin, ein anderes Set Kleidung!!) 15 EUR kostet, überlege ich mir das ganz schnell nochmal anders.\nAuch wenn Skins keine Auswirkungen auf das Gameplay haben, finde ich es doch einfach schade, dass sie ihren Fans das Geld so dreckig aus der Tasche ziehen. \n\n2. Balance und Hitbox \nOft merkt man, wie unausgeglichen das Game eigentlich ist. Es gibt Talente die Killer oder auch Überlebende so OP machen, dass man wenn man nicht mit eigenen Perks dagegen wirken kann, die Runde quasi direkt verloren hat, egal wie gut man ist. Natürlich ist das Spiel darauf ausgelegt, einem Vorteile durch die Talente, die man hart erarbeiten kann zu verschaffen- Vorteile bedeutet aber nicht, dass es je nach Talenten unausweichlich zum Sieg führt. Es macht genauso keinen Spaß eine Runde direkt zu gewinnen, wie sie zu verlieren. Da müssten die Developer viel aktiver hinterher sein.\nDie Hitbox der Charaktere ist teilweise VIEL zu groß. Man passt nicht zusammen durch Türen, steht sich dauernd in panischen Momenten im Weg, weil einfach KEIN PLATZ ist und das obwohl es von dem was das Auge sieht locker gereicht hätte.\n\n3. Update Größe und Bugs\nBugs sorgen dafür, dass man einfach keinen Bock mehr hat, weiter zu spielen. Auf einmal fliegen deine Mitspieler durch die Luft, du wirst plötzlich gegen eine Wand und siehst dann nur noch deine verdienten Blutpunkte. Es ist eine alte Leier und das man das bei einem Game dieser Größe nicht hinkriegt so etwas zu fixen, ist traurig.\nDie Größe der Updates sind wirklich schlimm. Ich habe noch nie ein 20GB Update für ein so kartoffeliges Spiel herunterladen müssen. Ich meine 20GB?! Für ein Archiv Event?? Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass man das nicht Speicherplatz freundlicher hätte programmieren können. \n\nZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\nGraphics\nO You forget what reality is\nO Beautiful\nO Good\nO Decent\nX Average\nO Bad\nO Don‘t look too long at it\nO MS-DOS\n\nGameplay\nO Very good\nO Good\nX It's just gameplay\nO Mehh\nO Watch paint dry instead\nO Just don't\n\nAudio\nO Eargasm\nO Very good\nO Good\nX Not too bad\nO Bad\nO I'm now deaf\n\nAudience\nO Kids\nX Teens\nO Adults\nO Grandma\n\nPC Requirements\nO Check if you can run paint\nO Potato\nX Decent\nO Fast\nO Rich boi\nO Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\nDifficulty\nO Just press 'W'\nO Easy\nX Easy to learn / Hard to master\nO Significant brain usage\nO Difficult\nO Dark Souls\n\nGrind\nO Nothing to grind\nO Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\nO Isn't necessary to progress\nO Average grind level\nX Too much grind\nO You'll need a second life for grinding\n\nStory\nO No Story\nX Some lore\nO Average\nO Good\nO Lovely\nO It'll replace your life\n\nGame Time\nO Long enough for a cup of coffee\nO Short\nO Average\nO Long\nX To infinity and beyond\n\nPrice\nO It's free!\nO Worth the price\nX If it's on sale\nO If u have some spare money left\nX Not recommended\nO You could also just burn your money\n\nBugs\nO Never heard of\nO Minor bugs\nX Can get annoying\nO ARK: Survival Evolved\nO The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n4 / 10","timestamp_created":1652801974,"timestamp_updated":1652801974,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115597174","author":{"steamid":"76561198303428478","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7708,"last_played":1653252006},"language":"english","review":"Yeah, since mom told me not to kill people irl, i found this amazing game where i can do it however much i want and instead of getting skolded i get rewarded with points that i use to become an even better killer :D...","timestamp_created":1652801408,"timestamp_updated":1652801408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115596929","author":{"steamid":"76561198142302676","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":36570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":969,"playtime_at_review":18597,"last_played":1660598191},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good job so far, i think\n","timestamp_created":1652801072,"timestamp_updated":1652801072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115596353","author":{"steamid":"76561198809666160","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":42880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4656,"playtime_at_review":6438,"last_played":1660582655},"language":"schinese","review":"上门修机不给钱还要挨打T T","timestamp_created":1652800228,"timestamp_updated":1652800228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115595395","author":{"steamid":"76561198060370838","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1523294454},"language":"english","review":"nah","timestamp_created":1652798810,"timestamp_updated":1652798810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516827583312988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115595329","author":{"steamid":"76561198044815613","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":66989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60596,"last_played":1658852328},"language":"german","review":"An Tagen macht es Spaß, und wiederrum andere nicht!
