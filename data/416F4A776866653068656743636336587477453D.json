About every single time i've been hit was an unfair hit. \n\nI would say just wait for this to hopefully get fixed, but Behavior does this shit constantly.

Donc les débutants si vous voulez un conseil, soyez patients, regarder les autres survivants jouer si vous êtes morts, faites du gameplay des deux côtés (pour pouvoir correctement jouer tueur, il faut comprendre comment on joue survivant, et du coup pouvoir les anticiper).\n\nLe seul petit malus est au niveau de la communauté, et malheureusement on ne peut pas en vouloir aux développeurs, car c'est malheureusement le cas (plus ou moins) dans tous les jeux multi.\n\nCôté graphisme ça n'es pas très poussé. Quand un tueur blesse ou tue un survivant le graphisme du survivant ne bouge, contrairement à Friday the 13th, ce qui est très appréciable quand on fini un survivant :)\n\nLe gros point négatif mais qui est en attente de devenir positif (été 2019) est d'avoir des serveurs dédiés (pour le moment ce sont les tueurs qui host), ce qui permettra de régler certains lags, ou même des fois (souvent même) des déconnections de joueurs en pleine partie, ce qui pénalise énormément le reste de la partie.\n\nAu niveau des dlc, il est vrai que ça peut devenir cher si vous vous mettez à acheter tous les dlc de la liste. Alors je vous recommande de n'acheter au début un, voir deux dlc payant qui vous intéresse le plus (avec le contenu de base), tout ça réunis devrais pouvoir vous permettre de vous familiariser avec le jeu, et obtenir la monnaie suffisante pour débloquer les autres dlc \"gratuitement\" (grosses séances de farm requises.)","timestamp_created":1546401148,"timestamp_updated":1546401148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617353439331054688","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48030901","author":{"steamid":"76561198097563618","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1320,"last_played":1607307206},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever.

The killer must hunt down and sacrifice as many of the survivors as they can and prevent their escape.\nThis is an Independent Game. It's not from an established studio. But it's still excellent. \n- You choose if you play as a Survivor or Killer. \n- Matchmaking is very good right now. If you pick Survivor or Killer you will get a game quickly. \n- If the Killer quits because he's doing poorly, the Survivors all get an XP reward. \n- If you get killed as a Survivor you can quit the match, get your XP and nobody is penalised. The match carries on for everyone else and you are free to start a new one. \n- The game rewards cooperation and this encourages survivors to help each other so most of the time they do. \n- You're going to suck as a level 1 Survivor and probably struggle as a level 1 Killer. Manage your expectations. Learn to play. It doesn't take too long to get the hang of it and once you realise this then the game is more fun and you can be encouraged by progression. \n- There are many Audio Cues to things that are happening in game. A decent Gaming Headset will really compliment this game. \nGraphically the game is fine. Some games look better and that's because they've got the same budget as a Hollywood Blockbuster. The graphics do the job fine for this game. \nAudio for this game is exceptional. Audio cues make a Gaming Headset a huge advantage. \nGameplay seems very simple at first but as you continue you realise it's much more complex. The first few times you get a \"Skill Check\" while you're completing an action like fixing a Generator or Healing a colleague you'll fail and think it's ridiculous. But eventaully you'll recognise the Audio Cue for the Skill Check and because you're prepared you'll usually hit it easily. \nExpect to get murdered early on and have fun with abandon. As you become more experienced with the game you'll find success with both Survivors and Killers alike. \nGreat game.","timestamp_created":1546392872,"timestamp_updated":1546392872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48028256","author":{"steamid":"76561198059799557","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2866,"last_played":1575059614},"language":"russian","review":"Игра замечательна особенно с друзьями","timestamp_created":1546391426,"timestamp_updated":1546391426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48028180","author":{"steamid":"76561198024967164","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1548282445},"language":"english","review":"Dead By Daylight is one of a kind.
