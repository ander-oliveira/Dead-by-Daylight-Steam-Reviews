Yes it has some things that need to be worked on, such as new gamemodes like hide and seek, more objectives, etc., but every game has it's downs. Despite these downs, the gameplay is fun, addictive, sadistic, and rewarding. You can play as survivor and either help your fellow teammates to survive, or play as a survivor who is a lone wolf and use others as bait. Alternatively, you can be the killer and live out your goriest nightmares, with you behind the mask. Being killer is a lot harder than being survivor nowadays, but it is still a fun experience. Especially when you get that sweet revenge on the survivor who's been trolling you the entire game. This game is not pay to win at all because if you buy DLC characters, you just get the chance to use bloodpoints to get new perks, where if you don't buy DLC, you can still get said perks using in-game currency. Speaking of DLC, most of the characters are non-DLC and are part of an ever expanding roster of killers and survivors.

Es ist auch sehr erfreulich, dass in diesem Spiel eigentlich Kameradschaftlichkeit gefördert wird, zumindest als Survivor. Weiterhin kann der Spaßfaktor sehr hoch sein, wenn nicht ein paar Dinge eintreten, welche ich später noch erleutern möchte. Außerdem hat man viele Möglichkeiten, was die Auswahl der Perks/Fähigkeiten angeht, auch wenn manche öfter gespielt werden als andere. Das Levelsystem mit den Blutpunkten und dem Blutnetz, als auch die Möglcihkeit Dinge über den Schrein zu erwerben bringen, meiner Meinung nach, einen eigenen und passenden Flair in das Spiel.\n\nKommen wir zu den nicht so schönen Dingen, hier eine Auflistung:\n- Antimates (Leute, die den Killer zu Dir locken oder Dich nicht abhängen, obwohl die Möglichkeit besteht)\n- Trolls (ja, die hat jedes Spiel, trotzdem sind sie nervig und verderben es einem) \n- Unfaire Spieler (ja, auch die hat jedes Spiel, ich weiß)\n- Leute, die Downloads starten, wenn sie ins Spiel gehen (man/er/sie laggt sich durch die Gegend)\n\nUnd hier noch ein paar Anmerkungen/genauere Erklärungen von mir:\nZu unfairen Spielern zähle ich in diesem Fall eher Killer als Survivor. Damit meine ich Leute, die dich am Hakan campen (Note: Es ist nicht verboten, wird aber von der Community nicht gerne gesehen) oder dich fokussieren. \nAntimates sind die \"unfairen Spieler\" unter den Survivorn. Sie denken nur an ihr Überleben und scheren sich einen Dreck um die anderen Survivor.\nAuch Trolls treten eher unter den Survivorn auf. Sie teabaggen hinter Paletten oder im Ausgang, schwirren zu dritt um den Killer, sodass dieser nicht weiß, wen er als erstes hitten soll und, was vllt auch an meiner wenigen Erfahrung als Killer liegen mag, schafft es nicht, einen zu verfolgen, ohne, dass die anderen ihn blockieren oder von ihm durch Spuren ablenken um es anschließend von Neuem zu beginnen.\n\nAlles in allem hatte ich schon sehr schöne Runden in DBD, muss aber leider sagen, dass es auch einige negative Aspekte gibt, welche für mich zur Zeit leider überwiegen. Dementsprechend muss ich dem Spiel dafür, wenn man alleine spielt, leider eine negative Bewertung geben.\nSollte man jedoch mit Freunden spielen, würde ich es positiv bewerten.\n\n\nEDIT!!!!\n\nNach mehreren Patches und etlichen weiteren Stunden muss ich nochmal ein Fazit ziehen.\n\nDas Spiel ist besser geworden. Zumindest für eine der beiden Seiten. Nämlich die Killer. In etlichen Patches wurden immer wieder Killer und ihre Perks verbessert. während die meist gespielten Perks der Survivor immer wieder verschlechtert wurden. Klar wurden bei den Survivorn auch Perks verbessert. Diese werden aber trotzdem kaum bis gar nicht gespielt. Bei den Killern hingegen werden die oft gespielten Perks beibehalten. \n\nDas wird natürlich bemerkt und so spielen immer mehr Leute nur noch mit Freunden als Survivor, da man als 4er-Gruppe vielleicht mal überlebt oder wechseln zu den Killern. Die Folge: Deutlich längere Wartezeiten für die Killer. In Extremfällen wird das Spiel sogar gar nicht mehr, oder nur in seltenen Ausnahmen mit Freunden gespielt.\n\nWeiterhin ist das Spiel, durch die ganzen Änderungen an den Killern definitiv nicht einsteigerfreundlich. Ich habe während der freien Wochenendes den neuen Killer gespielt. Dafür hatte ich mir vorher 800k Blutpunkte angespart und konnte den Killer dementsprechend schon leveln. In den Runden hatte ich dann Survivor mit einem oder zwei Perks gegen mich, denen man angemerkt hat, dass sie neu waren. Ich sage es mal so: bis auf eine Runde sind immer alle Survivor gestorben. Was das mit nicht einsteigerfreundlich zu tun hat? Hier meine Antwort: Es darf nicht sein, dass neue Spieler gegen mich oder noch erfahrenere Killer spielen. Wenn sie keinen Erfolg haben und immer sterben, werden sie das Spiel nicht weiterspielen. Mit anderen Worten: Das Problem ist das Matchmaking für die Anfänger. Daran sollte gearbeitet werden, ansonsten wird DbD vermutlich keine neuen Spieler anlocken.\n\nAllerdings kann ich allen Survivorn einen Tipp geben. Geht mit der Erwartung in das Spiel auf einen Camper oder Tunneler zu treffen und Antimates als Mitspieler zu haben und ihr seid auf alles gefasst. Wenn man so startet, regt man sich weniger auf, wenn man auf eins oder mehr davon trifft. \n\nDementsprechend würde ich das Spiel inzwischen sogar noch schlechter bewerten als vorher.\n\nP.S.: Zerstört immer die Totems, da inzwischen 95% der Killer NOED (Niemand entrinnt dem Tod) verwenden.","timestamp_created":1521473383,"timestamp_updated":1537886810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562155544757843018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40921465","author":{"steamid":"76561198092541223","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":15034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9237,"last_played":1638501021},"language":"english","review":"I think we did a pretty good job so far...
