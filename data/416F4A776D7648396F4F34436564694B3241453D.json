Unfortunately, this wonderful game got matched with the wrong dev team. This deav team does not listen to its community, ignores feedback, brings in features noone needs but they think will make the game \"healthier\", while everyone knows it wont.\n\nThey recently updated their HUD which literally made EVERYTHING less clear and harder to see. Because they thought they needed to add new visuals noone needs. Also they couldve easily added those visuals without changing the whole HUD.\n\nWhen looking at some of their livestreams like \"Devs play Dead By Daylight\" you can clearly see why that is. 98% of their team has clearly no idea of high rank gameplay.\n\nA few years ago, the community was really screaming for a flashlight nerf (you can blind the killer, but the way its add-ons worked were objectively overpowered). The dev team did nothing about it until one of its game directors live streamed once playing killer, and the survivors noticed it was him and all used that exact add-on and completely destroyed him. A day later the add-on was nerfed. That should pretty much sum up the dev team.\n\nUnfortunately, especially in the last year the patches have become even worse. It pretty much sums up as the following: The dev team sees a problem the community has seen already for years, they fix it to the worse OR the dev team sees a problem that doesnt exist and creates unnecessary problems. Its insane.\n\nNot to speak about the ranked system. You will experience on average 5 minute queues to be matched with ranks totally not in your leauge. E.g. ranks are 1 (highest) to 20 (lowest) I recently got matched as a rank 3 survivor with rank 16, 17 and 18 against a rank 10 killer. I had no premates or something else, I just queued alone. HOW? Its just pure madness.\n\nApart from that, the dev team bans people for revealing bugs in the game, even if they don't show how to exploit them. I've seen people who have been banned for show casing a possible bug in a CUSTOM game without showing how. How can a normal human being approve such a policy? They dont have a proper report system, players can be extremely toxic, in and out of the game, nothing happens. Someone reports a bug to the dev team without telling others how to exploit it? BANNED! Yikes.\n\nTo keep up a good reputation as a game, instead of actually making the game better or listening to the community, the devs pay content creators to not critizise the game on stream or in videos. Imagine that. Of course they're not calling it that way, its a \"Content Creator Support\" (called the \"Fog Whisperers Program\") and all they have to do to stay in the program is to not say something bad about the game. Sure. Probably the only system they implemented that actually works.\n\nTo sum it up (once more): Dont buy or play this game! Not because its bad, its a wonderful game, but you will become hooked and the dev team will disappoint you. Again, and again, and again. You'll get angry, forget about it, get even angrier everytime you hear of the next update. You dont even need to wait for something you think is surreal, they throw it right at everyones face daily. Its honestly the worst dev team I've ever experienced.","timestamp_created":1573075091,"timestamp_updated":1613077503,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56654001","author":{"steamid":"76561198361889681","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5983,"last_played":1635407966},"language":"english","review":"small balance issues, but overall an amazing experience for both killers and survivors.","timestamp_created":1573075065,"timestamp_updated":1573075065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56653883","author":{"steamid":"76561198195876821","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":13332,"last_played":1660224414},"language":"english","review":"love everything","timestamp_created":1573074911,"timestamp_updated":1573074911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56653749","author":{"steamid":"76561198999065017","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7343,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1660576527},"language":"schinese","review":"贼好玩","timestamp_created":1573074730,"timestamp_updated":1573074730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56653438","author":{"steamid":"76561198127120114","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":19346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2056,"last_played":1642617127},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, где где токсичный не тот, кто убивает, а тот - кто пытается выжить.\nПовесил сурва на крюк.

The ONLY reason I am recommending this is because I can (for some reason) say it is genuinely fun with FRIENDS. If I could give a neutral rating I would. Do NOT buy this game with the intent to play it by yourself, you will have a bad time.\n\nUpdated review: For some reason this community has become a lot less toxic over time (which really doesn't happen with any game), I still wouldn't recommend solo-queuing survivor by yourself, but playing killer by yourself can be great so long as you're not at high rank.\n\nAt High Rank in the game there is no way to play the game other than to run the meta, because the only way to counter survivor meta without getting rolled is to run killer meta and vice versa. Survive with Friends can be incredibly difficult to counter as a killer and sometimes almost feel unfair due to some perks such as Object of Obsession that allow them to call out exactly where you are and what you're doing, which makes mind-games borderline impossible and some killers (such as Trapper) unplayable. \n\nOn the other side of the argument, there are killer perks and add-ons that massively tilt the game in favour of the killer, such as Huntress' insta-down hatchets and Hex: Ruin. Ruin can extend games out massively as the killer can pressure gens by chasing you without having to waste time going over to the generator you were on and smacking it, whilst some add-ons allow the killer to end the game incredibly quickly and can quite often lead to a rapid depip.\n\nThen outside of perks and add-ons, there are also maps that can tilt the favour of the match in either side, with some maps being much better for killer or much better for survivor. The problem with this is there's 4 survivors to 1 killer which means more often than not there will be survivors sending killers to a map that massively benefits them which suffice to say can quite often lead to either a very difficult game or a game that is decided as soon as you start.\n\nThese map advantages won't be immediately noticeable until you get relatively good at the game, but once you do you'll notice things like bad pallet and window placements on certain maps or horrible pathways to hooks and generators, or bad visibility in loops and these all will massively affect game-play and are heavily dependant on the map.\n\nThe TL:DR of my review is the game can be fun but at high rank don't expect to be able to play with much freedom until you manage to get EXTREMELY good, what you play or run will often be down to a small selection of viable killers and perks.","timestamp_created":1573065213,"timestamp_updated":1604760811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56645399","author":{"steamid":"76561198283793463","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8565,"last_played":1633464418},"language":"german","review":"dieses battlepass system ist immer noch bullshit das benutzt eh niemand sonst passt","timestamp_created":1573065168,"timestamp_updated":1626518418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56645213","author":{"steamid":"76561198349489291","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":50337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31914,"last_played":1657661890},"language":"english","review":"good game,shitty players","timestamp_created":1573064992,"timestamp_updated":1573064992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56645001","author":{"steamid":"76561198348222222","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":113603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":80,"playtime_at_review":45242,"last_played":1660269319},"language":"english","review":"ive played this game since 2016 and took a huge break in 2020, after a while this game gets really boring but after a long break this game is fun again. on top of that matches can be fun or frustrating, if ur a new player and have never played before then this game will be really fun for you and ur friends so thats why i think its worth the money.","timestamp_created":1573064772,"timestamp_updated":1657150989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmvH9oO4CediK2AE="}
