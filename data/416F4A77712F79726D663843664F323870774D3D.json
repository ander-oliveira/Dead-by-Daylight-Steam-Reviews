Have made a lot of friends on it and it offers a genuinely unique form of gameplay you aren't going to find in other games. Not to mention the killers that are offered let you play as some really cool characters (I love the Demogorgon.) That being said, I've lost the motivation to play this game within the 5 or so months for a multitude of reasons, most of which being the game isn't that fun anymore. Coupled with somewhat incompetent developers, the game feels a bit lifeless nowadays.\n\nI mostly played killer, was just the role I enjoyed more. It eventually got to a point though where I was forced to sweat most matches to get a win, and I don't really enjoy not having fun most matches. This is mostly a personal issue, because different people are going to be able to lose with more grace, but I don't personally enjoy the gameplay nessecarily without any payoff. A lot of matches will end with 8 hooks and no kills, and it gets repetitive being T-bagged and insulted at the end of almost every match. So I'm not really the best killer, and when book totems and other (in my opinion) unnessecary buffs were added to survivor, I kind of just dropped the game. I understand the whole \"Just get better lawl\" argument, but I've played this game for a long time, and I just don't feel like putting myself through a bunch of un-fun and extremely frusterating matches just to \"get good.\"\n\nSo, if you're someone who isn't competitive, and is ok with losing for hours and hours on end, on the basis that it will \"make you better\", then I would recommend the game. Not saying you're bad at games, but this is one of those games that will take a lot of work to get into. Do be warned though, past the personal frustrations are genuine issue's with game development. Don't expect meaningful or helpful patches that balance the game, or make it funner for both sides. It's a pretty shared sentiment in the community that they don't really understand the mechanics of their own game.","timestamp_created":1645832170,"timestamp_updated":1645832170,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111021785","author":{"steamid":"76561198849282277","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":68,"playtime_at_review":7023,"last_played":1660342644},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1645832125,"timestamp_updated":1645832125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111021371","author":{"steamid":"76561199230249362","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1656871522},"language":"english","review":"love this game","timestamp_created":1645831691,"timestamp_updated":1645831691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111019790","author":{"steamid":"76561198805557183","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9161,"last_played":1656039169},"language":"spanish","review":"Divertido cuando jugas de sobreviviente una mierda cuando jugas de asesino uno que nunca juego de asesino no le podes poner gente con rango de oro o sangre a un bronce iv muy mal el emparejamiendo y mas que tocan puros premades que te hacen amargar una partida pongan limites que sea max 2 premades y ya por que hacen la partida desagradable.","timestamp_created":1645830207,"timestamp_updated":1645830207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111018995","author":{"steamid":"76561198448581702","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4047,"last_played":1658439244},"language":"brazilian","review":"sim","timestamp_created":1645829447,"timestamp_updated":1645829447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111018647","author":{"steamid":"76561198263455475","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":70222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":708,"playtime_at_review":42750,"last_played":1660251016},"language":"english","review":"This game literally makes me want to end my life.

The killers are so overpowered and the survivors are screwed over in every way possible.\n\nThere's literally an item that gives Myers an insta kill on someone who's been never been hooked or hurt. It's worse than a Mori and can be activated faster than one too. Every killer is some level of terrible. Be it PC huntress sniping you from a mile away or the deathslinger being able to shoot through objects.\n\nEach change they make to the game just makes the killers more powerful. Be it the map designs blocking most of the windows and doorways, or creating dead ends everywhere, which would suck for anyone with memory issues. Or the survivors being able to get downed from several feet away due to bad hit boxes and a large hit radius on every killer. Not to mention charge attacks that carry them several feet forward. Also spamming to drop a pallet but somehow their hit goes through faster when your not even close to their weapon.\n\nAlso the quests favor killers too, prompting you to play them in order to gain any decent amount of blood points in a day.\n\nThe glitches are also a major issue, like a killer being able to launch themselves onto a hay bale that shouldn't be accessible at all, but sense they're coming at you with a chainsaw I guess it's fair right?\n\nI've played killer and it's so easy to win that I just stopped killing players. I hate how over powered they are even when I play them. I can count on one hand how many times I've gotten screwed over as the killer, but I couldn't even count how many times being a survivor has ruined my entire day. One match can be so utterly unfair that it makes every survivor annoyed and stop playing. It's not fun. You get a handful of good moments in a session, but compared to just how many games you play and hate, it's just not worth it. I only ever play this game with friends at this point because I never want to go in solo knowing not only the killer will screw me, but the other survivors and map design and hit boxes will too. I can not see why anyone would play this alone, it would actively make me depressed and annoyed.\n\nMost of my game sessions consist of me and my friends listing dozens of ways the game could be fixed to be balanced, but will any of it ever happen? No.\n\nThey tried to fix the wiggle mechanics, but that wasn't the issue. It's the fact that 3 hooks are next to you at all time and getting away is always next to impossible. And even if you can get away they can just down you again in the next 10-30 seconds because they know exactly where you're going.\n\nYou can never be prepared for a specific killer because it's random, but they can always be prepared for you. This game is just so killer thirsty that playing survivor feels like masochism at this point. 7 times out of 10 at least half your team will die unless it's just a lucky day or the killer just lets you live. It's just sad when a game session's biggest joke is how they always simp for the same person on your team and let's them live after brutally killing you and everyone else. I sometimes feel like the game plays into favoring user names or skins and promotes discriminating against certain people because of how they look. Not to mention if you offend a killer by surviving they'll just down you later and camp your body until you're dead.\n\nSo yeah, I just can not ever recommend this game because of just how flawed it is. Which is just so sad because of how great it could have been.","timestamp_created":1645828445,"timestamp_updated":1645828445,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111017499","author":{"steamid":"76561198239499656","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":179553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1295,"playtime_at_review":137063,"last_played":1660596092},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo tem mts problemas, os devs não ouvem a comunidade, mapas muito desequilibrados e killers com niveis de poder muito distintos.

Les gens ont oubliés qu'ils sont sur un jeu, et le respect est resté sur le côté du bureau. Je parlerai pas du GenRush que vous allez vous prendre dans la gueule, en plus des tibag et des taunts récurent. Un réel plaisir.\n\nEn tueur, j'me suis toujours dis \"je tunnel pas, je camp pas, on joue fair\". Ce que j'ai fais sur les débuts de game. Mais en montant dans les rangs, on s'aperçoit très vite que si le mental craque parce qu'un mec vous a troll toute la game, on oublie vite ces principes et ça part en camping face sur le trolleur. \n\nEn parlant avec des joueurs, souvent ce qui me revient c'est \"il manque des tueurs\". En même temps, à force de tomber sur ce genre de joueurs, je comprends pourquoi une bonne partie des gens se barrent. Et c'est ces joueurs toxic qui après iront pleurer qu'ils n'y a plus personne, mais posez vous les bonnes questions ? no ?\n\nPour finir, je recommande pas ce jeu (ni d'investir) si vous n'avez pas un mental d'acier, ou si vous cherchez du fun en solo, vous allez être déçu. Oui, vous aurez de bonnes games de tant à autres, mais ça sera moindre que vos games ou les gens vous chieront à la gueule.\nCependant, je vous le recommande si vous jouez avec vos potes, ça peut donner des parties très funs entres copains ^^.","timestamp_created":1645825740,"timestamp_updated":1645825740,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111014158","author":{"steamid":"76561198168026308","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30715,"last_played":1659164948},"language":"spanish","review":"MM del orto no sirve para mierda, y los de consola son todos pt","timestamp_created":1645825106,"timestamp_updated":1645825106,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111012584","author":{"steamid":"76561198802591087","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":273,"last_played":1645823718},"language":"english","review":"its very fun to play with friends","timestamp_created":1645823741,"timestamp_updated":1645823741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111012521","author":{"steamid":"76561198363982173","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":34949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":549,"playtime_at_review":29955,"last_played":1660595175},"language":"spanish","review":"ESTA VERY GOOD JUEGO GOD TIER","timestamp_created":1645823687,"timestamp_updated":1645823687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111012431","author":{"steamid":"76561197989037732","num_games_owned":640,"num_reviews":212,"playtime_forever":2253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":2022,"last_played":1659707174},"language":"english","review":"---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☐ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☑ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☑ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☑ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☑ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☑ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10","timestamp_created":1645823624,"timestamp_updated":1645823624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111011548","author":{"steamid":"76561199234745185","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":66,"playtime_at_review":2304,"last_played":1660499521},"language":"brazilian","review":"Comprei o jogo recentimente e confeso que adorei muito. os killers e os personagem,  seria melhor ainda adicionarem mais killers no jogo","timestamp_created":1645822862,"timestamp_updated":1645822862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq/yrmf8CfO28pwM="}
