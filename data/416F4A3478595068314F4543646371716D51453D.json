블러드 포인트가 굉장히 많이 필요함.\n다른 캐릭터의 스킬을 자신이 선호하는 캐릭터에 넣기 위해서는 너무 오랜시간동안 플레이 해야됨\n아이템과 아이템 보조도구는 랜덤으로 얻더라도 최소한 스킬만은 원하는걸 살수 있게 해줬으면 할정도\n한캐릭터의 레벨을 30 이상을 찍어야 얻는 전승 퍽을 찍어야 다른 캐릭으로도 그 스킬을 사용할수 있는게 아니라 얻을 기회가 생긴다는점도 고인물과 뉴비의 차이를 벌리는것중하나.\n지금은 할인기간으로 초보 유입이 많지만 대부분은 위에 적어놓은대로 고인물들과의 차이로 인해 접을 가능성이 너무높음.\n신전 시스템을 이용해도 너무 느린 스킬입수 및 스킬레벨 상승\n주마다 4개의 스킬이 나오지만 원하는 스킬을 얻기 힘듬\n스킬만이 게임의 전부는 아니지만 최소한 입문자들 숨통은 트여줘야 한다고 생각합니다.\n어느정도 스킬과 아이템을 입수하고 나면 재미있어질 만한 게임이지만 입수할때까지의 시간이 게임에 재미를 붙일 시간과 비례할지 누구도 장담못함\n살인마의 경우 살인마마다 선호 스킬이 다르지만  클래식 스킬들(한방퍽 포함) 몇가지와 루인,과 같은 스킬들을 얻기 위한 시간이 오래걸림. 생각보다 토템 위치, 판자갯수나 발전기 위치, 개구멍 위치같은 운과 같은요소로 인해  게임이 터질때가 많이나옴.\n살인마는 살인마들 간 너프와 버프로 밸런싱 조절이 시급해보임\n생존자의 경우 원하는 스킬이 현 1티어 스킬인 칼찌, 스프린트, 자힐, 시계 or 불굴 or 데드하드 일경우 최소 캐릭터 4개는 육성해야함.\n옛날보다 블러드 포인트 벌기 쉽게 일퀘가 있고, 신전에서는 이미 구입한 전승퍽의 경우 죠스바를 블포로 환산해준다지만 저런 스킬들 얻는데 쓰는걸 비교한다면 생각보다 힘듬.\n아이템과 스킬을 따로 살수 있게 해줘야 뉴비들 유입이 쉬워질듯.\n살인마 입장에서는 칼찌, 스프린트 많아진다 생각도 많이 들겠지만 최소한 뉴비들 재미 붙일정도는 되야한다고

Normally, the goal of a game would be to get more people to play it, make that the old and the new players are having fun and balancing so nothing is really OP more very weak.\n\nFirstly they get many new player to play this, obviously.\n\nSecond, oh boi, what are you doing?\nI want to speak directly to the devs now: A Game needs a skillcap. A skillcap so high that you need hundreds of hours to get it all, the new patch is garbage, removing the difficulty in flashlight und pallet saves is a really really bad idea because not only you are removing a high risk, high reward thing from the game (wasted pallet or wasted flashlight is failed) but also, you are nerfing directly EVERY KILLER. You need to add more Stuff in order to let old players have more fun with it.\nRight now its just: you go ingame and do gens or you pallet loop the killer. If you know where every pallet is and if your team saves you, you wont need ANY jukes and with the nurse getting nerfed the last killer hasnt got a chance against it.\n\nBut actually thats the third one: Your balancing is bad. Idk whether you are only survivor mains but playing killer sucks. It really does. Killer who arent the nurse (got nerfed) havent got a that high skillcap, and with that not so many posibilitys, to stop the survivors to make gens. Hex:Ruin is a must have in order to get a high rank because without the gens are way to fast done. It was like that already before *1.9.2* but now its even worse. With getting 100%ly out of the killers grasp with a pallet or flashlight save, playing Killer doesnt just suck way more, its also very unlikly to win. It was survivor > Killer and now? Now its Survivor >>>> Killer (?!).\nPlaying as Survivor makes no fun too, cause of the low skillcap you can achieve.\n\nFreddy is garbage. Why does he have a ability to hinder himself?! Whats the point of that?!?!\nI got a few Ideas to change it, but I cant change the fact that killer are much weaker then 4 survivor and the amount of 100% pallet and flashlight saves they have.\n\nPls devs, balance Killer and survivor and bring me my skillcap back. 360s were so hard to make but so rewarding and you made letherface, the pig, and freddy. Every time I did a flashlight save or a pallet save I was feeling so good but now its so unstatisfying. Every time a did a 3 or 4 K at high rank I was so proud of me, but thats not possible anymore and trying it sucks so hard.\nSTOP IT.\n\nIf the game ever gets his old spirit again I will highly recommend it.
