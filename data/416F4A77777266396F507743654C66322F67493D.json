game is a mixed bag for me. In one hand it's an enjoyable game that I have a lot of fun playing with my friends and on my own. It's an amazing game for people who love horror media and the 3 people that still play Friday The 13th The Game and it's overall a decently made, \"chill\" (At some points), and fun game. However, As a person who has played 300 hours on my Switch and is currently almost on 100 hours on PC I think I have the right to say this game has some problems. Balancing, game design, and the developers themselves. Let's start off with the big thing. Balancing. For every multiplayer game out there that involves 2 sides fighting against each other, it is pretty important to make it fair for both sides. Some games have no problem doing this. Dead By Daylight however, well, let me put in a simple and kind manner, it struggles with this a lot. \n             Now you see, I don't blame Behaviour at all with this problem. Well. Partially at least. There is what? Like almost 30 killers and survivors in the game? I think they really screwed themselves over with the \"3 or 4 chapters a year\" promise. Every killer, and every survivor has to have different perks that are different everytime, every killer has to have a balanced power that's unique and can work with different maps and situations. AND, they have to make all of this, in like 3 months. A simple solution would be shortening that 3 or 4 chapters to 1 or 2. OR. Release 1 chapter a year, and spend the rest of your god damn time and money to fix the game instead of releasing new chapters and cosmetics. Now on to what I was saying before. Taking a break once in a while and fixing past killer's powers and animations and add-ons and perks for both killer's and survivors, fixing maps, adding gamemodes that are out of the same asymmetrical 4 v 1 aspect that has been the norm for 6 fucking years would be amazing. But. That goes on to my next point.\n            Behaviour Interactive Inc. is what I would call a company that is oblivious to its audiences responses. \"Ay Behaviour, fix this ongoing problem where console players can barely play the game because of lag.\", \"Oi Behavior, this perk needs a fixing, it is incredibly useless, could you take a look at it?\", Buenos Diaz Behaviour, why did you nerf Pig for the hundredth fucking time instead of focusing on killers who NEED IT!\". Well simple answer. Behaviour doesn't give a shit, because they are living paradise without any competitors trying to follow their footsteps of being the best in the genre. So BE (Which is what I'm abbreviating the name to because I'm tired of writing the entire name down.)  Thinks that they can be lazy and stay in their own world while posting yet another cosmetic pack for Meg and Legion. Some person told me this long ago and I remember it still today. \"Le comportement sort de ta tête\". Which for those who don't speak French, means Behaviour get out of your head. I don't care, about the new Glow In The Dark cosmetic pack that includes Claudette with a green neon shirt and a different hairstyle for 15 dollars. I care about the Raccoon Police Station Map to be smaller in size and for my mans Michael and Pig and Clown and Hillbilly and Trapper and Legion to get fixed to actually have a chance to go from F teir, to at least B. Cause y'know what BE, a million complaints have been thrown at you but i think what we all are thinking is, \"Listen to the community, and get your fucking head, outcha fucking ass. And realize, that your game, is spiraling at a increase in speed, down the dumpster, and that you should fix it, before Dead By Daylight, is just named Dead. Because nobody will want to play it. And don't you want that money? That you so want based on the cosmetic packs you throw at a incredibly overpriced rate? Well you could get that for decades if you fix your game, or you could get it for a couple years if you waste your time while you watch your game go down the drain. Think about it Behaviour. What do you want.\"\n           This game is fun. Yes. But this game is complicated in how I would place it in a 5 star rating. The game is good. However it pains me how much potential it has to be something so much better. To upgrade that \"good\" to a \"amazing\". And that's why I'm putting it in a 3 in a half stars. I would put it in a 3 and 3 quarters of the way filled stars if i could. But I can't. I will still play this game. Because I have a lot of fun with it. But I'm putting my rating like this because of the reasons I've already mentioned in this review. And they are some big fucking reasons why I am rating it this way. However, it seems like Behaviour is stepping up their game a bit. Which I can only assume will increase when this new opponent \"VHS\" enters the ring. But I unfortunately believe this will not stop anything. And only will go back, to how things were. Maybe worse.\n             Dead By Daylight is a good game. It has a lot of problems that need to be addressed. I would put Dead By Daylight in a 5 star rating of 3 and a half stars. Goodbye now.","timestamp_created":1633218128,"timestamp_updated":1633218128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100402085","author":{"steamid":"76561198861002680","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12806,"last_played":1659043600},"language":"spanish","review":"JUEGAZO","timestamp_created":1633217985,"timestamp_updated":1633217985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100401906","author":{"steamid":"76561199027697048","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":2058,"last_played":1660485222},"language":"english","review":"A lot of fun to play with friends.

Чтобы сбежать,требуется починить 5 генераторов и открыть ворота. В это время убийца должен мешать процессу – находить и убивать выживших, подвешивая их на крюк или используя memenro mori (специальное «подношение», позволяющее убить выжившего). Подношения – особые предметы, которые используются для получения некоторых преимуществ в игре.\nВ игре существует система прокачки-кровавая паутина. Каждого выжившего и убийцу можно прокачать,получив на них предметы, улучшения для них, подношения и способности (перки). Всё это открывается за бладпоинты, которые выдают в конце игры, их количество рассчитывается в зависимости от вашей полезности в матче. Немного расскажу про перки и улучшения.В игре достаточно много имбалансных перков и улучшений, которые значительно облегчают игру и которые вы будите видеть почти в каждом матче. Приведу пример из моей игры: убийца за весь матч никого не мог поймать, но как только мы починили 5 генератор, у него активировался перк-«Порча: никому не скрыться от смерти», которое накладывает эффект \"Уязвимость\"(выживший падает с одного удара вместо двух) и также этот перк ускоряет самого убийцу. Убийца, который не мог поймать никого, в итоге убил 3.\nГрафика в игре. Игра сделана на движке Unreal Engine 4, что уже говорит о многом. Графика средняя, но атмосферная. Конечно, часто не достает оптимизации и встречаются баги. Благо разработчики занимаются игрой и выпускают багфиксы и обновляют карты и модельки.\nТеперь затронем самую больную часть игры: комьюнити, систему рангов и хитбоксы. Комьюнити игры состоит в основном из токсичных игроков, которые в конце игры перечислят всю твою родословную.(ну либо мне такие попадаются только)). Система рангов в игре просто ужасная(спасибо за \"отличное\" обновление).Играя на самом низком ранге, ты можешь попасть против самого высокого, что очень сильно портит игру новичкам. Хитбоксы в игре плохие, больше ничего не скажу).\nНа счёт читов в Dead by Daylight. Почти за 400 часов в игре, я встретил только 1 читера, которого очень быстро забанило.\nОт игры я получил очень много позитивных эмоций, фана, бомбёжка тоже случалась. Игру я советую покупать в пати с друзьями.\n3 подвешенных выживших в подвале из 4.","timestamp_created":1633212418,"timestamp_updated":1637777959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536415457725524902","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100397873","author":{"steamid":"76561198982711120","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":686,"playtime_at_review":2109,"last_played":1660258347},"language":"swedish","review":"Vert nice!\n\nreminds me of my childhood. \nRepetetive abuse!\n","timestamp_created":1633212075,"timestamp_updated":1633212075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100397487","author":{"steamid":"76561198402960287","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7665,"last_played":1655410891},"language":"english","review":"yes.","timestamp_created":1633211563,"timestamp_updated":1633211563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100397022","author":{"steamid":"76561198138574649","num_games_owned":341,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":53642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44926,"last_played":1659063701},"language":"english","review":"⠀⠀⠀⠀               ⠀⣠⣤⣶⣶⣶⣦⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⡱⡿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠟⠛⠁⠄⠂⠀⠓⠋⢟⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⠜⢖⣁⣀⣀⡀⠀⢀⣐⢠⣴⣟⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣛⠿⠻⠉⠯⣉⠠⠹⠚⠺⠿⢿⣟⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⡿⡿⣿⣷⠆⠀⠐⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⣼⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡶⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⡟⠻⣋⢉⣉⠁⣀⢀⣄⣠⣄⡀⠀⣉⣉⣙⠻⢻⣿⣿⡷⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣾⡏⠑⠓⠉⢉⣾⣿⣿⣿⣯⠑⠚⠓⢛⣾⣼⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⡿⠻⠠⢤⣔⣼⣿⣿⣾⣿⣿⣲⣄⠀⠘⠻⣿⣿⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣧⠀⣀⠟⠃⠡⣿⠿⠞⠽⣿⠈⠛⣶⣀⣇⣿⡿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣾⣯⠃⢠⣴⣦⠀⠀⣠⣴⣦⡀⠘⣿⡷⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣾⡇⢠⡿⡿⠻⠁⢠⠸⠻⢿⢷⠀⢸⣿⠏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⡇⠊⣠⣤⣤⣤⣤⣶⣦⣤⣀⠃⣾⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣧⣬⡶⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠸⣿⣦⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣿⣿⡿⡛⢟⢶⣶⣽⡿⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⠿⢶⣴⡿⠟⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀","timestamp_created":1633210894,"timestamp_updated":1633210894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100396991","author":{"steamid":"76561198264290138","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":31417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1123,"playtime_at_review":8881,"last_played":1660491822},"language":"russian","review":"Я начал играть совсем недавно и на данный момент удерживаю 4 кровь - 3 золото.\nИ мне перестало нравиться играть в эту игру примерно на серебре.\n Я не получаю удовольствие от потных каток и не получаю удовольствия от поднятия в рангах.

I enjoyed playing with my friends and the theme of the game with the killers and trying to escape.\nBut this company get keeping going backwards in developing the game. You think after 5-6 years of being release they would have fixed all the game crashing, map balancing, perk balancing, killer vs survivor balancing, random map generating, match making, generators, totem placements and so much more. But no, they keep having issues and more issue every killer and patch they do. I feels like they got a fan base and now just trying to cash out on them and not fix the major issues before leasing new content. To me the greed feels to real now.\nWith the newer killer pinhead out games have not been enjoyable with matches DCing ever couple of game, either the killer or survivor because of memory leeks or what ever. They known the issues durning play testing but still decide to rush it out knowing these issue and people would still buy it. This my friends is company greed.\nLosing licensing agreements for what ever reason is very sad, the stranger things is gone in a few weeks. Current people can buy it and still play in the future with those characters, but the sad thing is in the future with new people joining because they seen people play with demogordn or steve or Nancy and they can’t never get them hurts.\nNow they are planing to reward players with ranks, the higher the rank the more extra stuff you get. The last week after this news came out the games have been hard core unenjoyable. Killer are so desperate to kill they now camp and tunnel the person right off of hook. Survivor now leave that person on hook just to work on gens and if you are a random player good luck of getting rescued. Game play when from somewhat joy able to down right not even worth having on my PC anymore.\n\nIf you ask me, don’t buy this game! Save your money, Save your sanity, and save your self headaches with something so incredibly unbalanced and unfun to play.\n\nTo the dev. You had something good. Now you have a pile of crap sitting in your office. Just a matter of time before people wake up and uninstall the game. You have to fix your maps, killer and perks! You have to fix the hit boxes and major desink issues in the game.
