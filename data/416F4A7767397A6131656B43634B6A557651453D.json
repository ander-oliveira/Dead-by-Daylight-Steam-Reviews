screen crashes have been going on for 3+ months now and games often start 3v1 or even 2v1 instead of 4v1 like it should be. Instead of fixing this issue they let it go and after the new chapter released now we have a bug that if you manage to actually make it through the loading screen then theres a chance you crash out as soon as you get into the game. The new matchmaking they rolled out recently is complete garbage.\n\n Before it was easy to get into a lobby with <150 ping now you have to dodge anywhere from 5-10 300+ ping lobbies just to find a playable one and then someone leaves and you get stuck with YET ANOTHER BUG. Often times when the lobby is full and someone leaves the lobby will bug out and won't try to find a 4th survivor meaning the game will never start and everyone has to leave and reque and hope it doesn't happen again.

The game has become too bad for me to recommend, the killer ques are seconds while the survivor ques can take much longer. This is in in part due to killer games feeling much more taxing, try hard, and competitive while survivor games feel more relaxed, rewarding, and fun. Thanks to the dev's mind set years ago of a competitive game and focus on the killer vs survivor experience the matches feel more like 1vs4 survivors instead of 1vs1 team. Most killers in high mmr are now only the top tier killers (Nurse and Spirit along with a few others) running only meta builds instead of the now 27 killers on the roster. This has lead the survivor experience to only see those killers and be filled with tunneling and camping. These revelations had come to me from filling out the post game survey where I tried to play both sides equally. Sadly I am not alone in this now as even the top level streamers admit that a team of highest level survivors will consistently beat a highest level killer. All of this has lead to the player base dropping by one or two thousand every month with only 32k remaining according to steam charts. I hope the game improves in the future but currently it is not looking up. I loved this game with all my heart but I cannot recommend anyone new buy the game for these reasons.","timestamp_created":1553384222,"timestamp_updated":1654540437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49724470","author":{"steamid":"76561198826898681","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1547977577},"language":"schinese","review":"网络差\n","timestamp_created":1553384130,"timestamp_updated":1553384130,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49723324","author":{"steamid":"76561198125389698","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5066,"last_played":1613237136},"language":"english","review":"As of 2.6.0 the matchmaking and ranking systems are garbage, on top of the game randomly crashing or not loading players into matches it's extremely unbalanced on the survivors side.","timestamp_created":1553379003,"timestamp_updated":1553379003,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480358034372329712","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49723319","author":{"steamid":"76561198406684674","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":150103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":801,"playtime_at_review":29331,"last_played":1660605780},"language":"brazilian","review":"eu ainda recomendo o game, mas se não fizeram mudanças no sistema de ranqueamento, o game vai morrer","timestamp_created":1553378994,"timestamp_updated":1553378994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.692237198352813721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49723207","author":{"steamid":"76561198117683572","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":212762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29515,"last_played":1653585408},"language":"polish","review":"ogółem jebać","timestamp_created":1553378616,"timestamp_updated":1652741177,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518467307090759277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49722744","author":{"steamid":"76561198071039062","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":38727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24020,"last_played":1658517807},"language":"russian","review":"Не покупайте игру!

BHVR are flogging this cash-cow for all its worth since they bought the publishing rights (and since Deathgarden was a complete flop).  One DLC every few months and masses of purchasable skins might be okay if they actually did anything about the fundamental bugs in the game.  But they don't - they just introduce more.\n\nThe game crashes regularly during loading in to a game.  REGULARLY.  And rather than work on this game ruining experience which has been going on for weeks?  BHVR throw out another DLC.\n\nRanking is straight up broken.  Before the latest DLC it was too easy.  Now it's way too difficult.  I get that rank should mean something, but it shouldn't also encourage the worst gameplay tendencies to achieve it - tunnelling, camping, farming, chain-blinding - not fun.\n\nMatchmaking is busted.   Not having a ping limit in matchmaking means getting players with horrible pings.  In a game like this, that's stupid.  The solution?  Dodge lobbies to avoid bad pings and keep waiting.   And you probably will get matched against players 10 ranks apart from you.  Despite waiting 5 minutes for a game.  Players with different experience levels in an asymmetric game leads to one side getting stomped on.  Not fun.\n\nPlayers disconnect a lot.  Keeping an item, rage quitting when they get outplayed, just de-ranking to bully new players - as long as they only do it once every 4 or 5 matches, then apparently it's all fine.  Never mind that the other players in the game had to wait to get in the game,  risk crashing during the load, waste offerings, and now have to play through a mismatched game. \n\nThe grind is insane.  I get that BHVR want people to keep playing.  But if their plan is to keep releasing new content, then that should be enough to keep people playing - not a ridiculous grind.  There are nearly 60 killer perks, requiring three levels each.  Meaning a player, to max out one killer, has to go through around 170 blood webs.  And there are fifteen killers as of today, with one getting added every few months.  Fun.  Don't get your heart set on getting all the perks any time soon.\n\nEvery patch introduces more bugs than fixes.  PTR is used just to build hype with streamers instead of actually testing things.  If It was for testing, then Legion would never have been released - a killer who basically bypasses every basic gameplay mechanic in the game in a completely un-fun way.  Not sure who's smart idea that was.  Probably one of the ex-Deathgarden developers.\n\nThis game is still fun... someof the time.
