Wenn man also es geschafft hat einen Überlebenden auf den Haken zu werfen, wurden wahrscheinlich bereits 2-3/5 Generatoren fertiggestellt. Das sorgt für kurze Spiele in denen niemand Punkte bekommt und niemand Spaß hatte. Der Killer kann wahrscheinlich auch jetzt in seiner Situation keinen Druck ausüben auf die übrigen Generatoren, ohne den Döner am Spieß zu verlassen, da die Maps sehr groß sind teilweise. Jetzt kann man entweder Campen oder auf gut Glück seine Patrouille machen als Killer.\n\nWenn man wegen so etwas keinen Bock auf Killer hat könnte man ja einfach einen der Menschen spielen und so Spaß haben oder?\n\nFalsch\n\nAls Überlebender besteht deine Aufgabe hauptsächlich daraus, maus 1 gedrückt zu halten an Generatoren und skill checks mit Leertaste zu bestehen. Ab und zu verfolgt dich dann doch der Killer und dann hängste nach 3 minuten Verfolgung vielleicht doch, oder musst vielleicht mal einem Teammate aushelfen der rumhängt.\n\nWas ich an diesem Spiel so traurig finde ist, dass es nicht wirklich Teamplay unter den Überlebenden gibt und man somit mit 3 anderen plebs ein 1v1 x 3 gegen einen etwas schnelleren Dummbatz hat der Äxte werfen kann oder Bärenfallen aufstellt.\n\nKiller zu spielen macht nur dann Spaß, wenn man optimale Perks ausrüstet oder einfach gute Killer spielt um eine Chance zu haben 2 vlt sogar 3 zu erwischen, Überlebender macht nur dann Spaß wenn der Killer dich jagt, m1 halten kann ich auch bei nem mausklick zähler im web.\n\nWas dem Spiel fehtl ist ein etwas anderer Ansatz:\n\nDer Killer müsste um einiges stärker sein, in seinen Fähigkeiten, Aufspüren von Beute, Druck auf alle Überlebenden im Spiel zu jeder Zeit bzw zu großen Teilen damit es nicht langweilig wird.\nDafür müssten die Überlebenden dann auch Verbesserungen bekommen, jedoch keine die ein 1v1 mit dem Killer ermöglichen wie es jetzt im Moment der Fall ist, sonder Teamplay orientierte Fähigkeiten. So würde man das Teamplay stark fördern, da nur das Teamplay es ermöglicht lange zu überleben und der Angstfaktor vor dem ach so starken Killer wäre dann auch noch da. Evolve hatte zwar andere Probleme, aber das Teamplay in Evolve wurde um einiges Besser umgesetzt als in DBD\n\nTL;DR\n+gutes Konzept\n-schlechte Umseetzung\n-schlechte Balance\n-Spielmodus ist schlecht umgesetzt und monoton da es nur einen einzigen gibt\n\n\nDie Community ist btw schon ziemlich toxic","timestamp_created":1560985720,"timestamp_updated":1561884303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450986534357070923","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51325180","author":{"steamid":"76561198382009473","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":485,"last_played":1573245183},"language":"spanish","review":"esta super chevere da miedo , me asuste varias veces enserio :o","timestamp_created":1560985500,"timestamp_updated":1560985500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51325007","author":{"steamid":"76561198309273521","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9074,"last_played":1654575716},"language":"schinese","review":"我搞不懂为什么我玩人秒排玩鬼等半天  我觉得很神经","timestamp_created":1560984526,"timestamp_updated":1560984526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490799903869628906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51314844","author":{"steamid":"76561198835847085","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":24441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23214,"last_played":1656315988},"language":"english","review":"I really like this game because I can play with my friends and I really enjoy this game","timestamp_created":1560983282,"timestamp_updated":1560983282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51314722","author":{"steamid":"76561198012887562","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":89,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89,"last_played":1509231010},"language":"english","review":"Over $100 in DLC for a game with a base price of $20, lmao. no.","timestamp_created":1560982519,"timestamp_updated":1560982519,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51314659","author":{"steamid":"76561198014549365","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1591048614},"language":"english","review":"die","timestamp_created":1560982158,"timestamp_updated":1560982158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51314554","author":{"steamid":"76561198311552940","num_games_owned":581,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":51122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44573,"last_played":1655069253},"language":"english","review":"I love this game so much, but damn over the past year ANY update has been in the killer's favor. it's insane.

A killer can take a swing at you and completely miss, the miss sound effect will even play, but NOPE!!!! Someone they hit you. It has even got to the point that killers know the range in which desync will allow for a hit to connect and they will take it. I have a whole folder of clips of how terrible the hits are right now.
