If you have a good team of survivors working together, you can get alot done, and it's more fun to play. Which is good, but still, if the killer camps the hooks (espesially when he's invisible and makes no heartbeat noise.......) you pretty much have no chance. I just really wish they'd make it somehow not so easy to camp the hooks. I've managed to self rescue off the hook only 2 times out of about 50 tries. 1st self rescue, I automatically landed in the trap right below me, and the 2nd time I just got chopped down by the killer immediately.

I find you don't begin getting the hang of playing survivor and winning successively until about level 30. At around this time more skills and items become available more frequently to allow you to gain the necessary 10k bloodpoints each match to gain a notch to improve ranking. Character progression and rankings are what drive repeated plays. \n\nMaps for the most part all vary game by game. The generators, exits, chests, etc will all change each game. Some locations of things remain the same (such as any items or generators in buildings). A little work on this variety could help.\n\nAt the current state the game still suffers from a variety of issues. You will be dropped from games randomly and have random crashes. This happens a good third of the time. There are also many issues where the game lags tremendously and suffers from very slow frame rates. This only happens in certain matches. For not much going on in terms of graphics or things to load, this game should be a lot smoother and more stable. I have also encountered several issues in game such as my character getting stuck, particular around areas that lead to a hill. This has caused me to lose valuable items during gameplay when my character was killed. I also had a game crash on me randomly causing me to lose 3 out of 4 notches in my survivor rank which was very frustrating after putting in all the work to gain them. If you quit or fail to gain 10k bloodpoints you should only lose 1 notch. \n\nI do find that one particular item, the flashlight, its almost completely useless. It is meant to stun the killer, but I have never seen it successfully do so in any of the probably 50 or so games I have played as survivor or killer. I have used the flashlight to stun (as indicated by gaining of blood points), but it doesn't seem to have any or much effect on the killer at all. I feel the devs should replace the flashlight with something more useful especially considering all the useless add-ons one spends on the flashlight.\n\nOverall though, I find this game really fun and addictive to play once you get past this issue. If the devs are able to increase performance, stability and continue to update this game with more items, customization, locales and characters, they have a real gem on their hands.","timestamp_created":1468354562,"timestamp_updated":1468354562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24281612","author":{"steamid":"76561198126729165","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":9854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2232,"last_played":1585161761},"language":"russian","review":"1.Застрял в текстуре, светил фанариком чтобы убили.\n2.Попал на невидимый копкан.\n3.6 миниигр подряд(когда с генератором возишься).\n4.Не отображаются иногда перки, когда играешь.\n5.Застрял с жертвой на плече, не мог двигаться, а он слезть.\n6.Просто не мог двигаться.\n7.Иногда вылетаю из лобби за маньяка.\n8.Игра с другом это:\"Готов? 3..2..1..(нажатие поиска лобби)\".\n9, Когда что-то не работает, просто откати версию назад.\n10.Когда маньяк вплатную к крюку, жертву не снять, ибо не подойти.\n11.

The game is now weeding out the poor players in low ranks who complain a ton about this game. \n\nI highly recommend this game, it's very fun and has some amazing aspects, however I do admit the community is horrid, such the spammed negative reviews, and taking a stroll to the discussions page is a saltmine. \n\nIf you have $20 in steam this is a fantastic buy and I ensure you you will get your money's worth.","timestamp_created":1468353818,"timestamp_updated":1532570806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24281400","author":{"steamid":"76561198009653387","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":262197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2327,"playtime_at_review":33573,"last_played":1660585889},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel an sich ist klasse und ich komme, egal wie sehr es mich nervt, immer irgendwann wieder.\nDas Problem ist - wie bei fast jedem Onlinespiel - die toxische Community.

В особенности когда очередной маньяк гоняет твоих \"товарищей\" по карте, очень весело наблюдать такое. Или когда Хиллбилли пытается нагнать тебя со своей пилой и постоянно врезается в окружающие декорации, а ты с довольным фейсом бежишь к выходу.\n\nИ вот минусы: \n\n- Как мне показалось это отсутствие чата в самой игре, когда уже начинается сам гемплей. Хочется все таки побеждать и как нибудь скооперировать свои действия с командой, а не ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ей страдать.

Review zu Dead by Daylight[/h1]\n\nDead by Daylight ist ein Horror-Multiplayer Spiel das auf dem 4vs1 Prinzip basiert.\nDie Überlebenden die aus einem nicht erklärlichen Grund ins Revier des Killers kamen müssen versuchen Generatoren zu starten damit der Ausgang mit Strom versorgt werden kann und somit das Tor in die Freiheit geöffnet werden kann.\nDer Killer versucht dies zu verhindern indem er sie dabei erwischt wie die Überlebenden die Generatoren reparieren oder sich versuchen vor dem Killer zu verstecken.\n\nDas Rangsystem in Dead by Daylight wird nicht durch erfolgreich entkommene Spiele oder durch viele Kills des Killers entscheiden, sondern durch Punkte, die man sich durch Teamplay oder durch Generatoren reparieren verdienen kann. doch Punkte zu bekommen wenn man ein \"Lone Wolf\" ist kann ganz schön schwierig sein da dieses Spiel einen für Teamplay und Beihilfen groß belohnt. Der Killer hat es auch nicht Leicht, sobald er einen Überlebenden gefangen hat sollte er nicht bei ihm campen und den sicheren Kill holen sondern die anderen Überlebenden daran hindern Generatoren zu starten, sich zu heilen, Lootcrates zu durchsuchen usw.\n\nNatürlich hat dieses Spiel, wie viele andere auch, Fehler.\nZ.B. Kann der Killer die \"Hit\"-Animation überspringen und sofort wieder zuschlagen wenn er einen Überlebenden an einem Fenster oder einer Barrikade getroffen hat während dieser gerade mit dem interagiert.\n\nTrotzallem ist Dead by Daylight ein großartiges Spiel für jeden Fan der 4vs1 Spiele.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b] [list]\n[*]Schöne Grafik, passend zum Setting\n[*]Viel Langzeitspielspaß\n[*]Ausbalanciertes Gameplay\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[*]Einige Fehler\n[*]Nicht vorhandenes Partysystem\n[/list]\n\n[b]Trotzallem gebe ich Dead by Daylight eine Bewertung von 7.75/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1468331138,"timestamp_updated":1468331138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24274340","author":{"steamid":"76561197985422729","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1477803284},"language":"english","review":"I want to start by saying that I do have fun with this game, and some times it's the same way that some people have fun by putting needles into their private parts.\nThere is so much that is good about this game and in the same breath i have to also say that there is so much that is broken and needs to be fixed.\n\n1. THERE IS NO CONTROL REBINDING! that is right a full launch of a game that does not let you edit the controls. Really?\n2. The Infinate vault hopping thing. there are so many vids on youtube and times that i have spent waisting time with a survivor that will just hop through window after window after window. \n3. Perk Ballance in relation to the lvl of others in the loby. how many times i have come across a high lvl Meg with Adrenaline, seriously that perk is so OP it is not funny, full heal and run speed +150%, at it's best it will full heal from dying state... are you serious? AND after she gets to lvl 30, she can teach it to other survivors.\nOn the flip side lets look at a few killer perks, Insidious for example, after standing still for a few seconds you have no terror effect, or no heart beat to hear, untill you move or act again.\nDearstalker, the ability to see aura of dying survivours from a distance away\nAnd Iron Grasp which makes it tougher for a survivor to escape from you holding them.\nThese are, in my opinion the best 3 perks that the killers have.\n\nIf you are going to buy this game, be sure you have 4 friends to play with as this is currently the best way to get enjoyment out of this game. Ther is serious Potential in this game, and i want to see it brought into being, and that is why i bought it... Evolve did something similar before, but this game has the ability to offer so much more.\nI just hope that the devs hear what the community is saying, and make this something special.","timestamp_created":1468330106,"timestamp_updated":1468330106,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24274023","author":{"steamid":"76561197989125236","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1468935761},"language":"english","review":"No resettable keybinds\nI 2016\nPeople asking for it on forums since months\n\nAnd don't dare asking something on the discussion section -> childish community of fanboys who only mock whoever has a problem instead of minding their own stupid business.\n\n0/10 game\n0/10 developers\n0/10 community\n\n","timestamp_created":1468328798,"timestamp_updated":1468328798,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463689267635345459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24273993","author":{"steamid":"76561198202444214","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2785,"last_played":1610916985},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel\n","timestamp_created":1468328707,"timestamp_updated":1468328707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507389187812805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u8DN79UCecTMXA=="}
