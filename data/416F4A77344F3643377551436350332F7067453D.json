Ну-с начнём с того, что купил игру на релизе и застал всю ту кривость и сырость игры, слова разработчиков о том, что P2W не будет, а потом выпускают Майерса, который всех убивал. И ещё много можно рассказывать о былых временах, а обзор я пишу о нынешнем состоянии игры.  (МНОГА БУКАФ)\nВведение.\nИгра, которая представляет из себя игру 4vs1. Где есть команда выживших и маньяк. Выжившие должны сбежать с карты, но что бы сделать это им нужно чинить генераторы, помогать друг другу, лечить, ломать крюки, копаться в дряхлых сундуках в поисках аптечки или фонаря для ослепление маньяка и многое другое. Маньяк в свою очередь использует свои навыки, что бы убить выживших. По мере игры у вас будет рандомная прокачка за ОЧКИ КРОВИ, которые вы получаете за 1 сессию. Покупаете перки подношения и другое. Первые игр 5-10 вы точно будете в восторге от игры.\nМинусы игры.\n-Не самая лучшая коммуникация с коммьюнити. Игнор большинства сообщений на их же форуме. Из-за этого вышел не самый лучший патч, который сильно урезал выживших и  сильно поднял  маньяков. Потом об этом попозже.\n-Баги. Самое уязвимое место в игре. Их много, очень много. Многие не значительные, но есть и очень мешающие играть.\n-Читеры. Да они есть, но лично я встретил их от силы раз 5.\n-Лаги. Разрабы до сих пор не могут с этим что-то сделать. Если маньяк решил скачать пару интересных фильмов для правой руки во время игры, то ждите, что он просто телепортируется к вам, даже если это не медсестра. \n-Однообразие. Тут кому как, если вам надоест чинить генераторы и убегать 100 часов подряд или же бегать за выжившими, то это игра не ваша. Если же вас особо не трогает, то можете приобрести.\n+- Внутриигровой магазин и донат в целом. Сначала данная дичь меня взбесила, теперь вы можете купить 2 персонажей из 1 длс за  266 рублей, а в стиме можно купить за 175. Логика мне не понятна. Но теперь те, кто не хочет тратить на игру деньги могут купить себе персонажей за внутриигровую валюту играя в игру и повышая уровень. \nБольше минусов я не наблюдаю.\nПлюсы игры\n+Отличная атмосфера. В первых играх вы окажетесь в собственном слешере, где вы примите одну из сторон.\n+Динамика происходящего. Игра может быть очень динамичной, когда маньяк гонится за вами и вы пытаетесь всеми силами убежать и обхитрить его.\n+Частые патчи, не всегда удачные конечно. Теперь выжившим очень трудно играть и маньяки получают сильное преимущество и надеюсь это поправят.\n+Интересный опыт игры с друзьями в данную игру, когда вы с друзьями кооперируетесь и пытаетесь обхитрить маньяка во время игры - это божественно.\n+Сеттинг. \nUPD: +Контента стало достаточно для изучения и порции обновлений побольше.\nВывод: \nИгра не самая хорошая и на неё постоянно выливается тонны грязи и негатива. В каком-то смысле это даже оправданно. Но разработчики пытаются предложить нам что-то интересное с каждым длс. Пытаются менять геймплей, что бы он не застаивался, так же делают и RG со своим LoL. Лично игра меня очень затянула и наиграю в ней порядка 100-200 часов, игра развивается и не собирает останавливаться. \nОценкой данной игры является ваше мнение.           \n                                                                 Спасибо, что прочитали данный обзор и посчитали его полезным !","timestamp_created":1532736716,"timestamp_updated":1586604373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536931812763214111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43786954","author":{"steamid":"76561198243580944","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":630,"playtime_at_review":18388,"last_played":1660503042},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego extremadamente divertido y adictivo ,tiene mucho contenido aunque la mayoría es de pago y con la nueva tienda aun mas dinero que se me va :(\nMe encanta jugar con mis amigos,pero en las partidas te encuentras con muchos jugadores tóxicos-\nUn buenisimo juego para pasarlas con amigos y divertirse, al principio piensas que todas las partidas son monótomas, ARREGLAR GENERADOR, ABRIR PUERTAS, ESCAPAR.

Like any game that exists, there are bugs that are sometimes around. Some are large, some are small. I have over 600 hours and I have rarely encountered a bug that ruins my game so dratically. The dev team recently bought the right to their own game so updates are more prevalent now a days. So, like any game that has a multiplayer aspect, there are going to be some balance adjustments here and there. This game has been, and is STILL survivor sided. Since release the killers have been in a space  of being quite easy to manipulate due to surv buffs and most new killers getting not so good perks, while survivors get some pretty decent ones in return, that is my opinion though. The game, despite that, is still great to play. I have equal hours on surv and killer and between them both I do prefer killer (because I get more points usually), and I have dealt with loops, tea baggers, flashlights, all the things that made killer unfun. Killer has been very weak for a long time and NOW, recently, they finally gave some underpowered killers some meaningful buffs to put them in line a bit more, while nerfing the ability to run the killer around so easily. Both sides got some perk changes, and both sides benifited. \n\nDon't listen to all thse recent review bombers. They are mad because they have to actually TRY and lose the killer for once. I think they forget this is SUPPOSED to have the killer ve menacing. The killer is SUPPOSED to have an upperhand in the game. Thats the whole point of it being 4 v 1. Im pretty sure most people forget that. \n\nThis game is great, and will be getting massive support over the coming year, with more balance changes and things for improvement. After 600 hours, maybe one hour, combined, has been spent being upset at some things in this game. Highly recommend it, so long as you can adapt. The only other thing is some people in here are....not very nice, very rude.

I thought they probably exaggerated, so I played some rounds as survivor. To be honest, it was a really unpleasent experience. \nThe game is designed arround the idea that survivors must repair generators to escape the killer, while the killer must catch them. Both as killer and survivor, you rely on visual as well as audible hints. Yet, some perks / skills you can equip your killer or survivor after some leveling, which will allow you to see the auras of your opponent/s for a short amount of time. Some killers have the ability to detect survivors (area of damage-attack for visual and audible hints; or being able to ambush the survivor). \nSo the developpers decided that the chase is the game's core element and not the game of cat and mice, which it was before. Worse, with the recent patch you're sometimes unable to hear the killer approaching, and you will have to rely on two perks and/or visual hints. Sometimes you're out of the game without doing a single mistake, because one of the other survivors you're forced to play with messes up and the killer camps. \nWhile the game favored survivors before the patch, the patch rebalanced the game towards the killer, which was per se a necessity. Changes had to be made, because of the very agressive playstyle of some survivors, who adopted to the new game mechanic of chase, looping the killer and playing with their friends while using discord, thus destroying the game's balance.\nYet, after the patch, it is annoying to play as a solo survivor, while playing as a killer is more fun. Is this game good? No, because the developers' (admittingly hard) decisions are not well though through. Does this game rely on a very fun idea? Yes, I would love to play cat and mice once again. \nI would love to see the developers make some chances, such as to remove the ability to use discord while playing and to remove or alter unfun perks (decisive strike, barbecue and chilli, sprint burst). For the moment and after quite some hundred of hours, I decided to quit playing the game for the moment and to give it a bad rating, because I really think that the developers' ideas do not favor the game but alter it in a way the game is not benefitting from.","timestamp_created":1532713214,"timestamp_updated":1532713214,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501051545143127441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43781344","author":{"steamid":"76561198065239910","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":66076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8651,"last_played":1646495264},"language":"english","review":"So... From a more critical point of view... Yes part of these negative reviews are due to the fact that killers were buffed, but saying that only that would make the game so bad is nonsense... The major problem is that the devs are REALLY stupid and they don't have a clue about what they are doing, they buff and nerf things that are far from being the main problems, therefore by doing so, they only make the real problems more anoying... Let me explain more clearly...\nI just had a game (against a strong trapper, not that hard to be strong since it has been buffed), on that game none of the problems were about the power level itself of the killer, because we were playing a 3x1 because 1 survivor disconnected, making the game hard either way, and not helping the survivors at all (we don't even get a reward like quitter bonus like the killer), survivors receive no punishment WHATSOEVER when they harm their team by leaving the game, and the cherry on the top was the killer camping on a 3x1, like straight up camping, we all died from 1 hook cuz it was impossible to rescue (completly eliminating the reason why we play the game), and besides that, the ruin totem (a device that we need to deactivate to be able to survive) was probably near the hook, because we couldn't find it...\n\nTo sum it up... The devs don't know what they are doing and this is clear... They don't change the speed in which the gens are being done, they put totems, that brings inconsistency for the survivors AND the killers, making the game more RNG based (anoying type of RNG)... They don't change the fact that the killer is INCENTIVISED to camp because he is REWARDED for that, if not straight up face camp, at least a soft camping, like pretending he is not... So yeah boiz, the game is completly broken to the core, and the more the devs update it, the clearer it gets that they don't know what they are doing... It's downhill from here, so I REALLY don't advise anyone to buy it...

The concept of this game was fun, but everything is so poorly executed that I suggest everyone, please don't waste your time on this game. Every patch comes with new bugs that make the game unplayable. When the devs release a new chapter they don't care if it is finished or not (last time I tried the new killer Twins out I couldn't use my power or switch back so I had to disconnect and get a 5min penalty), they just release it anyway bc they are bunch of money-hungry, arrogant, stubborn people. If steam had a Worst Developers award I would no doubt vote for Behaviour.\n\nThey tend to make changes that no one asked for and ignore the elephant in the room. No one asked for UI change but they did it anyway even though most people gave negative review to the UI change. Their dedicated servers have stolen so many grabs from killers (last time when I grabbed a survivor I couldn't hook her or drop her but my movement speed was slowed down and I couldn't use my power for the rest of the game as if she was still on my shoulder, and I could hear the sound of her healing herself and repairing generators in my ears), which is a problem since the game moved on to dedicated servers last year but 2 weeks ago when I played this game the issues still existed. Apart from that, they also decided to buff We're Gonna Live Forever before No mither when No mither is literally the most useless survivor perk in the game. You get the idea. Their priorities make no sense. They don't fix their bugs. They just keep pushing out new chapters and skins because these are what bring them money. They don't care about player experience.\n\nBalancing, perk/power changes and reworks are terrible. I started playing Dead by Daylight in 2018, and back then the perk No One Escapes Death needed to be tier3 to grant you the ability to one hit down survivors when exit gates are powered. It's just a boring and unfair perk that rewards killers for doing poorly in terms of protecting their generators. In an ideal situation, you should pressure survivors off generators and keep them busy enough so that they don't get to finish all generators. But the devs, for some reason, decided to buff this perk. They are rewarding people who play badly. Same with survivors, they have too many second chance perks (Decisive Strike and Unbreakable) and item add-ons that allow them to get away with doing stupid or cheeky things. When they misplay they can just press the E key and prolong the chase for another minute or more. Now that the devs have nerfed Hex: Ruin (a perk that defends generators), a match can end in around 3 minutes if the survivors are efficient in doing objectives. I guess that's why they thought buffing NOED was a good idea. Did I mention that queue time in this game is also terrible? Imagine waiting 10 minutes for a 3 minute game. And the ranks of your teammates and/or opponent are 14 higher/lower than yours. That's the gameplay you're getting.\n\nI can rant on and on about how bad this game is. It has way too many problems. But the worst one has to be the devs. They clearly don't play their own game so they know nothing about it. they have no idea what is healthy for the game and what will break it. Pre-nerfed Mettle of Man clearly shows that the devs don't think before they add something to the game. And the fact that Huntress Lullaby no longer affects the Doctor's snap out skill checks just makes me believe that the devs nerfed it simply because they themselves couldn't hit skill checks. And they don't test things before releasing. Even if they did have the players test it out, just like the UI change, they would still do it anyway. Only god knows what this company is thinking. And they are very proud of how people are still playing this game even though they keep making bad changes. \n\nJust like the game director of Dead by Daylight once said, \"go play something else.\"","timestamp_created":1532705850,"timestamp_updated":1612979851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43779484","author":{"steamid":"76561198082653911","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":63823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6188,"last_played":1658430904},"language":"koreana","review":"좆같은

If you play as survivor there would a chances that you would get a toxic killer abusing lag switch ping system. This is quite annoying because it makes you stop while the killer is on the move while your stuck waiting for your internet to re establish a better connection to the host. The Community is very toxic with a lot toxic players abusing glitches and many more. Espcially with the devs they are quite toxic for not fixing this type of issue they want to grind your pockets to be honest, with alot of DLC that are paid which gives this vibe \"more money, better gameplay\".
