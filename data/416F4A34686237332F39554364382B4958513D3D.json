Da es auf jeder möglichen Karte einfach Plätze gibt an denen sich die Überlebenden sofort ohne irgendwie nach zudenken in Sicherheit bringen. Man hätte ja kein Problem wenn man als Killer sie dort irgendwie fangen könnte ... aber das ist einfach unmöglich. Der Punkt ist einfach dieser, dass die meisten Überlebenden in höheren Rangplätzen sich diese nicht verdienen sondern immer und immer wieder diese Plätze auf jeder Karte ausnutzen bis zum brechen. Dadurch macht es als Killer zum Beispiel einfach keinen Spaß mehr, da es einfach nur Nerven aufreibt.\nDas Spiel steckt im Prinzip noch in den Kinderschuhen.

If their demands weren't met? They'd continue to sabotage the games' pub servers for those who were okay with playing with strangers.\n\nMany people ragequit because they were first to be caught by killer\nMany of these people scream about how unfair it was that they were caught first\nMany of these people will cry foul that a killer decides to camp a meathook to ensure the first survivor dies, with hopes the other survivors don't start the generators while he waits and lets the first survivor bleed to death on the meat hook.\n\nThese babies cry foul because killers use strategies, they became so pampered with their self-absorbed ideology that they would think to themselves in the right no matter what, and that they'd deliberately try to 'Avoid' or leave games that happens to have Killers who Camp. You cannot argue with these kids, they'll tell you \"camping isn't a strategy\" no matter how much logic you use.\n\nDon't be like me, buying the game cause you love playing as a Killer, love the feeling of being a predator, of Cat and Mouse hunting. These devs made a repetitive, empty game, full of whining, narcissistic children who sabotage servers and the devs bent over and submitted to them. Best if you don't buy the game unless the developers actually fix and make the game less repetitive, less empty, and where the game modes aren't so severely leaned towards Survivors being a cake-walk to win. Survivors who're this self-absorbed are the WORST to play with as they will use every cheap tactic to win, and when I say cheap, don't think 'Camper' cheap, but much worse. If you Main Killer, you'll see what I mean, but I'll vaguely tell you what survivor-exploitations happen the most.\n\nWindow-Hoppers - and - Barricade-Hoppers.\n\nIf you main Killer, you will hate these people, as they will make it impossible to win. They'll also cry that it's 'Legit' or that if you claim camping as killer is a Legit strategy, then so is window hopping. The difference? There's areas on the maps that make it so if a survivor camps by a window, you, as a killer? Cannot catch them, cannot hit them, cannot kill them. They can wait it out until you leave or literally quit the game.\n\nTake my word with a heavy grain of salt, I became Killer Rank 1, playing a LOT OF MATCHES, so I've played against every variety of 'Survivor' you can name. Skilled, unskilled, Ragequitters, or just plain ole' obnoxious. The achievement of obtaining Killer Rank 1 has gotten into a lower percentage just by how much harder it is to win as Killer.\n\nTL;DR - Avoid this game unless the developers actually ADD something to it. It's empty, and full of toxic children who're incredibly cancerous. I told one of them to kill themselves because of how toxic they were on the forums and got insta PERM banned too. Was pretty funny.\n\n[Edit] - After the ban, I sometimes re-look at the forum to see if anything has changed - but evidence still shows that most of the community members are completely selfish and they don't care about how much fun the killer is having, they only care about winning and making it so the killer can't win so they can stroke themselves off at an Ezwin, that is only possible because they sabotaged the servers enough until the devs buckled under the complaints.\n\nI expect many to object or criticize this review, if any of those who do leave a comment happen to be one of the 'Cancerous' community members who have no shred of logic, I will be instantly blocking. I argued and tried my hardest to persuade and convince these kids that what they were doing was unhealthy, was bad, and was selfish, they merely attacked me endlessly for it. I have no patience for the cancer that is within this community, so I made this novel of a review to explain my story, to avoid this game, avoid the cancerous community, and for the love of god, if you love the concept of playing as a Killer?

Проваливание под текстуры\n 4.Телепортация (и тех и других). Причём чаще всего лагают Вижившие, и не ОТ маньяка, а К нему (С маньяками редко такое случается, но всё же бывает. Чаще в минус выжившим..)\n 5. Двойные скилчеки. Перестаешь чинить генератор, а он бахает два раза подряд\n 6. Маньяк кладёт полумёртвого выжившего на плечо, а выживший оказывается не на плече, а где то в метре (или двух) от него, вверх тормашками и в форме буквы \"Г\"\n 7.Невидимые текстуры. Не видно стен, забора, домов (Одни генераторы да земля-матушка :) ) Со временем конечно прогружается, но всё же...\n 8. Ищеш лобби, кто то лобби распустил. Возращаешся к меню персонажа и видешь не одного, а двух как две капли воды героев, застрявших друг в друге (Один чуть больше)\n 9. Когда игра начинается, есть шанс того что выживший станет невидим (может даже двое станут невидимыми), виден лишь предмет в их руках (Поверьте, это очень читерно)\n 10.Сбрасывание рейтинга.

Нафиг я объясняю, когда вы увидите телепортирующегося маньяка, который видит через стены и убивает с одного удара, тогда поймёте.\nА выжившие не лучше: чинить генератор за 2 секунды, бегать без следов и шума, не превлекать ворон...\n Ах да, ещё эти гады которые что-то делают (Чаще маньяки) а потом у выживших (Маньяка) лагает так, что мама не горюй, легче просто выйти из игры.\n\n Поверте - бесит это всех, в том числе меня.\n\n\nВсё выше перечисленное бесит немало игроков, некоторые даже бросают игру.

The reason why they must escape is because lurking in the area with them is a demonic, cold-blooded serial-killer. The killer who is controlled by 1 player in the match must kill/sacrifice as many survivors as possible. Sounds like a pretty straight-forward matchup. However it is not as easy as it seems.\n\nIn each map there are 2 main exits which are closed and dysfunctional, as well as around 7 stationary generators spread around the area. In order the power the main exists, the survivors must repair a certain number generators (typically depending on the amount of survivors in the match (4 survivors = 5 generators. 3 survivors = 4 generators. etc)) Each generator takes a vaguely large amount of time to repair and while survivors are repairing them they are constantly under the heart-pounding pressure of encountering the killer.\n\nThe killer's job isn't entirely simple either. When the killer finds a survivor he must strike them (generally twice) with their primary weapon in order to seize them from running and down them. From there the killer cannot physically kill the survivors (unless a certain \"perk\" is used). His job is to pick them up and hang them on sacrificial hooks spread around the map. The hooks keep the survivors stationary and sets a long time limit where a spider-like, speared creature (best description I can give) forms around the hook post and attempts to kill the survivor. The survivors can be saved while hung up though. \n\nAt this point in time (July 19, 2016) the killer player can select 1 of 3 different killers, each with a different ability. One carries around beartraps which can be set anywhere and seize wandering survivors. One has a cloaking bell which can turn the killer mostly invisible. And also one with a chainsaw that can be used to charge at and completely down any survivors that make contact.\n\nThe game as well as being challenging includes many more mechanics and features than it appears. When performing tasks such as repairing generators or healing teammates, the game randomly displays 'skill checks' in order the make the tasks more pressuring and challenging. Upon failing a skill check, the completion bar will move down slightly and will also causes a very audible sound, potentially attracting the killer. Upon succeeding a skill check, the bar moves skips a few seconds and rewards the player extra game points. There are also storage crates around the map which contain useful items for survivors such as medkits for assisting in healing other survivors or yourself, toolboxes for assisting in repairing generators or sabotaging hooks and other mechanical objects, or a flashlight which can be used to blind and stun the killer when necessary.\n\nThere are many ways for survivors to counter the killer's wrath including vaulting over slightly raised objects or windows, pushing down barricades in front of him and potentially stunning them, blinding them with the flashlight, hiding in cabinets, or planting themselves in camouflaged positions in order the lure the killer away.\n\nThere are many other mechanics in-game which I would love to talk about but need to keep this review not as long. The game also has a ranking system used to truly compete with other players and become more skilled at the game. There are also a variety of customization options, items, perks and add-ons for the characters and killers.\n\nThe game at this point in time isn't perfect, as there are many bugs and in-game features which make the game less fun and more frustrating at times. However, what we have right now is a creative, fun and interactive competitive game that tests and rewards the player's ability to remain vigilant, keep focused, be stealthy, stay alert, and be altruistic and supportive to your fellow survivors. And always remember that \"death is not an escape\"\n\nPros:\n- Incredible variety of mechanics\n- Intriguing gameplay\n- Audio gives players paranoia\n- Overwhelmingly terrifying moments\n- Greatly tests player's gameplay abilities\n- Variety of customization and add-ons\n- Enjoyable when played with friends\n- Potential epic and satisfying moments\n\nCons:\n- Some frustrating mechanics and features\n- Confusing ranking system\n- Non reusable items and perks\n- Over-powered favouring to quickly skilled players\n- Glitches (July 19, 2016)\n- Not a lot the game has to offer (July 19, 2016)\n- Poorly optimized (July 19, 2016)\n\n7/10\nRecommended for players interested in multiplayer, survival horror, strategy, and competitive gameplay.","timestamp_created":1468923228,"timestamp_updated":1468923257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530336201190948486","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24405358","author":{"steamid":"76561198052880228","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":12056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1461,"last_played":1634825399},"language":"german","review":"oh sch****, oh sch****, sch**** !!!!!!!!!!\nDas Letzte mal als ein Spiel mir Herzrasen breitet hat war DeadSpace1!\n(und nur DS1)\n\nDas is wie Verstecken + Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht.\n(nur ohne Bret und Würfel, aber mit viel Ärger!)\n\nsch**** , ich hör mein Herz immer noch. ;-}]","timestamp_created":1468923049,"timestamp_updated":1468923049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24404741","author":{"steamid":"76561198317759407","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1635511803},"language":"schinese","review":"新手太菜，老是被虐","timestamp_created":1468919664,"timestamp_updated":1468919664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24404697","author":{"steamid":"76561198071255882","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3836,"last_played":1599456673},"language":"english","review":"really fun game.

Recent changes have made it terrible for beginners, and bad for everyone.\n\n1. Changes to the perk distribution system - Now players get the more common perks instead of rare and very rare perks when they level. That doesn't hurt me, but if you are just starting out, you're going to have an ever increasing collection of the worst perks in the game as you level up to 50. I have a ~40 survivor that I leveled under the new perk system. One rare perk (specific to that survivor, so I get this one no matter what), one common perk, and 15+ uncommon perks. All of them junk.\n\n2. You still directly connect to another player's PC (the killer) - The person playing killer can unplug their ethernet cable and quickly plug it back in. This will disconnect survivors. If you are disconnected in this manner as a survivor, you get ZERO points. You likely just wasted 10-15 minutes of playtime for nothing. On the other hand, the killer will get all of the points they earned so far, plus 1250 per survivor that gets disconnected (a \"quitter\" bonus).\n\n3. Unlike most multiplayer games out there, DbD doesn't show you your connection speed to the killer - There's no ping indicator and the game doesn't have a region lock. You'll want to play with people on your continent and end up with someone half way around the world. And this isn't by accident. A player from China can set their region to somewhere in North America, and you'll get connected to them, lag and all.\n\n4. Stagnant playstyle - There are six killers in the game, but the majority of your matches as survivor will only be against two of them, the Trapper and the Shape. The remaining four are either too weak (the Wraith and the Hag), or have too much of a learning curve (the Hillbilly and the Nurse).\n\nIt was fun, a lot of fun, at one time.

Начнем, с того, что игра очень интересна, но прокачка персонажа в игре занимает очень много времени. В игре присутствует огромное кол-во багов, из-за которых у вас будет бомбить. В игре есть такая категория - \"Альтруизм\", скажу честно, действия в этой категории приводят к смерти, если вы не играете в лобби из 4 человек и сидите между собой в любой голосовой программе. Большинство игроков поступают немного неправильно, нарушая смысл игры. Например, выжившие, бегают в мансовых места(бесконечный троллинг маньяка), некоторые маньяки подходят вплотную к жертве и не дают ее снять(блокируя действие), некоторые маньяки сидят вплотную к люку, не давая Вам сбежать. Разработчики говорили, что хотят это все как-то пофиксить, но пока это все на мертвой точке(исключение: мансовые места, их фиксят, но добавляют новые).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nМой вывод: игра достойна своих денег, но ей не хватает собственных серверов, и многих баг фиксов.","timestamp_created":1468886383,"timestamp_updated":1472475745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24399181","author":{"steamid":"76561198314536563","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1539599144},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1468886297,"timestamp_updated":1468886297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24398785","author":{"steamid":"76561198137984876","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1466788976},"language":"german","review":"Billospiel ;-)","timestamp_created":1468884181,"timestamp_updated":1468884181,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496183186769485474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24398751","author":{"steamid":"76561197995667156","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1592010106},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego multijugador para pasarselo pipa. \nCuanto más juegas mas inceptivos tienes para continuar jugardo subiendo de nivel y con nuevas mejoras para tu personaje.","timestamp_created":1468883963,"timestamp_updated":1468883963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620617687702178955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24398708","author":{"steamid":"76561198273267453","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1583030729},"language":"english","review":"Really good game.

Released far too early and now they are currently in the process of adding in features that should have been in from day 1.\nLack of options/settings. No keybinding changes. (I mean seriously?). The resolution is a fucking slider for fucks sake WHO DOES THAT?\nSurvivors have to deal with laggy killers (purposely lagging their connection so survivors can barely move). \nPeer 2 peer connection instead of dedicated servers \nRiddled with countless bugs: For example, trapped in terrain, buggy user interface, bloodweb bugs, items bugs, you name it.\nQuite a few hackers in the game now since the developers were stingy and didnt invest in some decent anticheat software.\nPossible to lose all progress (happens rarely but gamebreaking nonetheless)\nThere is no Matchmaking system at this moment. If you start the game fresh, it is possible to play against Rank 1s or Level 50s or both.\nVery difficult to find a game because the killer can pick who they want to play with since they get to see the survivors rank and level. They will \"lobby hop\" if they feel that the chance of them winning/ranking up is low.\nBuggy Match finding, usually can't find a match or kicks you back out to menu screen. Almost impossible to find games with the \"survive with friends mode\".\nSurvive with friends does not have persistent match finding so everytime you fail to find a game it'll unready everyone and you have to wait 5 seconds again so you can't even alt-tab and do something else. Expect to find a single game every 15minutes only to find that the killer lobby hops because he doesn't want to play against a premade team.\nDevelopers clearly do not play their own game often since they have no intention of balancing perks/hook camping etc etc.\nVery unlikely to find good games. You'll manage to get into a game 2/10 times when you press ready, you then have a 5/10 chance that the killer will dodge the game, then you'll have a 5/10 chance you'll be matched with veteran killers/survivors. Then there is a 1/10 chance you'll meet a ESP hacker or you'll find a killer who will hook camp survivors until they die or the killer that ragequits early. So you have a grand total of <1% chance of finding a good game.\nAt high ranks, due to broken perks, no one helps each other because it is far too unlikely to successfully rescue someone as survivors when they are caught. Killers have huge problems when survivors are really fast at fixing generators.\nModerators like to ban/lock threads that directly criticises the game so be careful of what you say.\nCommunity is slowly becoming more toxic as these issues persists.\nOverpowered perks for killers as well as for survivors.\nKillers have to deal with window cheesers.\nHorrible grind for levels. If you're not prepared to play 300+ hours on this game, do not expect to get the best perks, add-ons, offerings for both killers and survivors. It takes about 50+ hours to get one character to level 50...There are 7 characters.\nNo diversity due to overpowered perks.\nSome map are completely broken for survivors, i.e. autohaven maps and some maps are completely broken for killers, i.e. sheltered woods.\n\n\nPros: \nExcellent concept. Potentially the best gameplay for this type of genre.\n\nConclusion:\nGame has huge potential but the developers are making very amateurish mistakes. Don't expect many hotfixes/patches often, they work at a snail's pace. Heard rumours that this game is supposed to be competitive (e-sports maybe), but you cannot have a competitive game with perks as broken as the ones in the game. As it is now do NOT purchase this game. If you already have do NOT play more than 2 hours so you can atleast refund it until all of the issues above are addressed.","timestamp_created":1468877014,"timestamp_updated":1468877188,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537293314933776855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24397047","author":{"steamid":"76561198289974555","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1623728904},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimo vale a pena deveria almentar a quantidade de sobreviventes e monstro colocar mais 1","timestamp_created":1468876583,"timestamp_updated":1468876583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hb73/9UCd8+IXQ=="}
