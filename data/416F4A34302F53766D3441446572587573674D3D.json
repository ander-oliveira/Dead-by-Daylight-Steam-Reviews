It drains the fun out of the content, and it skews the fun of the game by making boring and repetitive matches. \n\nThat's why we complain about balance. That's why we complain about bugs. Because as soon as these trickles of power fall into the hands of sweaty, angry, and truly toxic players. You will be subjected to them over and over again. Especially in higher MMR.\n\nPlaying the game seriously and competitively will take out all of the fun and excitement you expect to get out of it's gameplay. At least it does for me. \n\nDon't play too well if you want to enjoy more frequent laidback games.

The games gets regular content updates so that a nice plus. I would recommend looking on a site called G2A.com as i found this game on there for 6 dollars so that's a real steal. \n\nThis game is very new player friendly with the rank system that's is fair and balanced. The games ques tend to not be to long even late into the night (past midnight) Overall I would recommend this game to anyone looking for something different. Also as a add on DBD vs Friday The 13th, DBD wins by a landslide.","timestamp_created":1650185991,"timestamp_updated":1650185991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113996634","author":{"steamid":"76561198925415048","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":7211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":141,"playtime_at_review":4839,"last_played":1659982437},"language":"polish","review":"nerf legion and it will be playable","timestamp_created":1650185971,"timestamp_updated":1650185971,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40/Svm4ADerXusgM="}
