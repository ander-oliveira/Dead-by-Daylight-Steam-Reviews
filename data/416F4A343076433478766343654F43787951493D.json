You run around a pallet until the survivor drops it, then break it and move to the next one. Every map is designed in a way so the survivors can chain together multiple 'loops' wasting as much time as possible, and have numerous second chance abilities to fall back on if they make a mistake. Killers meanwhile get one second chance perk, and it's considered 'toxic and unearned.' There's no real agency on the killer's part; unless you get a good mindgame or prediction, it is incredibly unrewarding and unsatisfying. When you down a survivor, you don't think \"yeah I got them,\" you think \"thank God I finally got them\" and that's not the experience I want when playing as famous powerhouses like Pyramid Head or Michael Myers.","timestamp_created":1612984632,"timestamp_updated":1645452371,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519449055194854736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86354387","author":{"steamid":"76561199036161820","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1649186828},"language":"russian","review":"Сгорел пердак, рекомендую!","timestamp_created":1612984622,"timestamp_updated":1612984622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86354378","author":{"steamid":"76561198065211168","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1917,"last_played":1616083850},"language":"schinese","review":"这更新很好。人别玩了 ，40米的刀先让你跑39米","timestamp_created":1612984608,"timestamp_updated":1612984608,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574486434459686279","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86354351","author":{"steamid":"76561198175238882","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":48962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":494,"playtime_at_review":38772,"last_played":1660588978},"language":"german","review":"Behaviour KEKW","timestamp_created":1612984578,"timestamp_updated":1612984578,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86354311","author":{"steamid":"76561198209085951","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3518,"last_played":1658503705},"language":"english","review":"buy\n","timestamp_created":1612984546,"timestamp_updated":1612984546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86354260","author":{"steamid":"76561199096294207","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1656802379},"language":"english","review":"Great.

BHVR continues to push barely functional updates and unwanted content while after nearly five years of development the core gameplay loop remains stale and unchanged. they just don't care. \nplaying dress up with your characters is both the endgame and the main incentive to even play. now drop your cash on the battlepass, some $20 costumes, and some 7$ DLC's you fuck.\n\nand it's such a shame thinking of the great potential Dead by Daylight had when you consider the amount of both famous and original horror characters it has; but in the end it's all shallow and meaningless set dressing that amounts to nothing. \ndue to the decisions of BHVR, this game will forever stay a simple cops-and-robbers tag game with barely a veneer of horror aesthetics slapped on. and even then it's still laughably incompetent at being something so simple.\n\nEdit: Can't believe I wrote this before Boon Totems came out! Things are even worse now! Blatant cheaters in every game and a broken MMR system. Literally nobody likes the new matchmaking system and player frustration is at an all time high. Playing killer is now so unfun and stress-inducing that the devs are implementing a way to bribe players with extra rewards just to play killer, and that's ON TOP of the already higher bloodpoint gain killers get. Instead of addressing SWF. or the broken matchmaking, or the perk tier/bloodpoint grind, they're releasing Ringu chapter, another M1 killer with no potential and even more perks. Just more perks, more grind, more bloat, more frustration, and it's been going for years.

With the previous UI you would collect information from one quick glance over the bottom-left, now you need to scan the entire screen to get the same information.\n[*] Hitbox's size are now inversely proportional to community approval. Roll a D20 to see if it hits, advantage applied.\n[*] Progressing in the rank system actually makes you regress in the rank system. i.e. gaining a \"pip\" makes you actually lose the \"pip\".\n[*] If you are hooked, game will play dance music. Won't decide to play a fade-in or a fade-out for current soundtrack, so it will play both effects at random intervals.\n[*] As a spectator, if a survivor is hooked, music will decide to die until you close the game.\n[*] Perk \"Dead Hard\" is now triggered 1-2 seconds after the player actually wants to use it.\n[*] In loading match-screen, players could make the server angry and get disconnected in tandem.\n[*] Spectating a survivor that is escaping makes the game enter into a tantrum and freeze your screen. This does not produce a crash but you have to close the game as it will not let you play anymore. [b]Analyzing it more reflexively, this may be intentional, to be the stress factor in the \"Horror\" tag[/b]\n[*] Survivors may phase into a wall and become stuck there, survivor won't be able to move and can't be hit by the killer, making the game take itself hostage until the survivor or the killer decides to uninstall the game.\n[*] As a survivor if you don't escape you will not progress in the ranking system. And guess what? you will not escape too often! making higher ranks of survivors more sweaty and scummy.\n[*] Timer progression is now displayed as a shade of bright red [b]over bright red[/b].\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1612977882,"timestamp_updated":1645034589,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586944162845611572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86348287","author":{"steamid":"76561198942379661","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1638644690},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu amo DBD","timestamp_created":1612977774,"timestamp_updated":1612977774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86348192","author":{"steamid":"76561199118556641","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":92105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1124,"playtime_at_review":12498,"last_played":1660532464},"language":"english","review":"I would not recommend this game.
