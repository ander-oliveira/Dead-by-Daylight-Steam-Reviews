Even playing it some matches is amazing.  But the lack of understanding of the problems the game has by the dev team is the final straw for me.  This game introduced its first DLC (which added a new Killer, new Survivor, and a SLEW of other mechanics changes) before getting the matchmaking system working correctly (among a ton of other mechanic and balancing problems).  The game has been, since launch, a killer-favored game.  It probably even should be.  That hasn't stopped the dev team from nerfing survivors constantly in every patch.  \n\nThere was a problem with certain areas of the map exploiting game mechanics so that survivors could infintely run away from killers.  You usually saw this in higher level play. It was a serious problem that needed to be fixed, probably by removing/changing the infinite area. The dev team's response?  Nerf the mechanics involved in the infinite, instead of just removing the actual source of the problem.  The consequence of this nerf?  Survivors have an even harder time running away from the killer who is 10% faster than them.  It just doens't make sense.  \n\nI had high hopes that the game would be fixed and that the dev team would listen to the community about the problems.  They haven't.  On top of that their solutions are terrible (or there just aren't any 'solutions' at all).  I know it's a small team.  However, I've seen small teams do amazing things.  You know what's not amazing?  The dev team only wanting 1 survivor of 4 surviving every round.  That's ludicrous.  There is a disconnect between what the dev team wants from the game and what is fair/realistic/fun.  I'm sorry.  I can't keep being frustrated every time I open this game in hopes that I won't for once.

But not every match is going to be enjoyable, and your expectations for every one to be a ton of fun should move, else you'll be one of the people whining when things don't go your way.\n\nMatchmaking -- It's pretty messed up for the moment. Sometimes it takes a long time for you to get in a match, sometimes it doesn't. Low rank killers can get matched with high rank killers, and vice versa. I believe lobby dodging has a punishment now for killers who dodge? A 15 minute cool down? Anyways, just play the game to the best of your ability. You don't need to hook every person to pip. You don't even need to hook one person. Just keep up the chase. Not every match is going to go your way. Same for survivors. Just play to the best of your ability. You can't win every time. That's how most multiplayer games work, yeah?\n\nPerks - Perks are DECENTLY balanced at the moment. Saboteur, while not receiving a nerf to its stats, is balanced now in my opinion because of the global warning and point decrease. Thanks to this, hopefully the meta will change from iron grasp 3 and agitation 3 being a must, therefore giving survivors more of a chance to wiggle free. That's my hope anyways. :^)\n\nNew Window Vaulting -- Please... This needs to go back to the way it was in the previous patch. It seems near impossible to get a sprint vault. I think what they had done previously to it was the best fix. This has made windows incredibly unreliable, where previously they were a go-to that gave you a little bit of time and space to get away from the killer. I really hope they return this to the way it was.\n\nAll in all, the game can be enjoyable, and it can be annoying. You can't win every time. The most annoying things are waiting and window vaulting. I'm choosing not to address The Nurse because I don't have an opinion fully formed on her. She's hard to play so far, but not all counters have been introduced as it's only day 2 of her release. Expect people to make guides on \"How To Play (Against) The Nurse\".\n\ntl;dr -- Waiting is annoying, but it's not complete cancer. Metas change pretty frequently.

Every match keeps you on the edge of your toes - feeling as though your chances of living to see daylight again are so slim that you contemplate giving up that very moment.

The satisfaction that comes with the hunt, the primal need to spill the blood from your prey, and the smile that curls across your lips  as you hear the meat hook spreading open their flesh... At moments it's as though you're falling too deeply into the rabit hole that is the mind of the killer...\n\n\nAnd when the game is over, and you turn off your computer, you find yourself lying in bed later that night, staring up at the ceiling fan whirling haphazardly around and around... suddenly wondering how it is you're still feeling shaken from all that you witnessed earlier in Dead by Daylight. Wondering if deep down inside you're struggling through life - trying to survive till daylight - or if the thoughts from the mind of the killer will forever keep you buried in your own darkness...\n\n\nNo words can truly describe what it is this game will make you feel. However, I made a video/trailer in an attempt to capture the psychological elements and emotions Dead by Daylight can evoke:\nhttps://youtu.be/oDAhIessTN4","timestamp_created":1471622872,"timestamp_updated":1471622872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25015031","author":{"steamid":"76561198278513889","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":243675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223840,"last_played":1658267789},"language":"russian","review":"Самое интересное за 3к+ часов игры - это пост-игровой чат.

I honestly thank the dev team for their hard work (And yes I know this game has a lot of bugs, but honestly.. if you think you can do a better job, then do it) You start off rank 20 and work your way towards rank 1. The ranks reset every month (The 13th of each month) And you unlock different perks and progress through the bloodweb. You also get the shrine where you can save up shards and spend them on teachable perks which any of your character can learn. You can prestige your character after level 50 which means you will lose all the perks and items, but you have the chance of getting rare perks and items the more you prestige. They also added a store page where you can spend real money for outfits if you so desire. They constantly put this game on sale and on free weekends so if you're dubious, I would say try before buy. Anyway, enough of the tutorial..

I absolutely love the concept, I love the gameplay, I love the rush of adrenaline that it gives me. This game is wicked fun, and losing or winning, I have a ball every time!\n\n... When I can actually get a match, stay connected without issues, and see the game all the way through to the grisly end without unintended issues like clipping into a rock and getting stuck thanks to interpolation issues.\n\nI've given this game nearly a day of hours in gameplay, and most of that has been spent sitting in a lobby attempting to connect to a match. A lack of a proper queuing system,  no matchmaking filters, and flakier than acceptable client code makes this game more of a chore than a game. If you attempt to queue into a match and the game fails to connect you after about 10 seconds, you are forced to manually start searching again. If you leave a lobby, you are forced to wait 10 seconds before you can join another one. If the killer disconnects from the lobby and you are playing as a survivor, the lobby is disbanded and you are forced to start the process of finding a lobby all over again.\n\nTake note, this is describing the process of getting into a pre-game lobby as a single player. If you are trying to play with a group of friends as survivors, good luck getting into a game at all. As of the time of this writing, I have already had more than two occasions in which I had a full group of survivors and was never matched to a killer after more than 30 minutes of attempting to queue.\n\nOnce into a match, the game runs fairly smooth, but the host has advantage (the host is always the killer), and if they are on a poor connection, you can expect rubber banding and location resolution issues as the game attempts to compensate your position for your killer's connection. Some of the myriad problems I've run into (only rarely, but often enough to be mentioned) are being relocated into a rock and stuck long after all of the other survivors have exited the match; rocketing forward twice the distance I should have traveled directly into a wall and stuck there as I watched the killer walk up to me and proceed to smash me into it; being suddenly moved two character widths to the right as I attempt to climb through a window, thus rendering the window unusable and me a sitting duck for the wraith who was following me; and many more, all random, but all usually at the worst possible times.\n\nAs of this review, I've uninstalled the game entirely, and I refuse to install it again until I see patch notes fixing, at the very least, the matchmaking issues. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody at its current price in its current state. Buy at your own risk.","timestamp_created":1471618446,"timestamp_updated":1471618446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25013734","author":{"steamid":"76561198121260600","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2264,"last_played":1650741543},"language":"russian","review":"DBD это-\nfailed to join server\nfailed to join server\nfailed to join server\nfailed to join server\nfailed to join server\nfailed to join server.\nНо если серьезно сама затея игры неплохая,но её для начала нужно проработать.Что я могу сказать,так это, то что игра ещё сырая,в ней очень много багов,как геймплейных так и визуальных,проблемы с балансом(после последнего обновления,к нему мы еще вернемся) и последнее (ИМХО) самое раздражающие так это сервера,которых просто НЕТ(сервер хостит маньяк,благодаря этому он может делать всё,что угодно).Проблемы с подключением тоже не менее важная проблема,когда в игру играют более 25к человек и ты не можешь найти сервер,и к тому же еще каждый раз тебе требуется нажимать ГОТОВ,либо тебя вообще выкидывает в главное меню,но после обновления 1.1.0 игру вообще невозможно найти.Но всё же я рекомендую её,лично я вижу в ней большой потенциал хоть в ней так много различных багов,разработчики стараются их фиксить(хотя своими фиксами они их и добавляют xD).Надеюсь в будущем игра станет лучше.","timestamp_created":1471618431,"timestamp_updated":1471618431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25013717","author":{"steamid":"76561198112523575","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":12025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4994,"last_played":1657619550},"language":"russian","review":"10 РОФЛОВ БИЧАР ИЗ 10","timestamp_created":1471618384,"timestamp_updated":1471618384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25013638","author":{"steamid":"76561198316252108","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8545,"last_played":1515661322},"language":"thai","review":"อยากไปล่าด้วยตัวเองเลยทีเดียว สนุกซุดดดด\n","timestamp_created":1471618145,"timestamp_updated":1471618145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25013619","author":{"steamid":"76561198277157268","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10927,"last_played":1635024705},"language":"russian","review":"Топовый хоррор на первых парах,потом становится тактическим выживанием,а я игр с таким жанром более не встреачал.\nтру,рекомендую","timestamp_created":1471618090,"timestamp_updated":1471618090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542705953121185303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25013600","author":{"steamid":"76561198317847110","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1471614443},"language":"russian","review":"Купил эту игру, а она не пошла на мой компьютер.
