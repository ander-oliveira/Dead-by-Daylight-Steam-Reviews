What does this mean?  It means some kid on an Xbox One S with 2mbps DSL internet stolen from a Starbucks parking lot gets to rubber band all over the place as either Killer or Survivor which throws all the collision hitbox detection completely out the window.  If your match doesn't disconnect halfway through you get to see fun things like Killers hitting a Survivor after the Survivor has already vaulted and is 3 meters away, Killers hitting a Survivor after the Survivor has completely rounded a corner of a set piece, and pallets dropped by Survivors stunning the Killer when the Killer is 3 meters away from the pallet around a corner of a set piece.  Basically, take any given estimated hitbox and add 3 meters and 3 seconds of time in either direction to compensate for this.  You wanted Frankenstein in the game?  You got him, pal, because they pieced their netcode together from random stack overflow posts made in 1998.  These are just some of the fun error codes you'll become extremely familiar with, being that you get to see them five times per hour: https://i.imgur.com/dIc73zn.jpg\n\n• I mentioned Frankenstein which brings me to Dracula.  This game will suck your life and your wallet dry.  They have events constantly and time-based challenges to complete to unlock cosmetics, otherwise you'll be breaking out that wallet.  Don't wanna church yourself up?  Then don't pay?  Sure, that's fine.  But here's the issue: these challenges cause random Survivors / Killers you are matched with while doing solo-queue to have completely random goals they wish to accomplish instead of playing the map and completing the objective, which is powering up 5 generators and opening the exit gates (or hooking everyone to death as Killer).  While this does lead to some hilarious shenanigans and people blatantly farming things for points, it can get tiresome.  You may have a challenge that requires you to remain hidden while being near the Killer and healing someone or repairing a generator... and it gets thrown out the window because xXRatFeng420Xx is working on a challenge to lead a Killer on a chase for 120 seconds and get away, which means they need to loop around the entire map three times leading the Killer right into you.\n\n• Frankenstein and Dracula, eh?  How about the Wolfman?  I'm talking that wet dog in the rain stink from sweaty, stinky tryhard neckbeards.  Survivors and Killers are both guilty of just steamrolling you like a bag of kittens due to the completely broken matchmaking.  Every 13th of the month the matchmaking resets and everyone starts out on the same level.  I dunno how they compare you to anyone else but what I can tell you is the game does not take into account how long you've been playing, what your player level is, what your Survivor or Killer level is, how many perks you've unlocked, or how many items you have.  I honestly think it just does some random check to see how many games you've won / lost since the 13th of the month and then realizes no one else is on your level and gives you complete random players anyway.  Their most recent \"solution?\"  Hide the ranks.  People complained so much that they put it back to showing ranks instead.\n\n• Cosmetics & Licensing IPs.  This is a tough one because the Devs aren't really at fault here.  They've explained on some live streams just how many hoops they're required to jump through to make the game what it is.  On one hand you have their made up original IPs, Killers and Survivors, and on the other hand you have licensed materials owned by other people, and just like Hollywood there's no way these 3rd parties are handing over their IPs without telling the Devs what they're allowed to do or what not to do.  Case in point, Stranger Things was licensed, and now the license is being pulled, because Netflix decided they want to launch their own gaming service and the Stranger Things buy diamonds with real money to continue playing the match three Farmville card battle mobile garbage iPhone game is well on its way.  What does this mean?  An entire map is disappearing from the game and after a certain upcoming time you will no longer be able to buy any Stranger Things characters or cosmetics.  What's the big picture?  In theory, any IP could have its license pulled and they could eventually just remove any characters / maps / cosmetics you've already paid for, if the 3rd party requires it.  Games as \"service\" everyone!  On top of this you also have limits on how characters are allowed to look, what moves they can do, and even what cosmetics they're allowed to sell.  Some characters have 27 different outfits, and some have 2.\n\n• The Currency.  (Leprechaun always gets his gold?  Ok this metaphor thing is dumb now)  You can earn in-game earned currency used to unlock characters and cosmetics, but ANY licensed IP from a 3rd party does NOT allow you to use it to buy their stuff.  If you want any 3rd party IP content you have to spend real money.  What this means is say a new Killer or Survivor comes out, because they want to make a lot of money and show the 3rd party the IP is popular they are inevitably always unwaveringly and completely overpowered.  Everyone playing the meta game of min-maxing the BEST build evar to rolfstomp everyone else spends the cash and buys the hell out of the new hotness.  This goes on for a month or three, and then they patch it, nerfing it to the point of thousands of forums posts decrying how \"broken\" the game is now.  Doesn't matter, they still got your money, and if you're lucky you'll get to keep playing <character> for at least a year until they lose the license.  One other thing, if you use in-game earned currency to buy new DbD IP characters you miss out on specific Steam-Only cosmetics.  If you want to get some random single special Steam shirt for <character> then you'd better break out that wallet.  What sucks about this is they don't even tell you straight up which items you'll be missing out on.  You have to delve into random forums out there just to make sure.  All they have to do is show EVERY single item there is for each character and how you earn the item in the character store screens, but they don't.  DbD wants you to utilize their in-game store for in-game bought (not earned) currency, bypassing Steam so they can cut out the middle man.\n\n• Finally, the actual meta-game game.  Every Survivor and Killer has Perks.  If you get any character to a certain level the orange colored Teachable Perks start to appear in the bloodweb.  You have to spend your bloodpoints in the bloodweb to unlock the orange Teachable Perks.  Once the orange Teachable Perks are unlocked, they have a chance to show up in any other character's bloodweb, except that character needs to also level up their bloodweb with bloodpoints and use the bloodpoints to unlock the orange Teachable Perks from any other given character.  You'll be lucky to get 20-30k bloodpoints in a match if you don't complete any bonus challenges.  Plus there's a tradeoff if you chase after a challenge you're farming while disregarding the actual game objectives you're still missing out on the points you would have already gotten.  If you get over 60k in a match consider yourself lucky or extremely good.  Finally, there are shards you can earn but the ONLY way to earn them is leveling up your overall main player level.  Every player level nets you a pitiful trickle of shards.  Months of playing is barely enough to buy a single skin and they only work on non 3rd party IPs.\n\nThe takeaways: netcode made by cavemen, solo queue will make you literally break your keyboard, and somehow / someway you're going to spend money on dumb content and cosmetics.","timestamp_created":1594181731,"timestamp_updated":1630409201,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491264104843139648","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72273637","author":{"steamid":"76561199013992835","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1593429113},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏就是卡开了加速器还是卡不知道是因为啥","timestamp_created":1594181617,"timestamp_updated":1594181617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72273561","author":{"steamid":"76561198160111608","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":116,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1659769352},"language":"spanish","review":"Genialitsimo

I wouldn't say this game is survivor sided, as realistically a \"scummy\" killer can hold all the power in a game by simply going against the \"survivor rulebook for killers\", but it is still brutal. Multiple videos providing evidence for this can be found online, including videos from Demi, Tru3Talent, etc. From broken loops to sweat squads with locker flashlighting on dead dawg saloon, the potential to destroy a killer's motivation to play this game is definitely there.\nSecondly, after 1000 hours in this game, you would expect to be able to have all perks for all characters on at least half of the cast for one of the sides. I am sure if you were ridiculously efficient with how you spend your bloodpoints form the VERY beginning of the game, then it just might be barely possible. Tier systems for perks in this game are outdated and needs to be completely removed for both sides. This would avoid needed thousands of hours to be able to play any killer however you want, and play any survivor how you want as well. I'm aware changing survivors doesn't really matter too much, but for killers this is a really big deal.\nLastly, mmr is complete trash. The \"ranking\" system in dbd has never been accurate and probably never will be. Ironically the current \"grade\" system is better at ranking than the mmr \"ranking\" system. I'm aware in a game like this it is hard to create a sustainable ranking system, but just slapping a bad system onto it and calling it a day is not a solution.\nEvery new patch in dbd seems to make the game slightly more unplayable for both sides, but mostly for killers. Everyone runs the same 4 perks out of a pool of 6 or 7 on both sides, and it's ridiculous how little variety there is in this game. Half of the excellent perks are locked behind paywalls (which whilst not an issue for myself personally, is a giant issue for a 5 year old game).","timestamp_created":1594177055,"timestamp_updated":1642209145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72270174","author":{"steamid":"76561198072954812","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":52602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":914,"playtime_at_review":3890,"last_played":1660432808},"language":"spanish","review":"MUY

It's kind of pvp hide-and-seek. Survivors have to locate and fix 5 generators to open the gates and escape. Killers have to stop them and sacrifice them before they escape. The game is really really polished and I appreciate it in comparison with similar games.\n\nThe scoring system is great and it forces you to do many things (not just hide forever and fix without ever having a chase with the killer). There are four score categories for both survivors and killers. Each category covers a gameplay aspect and each category is capped. So to maximize your score as a survivor you need to fix generators AND help out your teammates AND distract the killer by losing him in a chase.\n\nI really like that you can rank up even if you don't escape, and if you win you do not necessarily rank up. It forced me personally to do different things in each game.\n\n","timestamp_created":1594174022,"timestamp_updated":1594174022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72268339","author":{"steamid":"76561198125571531","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2993,"last_played":1626925543},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é cheio de adrenalina!

Pra quem gosta de beleza, gráficos e desenhos, deixo adiantado que o jogo é todo sangrento, as roupas dos personagens são sujas, e os assassinos são horrorosos (no bom sentido).\n\nPS: a DLC nova com o mapa de velho oeste (Túmulo de Glenvale)  é o único mapa \"bonito\".

Eu até entendo que a empresa tenha que se sustentar, mas eu paguei por esse jogo e quero ter conteúdo, que inicialmente é pouco. Cobrar dinheiro real para comprar personagens (que são mais poderosos e que dão uma mecânica de evolução) tira mta imersão, pois vc deveria cobrar pouco para adquirir esses personagens. Mas tirando esses pontos, ele é bem legal. 9/10","timestamp_created":1594167928,"timestamp_updated":1594167928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72264102","author":{"steamid":"76561198352605431","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":18152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":325,"last_played":1659431415},"language":"russian","review":"4 из 5 ниггерсов одобряют","timestamp_created":1594167683,"timestamp_updated":1638509317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72264077","author":{"steamid":"76561198290505680","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1621,"last_played":1644119642},"language":"english","review":"Good game to play with friends","timestamp_created":1594167647,"timestamp_updated":1594167647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72264019","author":{"steamid":"76561198087387236","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1597604293},"language":"english","review":"nah","timestamp_created":1594167573,"timestamp_updated":1594167573,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72263984","author":{"steamid":"76561198313718864","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":154,"playtime_at_review":1976,"last_played":1660296436},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1594167525,"timestamp_updated":1594167525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72263905","author":{"steamid":"76561198258015966","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":13329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2120,"last_played":1639187535},"language":"english","review":"Dum dum dum dum","timestamp_created":1594167411,"timestamp_updated":1594167411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72263878","author":{"steamid":"76561198022972237","num_games_owned":1248,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1594096926},"language":"english","review":"In many cases the game discourages team work If you're a survivor.  It's often better to let a team mate get hooked and camped while you do generators and ignore them, then if it's convenient unhook them.  This isn't just something I found on my own it's a strat that's been parroted to me personally and across message boards.  If you're the killer you typically have long wait times between games, and are often likely to receive criticismon your play style no matter what you do (at least in my experience).  I have yet to play a game where one or more players didn't disconnect at the first sign of the game going south.  TLDR: The core game play is incredibly repetitive and the community is fairly toxic, except for the few folks who seem like reasonable decent folks, but there are far fewer of them.
