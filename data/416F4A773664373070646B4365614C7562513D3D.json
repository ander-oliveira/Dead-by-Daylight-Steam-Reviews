This game bug way too often and fail with its queue to join a lobby. While I am able to play sometimes but this bug it is a total turn off and I would not recommend buying this game cause of the bug.\n\nEdit: 7/23/17 Many months since my last review and this game still have connection problem that the developers dont bother to fix. I really wish I could get a refund cause I waste more time trying to get into a queue/game than playing it. I have so many hours on my account cause I get tired of trying to join a game from the constant \"connection problem this game have\" and just go afk with the game open.\n\nUpdated review 11/6/2019:  After quitting this game for awhile and came back recently I am happy to see that developers made a lot of improvement to the game. The connection seems so much more stable but finding a match can still take some time at certain moments. There have been a bunch of new characters, killers, and maps to play so it is great to see that this game is still developing.

When I finally did end up buying it I immediately ran into issues the very first time I tried to open it after installing. Long story short I had to fix 2 separate issues that were not caused by me just to get into the main menu. That should have been my wake up call to get a refund but I still ended up pushing forward because it just looked so cool, and boy do I have mixed feelings.\n\nBefore posting this review I found several others that spoke specifically to the hacking and exploiting being employed by a large portion of the player base. I can definitively back up those claims as I run into a hacker more than 50% of the time I get into a game. The developers seem to have been oddly silent towards fixing any of these issues and in some cases they make the game entirely unplayable.\n\nMy biggest issue by far though has to be the bugs. I knew going into this that there was going to be some pain because it was so new. I'm happy to get a newer or even alpha/beta game when it's cheap and provide feedback to the developers to help fix things; but holy shit, this game is incredibly broken. I'll sit down for a couple of hours one night to try and play this game and only end up playing the actual game for all of maybe 20 minutes. The load times are absolutely ridiculous and through the roof, I'm constantly getting kicked out of wait queues and actual games, and it is incredibly infuriating to wait 30 minutes to get into a match only to find out that my killer is hacking and I have no hope of winning much less racking up a decent score before he murders me.\n\nOverall I can easily say that this game is not worth it, even on a sale. That being said it makes me really sad to have to say that because this game has so much potential and on the super rare occassions that I can actually play it without having to deal with hackers I enjoy the hell out of it. I will continue to check back and stay on top of new developments as I have high hopes for what this game can become and should be, but at the current moment it is an absolute joke.\n\nFix your damn game.","timestamp_created":1483064846,"timestamp_updated":1483064846,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28813239","author":{"steamid":"76561198000400811","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":37214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35323,"last_played":1650175050},"language":"english","review":"Company is willfully ruining the environment by participating in NFT scams with their new Hellraiser chapter.

It has such great potential, but it's almost certainly never going to be realized.\n\nThe game is full of rampant bugs and balance issues, some of which date back to the \"beta test\" from the game's release, some from the issues brought in by the multiple DLC's. The devs seem to be incapable of implementing changes without breaking multiple things and the bugfixes range from within a few days to months, or simply never being fixed.\n\nBalance is awful; at low levels, killers will likely stomp the survivors. At high levels with everyone fully kitted out with perks, the survivors can basically spend the entire game goofing off and toying with the killer until they escape.\n\nThe DLCs are lackluster, and as stated before, generally introduce a whole host of new bugs and issues.\n\nThe dev's stance on exploits and balance is hilariously inconsistent; they go from \"Infinites are bad and cheesy, don't use them\" to \"Infinites are a mind game!\". They go from \"Our stats show the nurse isn't better than any other killer, we're not changing her.\" to \"We're nerfing the nurse really hard\". The most recent exploit involves using perks and items from survivors on killers and vice versa; the devs went from \"We're not going to give big streamers the same punishment as others who use the exploit because they're our marketing\" (a tweet from a dev which has since been deleted) to \"Ok, we'll punish the streamers too\" after a massive outcry.\n\nThis game has so much potential, but the devs seem to be intent on running their game into the ground and then hiding behind legions of fans who'll scream \"But they're just an indie dev!\" (of 40+ people, backed by Starbreeze, when they apparently have enough people to both work on DbD and work on other games at the same time). \"But they're fixing the bugs!\" (Very slowly, and only after people yell at them for months at a time to fix the most egregious issues.) \"But the devs are great and listen and communicate with us!\" (Their communication is generally \"We know of X issue and we're working on it. No eta. :)\" or \"Stop whining, our stats show it's fine\". ) or my favorite, \"But you're just being an entitled whiner!\"\n\nIf we buy a game, we are in fact entitled to a working game that doesn't hang on loading screens every other game, or try to deal with bugs and exploits that have been in the game since launch. It's so incredibly disappointing that they've had this long to fix their game and steadfastly refuse to.\n\nHere's hoping Friday the 13th and Last Year will provide some competention to incentivize the devs to fix their game.","timestamp_created":1483062980,"timestamp_updated":1483062980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28812602","author":{"steamid":"76561198162948165","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1630248473},"language":"thai","review":"ตอนแรก ผมโหลดมาเล่น แต่เครื่องผมรับไม่ไหว ตอนนี้อะ สบาย","timestamp_created":1483062868,"timestamp_updated":1483062868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499995797872543335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28812569","author":{"steamid":"76561198067236842","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":79157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":26230,"last_played":1660164836},"language":"english","review":"2018: It's a bit glitchy, but its pretty good.\n\n2021: What the fuck did you do BEhaviour?\n\n2021: I will keep crawling back to dead by daylight like its an abusive relationship","timestamp_created":1483062793,"timestamp_updated":1634178190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499995797872543335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28812153","author":{"steamid":"76561198069703440","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":92269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":47219,"last_played":1660585123},"language":"english","review":"New review: They nerfed Leon and Claires booty, the booty is flat like a bread.","timestamp_created":1483061713,"timestamp_updated":1623956747,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441231906414031982","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28812087","author":{"steamid":"76561198283602060","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1508441414},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo sensacional, inovador e fica melhor ainda se você jogar com amigos, a gritaria rola solta, e gera boas risadas.\nNão deixe o monstro te pegar! \n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1483061502,"timestamp_updated":1483061502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500351011753082275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28811991","author":{"steamid":"76561198047383469","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1483590129},"language":"english","review":"great gamejust sycks getting into a match , either takes forever or bugs out !!!!!","timestamp_created":1483061205,"timestamp_updated":1483061205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28811867","author":{"steamid":"76561198088997802","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1510780520},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego es muy divertido, eso no se puede negar, pero la avaricia del dinero hace que los personajes de pago esten totalmente desbalanceados, una gran pena, despues de tirarte 10 minutos esperando para encontrar una partida como superviviente \" cosa aparte\" , encontrarte con un michel mayers dice adios a tus posibilidades de divertirte o almenos de intentar hacerte una buena partida.\n","timestamp_created":1483060854,"timestamp_updated":1483060854,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28811787","author":{"steamid":"76561198031032193","num_games_owned":817,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4531,"last_played":1647100407},"language":"russian","review":"Здравствуйте, дамы и господа.

The game is much better, far more enjoyable, well balanced, and has much faster bug fixes. However the grind is insane even when compared to a game with regular wipes such as \"Escape From Tarkov\"\n\nI've now revisited the game after a 4,5 year long break. The game has honestly improved a lot, and is definitely in the best spot it's ever been during the time periods I have played the game.\n\nThe devs seem to have fixed most of the issues I used to have with the game.(Completely broken killer builds, infinite loops easily abused when playing survivor, and general balancing issues and really slow bug fixing.\n\nThe game is now a lot of fun, and mostly well balanced although I still think SWF is a balancing issue but one that unfortunately can't be solved without killing the game, by simply removing the option, and losing a large part of the playerbase.\n\nThe main issue with the game now is simply the grind. The original perk system where each perk had 3 tiers to unlock, worked fine when there were only 3 killers and 4 survivors. However with the amount of killers og survivors in the game now, the progression system is simply outlandish. You still earn the same amount of bloodpoints pr. match as you did 5 years ago when the game first released, but now you have more than 3 times the amount of perks to unlock, and playable characters to level for those perks. Unlocking all perks for one character yet alone all characters will now take an absurd amount of time since you still have to unlock all the tiers of each perk before you've fully unlocked it.\n\nI hope the devs will adress this absurd grind by either upping the bloodpoints you earn pr. match or preferably removing the tier system from the perks, and simply making the tier 3 perk, the only one available.\n\n","timestamp_created":1483045672,"timestamp_updated":1626380411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541618168354034424","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28804700","author":{"steamid":"76561197978267622","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1489153807},"language":"english","review":"Buy it if you like to force-quit games with the task manager 4-5 times before you actually can join a singleplayer game.

There's not many other games that can effectively scratch the need to play hide-and-seek like this game does. There's so many things it gets right, and if you're a fan of horror movies like I am, you'll be thrilled at the little moments the game gets right: being chased by an unstoppable killer, desperate for some help or relief (or being the one doing the chasing).\n\nObviously, this would be a huge, stonking thumbs up if everything else bar the gameplay was in place- which it just isn't.\n\nThe matchmaking and lobby system for DBD is absolutely horrendous, and will be the true thing you'll be struggling with constantly, rather than a killer. You'll get into lobbies, only to be unceremoniously kicked or crashed to your desktop. You'll connect into a game and the killer will instantly drop. Sometimes the game won't give you the pleasure of letting you know a queue's failed for some random reason and you'll just be sitting there with your mates twiddling your thumbs in the lobby.\n\nLong loading times abound, endless loading screens as well.
