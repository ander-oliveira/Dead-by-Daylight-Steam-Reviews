If you're competitive and play survivor, the game will be great at all ranks when you're skilled enough. If you're competitive and play killer, the game will be great for the first 15 ranks, and after that each match is a toss up. If you're not playing specific killers, or you run into SWF groups you're at a heavy disadvantage despite occupying the role with 4x the power. On both sides of the spectrum, there are plenty of frustrating bugs that the developers can never get a grip on. Running this game is intensive on the PC even at the lowest settings. To add insult to injury with lowered graphics settings you put yourself at a significant disadvantage due to the blurriness. As survivor you'll bump into doodads more often, as killer it means having people disappear off your screen if they run into you and spin. The game has multiple balance issues, and their developer team seems to lack the creativity, ability, and/or will to put the game in a good spot. If asymmetrical horror is your thing, this game will only satisfy you for a couple days. If competitive cat v. mouse is what you're looking for, this game will deliver up until the highest ranks, before becoming frustrating most of the time.","timestamp_created":1467330577,"timestamp_updated":1594049511,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23969842","author":{"steamid":"76561198136442116","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1477332176},"language":"french","review":"Grosse recommandation pour ce jeu. \nPoint négatif, gros anti jeux des tueurs à rester devant leur crochet.. c'est lourd.","timestamp_created":1467330508,"timestamp_updated":1467330508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494011849164962769","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23969825","author":{"steamid":"76561198094892283","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1083,"last_played":1655484030},"language":"english","review":"Excellent & fun game that delivers a continous sense of fear and panic as a survivor.

Even with the devs knowing full well weeks before the release of the game, the ability to invite your friend to a game other then private was never added.\n\nI love to progress in games, it means that you get better at it with tools you can use. When you play private, sure, you can play with your friend(s) but you do not level or gain anything in return.\n\nThe problem with playing a private game means that if you only have one other friend to play the game with, one of you will be the monster and the other a surviver, you cannot open the game to public or invite others not in your friends list. This means that out of the 4 survivers that could be on the map you play by yourself.\n\nIf you want to play with friend and progress, you have to play the loby game, you enter and exit depending if your friend is in there or not.\n\nI cannot speak for everyone, others who play this game think that the game would be easy or unfair if friends talked over the internet allowing them to communicate where the monster is... I've played the game with 2 other friends, 1 other surviver and the monster, from this experience I can say that we ether won with most of us dead or all dead, rarely we all survived, comunication did us little good except when we had to run, which still eneded up with one of us dead, we never took advantage of hopping windows like crayze.\n\nIts been a few weeks now since the game has released and the survivers life has gotten even harder.

I honestly can't remember the last multiplayer game that kept me so engaged that it kept me hooked in all my spare time.\n\nThis game is a 4 v 1 assymetrical horror game, which is a fancy way of saying there's four people trying not be killed by a very dangerous and scary bad guy.  The four players must work together in order to survive, powering up enough generators to get power to the exit, then make their escape, all the while hiding or evading the menacing killer.   Meanwhile, the one player on the other team has only one goal, to hunt down those survivors and make their lives as painful (And short) as possible, using a variety of weapons and tools at their disposal in order to bring them down before hanging them on meat hooks as a sacrifice.  When a survivor is caught, he can be rescued by the more courageous of his team mates.  Or, for the more cowardly, the sacrifice provides them more time to get objectives accomplished and escape.\n\nThe game is incredibly fun, both for the survivors and the killer, depending on which you prefer.  Personally, I ADORE the Killer, yet I'm amazed at how many players prefer playing as the Survivor.  I think it goes to show how well the game is fundamentally balanced, the fact that both roles can be so enjoyable.  Seems to depend a lot on taste.  And there's a bit of luck as well, as the location of objectives on each map is randomized, and sometimes their placement, as well as the spawn of the players, seems a little more convenient for one side or the other, which can influence which way the game goes from an early stage.\n\nThe game DOES have it's share of issues at this time.  Survivors can use some fairly cheap tactics to keep the killer at bay, such as hopping back and forth through a window, preventing the killer from ever laying a hand on him/her.  The ranking system is, in my personal opinion, not terribly well thought out, and there's people who like to disconnect before they die in order to prevent themselves from losing any rank, which, often times, hurts their team mates more than it does the killer, as he immediately has one less person to worry about.  Some killers, once catching someone and hanging them on a hook, choose to simply camp and ensure that person's death rather than try and deal with the other survivors, which is REALLY unpleasant for that survivor, especially if he/she is caught early on.  There's a variety of balancing issues, as some killers (Namely the wraith) are a lot easier to play and make WAY more points than others.  Perhaps the most glaring omission of all is the lack of an option to join an online game with a friend or party up, though the developers have made it clear that that's coming.\n\nThe game could use a bit more polish, and there's only a handful of maps at the moment.  And it would be great to see more playable killers and survivors.  It can be frustrating dealing with some of the glitches, issues, and exploits that some players take advantage of.  And yet, despite it all, I can't pull myself away from the game.  The core concept of this game is absolutely brilliant, and overall, the game is amazing and I can't recommend it enough.  And there's simply not enough games like it out there.  And the price is very reasonable, I think, for what you're getting.  Despite the flaws, most of which I suspect will be addressed in the coming weeks, the game is an undeniable pleasure for me to partake in.  There's simply so much satisfaction to be found in charging across a corn field with a chainsaw right into a panicking survivor, cutting him down before he even knows you're there.  And there's also nothing like the exhilaration of escaping the killing grounds alive as a survivor.\n\nMy final thoughts are this.  If you want a more polished experience, want to play with your friends online, or are at all hesitant about playing this game for various issues that players have raised, wait for a while.

Да они работают над игрой, но меня бесит, что они переходят из крайности в крайность (то понерфят маньяка, то выживших), а основные баги не исправляют.
