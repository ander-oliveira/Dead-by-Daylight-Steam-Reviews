Muy barato para la cantidad de horas que se le pueden echar. El problema: los DLCs. Es mucho contenido que no se nos da con el juego al comprarlo. Además, los DLCs te dan muchas ventajas sobre los que no se compran ese contenido extra, pero no convierte el juego en un P2W. Jugar solo es entretenido pero lo que aporta un gran entretenimiento a las partidas es jugar con amigos mientras os comunicáis por algún canal de audio (skype, discord, ts...). Otro aspecto negativo del juego es que parece que los devs hacen poco caso a la comunidad porque hay cosas que no cambian que llevamos un tiempo quejándonos, pero ya han puesto un \"test server\" así que parece que poco a poco escuchan nuestras plegarias. \n\nNada más que añadir, un juego barato para lo que nos tienen acostumbrados otras compañías con horas y horas de diversión si te gastas algún eurillo más.\n\nPD: Quiero aclrar que los DLCs no son para nada caros, la gran mayoría no tendremos problemas en adquirirlos si de verdad nos gusta el juego y queremos apoyar a la compañía.","timestamp_created":1475405153,"timestamp_updated":1518369867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25818098","author":{"steamid":"76561198145265054","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":93665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47335,"last_played":1653401130},"language":"russian","review":"Отлично мусорное комьюнити у игры!

Es kommt nur noch selten zum Rausschmiss aus der Lobby und auch das Finden eines Spiels geht deutlich schneller und zuverlässiger. Außerdem funktioniert das Teamwork unter den Spieler plötzlich besser, obs an der Vorweihnachtszeit liegt? :)\n\nReview\n\nWenn das Spiel läuft und man nicht gerade gefühlt stundenlang in der Lobby hängt, dann kann das gemeinsame Reparieren von Generatoren und Flüchten vorm blutrünstigen Killer sehr viel Spaß machen. \n\nMan merkt, dass die Entwickler bemüht sind, ihr Spiel zu stabilisieren und die (doch noch zahlreich) vorhandenen Bugs auszumerzen. Bis jetzt gab es einen kostenlosen und einen Bezahl-DLC zum kleinen Preis, was ich bisher eine ganz gute Politik finde, um eben auch die Entwickler bei ihrer Arbeit zu unterstüzten.\n\nDas Spiel selbst bietet keine weltbewegenden Mechaniken und im Prinzip macht man jede Sitzung das Gleiche, aber verschiedene Perks und Items von Jäger und Gejagten verleihen jeder Sitzung eine gewisse Einzigartigkeit. Mal hängt man nach fünf Minuten blutend am Haken, mal schafft man es als Gruppe gemeinsam gerade so zu flüchten. Die Spannung und Atmosphäre ist einfach top, das macht richtig viel Spaß.\n\nDa sehe ich dann schon auch mal drüber hinweg, dass die Perfomance teilweise sehr zu wünschen übrig lässt, das Matchmaking bzw. das Finden einer Lobby immer noch sehr viel Luft nach oben hat und einige Glitches und Bugs teils zum unfairen Ableben führen. \n\nInsgesamt Daumen nach oben, die Entwickler arbeiten fleißig daran und wenn man bisschen Zeit mitbringt, kann man viel Spaß haben (auch, wenn man ständig stirbt - erstaunlicher Weise)\n\nIn dieser Gruppe https://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu findest du mehr gute Reviews von mir, dort könnt ihr mir auch folgen.","timestamp_created":1475360657,"timestamp_updated":1564320138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611405789852142334","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25809380","author":{"steamid":"76561198136799113","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1634690716},"language":"english","review":"If you want the fear that comes with running/hiding for your vitual life from a living, breathing, blood hungry muderer, you have found the right game.

You’re good with this game.\nDead by Daylight is a competitive Game, so there is really, much salt and toxic in the community.\n\nNow let’s go to the Game itself.\nThe Developer spends much time into the game to bring it forward. They are all the time trying to balance the game. Well in the end it`s not really working, one side is all the time complaining they are weak and the opponent side is to strong. That’s true on one side, but they do rebalance things and so it changes on some point and then change back. \nDead by Daylight is a 1v4 Multiplayer game.\nThat mean`s there are 4 survivors playing against 1 killer. The target of the killer is killing them all and the survivors have to do 5 gens and open the exit gates. They most common key for survivors is to play in a team, sadly many don`t do that, so there are a bunch of PERKS you have to have. (Self-care is a must have). It is frustrating sometimes if the full team dies because of no team play. But well just join the next lobby and try again ;)\nKillers are Alone on their journey to kill the survivors, in low rank killers are really overpowered and you will die lots of times, but it doesn`t mean anything, you get blood points to get better perks and stuff. In high Rank, well then Killers are really hard to win against skilled pallet loopers and peeps using 369S and met builds. But in the end if you don`t care about a full 4 man kill round or every single game an escape it`s really funny.\nI would all of you suggest just ignore the after chat, when the hate and insulting rage starts…. Well since it is a competitive game, peoples get mad pretty fast.\n\nWell and there is one thing you will face in the game pretty often, Camp Killers, they park their avatar right in front of your face, makes it impossible to unhook and rescue you from the hook. In that case the one on the hook is well fkd up.\n\nPros of the game:\n+ really good game concept\n+ every single game has his own flair and thrill\n+ Graphics are really amazing\n+ very cool atmosphere \n+ Perk system (teachable perks you can use later on other characters)\n+ Offerings to give each game a own flavor\n+ Dev`s are really into releasing new content and fix bugs\n\nContras of the Game:\n- Sometimes long lobby waiting times \n- balancing (low Rank killers to overpowered high ranks the other way)\n- if you face a skilled Nurse, your 90% of the time Dead\n- Matchmaking is terrible since the release of the game \n- The Killer ALWAYS host the game it’s an P2P game, so if you are into an killer with potato internet or you face a Region hopper, your game will LAG so much, sometimes it’s impossible to play.\n- No implemented Ping indicator, to see if the others lag or not\n- you need to use a 3rd party tool called MLGA (Make Lobby’s Great Again)\n\nAwesome Game with the potential to get addicted !","timestamp_created":1475358467,"timestamp_updated":1542950097,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472816735506057739","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25808683","author":{"steamid":"76561198075173643","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":6734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2030,"last_played":1481932951},"language":"english","review":"9/10\n(Just the servers are shit.)\n(And the useless rank resets... -.-)","timestamp_created":1475357157,"timestamp_updated":1476397923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532163739204406738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25807950","author":{"steamid":"76561198061051038","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":59455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":380,"playtime_at_review":2362,"last_played":1660586874},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego muy bueno y adictivo hay cosas que aun tendrai que mejorarase como el tiempo de espera de algunas partidas (a veces puede ser tedioso esperar).\nEs recomendable jugarlo con amigos si quieres echarte unas risas per siempre tienes la posibilidad de jugar solo y ser un asesino despiadado o un superviviente que va a su rollo.\nEn general la comunidad es muy buena ya que se ayudan mutuamente entre todos\nEn resumen me alegro de haberme comprado este juego aunque aun tiene cosas que pulir como todos","timestamp_created":1475354561,"timestamp_updated":1475354561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25807745","author":{"steamid":"76561198289147438","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1479318057},"language":"english","review":"Great!

REVIEW: 01.10.16\nOk, so this is the first time since I started playing that I'm actually rating it positive, matchmaking is very stable now.\n\nBut there are still a couple things that get on my nerve, that really need to be adressed:\n\n1- Trapper hook behavior\nSeriously, the Trapper is broken for one sole reason, placing traps right bellow hooked survivors, that is a very low blow since you're gonna end up hooked if you try saving someone.\nBecause if you're releasing someone while a Trap is right below you, either you get trapped in it, or the one getting freed from the hook gets trapped, which is very frustrating since the moment you enter the struggle phase you die Instantly by being placed on the hook again.\nThere should SERIOUSLY be a range where Trappers CAN'T place traps around hooked survivors, it can be a VERY SMALL range where all it does is preventing people getting trapped by getting either free or releasing someone, where it actually requires skill for the survivor to dodge those traps, instead of hoping that the Trapper is not face-camping or zone-camping the sorry b*stard that got hooked.\nThis gets more and more frustrating because higher ranked players ONLY play Trapper, and every single one of them does this.\n\n2- Killer Lobby Dodging\nIt really is frustrating how many killers have started doing this lately, they keep dodging lobbies and there is nothing stopping them because the cooldown penalty is so ridiculously low.\nPlease, just boot them for 30m out of the matchmaking, and increase this penalty by 10m for every single time he does it in a row.\nEither that or don't let the killer see the survivors at all in the lobby, just plain text showing that they joined or how many are left to create a game, because I noticed that they lobby dodge the moment they see people with certain Prestige Level, Items or even when they enter the same time thinking they're premade.\n\n3- Hosting Logic\nAs far as researching about this matter goes, it seems like that the killer is the host, and oh boy has this been used for a lot of exploits, specially if you're facing a Hillibilly.\nBasically, the killer sees you and boots up his torrents or whatever the hell he uses to make it for you, the surivor that joined being laggy.\nAnd since he's the host, he isn't lagging at all, he just sees you flailing against walls or not walking at all, just being an easy target.\nLately this has happened A LOT, and reporting those lag switching Killers does not seem to do anything at all.\n\nAside from those 3 flaws I listed the game is pretty solid and I'm having a blast with it.\nHOWEVER, if this goes on, this review quickly becomes Negative again, because those 3 flaws are VERY annoying.\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: 24.09.16\nSo, they fixed most of the issues I adressed on the two previous reviews I made, but now we got a really big problem...\nThey promised an Update where we didn't have to press the Ready button over and over again, and guess what, those madmens actually delivered...in a bad way.\n\nNow it boots you to the main menu constantly, true, you don't have to click the Ready Button anymore, but now you gotta join the search screen, invite your friends in case you want to create a party, and then click Ready, just to be booted to the main menu again.\nPretty amazing huh?\n\nI have fun with the game but this is very frustrating, and I will still not recommend this game to anyone for those big big big issues in the lobby search that has plagued the game for MONTHS.\n\nAt the moment I have 70+ hours logged in this game at the moment, 40 of those are for waiting finding a game, I wasted almost two days worth of time for finding a game, how ridiculous is that?\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: 27.07.16\nThey added a decent party system now, you can now queue with your friends, at the beginning it was terribly broken and you couldn't find a single game without having to re-queue with them for over 20m, but now it fails to find a game 2 out of 3 times in 5 minutes which is bearable.\nI got a problem with the queueing though, whenever it fails to join a match, everyone has to click READY again for it to search again, which is irritating if you want to do something else while it's looking for a game, I hope they make a hotfix about this soon.\n\nNow lets talk about the gameplay, like I said in my last review, it's fun, it really is, except if you run into Killers that are ???????s, as in, camping in front of the survivors that they hooked.\nThis is a terrible strategy because the Killer won't have enough points to prevent a lose anyways if he does it, and if everyone wants, they just ignore the Survivor and go through their merry way and finish it quickly, so in the end the ones that lose are the killer and the unlucky survivor that had to deal with that camper.\n\nThere is currently no way to prevent this, so this aspect is very unbalanced and takes quite a lot of the fun factor away.\n\nThis is mostly an issue in low rank though, since most decent killers actually roam and hunt to earn points.\n\nAside from that there are a couple of game breaking features, if the killer ragequits, you don't earn points for surviving, instead you are evaluated with the points you farmed before he quit, which mostly results in a loss for you, which is very irritating.\nA lot of killers abuse of this for trolling, they let you farm for a while and all of a sudden they quit.\n\nThere are a lot of other gameplay issues and balance issues, but I won't go deep into that than what I said above already, if you want to know more just visit the subreddit for this game, there is quite a list for that and you can also learn a lot there.\n\nSo until they actually fix those balance issues with campers and leavers, I will stil consider this game to be \"Not Recommended\".\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: 29.06.16\nThis game is one of those games where it's the most fun with friends, but guess what?\nYou can't create a party with one or two friends and queue for a game.\n\nBasically you have to select the same Download Region in Steam and then queue at the same time trying to get together for a match with can take forever.\n\nI wrote this review while having 2.8h logged, 2 of those hours were trying to get into the same lobby.\n\nDon't buy this unless you're playing solo.","timestamp_created":1475339618,"timestamp_updated":1475354154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25803479","author":{"steamid":"76561198330617759","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":170884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":229,"playtime_at_review":72624,"last_played":1660558338},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная

Like I stated on my previous review, the dev's have been listening to the community and the current patch has balanced the game alot more and in my opinion, it is now fun to play as both a killer and a survivor. The new killer \"Mike Myers\" is in my opinion, a masterful killer. DBD got him right and when I face him as a survivor, I want to pee my pants. Playing as him has wonderful moments. What I like best about him is that depending on the addons you choose, you play completely differently. None of the other killers have that and I hope we get more killers that can have multiple playstyles to them. \n\nIf you like to be scared, or you like killing hapless survivors, this is the game for you. \n\n--------------- Old Review -------------------------------------------\n\nSo, I've got alot of hours in this game. That is because I love it... well... \"loved\" would be more accurate. When this game first came out, the Dev's did a great job of listening to the community and making improvements to the game... and to a small extent, the still listen, just not to everyone. Survivors and Killers have drastically different views of where this game should go, which is understandable, but the problem is that instead of trying to find a middle ground, the developers seem to favor the Survivors. \n\nThere is litte debate that Survivors get alot more love then Killers from the developers. Being primarily a killer, it saddens me every time Survivors get something they want and Killers get something taken away. Most recently killers were promissed more cosmetic outfits for free when they released the 80's suitcase for survivors. All they did though, was give 1 new cosmetic weapon to the killers... woopie, each survivor has 3 complete outfits (not including the paid 80's suitcase), I really feel killers are getting loved to... \n\nRecently, updates have been made to matchmaking right before the weekend that have been so bad that most players can't even get into a match. A fast way to kill a game is to make it unplayable during peek hours. You would think after two failed updates before the weekend, the would wait, but no, another weekend update and the game is broken again.
