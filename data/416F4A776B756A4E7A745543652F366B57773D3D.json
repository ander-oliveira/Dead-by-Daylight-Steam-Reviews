edit: Changing my review to positive after 5 years and returning to the game.\n\nPros:\n- Enough randomness to make most games feel very unique.\n- Very fun, intense gameplay.\n\nCons:\n- Having perks and addons, and learning about the vast plethora of them all, feels a little too important at times. Winning and losing seems to revolve around them.\n- I think the game would be more immersive without all the \"wall hack\" type abilities or supernatural killers personally.\n- Some maps aren't very scary or engaging.\n- Biggest complaint is definitely the invisibility of the MMR system and W/L ratios. Ranking up to Rank 1 means nothing really, except that you were active for a month and weren't terrible. Seeing one's MMR is what would allow people to know how statistically good they are, same with W/L ratios so that players can evaluate whether they lose all the time on this map or that map, against this killer or that killer, and so forth.\n\nOverall I'll give the game a positive review, because it's simply fun, win or lose.

How about running away from pysco hillbillies with chainsaws? This might just be the game for you. Although, if you like doing either of those things in the company of friends... well you better have atleast 4 other friends with 20 bucks in their pockets.\n\nTLDR: Good game, would recomend if you like to play solo\n\nThe week leading up to the launch of this title, I was very excited. Watching a multitude of streamers play this game with their friends made me wish I could do the same. The hype was real. When the game went live a friend of mine and I bought this game anxious to cower in fear at the likes of machette clad macocists. We then spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to play together. Surely there was an \"invite a friend\" option we were over looking. After hosting and rehosting lobbies we discovered no such option exsists... What a let down! Dead By Daylight seems like the perfect platform to have a real horror shared-experience with friends but the only way to accomplish this is in a private game. To me, this seems like a huge over sight. \n\nNow, understandably, I can see the developers side of this decision. Sure, playing this game as a survivor with a friend could lead to some already unbalanced game play, however I think that the whole soul of this game revolves around surviving as a group and what better way to experience that than with a friend. In my opinion if the developers were worried about competetive balance, they should have just made the match making system allow friends and then work on developing a more competetive game mode in the future.\n\nRant aside, let's talk about the game. Overall i really enjoy the game. The ambianceis perfect. The maps are creepy, the character modles are pretty terrifying and the mechanics are pretty solid. The feeling you get as a survivor being chased through a cornfield by a psycotic chainsaw massacre-ist is second to none. Likewise, hunting survivors as a nearly invisible wraith is awesome. Sure there are some balance issues that are being addressed, that is fine. I am happy that the developers are quick to patch this title.\n\nDead By Daylight is certainly worth the money with one caveat: I hope you like playing by yourself! I, however, do not and will probably not be playing this game too much until i can actually match make with my friends or somehow convince more of my friends to make the purchase.","timestamp_created":1467235480,"timestamp_updated":1467235480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23936863","author":{"steamid":"76561198112714275","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1652095047},"language":"russian","review":"ты скорее умрешь от старости, чем найдешь и соберешь лобби","timestamp_created":1467235044,"timestamp_updated":1467235044,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23936758","author":{"steamid":"76561198254638720","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":76,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76,"last_played":1467226022},"language":"english","review":"tr","timestamp_created":1467234796,"timestamp_updated":1467234796,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23936627","author":{"steamid":"76561198307017783","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1108,"last_played":1540651478},"language":"english","review":"great game all around love it am a fan","timestamp_created":1467234520,"timestamp_updated":1467234520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23936610","author":{"steamid":"76561198018463083","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1622658143},"language":"english","review":"pleas add so i can play whit my mate on online\n","timestamp_created":1467234491,"timestamp_updated":1467234491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23936557","author":{"steamid":"76561198065315082","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2245,"last_played":1632367919},"language":"english","review":"A simple horror game that is good for a group of five.

This game is filled with tons of crap and toxic players. Most of the time I fix around 1-3 generators per round, get hanged on a hook and then be the only one who dies and the rest of the team escapes fine. Also, in almost all of my games my team has thrown the killer at me causing me to die most times. Once I even found a Tool box and fixed almost all the generators. When I was hiding my \"team mate\" took the killer to me which then killed me and then he and the rest of the team escaped. You may think,\"Oh, just another 12 year old who got one bad game is salty.\" Wrong. This has happend more than at least 20 times of my game time. And if I do manage to live with these unbalanced teams and such, the killer rage quits or alt-F4s out and I dont get the 5,000 bonus.  While we are on the topic of killers, since they are the hosts of the server and people connect to them, most of them have garbage connection. Once I got unhooked and teleported almost across the map. Most times after I jump over a wall and run a bit, it teleports me back and the kill is pulling my leg and I get down. Like, What the fuck. In a nutshell, if you want a \"I'm just going to use you and kill you later\" simulator, buy this game. Also, why is there only one game mode? Come up with more instead of just doing the same thing over and over. You can't even play with your friends on-line, only in private matches. You can't even voice chat with your team in game, just a small window to type in some stuff before the game starts. In a nutshell, this game has only one thing to do, toxic teams with no clue of how to save you, you will die every round, you will stay at rank 20, and you will rank up as slow as a turtle moving.","timestamp_created":1467231973,"timestamp_updated":1467233388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487256377935409546","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23935519","author":{"steamid":"76561198010626324","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":46998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46040,"last_played":1579607000},"language":"german","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1467231892,"timestamp_updated":1498093171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23935477","author":{"steamid":"76561198104338881","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":8790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8531,"last_played":1590933776},"language":"russian","review":"Последний раз я играл в игру за Майкла в 2016 году, поддерживал игру с самого начала, до тех пор пока что то обновилось и лаунчер у них сломался, обновите драйвера мне писали и я обновил, сейчас всё работает но всё то же что и было прежде.\n\nПочинили лаунчер значит.

Да, идея не самая оригинальная и многократно использованная, но в умелых руках смотрится отлично. Игра полностью заставляет нас окунуться в атмосферу того, что Вы - жертва, просто жалкая игрушка в руках монстра, метающегося по всей карте в поисках Вашего тела, чтобы насадить на крюк и убить. Даже зная, что маньяком манипулирует десятилетний ребёнок, который толком догнать никого не сможет - невольно начинаешь бояться. Жуткая [b]атмосфера[/b] и мрачное оформление игровых локаций делают своё дело. Туман, осевший на земле серыми комьями; размытие даже на средней дистанции, из-за чего приходится полагаться на своё сердце, которое в самый последний момент подскажет местонахождение убийцы. Сразу становится видно, что [b]разработчики заострили внимание не на жалких \"пугалках\" и \"скриммерах\", а на атмосфере и страхе[/b]. Также, Dead by Daylight обладает [b]системой прокачки[/b] и экипировки своего персонажа. Однако, единственный и самый огромный недостаток сея проекта - [b]ранний доступ[/b].

The energy could be used to where if they use it all up they become slower than the killer at performing such things such as the window. The window speed difference was set as an advantage to get out of range of the killer and get away, not sit there and watch the killer walk back and forth helplessly trying to get somebody while the rest get objectives. If the killer leaves that survivor then they will just grab the closest generator since the windows are usually next to them. This would give a better balance between killer and survivor.
