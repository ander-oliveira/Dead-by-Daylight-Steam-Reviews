The game looked like it was going to be awesome, but what a let down.  When you're a lvl 1 killer going up against a fully stacked lvled group of survivors with all super rare perks, good luck. As the survivor its not so bad, but I would like to kill people as well. As the killer you will spend most of your time playing ring around the rosey as they hop through the same 2 windows or fences.  While you do this the others are turning on the generators and escaping.  If you leave the game of ring around the rosey then they will just turn on the generator you left them by.  Once you know the general lay out of the map its pretty hard to get killed as a survivor plus the added perks later on make you pretty untrackable or being able to be snuck up on.  I get the survivors need to be quicker than the killer, but to be able to just hop over the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over... get my point. I can see how this game would be fun in a lan type setting or with a group of friends over vent or something, but as of right now not so much. I guess I will get my serial killer fix when Friday the 13th game comes out this October.  Really hope I get my very first refund.","timestamp_created":1466660091,"timestamp_updated":1466660091,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23720122","author":{"steamid":"76561198144675837","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":1546984955},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game, i am super addicted.

It ruins the feel of adrenaline the game should be providing.

Wonder why ? Because that survivor just decisive striked and used unbreakable on you got slugged and tunneled by his/her last matches and doesn't want to experience that again same goes for the killer, want to know why he uses noed, op addons or mori ? Because he got matched against a toxic swf who runs 4 decisives, 4 unbreakable and flashlights, he got gen-rushed, the person they downed got flashlight saved, the person they grabbed got out of his grasp with decisive etc. No one cares about having fun anymore in this game its full of unnecessarily tryhards who just sweats their ass of for a few bloodpoints and they ruin other persons experience.

Cant imagine trying to do it with 2 other friends as well. Playing as a killer can be just as frustrating. Players seem invisible, and the scratch marks on the ground that are supposed to help do nothing to help. When you do catch someone they are able to wiggle away in less than 5 seconds.

Mistakes are being made, but changes are constantly being applied.\n\nPros:\n1.) The controls are smooth and work well. This is important when reacting to jump scares.\n2.) Objectives are simple to understand and intuitive. There's a proper learning curve for the minor mechanics, such as personal items.\n3.) Nothing will ever make you lose unless you make mistakes. It's so easy to learn from your mistakes, which is so nice.\n\nCons:\n1.) Players with low levels/ranks (like myself) tend to stick with a very predictable meta/style. This causes an awkward balance/scale: The survivors either win super easy at the cost of a single player, or everyone dies. This tilt happens constantly, and will continue until new fixes occur or a new meta exists. (Will be fixed with time)\n2.) The levelling system is currently broken. Survivors who escape without scoring enough points can still be demoted, there's no method to determine your current score, and players who synergize well win fast meaning there aren't enough points for everyone to rank up together. You pretty much have to make mistakes just to earn more points. (Will be fixed with future updates, hopefully)\n3.) The Bloodweb/items currently are either super easy to understand & use, or is completely vague on how it works. The tutorials, as normal with beta releases, leaves a lot of information missing.\n\nGo watch Twitch players to understand the mechanics of this game. It's a classic game of hide-and-seek with an adult theme. It's a blast to play, and feels ridiculously satisfying to escape the murderer, but the odds are blatantly stacked against you.

I enjoy playing as the killer, and I also enjoy playing as the survivors/victims. My only gripe is that there is no built in matchmaking lobby system to group with friends and search for public games. You can only play with friends if you play in a private match, but finding 4 friends to play with can be an issue.\n\nLuckily it's actually fairly easy to lobby hop public matches to find your friends (I've only tried with 1 friend), we managed to play quite a few games together. Simply search at the same time as your friend until you both end up in the same lobby. This can take some time.\n\nOther than that, the gameplay is fun, there's not too much lag (though it has been present and terrible in a few games, for the most part it's fine). Playing the killer and playing the victims is a completely different experience, almost as if you're playing 2 different games. The maps are varied and the progression system works well.\n\nAlso, I LOVE the perks. Like, it's so refreshing having perks that ACTUALLY make a difference and matter. Some of these perks are game changers, and completely change the feel and play of the game! Certain perks combo together, and overall the perks enhance the experience 10 fold. And since there's meaningful perks on both sides of the fence it's not OP or anything, as killers and survivors alike can both have meaningful perks that impact the game.\n\nfor example, the perk \"Deerstalker\" shows survivor auras within certain feet of you as the killer when they're on the ground, which changes your playstyle to leave people down more often and chase the other survivors, it's fun as hell. \n\nBut on the survivor side, you have perks that allow you to heal yourself without a medkit, or sabotage without a toolkit, or silently hop over things at high speed with little to no noise, etc.\n\nOverall, a fun game, I enjoy playing it, and it's well worth the 20 bucks.","timestamp_created":1466638709,"timestamp_updated":1468462209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506504416465759277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23716235","author":{"steamid":"76561198057024730","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1624801028},"language":"english","review":"I was excited when I bought this game but I can't bring myself to play it because of how bad I think it is.\n\nPros:\n- Grouping system (Finally)\n-(One) Free DLC\n-Some Lore\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive Gameplay\n-Unbalanced\n-Buggy\n-Not Scary or stressful\n-Clunky and odd looking animation bugs (Putting survivors on hooks, Picking up survivors)\n-Audio cues from survivors overlap (attempting to struggle when a killer is holding you)\n\nI wanted to like this game but just couldn't.

As a game that I do truely like and matches my preference, the flaws however is just ridiculous.\n\nflaws: \n1.It's not as glitchy but it can be glitchy\n\n2.They need to do something about hook campers, or atleast some how force the team to kind of work together to get people off hooks. for example: Maybe lock the generators until your whole team is off the hooks? but whatever generator your on you can finish until you either exit off of it or you finish it. (it's just something to think about but that could have lots of flaws in that example to.)\n\n3. I hate the fact that when you enter the game people could just leave and refuse you points. They should have some other kind of punishment instead of just losing rank or something like that. Like have an automated system to which they actually start to ban people if they leave?\n\n4. Another one is that you can't even invite your friends to play in a public game and you play with total strangers with no chat, no VoIP. Not anything to communicate with your team. A lot of those people won't even come to help you and you lose rank for pretty much at the beginning of the game or after you did alot of stuff for the team.\n\nNow even know I listed 4 flaws this is the bad stuff I experienced. Now away with the negativity and in with the positivity.\n\nPros:\n1.It's a pretty good game for an adrealine rush, they did an amazing job to make you want to panic in times you feel like doing it, I can't help myself to always hop out of my spot everytime I see the monster coming at me but don't actually see me yet.\n\n2. It's a great game afterall for teamwork and it makes you feel like you are just rewarded for baiting and for saving your team off of hooks.\n\n3. It's very atmospheric with alot of the maps and makes you feel like your in a horror movie.\n\n4. I love some of the perks you can get with killer, like the one that makes their skill check come up more then it usually does to the point when you are near a generator they panic and mess up.\n\n5. Last but not least it's a good game after all just to make you feel like an adrealine junkie and make you freak out in dire situations.","timestamp_created":1466633014,"timestamp_updated":1466633014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23714890","author":{"steamid":"76561198031470295","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1471896443},"language":"german","review":"Hammer Spiel, Leute ernsthaft.. hab nichts negatives bis jetzt gefunden.

Points are given for each objective met. You can play either as a killer or a survivor. Killer would have to host. If you do not like the concept or the game where you find it to be quite redundant then it is not the right one for you, I suggest for you to search it up on youtube for its gameplay.\n\nI've never played the beta, hence I do not know what are the problems then. Despite a few glitches here and there, I can say that I'm satisfied with the game thus far. Those glitches do not hinder the gameplay too much but if they are fixed then it is much appreciated. Playing online is a gamble, sometimes its silky smooth and sometimes its just plain laggy. The lobby matchmaking needs some revamp in terms of getting to play with your friends online in the same lobby and not always reshuffling to get into the same lobby with your friends (I see that a lot online). I really like how they cut-off the communication in game online as to avoid cheating and also stripping away the fun from it. \n\nHonestly, the ranking system is broke and it needs to be fixed but I'm a casual player so I don't really mind about it. From the games I've played so far, there are two types of killer. One, the killer would camp after hooking you up, 2nd the killer would hunt for other survivors giving them chance to save those that are hooked. I definitely prefer the latter to spice up the gameplay. Sadly, the mass majority camps at the hooked survivor and awaits for him/her to die which is kinda a kill-joy. A way to counter this is to slowly die by the hands of the killer so that you can stall time for other survivors to fix the generators. \n\nSince this game is new, I am more than happy to give the devs a chance to improve the game and also adding more content to it.\n\nIf you're willing to look beyond the ugly side of this game then you're going to have heaps of fun playing it.\n\nI can easily recommend this game to anyone if you have the extra buck to go for it. Otherwise, if you think that this game is not suitable for you, you can do your wallet a favour by keeping it fat.
