By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Para ello los supervivientes utilizarán la astucia, ingenio y las herramientas que el juego te proporciona(objetos,decorado del escenario, herramientas de aturdimiento o vnetanas, perks, etc...) Estos cuentan con cámara en 3a persona, la cual da ventaja para tener mas visión a diferencia del killer que tiene 1a persona. \n\nSiendo el asesino tendrás que dar caza a los escurridizos supervivientes, colgándolos de los ganchos distribuidos por el mapa utilizando habilidades especiales únicas, las cuales varían dependiendo del asesino que utilices (cada uno tiene mecánicas únicas) además de perks y tu ingenio.\n\nGráficamente el juego cumple, está bien optimizado y no dará problemas en PC de bajos recursos.\n\nEl punto más importante y controvertido viene ahora, el balance del pvp.\nHay un desbalance muy marcado, siendo favorable hacia el bando de los supervivientes. Los supervivientes a diferencia de los asesinos pueden ir en grupo ya creado, siendo estos de 2-4 personas haciendo que el asesino esté constantemente vigilado por ellos, aunque el juego no les proporcione herramientas de comunicación la gente puede usar discord, skype, ts, RC, etc... dando una clara ventaja en un juego 4vs1.\nAdemás de que más de la mitad de los mapas favorecen a los supervivientes, siendo en su mayoría mapas amplios donde asesinos con baja movilidad se ven mermados o lleno de ventanas haciendo que el killer se tire más tiempo del que debería. Al ser 4 supervivientes con 4 perks por persona son 16perks contra 4 perks que lleva el killer, si es una premade pueden ponerse de acuerdo y hacerse perks para cubrir todos los metas de killer siendo un infierno para este. Cabe destacar que los supervivientes suelen ser bastante malillos si van en solo Q, no saben contrarrestar a algunos asesinos que no se ven muy frecuentemente. Algunos personajes killer son bastante malos y no merece la pena ni jugarlos ya que requieren un sobresfuerzo por parte del jugador para poder rentabilizarlos siendo una odisea.\n\nY por último pero no por ello menos importante es la comunidad, junto con la de League of legends es de las más tóxicas en la industria de los videojuegos, no hay partida que al terminar haya alguien que te insulte, se meta en tu perfil y te ponga la mayor obscenidad que se te ocurra. Aunque me repita, desde la objetividad esto ocurre sobre todo de la parte de los supervivientes, si pierden la partida hay una cantidad de lloros que podrían acabar con la sequía del mundo. Del lado del surperviviente los asesinos también realizan actitudes tóxicas jodidendo la experiencia del jugador pero esto ocurre en menor medida. \n\nComo conclusión, si eres una persona que le gusta aprender de sus herrores, con autocrítica, determiación y que no te cabreas, el rol de asesino es lo tuyo, en cambio si eres una persona que le gusta la cooperación aunque tengas que estar reparando sin hacer nada un buen rato este es tu rol, es muy divertido jugarlo con amigos y puedes enfocar la partida a marear al asesino, dar utilidad o reparar como un loco motores.\n\nEs un gran juego pero requiere un mayor balance para que no sea tan tedioso, cómpralo, no te vas a arrepentir, además de que van a hacer un balance muy tocho este año para ajustar el meta. \n\nSi has llegado hasta aquí después de semejante tostón te felicito y agradezco tu determinación :) Si te ha gustado valora con positivo, se agradece.\n","timestamp_created":1657494091,"timestamp_updated":1657494091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118599520","author":{"steamid":"76561199122038866","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3914,"playtime_at_review":3802,"last_played":1660600571},"language":"spanish","review":"da miedo","timestamp_created":1657493557,"timestamp_updated":1657493557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118597703","author":{"steamid":"76561198038575063","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":14004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13171,"last_played":1658961171},"language":"english","review":"If you had enough of your comfortable life in this utopian world we live in and want to experience the polar opposite, then this is the game for you.
