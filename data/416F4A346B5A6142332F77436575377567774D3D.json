The graphics are amazing enough. The game is only balanced if you know what your doing. With hundreds of hours its not hard to become experienced enough to know the do's and donts of the game. There is much fun to be had, whether you get camped by a killer or not, there's still 3 other survivors to be productive and have a chance at outplaying the killer. Sometimes if a killer is new to their character, camping is one of the best ways to win (not the best way to get better though). In this game you have the freedom to win however you want. Remember, you ARE a killer. You ARE the survivor. You play like someone trying to catch prey no matter what, or someone who needs to survive no matter what. Use your brain and dont complain about the methods of which a survivor/killer is playing out the game. You do come across hackers here and there in the game but its not often enough to make someone stop playing. All I'm saying is that this game is great and has a very unique play style. You DO pay for it, so its only right your able to play how you wish. \n\nThe best part of the game is the chill killers who play (ghost face) haha. I've had my fare share of good times playing with survivors just messing around playing \"Hide and stalk.\" There's so much you can enjoy in this game and the community is mostly positive which is hard to find in multiplayer games. People should stay positive no matter what anyway, win or loss.

juego que recomiendo ampliamente jugar con amigos y pasar un buen rato\nEl juego presenta mecánicas de jugabilidad 4 vs 1 (Supervivientes vs asesino) así como partidas custom donde podrás probar personajes y habilidades que hayas adquirido.\n\nLo bueno:\nGráficos : de gama media, la gran mayoría de computadoras podrían correrlo , existe de gráficos bajos hasta ultra , causaría mas problemas tener una red de Internet inestable.\n\nPersonajes : Tienes muchas opciones para elegir con diferentes habilidades para diferentes estilos de juego ya sea jugar sigiloso o ir agresivamente.\n\nLo malo:\n\nEl juego tiene actualizaciones constantes que pretenden arreglar errores del juego , por lo que puedes esperar BUGS, LAG y que desactiven ciertos objetos, perks , personajes o mapas.\n\nDLCS : Existen personajes originales del juego que puedes adquirir sin usar tu dinero real (existen múltiples divisas en el juego para adquirir desde personajes, habilidades o aspectos) , sin embargo los personajes de licencia tendrás que comprarlos con dinero real (Halloween, Masacre de Texas , Pesadilla en la calle Elm , etc etc).\n\nComunidad medianamente TÓXICA: Tarde o temprano te toparás con un asesino que una vez te atrape te campeará toda la partida, cosa que es permitida dentro del juego (el asesino solo perderá algunos puntos, pero la posibilidad de que los 4 jugadores escapen será muy mínima)  o bien si vas como asesino te tocará un premade de 4 supervivientes listos para trollearte (trabajar en equipo) y hacerte la vida imposible.\n\nDesbalance: Así como frecuentemente se actualiza el juego, frecuentemente existe desbalance haciendo que ciertas mecánicas puedan ser explotadas para acabar con la partida lo mas pronto posible o de lo contrario alargarlo y hacerlo un verdadero martirio, al igual que ciertas habilidades de personajes que interfieren con otras o causan crasheos frecuentes a todos los jugadores.\n\nHe jugado este juego desde 2016 y te puedo decir que: \nEl estado actual del juego no es bueno y claramente existen diferentes juegos similares en Steam y otras plataformas , pero te puedo garantizar que no encontrarás tanto contenido disponible como en DBD a su vez siendo este un punto débil pues hay demasiado contenido que necesita ser arreglado.\n\nEl juego y su contenido frecuentemente están en oferta, te recomiendo esperar a las ofertas para adquirir ya sea el juego lo los dlc.","timestamp_created":1635283313,"timestamp_updated":1635283875,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101681649","author":{"steamid":"76561199059965257","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1652226490},"language":"english","review":"amazing

The game is fun, it can be annoying at times, but every game can do that. If you are looking to get into dead by daylight as a new player, let me run you through what will happen, as I was also a new player, not having played the game since like 2017.\n\nThe game doesn't really seem \"new player friendly\" on the surface. There IS a new skilled based match making system which I do think is a big help for that, but that being said... it's not perfect. Playing the game against people with multiple unlocked perks and knowledge of loops, routes, and killer abilities can be overwhelming, it can seem like the game is impossible and playing against experienced players when you are not so experienced CAN ruin the game for some people. That being said, Dead by Daylight is not hard to learn, you can pick up pretty quick on what people use and how the game is played relatively easy. And to be honest, looking up some YouTube videos on things like perks and just more intermediate to advanced tech was also a big help, I would recommend. \n\nOkay so now your past that, you learned everything and are feeling confident, you have most the perks you want and are ready to dive in some more. At this point, the game is AMAZING. Every game always have different outcomes and things that just keep making you want to load up another game. I cannot stress enough about once you get into the world of Dead by Daylight, there is no going back, it is immensely fun.\n\nAlso, here are some other pros and cons to the game.\n\nPros: \n1) It's very entertaining, a casual game if you want it to be, a competitive game if you want it to be, best of both worlds.\n2) So many different ways to play the game. (even if some are better than others)\n3) One of the best games to play with friends, hands down.\n\nCons: \n1) Sbmm isn't really the best, other people playing with friends can lead to a game with a random top ranked player.\n2) The community at times can be a little toxic, 50% of people are so cool, 50% are jerks, you'll find a lot of both.\n3) DLC content is kind of necessary if you want to take the game seriously. There is a lot of \"meta\" perks in the game you just kind of need if you want to succeed to a top level.

SBMM make it almost playable.\n\nThe worst thing is the grind. Game is literally forcing your hand to pay to unlock characters (also some characters are also behind a hard paywall). So I can easily say that this game has Pay-to-Win elements. You have to unlock specific characters, upgrade their skill tree (which requires lots of time) and worst of all you'll suffer bad teammates and a toxic playerbase along the way. Save yourself from this bloody mess. Game is fun but devs and community are not. Avoid.","timestamp_created":1635275985,"timestamp_updated":1635275985,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541164696216583252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101677063","author":{"steamid":"76561198803437228","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1556,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1660513639},"language":"polish","review":"Fajne to to, aczkolwiek fajniejsiejsze by było gdyby ilość graczy grających na mikrofalach i domofonach została zredukowana do 0                        :)","timestamp_created":1635275953,"timestamp_updated":1635275953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101677023","author":{"steamid":"76561198982470217","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7360,"last_played":1640672606},"language":"english","review":"Did you guys know that Dead by Daylight is 50% off until November 1st, unless it isn't anymore.","timestamp_created":1635275900,"timestamp_updated":1635275900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101676942","author":{"steamid":"76561198135617284","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1160,"last_played":1637630488},"language":"english","review":"Often very one sided in favour of the Killer.\n\nI've reinstalled it three times now as it refuses to update to the Drive it's installed on.
