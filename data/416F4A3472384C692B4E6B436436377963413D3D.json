Its fun. Now that does not mean it does contain any form of glitches, annoying players, and there generally a few things you probably will dislike. The games concept is amazingly smart and entertaining, being hunted down by a killer with 3 other survivors, or hunting the 4 survivors as the killer. There are a variety of survivors you can choose from with different perk builds, and there also other killers with a variety of ways to improve your addiction for massed genocide. Maps are layed out nicely, however some maps play out better for other killers, but their all managable as any killer. The community I would have to say however is pretty mixed between fair players and players that use the cheapest of tactics, which sed tactics can get you reported for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" and yes this is a choice for the report system. Its unsportsmanlike to \"Face Camp\" in this game which is a term where the killer camps the survivors he hooks, the fear of the other survivors saving your hooked prey is very likely, and using this tactic makes it difficult and generally not fun for the survivors at all. Mostly because survivors generally dont have many ways at all to defend themselves and its real easy to take down the survivors, and thats why good sportsmanlike conduct plays a big part as the killer. Oh and also having good internet, and yes the killer hosts the match. Theres no real dedicated server connection to this game. Outside of those very aggervating and annoying killers, and small bugs that break your chances of  escaping the killer's grasp. The game is fun. More fun with friends though. Playing alone is more of a thing for killers. Anyways final verdict my rating for this game is 8.5/10 mostly cause the bugs dont make that large of an impact but its not a 9 since it relies almost soley on Player compliance, with hosting the matches, making the match fair, and being a helpful teammate. Give it a try, with friends.

Finding a game takes at least 10 minutes, most likely more. Its mechanics are, in principle, extremly unbalanced. It's unbelievably easy to cheese whether you're a survivor or a killer, which is beyond frustrating and definitely not fun to play. \n\nThe worst thing is the developers fail to recognize this, despite the complaints of the entire community -- one glance at the forums will prove it to you.

Люди, желающие этот товар, взгляните на \"минимальные\" требования и будьте готовы, что у вас будет 30-35 FPS(До 15-20 в требовательных картах), если вы, конечно, имеете слабый ПК. Так что, оптимизации вы тут не найдете, ибо иногда садясь на свой старый компьютер(у меня их два) и имея в своей сборке GTX650 и довольно слабый процессор, я получаю 30-35 FPS в игре, как описал выше и 20-25 FPS в главном меню(Когда был Новогодний ивент, теперь 30-35). \nБаланс(Подборка игроков в лобби и тд.) тут скромен, ибо к более опытным игрокам со стажем, будут попадаться люди, которые наиграли менее 50-ти часов, что довольно плачевно. Эта ситуация происходит с 20~8 ранг, потом ситуация с подбором оптимизируется и вам, игрокам, менее часто будут попадаться люди, которые менее опытны(тобишь, кто мало наиграл).\nКоммьюнити тут отвратительное, надумали себе правил и решили тех, кто не следует ими- наказывать(Пишут всякие гадости в профиль и после пройденной игры в общем чате.), советую скрывать свой профиль, иль закрывать чат в самой игре, нажав характерную кнопочку, справа от вкладки для вашего письма. Довольно много людей, которые \"троллят\", не смотря на какой стороне(маньяк, иль выжившие), но это очень часто происходит. Есть адекватные игроки, их довольно мало и встречаются редко. \nБагов тут на любой вкус и цвет. Вас встретят доски(Наподобие оружия от маньяка, которые разбросаны по всей карте и их надобно скидывать), в которых вы можете застрять, иль они появятся в центре прохода. Здесь вы встретите зависание игры, которое будет сопровождаться со звуком, а кадр застынет(модный баг нынче, после недавнего добавления DLC). Вы можете застрять уже при спавне, иль в окне, а бывает, что при обыскивании сундука. Багоюзерство с перком \"крепкий орешек\", который позволяет залезть выжившим туда, где нога маньяка пройти не может, да и без этого перка было много проблем с \"паркурством\". Вы будете подпрыгивать при ударе, если одновременно успели выбраться из капкана, а маньяк нажал \"пробел\", для того, чтобы вас поднять. Можно написать целый конспект, следуя данной теме, что очень плачевно.\nУровень проработки DLC настолько низок, что мы не видели ног, которые ломали доски у Фредди Крюгера. Мы сейчас можем слышать, как Saw(Аманда) ломает генераторы, сопровождаемые звуком ломания паллетки(доски). Худшие киношные Memento и просто ужасная проработка \"Разрывателя челюсти\" под предлогом, что \"мы не хотим делать из игры мясное месилово\".\nГрафические показания лучше не трогать, ибо будете разглядывать \"мыльную\" графику, имея возможности сидеть на максимальных настройках.\nЕсли вы собрались сыграть в эту игру, думая, что это будет какой-нибудь ХОРРОР, то это будет длиться 5-10ч(Может и дольше, смотря какая психика.). Здесь, скорее всего, вы получите элементы гнева, например: удар через окно, который не должен был происходить, иль вы попали в трудный скиллчек от \"Решающий удар\" прям перед крюком, но маньяк быстрее нажал пробел, чтобы вас повесить, а оглушение он получит и перк задействован, только вот проблемка такая, ты уже на крюке и тебе это не помогло.\nИтоги: Продукт сырой, к покупке никак не рекомендуется, особенно с покупкой всех DLC, которые обойдутся в круглую сумму(если считать сам Продукт и все DLC с момента релиза). Оценка игры, равна настроению после траты денег на данную ересь: 4 из 10.","timestamp_created":1485833047,"timestamp_updated":1516978588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503773391246795654","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29597424","author":{"steamid":"76561198256502733","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":52080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33178,"last_played":1643708033},"language":"english","review":"RUNNING, HIDE AND SEEK WITH BUGS AND GLITCH, TOO LONG JOIN GAME AND LOADING SCREEN THO!

The most frustrating is the matchmaking bug that causes the infinite loading screen. The only way to get out of it is to ctrl-alt-delete. I have found a work around by finding games by joining through the \"survive with friends\" option and just queue solo. It seems to work but just adds extra steps and can be a bother.\n\nThere are other glitches and bugs, but the rest are not as frustrating or as frequent as the loading screen bug in my opinion. \n\nDespite the bugs I do recommend this game.

been playing for a long time, sad to say that they messed up a lot of things for playing survivor. if you are the last survivor you basically have no chance to win at all, with a lot of luck you find the hatch before the killer does, but if he does first, you can just as well disconnect. \ni understand why they nerfed sabotaging of hooks, and that's fine..., but also now, no matter how much you wiggle, without the killer wanting you to escape, you cant wiggle free anymore. back in the day you had to use a skill for that, iron grasp, which still exists, i have no idea why you would ever need
