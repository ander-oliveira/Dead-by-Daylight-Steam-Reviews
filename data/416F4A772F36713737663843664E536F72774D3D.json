Not one match was even close. Having a teammate with shitty MMR means they will most likely leave because they do not understand what is happening when there is a good killer. The same is true the other way, been on really good teams and the killer literally gets 0 hooks or kills.\n\nIt balances all of the survivors MMRs together, so it will FOR SURE always be skewed. The delta between survivor skill is way too high. Its less skill based now and more random. Also the tier that you are currently in has nothing to do with your MMR, it is just reward based. Which is \"okay\", I guess, it now more or less tracks progression to BP rewards, but now players have NO VISIBLE OR TRACKABLE WAY to see how good they are. This means no one really cares anymore and good luck actually getting good at the game if every game is a wash.\n\nIt's just a grind to the top because you cannot fall down in reward rank at all. All the points are made up and the matches don't matter. So people feel nothing when they just leave and nothing bad really happens anyway. They also really have no incentive of doing well either, because doing bad has no consequence. Having a competitive game with no competitive rating is worse than participation trophies because no one is even participating nor are they getting anything for it. If you successfully grind all the way up, you get bloodpoints, which they hand out to you for playing at all anyway to try to keep you around. Grind for like 20 hours to get top rank and receive like 1 million BP, but if you play during any event for like 5 matches you get that anyway. \n\nUsed to really enjoy this game, might check in every few months to see if matchmaking ever actually starts happening. Until then, hard pass this game unless you have a group of 4, or really like grinding mindlessly. Considering the avg gamer games about 1.5 hours a day, you might get into and finish 1 good match in that time. Maybe? Its a gamble. So just not currently worth it in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1648712320,"timestamp_updated":1648712320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113105037","author":{"steamid":"76561198862557905","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":411,"playtime_at_review":9273,"last_played":1660568313},"language":"english","review":"11/0.5 good game fun to play with friends\ni obly have 150 hours but ill have 360k+ in a week\nits so fun and cool you will get 650 girlfriends if u \nunlock all teachables for claudette","timestamp_created":1648710628,"timestamp_updated":1648710628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113104471","author":{"steamid":"76561199155350322","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":28,"playtime_at_review":1620,"last_played":1660488618},"language":"schinese","review":"很适合小孩子玩的游戏，充满了童趣","timestamp_created":1648709276,"timestamp_updated":1648709276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113103588","author":{"steamid":"76561199174894732","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":264,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1660421330},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno","timestamp_created":1648707206,"timestamp_updated":1648707206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113103383","author":{"steamid":"76561198171290541","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":96371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4396,"playtime_at_review":45425,"last_played":1660601891},"language":"english","review":"Best game EVER!!

A large chunk of the playerbase plays just to torment others in ways transcending the game. They will do anything they can in a match with a sole purpose of making you miserable and then throw insults and mock you after the match. If you abide by their \"rules\" and play nice, you will likely loose and they will flame you anyway. \n\nBoth survivor and killer players are stuck in a gameplay loop that is inherently unfun for both sides in higher levels of play -it's the most \"optimal\", but also just boring and frustrating for everyone. Many perks are greatly unbalanced, dominating the game. As killer you will feel absolutely powerless and helpless while survivors dance in front of you and mock you. As survivor, you will get targetted by frustrated killers and tunneled out of the game early. \n\nIt's a vicious cycle of hatred, \"us vs them\" mentality and frustration. Many people call themselves toxic and wear it as a badge of honour, acting accordingly. The devs have a history of not acknowledging the state of the community and leaving features (and exploits) in the game that are there specifically to bully players and have nothing to do with actual gameplay. They even told people having issues to play another game in one of their past streams. Therefore, it's unlikely it will ever get better. This issue extends to accessibility issues, as there are macroes people use purely to annoy others, that cause rapidly flashing lights and a persisting drilling sound, that may cause severe headaches or even seizures in photosensitive people.\n\nPoor understanding of the high levels of play by the devs results in highly questionable balance. That, combined with the aforementioned overwhelming toxicity has caused the game to hemorrhage players over the last years. \n\nAnother issue that the game has had for about 2 years now, is an overwhelming amount of hackers. Getting hacks is easy and many people use them. Many of those hacks are subtle enough that you won't know for sure if it's hacking or they are just lucky or good (especially since you don't always see what they are doing). If you caught them redhanded, they will gaslight you and tell you you are the problem instead. The hacks range from simple things like faster movement, repair speed and automated perfect dodge, to wild things like teleports, instant repair/totem cleanse, freezing the killer in an action they can't cancel or preventing the match to ever end for you even after a timer, forcing you to disconnect (which removes all your points, challenge progress and applies a timed matchmaking ban). They have also been shown capable of digging out your IP address through the game. Some streamers were even swatted due to that. These issues haven't been addressed at all by the devs and continue to exist untouched.\n\nThe core gameplay is addicting in its own way and will keep bringing you back. Then you will have a horrible experience and leave the game. And come back after forgetting how bad it was. \n\nI've defended this game for years, even recommended it to friends cause it has fun things about it. The characters are incredibly well designed, the art department in general is phenomenal. There are also many horror icons that are cool to experience in a game. The core gameplay is fun until you reach high levels of play and there are many killers - each with their own unique gameplay style. The lore has been expanded over time and by now it's rich and well written - a real treat for those who care. However, the toxicity and gameplay has been getting worse and worse over the years and at this point, the state of it is so fundamentally rotten, that even the associated content creators of the game struggle to have fun playing it (especially killer mains). \n\nTo sum it up - the game can be really entertaining early on, but don't fall for that. You will end up having a horrible time and if you get too involved in the game, it will be hard to stop playing for good. You will always come back and have a bad time again. It's going downhill in terms of balance, community health and even security. Until these issues are properly addressed and proper steps are taken, I can't recommend this game to anyone.

Al permitirte jugar con amigos en steam puedes activar el micrófono y estar en permanente comunicación con tus compañeros.Esto, que del lado del superviviente es increíble, del lado del asesino es horrible porque poseen un control de mapa superior al tuyo, te tienen localizado todo el tiempo, se pueden dividir las tareas (por ejemplo uno distrae al asesino, otro busca el maleficio y el resto repara) colocándose perks para cada una e incluso hacer sinergia entre perks.\n\nEn síntesis si quieres jugar como superviviente es mejor con amigos o conocidos con los que te puedas comunicar, si quieres jugar como asesino te deseo suerte, pero insisto el juego no vale el precio que tiene.","timestamp_created":1648679331,"timestamp_updated":1648679331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113090158","author":{"steamid":"76561198995205602","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4262,"last_played":1650392154},"language":"english","review":"Fun and enjoyable to play with friends or solo.","timestamp_created":1648679058,"timestamp_updated":1648679058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113089884","author":{"steamid":"76561198331836884","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":76184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73234,"last_played":1656038827},"language":"brazilian","review":"Depois de horas de jogo posso te dizer q não vale a pena o estresse, se você quer jogar com amigos, ótimo vc vai se divertir, se vc quer jogar de assassino, desista vc só vai se estressar, 4 dead hards todas as partidas, mapas que só te botam em desvantagem, comunicação e lag switch, não vale a pena.","timestamp_created":1648678558,"timestamp_updated":1648678558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113089543","author":{"steamid":"76561198302741381","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":55814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":146,"playtime_at_review":48387,"last_played":1660368398},"language":"english","review":" You can listen to all the negative reviews if you'd like, however, this is actually a really good and very fun game assuming you learn to not get affected by the actions of the other players or fall into the \"game bad\" hivemind. I understand all the complaints but i have to disagree that they should make you avoid buying. \n\n Killers can camp or tunnel you and ruin your experience for one game by essentially killing you entirely right away, now you either let this affect you to the point making a 3 paragraph post explaining why killer is too overpowered and campers should be banned or.....      you just find another match and keep having fun. \n\n Survivors can bm harder than an MW2 lobby via teabagging, bullying, and flashlight clicking making your life a living hell and causing you to want to blast a hole through your monitor the size of a small dog. Again you will be tasked with making the decision, forum post about how SWF shouldn't exist, killer is too weak, gen rushing is too powerful, or.....    you just find another match and keep having fun. \n\nI'm a firm believer that the fun in a game is what you make of it. Seriously its not a competitive game, I used to experience the tilt hardcore more than pretty much any other game. I used to freak out, read posts agreeing with my poor takes on game balance to make me feel more justified, and complain to everyone about how unfair it felt. But then I realized that was dumb, and that I was being dumb. If you get camped first hook and die in 3 minutes of the match start, so be it, don't let it get to you, it doesn't happen very often and you can go into the next game hoping that you both play better and have a better experience. Same goes for killer, don't allow the people in this game and this community to keep you from playing this just due to their attitudes and overall negative behaviors and mindsets that have been formed over the lifespan of this game. No, whatever you lost to (probably) isn't actually that overpowered, yes, you probably could've outplayed your enemy, no, the way that dude played isn't a bannable offense, and no, you shouldn't judge this individuals personality and life experience or skills purely off of how they played a character in a video game.\n\nTLDR: It's good, just stay positive and don't let the negativity get to you, its just a game, have fun.","timestamp_created":1648677963,"timestamp_updated":1648677963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":94,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70637059211730957","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113089360","author":{"steamid":"76561198797326750","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1651111459},"language":"spanish","review":"gran juego, mejor que su vercion mobile \n","timestamp_created":1648677588,"timestamp_updated":1648677588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113089304","author":{"steamid":"76561198841471580","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1004,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1660527196},"language":"english","review":"Super fun game lots of variety and fun both as a single person or with friends.","timestamp_created":1648677464,"timestamp_updated":1648677464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113088849","author":{"steamid":"76561198824106451","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2820,"playtime_at_review":8814,"last_played":1660596692},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了很久的游戏 感觉跟朋友一起挺好玩的","timestamp_created":1648676612,"timestamp_updated":1648676612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113088453","author":{"steamid":"76561198972268302","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5173,"last_played":1651089855},"language":"english","review":"If the devs actually did proper updates, upheld their anti cheat, and did something beyond the minimum it'd be worth it.
