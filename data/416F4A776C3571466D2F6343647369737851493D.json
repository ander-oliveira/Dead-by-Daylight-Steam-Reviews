update is SO bad that everyone left due to hitboxes despite the fact there is no hitbox issue, just a desync, so the only people left are beyond sweat lords.\n\nFor killers, initially it is horribly unbalanced play. You're first 10 games will contain players of relatively equal skill. Hours 10-100 expect to either get your shit pushed in by players who are at LEAST 1/2 the entire rank system higher than you in skill level, or utterly stomp new players, only 1/20 matches will find that inbetween of balance. Also they almost all run the same 3 perks, so google: dead hard, borrowed time, and decisive strike before you play. Early game is 4/10 for killer, once you get the hang of it it becomes a 7/10.\n\nEasy to medium difficulty games for survivors early on, just run the same 3 perks mentioned (requires you to buy DLC) and you're games will be significantly easier. Practice cutting corners, looping, and doubling back. 8/10 for survivor, hope you like sitting and watching your rank \"4\" friend play as you'll likely die within the first 3ish minutes and have to watch them play the other 7-15 minutes without you.\n\nAlso take the advice of other negative reviews with thousands of hours. Still semi fun though, would not be so bad if matchmaking had a semblance of balance, not recomended as 75% of the time you're new will not be fun. The game is fun to meh at the moment, but the toxicity of the community is honestly what causes this game to have a negative review for me.","timestamp_created":1611560278,"timestamp_updated":1613334249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85311998","author":{"steamid":"76561198117904690","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4330,"last_played":1653976663},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, viciante y entretenido, se recomienda.","timestamp_created":1611560159,"timestamp_updated":1611560159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85311914","author":{"steamid":"76561199027163174","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4885,"last_played":1649775878},"language":"russian","review":"Игра сама по себе хороша и очень увлекательна, но нужно очень сильно поработать над балансом маньяков.","timestamp_created":1611560013,"timestamp_updated":1611560013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85311557","author":{"steamid":"76561198447575001","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":78425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":423,"playtime_at_review":25678,"last_played":1660110578},"language":"schinese","review":"\"I think we did a pretty good job so far~\"","timestamp_created":1611559343,"timestamp_updated":1611559343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85311356","author":{"steamid":"76561198996227188","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4360,"last_played":1642017566},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom","timestamp_created":1611558942,"timestamp_updated":1612165588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85311314","author":{"steamid":"76561198202937472","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":16814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1190,"last_played":1658142708},"language":"polish","review":"h","timestamp_created":1611558858,"timestamp_updated":1611558858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85311257","author":{"steamid":"76561198032085607","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":5515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1654657491},"language":"english","review":"Lots of fun playing with a full lobby of friends or just online.","timestamp_created":1611558740,"timestamp_updated":1611558740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85310923","author":{"steamid":"76561198973662355","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4689,"last_played":1658823681},"language":"tchinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1611558086,"timestamp_updated":1611558086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85310779","author":{"steamid":"76561198284465433","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20941,"last_played":1659031703},"language":"koreana","review":"한글로채팅좀되게해라씨발럼들아","timestamp_created":1611557847,"timestamp_updated":1611557847,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85310772","author":{"steamid":"76561198251521220","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":55039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1660251937},"language":"english","review":"Lemme start off with a positive review.

Balancing decisions are made with little to no regard for the actual effectiveness of the abilities being nerfed/buffed, and power creep has rendered many of the game's launch roster obsolete as new killers and survivors are often effectively improvements over existing archetypes. In addition, the game's economy is completely unbalanced. There are some 40 odd characters added since the game's launch, each of which costs 9000 \"shards\" to buy. Earning that many \"shards\" takes nearly 100 hours of gameplay- I have only unlocked ONE character myself so far. These characters are $5 USD each otherwise, and buying a character actually makes your OTHER characters more powerful, as you can mix and match the traits they come with. In order to actually have all your options available be able to compete properly in this competitive, vs-mode-only game, you either need THOUSANDS of hours, or over a hundred dollars in DLC to do so. \n\nThe game needs a complete and total overhaul, a sequel, or some other fresh start. It's marred in it's own issues and they are too deeply set to fix at this point, not that the developers are capable of listening to their customers' repeated and consistent concerns over the last several years. The gameplay can be fun when you get into a good groove, but more often than not one player missing a single QTE is enough to ruin an entire game for all parties involved, which is exacerbated by the godawful matchmaking- let alone the frustration caused by intentional greifing, which is rampant.

Die Entwickler kümmern sich relativ wenig um eine richtige faire Balance und um die Ausmerzung der Bugs, die inzwischen immer noch nicht behoben wurden. Die Intension der Entwickler liegt darin, noch mehr Killer zu modellieren, um noch mehr Geld zu verdienen. Das Spielprinzip zwischen Killer und Überlebender ist klar und deutlich. Aber dennoch ist die Balance zwischen Killer und Surv. ein absoluter WITZ! Teamplay war mal. Diese Zeiten sind definitiv vorbei!
