Есть свои недочеты. Если вы новичок то вам придеться перетерпеть первые 20 часов игры против топовых маньяков тусующих на 20 ранге(самом низком), ну или если вы будете играть за маньяка - готовтесь, что каждый 3 подбор людей будет состоять из пати с ТОПовыми фонарями и ящиками инструментов. Есть проблема матчмейкинга. Человек будучи на 1 ранге сможет сыграть вместе с маньяком 10 ранга если присоединиться вместе с 20 рангом которого пригласил в лобби \"Выживание с друзьями\". Вам будет трудно против сильных игроков. Но есть YouTube и Twich которые научат вас с помощью стримов как обходить те или иные фокусы сурвов и киллеров. Я освоил владения игрой и мансования за 25 часов. И играя не как полет-селлер, а как полет-лупер и с умный использованием генерации карты. Когда вы освоите примерное знание карт всех - это примерно 40 часов, вы сможете понимать где ловить и куда убегать. Нужно уметь читать выживших будучи маньяком и наоборот будучи выжившим. к своему количеству часов я могу с уверенность сказать что это хорошая игра. Есть проблемы, но все со временем стараются исправлять. Когда-то это удаеться, когда-то становиться хуже. Но я спокойно смотрю на все изменения в игре.

Play with a positive attitude and you'll have fun, play without it and you'll be stressed and angry.\n\nI'll start off by saying this game is far from perfect. There's a lot of flaws, but there's also a lot to love. The game is very simple, but it does it well and manages to make a seemingly boring gameplay loop into a fun experience, for the most part. \n\nPros:\n- The game is basically a love letter to the horror genre. Besides Jason Voorhees and a few others, Dead by Daylight has the big \"slasher movie\" antagonists we all know and love. Michael Myers, Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, etc.. The original killers are also great, in my opinion, and are all worthy additions to the genre.\n- The gameplay loop, although it seems boring and too simple on paper, is actually very satisfying and can result in a lot of fun if your doing well. The game revolves around \"the trial\". 4 survivors are dropped into a map, and 1 killer has to hunt them down before they can repair a series of generators to power gates they use to escape. There's no other game modes, so one would think this would get boring very fast, but it manages to hold its own surprisingly well.\n- I have a lot of fun with friends in this game. While it can get frustrating (especially if you die early and can't start another match without leaving your friends) overall we all have a blast.\n- Constant progression. There's always a survivor or killer to level up, thanks to a prestige system and frequent updates adding new characters. You'll never feel like you have nothing to do.\n\nCons:\n- Utterly god awful community. I'm a stickler for good community so this is a big one. The game's community is unfortunately very toxic, which is disappointing on its own, but the toxicity also bleeds through into the gameplay as well. Toxic survivors can make playing killer very frustrating (although satisfying, if you do end up killing them) and vice versa. It's never fun being hooked and then face camped, which basically guarantees your death.\n- Balancing issues. There is definitely a clear meta in this game, especially once you start getting into higher ranks. Some characters are just pointless to play, since their basic abilities are so flawed that you'd have to be god-tier to be succesful using them against competent players. This is more apparent on the killer side of the game, since survivors don't have abilities like they do, which makes them more flexible.\n- Stressful gameplay. Like I said earlier, the game is fun, especially with friends...if you're doing well. If you're not, it's awfully frustrating. This is one of those games where your mindset can make or break it. Go in with a positive and healthy mindset and you'll be fine.

The game was really fun at first. There's a definite learning curve, but once I figured out how the game worked it quickly became one of my most played games. As of now (October 4th, 2018), I can only handle a few games at a time before the game becomes too unplayable. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nWhen the game FIRST came out, there were things such as \"instant blinds\" as well as \"vacuum pallets\" that made the game SUPER lame for killers. Naturally, killer mains cried to the developers. This resulted in following patches up to this date (October 4th, 2018) being solely focused on nerfing survivor perks and buffing those of killers. Items such as the \"odd bulb\" which were used for the \"instant blind\" were nerfed to the point where an item add-on literally half its value works better (they haven't updated the item description, nor balanced the rest of the add-ons accordingly). \"Vacuum pallets\" were removed from the game (albiet, rightfully so, they were pretty broken). Perks focused on survivability and looping ability were nerfed (ie: exhaustion debuff nerfs). \n\nAt the same time, killers are being buffed endlessly. Bloodlust timer was reduced so they can catch up to survivors faster. Killers get new perks that give them the ability to one hit every single survivor if you cleanse the wrong totem. Overall performance such as lunge range was improved on certain killers. \n\nDid I mention killers are the ones who host the game? What does that mean? You guessed it! Lag switchers! \nDon't 360 or loop any killer too hard at high rank or they'll break out the lag switch and you'll be on the hook before you even know what happened. I don't know if they actually get banned or not, but at the rate I've encountered them, it doesn't seem like it. \n\nHow could I forget survivor hitboxes too?! The killer's weapon doesn't even have to physically touch your character model to damage you. It's the sheer force of the shockwave behind the killer's swing that travels through the air and damages survivors. (Survivor hitboxes are significantly larger than actual character model.)\n\n\nDEVELOPER SOLUTIONS:\n1) MORE COSMETICS (gotta get that $$$)\n2) MORE DLC (gotta get that $$$)\n3) MORE PERKS BUFFING KILLERS (because they DEFINITELY need ANOTHER exposure perk, aka: instant down)\n4) MORE NERFS TO SURVIVORS (because survivors are still too toxic, says lag-switching killer mains hehe xd) \n\ntl;dr:\n1) Killers buffed endlessly + survivors nerfed endlessly\n2) Devs focusing on making money instead of getting dedicated servers or actually balancing the game. \n3) Would purchase if you're interested in being a killer main.

You cannot really impact this. You can try config changes and goof around until you get it where you want it but that is no proper fix as it depends on your configuration.\n\nIf you have Ultrawidescreen forget it. \nYou cannot even set the aspect ratio which causes the game to cut your game up with the biggest \"cinematic\" black bars you will ever see because a higher FOV would be unfair...\nYou cannot set the resolution.

Leider muss ich zugeben, das der Kaufpreis dieses Spiel nicht wert ist. Grafisch mag es gut sein, aber das sind viele Spiele. Nein, es macht schlicht und einfach keinen Spaß, ganz im Gegenteil sogar, es raubt mir jeglichen Spaß. Das liegt nicht vorrangig an dem ewig gleichen repitiven Spielprinzip, was mir aus dem Halse hängt, es liegt an den Mitspielern, für die mir einfach die Schimpfworte fehlen. Es liegt auch nicht unbedingt daran, dass ich schlecht oder gut bin, ich schätze mich selbst als mittelmäßig ein. Aber wenn ein Spiel Mitspielern auch noch die Möglichkeiten gibt, Teammitglieder den Spielspaß zu rauben, so ist es ein Design-Problem. Und von der giftigen Community will ich noch nicht mal reden, dies unterstreicht nur meinen Eindruck, mit welchem ich jetzt dieses Spiel in die Tonne trete - wenigstens ein Aspekt an dem Spiel, was mir Freude breitet und was ich mir auch von keinem anderen Mitspieler rauben lasse.","timestamp_created":1538684290,"timestamp_updated":1538684290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461506366729736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45104984","author":{"steamid":"76561198440244614","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1537857447},"language":"english","review":"I was looking forward to playing an online match.
