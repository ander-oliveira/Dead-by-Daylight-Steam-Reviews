Now killers that never deserved their rank are flying high at [i] rank 1 [/i] [spoiler] (Even though Rank 1 is completely void of any players because the matchmaking system is garbage) [/spoiler] while survivors who may or may not deserve it are forced to stay at rank 15 because no matter what they do they cant rank up.

I dont mind having a couple odd games where i lose, its going to happen. But when i finish all 5 gens and I never let the killer see me, I am punished for that, while the killer is rewarded for focusing down one player. Camping is always going to happen, I realize some players might just want that kill, but when you are punishing players for something they cant control (such as camping) you are making it less fun for the rest of us to enjoy.

If you plan on playing survivor, find a different game. \n\nI have been through a lot of shit in this game, I bought it on launch day and have seen a lot of changes. This is probably the worst state I've seen this game in. Also, previous Rank 1 Killer and Rank 1 Survivor, but I stopped playing for about 4 months, and I have come back to a hell hole. \n\nMy review in November, 2016 \"Most fun I've had in a long time! :D\"\n\nMy Review now: \n\nThis game is honestly trash in its current state. Since launch, this game has been so easy for survivors, they have had no problem winning the game so as long as they didn't get a good killer... It has seen many changes with the goal of nerfing the survivors so that the killer may have an easier time winning matches; however, this latest patch takes it too far. \n\nFor first time buyers:\n\nRight now, the game is in no state to be purchased, the majority of the respectful community have since left this game behind. Games are filled with Killers from China, which causes major lag, because the game is P2P. These Chinese killers also have no Game Etiquette, and will face camp/tunnel you hard. \nSurvivors are also huge problems, its as if the game currently has a lot of Summer Sale Noobs, and survivors will take you off the hook when the killer is standing right in front of you, resulting in the killer grabbing you and hooking you again. As I see it, this game is only a slope downhill, and will not see any proper improvment from the community or the devs.\n\nFor people who understand the game: \n\nIn this games current state, the killers are insanley overpowered, even with a 4 man SWF. There are about 6 pallets on the map and you have nowhere to run, a lot of killer ITEM ADD-ONS have overpowered abilities with no proper drawback (The Huntress can 1 hit down you with her hatchets, only penalty is a removal of 2 hatchets) (The Shape still has Fragrant Tuft of Hair, Judith's Tombstone, and Tombstone Piece, which by the way are fairly common items to get on the bloodweb.)\nMost survivor perks have been nerfed, and you will see a lot of killers camping because its easy to do now, the past 12 matches I have played, I have had 11/12 games someone has disconnected at the start of the match, and roughly 9 campers. \n\n\n\nNo, DO NOT BUY THIS!","timestamp_created":1479947726,"timestamp_updated":1501659895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505121707916259766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26962690","author":{"steamid":"76561198038780953","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":56094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34722,"last_played":1629064879},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1479947688,"timestamp_updated":1479947688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26962210","author":{"steamid":"76561198032048387","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":272377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68452,"last_played":1637317384},"language":"english","review":"Is good","timestamp_created":1479947580,"timestamp_updated":1479947580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26961715","author":{"steamid":"76561198228519864","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":52500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30118,"last_played":1646103747},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ele traz aquele sentimento de tensão e é muuuuuito viciante.

Survivor and Killers have completely differant play styles, and many options to choose from on both sides. Innitially when I started playing, it was fairly buggy and had quite a few issues connecting on multiplayer. I gave DBD a rest for a few months and came back to check it out just before the October patch (which added the first DLC content).\n\nI don't know the long term plans this company has to support the game in the distant future but the difference a few months have made are fantastic. Many more maps to play on, enough survivor and killer variety to keep me coming back for many matches a week, and an evolving meta game that has had me reading up on patch notes and strategies that I haven't really done in past games.\n\nTwo thumbs up for this game, and thanks to the developers for keeping in touch with the
