It feels like I'm trying to enter a club and I don't meet the proper requirements when I start. This would be less of a bother if I had ai bots to fail in front of, a proper tutorial, or at the very least: a method of organizing players by their ranks, so I'd fail as much as everyone else. This game has none of the above. (IF it does have a method of organizing players by rank, then it seems awfully strange how everyone is already at their top ranks and nobody seems to be new to this at all, considering how I was just dropped in the middle of expirienced players. Twice.)\n\n As a killer: you can't just kill a survivor. You'll have to attack the survivor, then drag his/her body to a meat hook, HOPING that another survivor didn't break it, all within a certain period of time. I've been told that you CAN kill a downed survivor if you can find a \"memento\", which I find to be completely rediculous. If you're a killer, aren't you supposed to.....well, kill people!?\n\nAs a survivor: fixing a generator requires a quicktime action. Because the developers will not have mentioned this ANYWHERE, you will most likely fail the first time you touch a generator and either get slaughered because of it, or hurt your team's chances at survival because of it.\n\nThis isn't tf2, pd2, csgo etc. where you can fail in front of ai bots or recieve proper tutorials. This is a polished, yet unfinished game that you have to pay for, in more than one way. It MIGHT improve over time, but as of now, I wouldn't recommend you play it at all, unless if you know 2 - 3 other people who also play it.\n\nIf you want a good slasher game, where you play as the killer: I'd recommend \"Party Hard\". It's storyline is decent, most of your attacks are stealthy and strategic, and the best part: You aren't expected to know what you're doing, before you're supposed to know what you're doing.","timestamp_created":1469588268,"timestamp_updated":1469640267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5160866379737854","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24548568","author":{"steamid":"76561198082089154","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":86811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7643,"last_played":1599114503},"language":"russian","review":"Очень здорово, надеюсь незабросят игру.","timestamp_created":1469587356,"timestamp_updated":1469587356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543310403823852539","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24548548","author":{"steamid":"76561198148994105","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5423,"last_played":1532858256},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏还行勉强能玩","timestamp_created":1469587174,"timestamp_updated":1469587174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527628004550933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24548490","author":{"steamid":"76561198217121125","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1579798212},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏真的可以，特别是现在有了汉化爽翻天了。很高兴是在之前涨价买的，现在涨价真觉得那些还在犹豫的人捉急，还在犹豫的赶紧买吧！难道汉化还不能吸引你？","timestamp_created":1469586819,"timestamp_updated":1469586819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504439949989318848","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24548343","author":{"steamid":"76561198073042053","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2065,"last_played":1502509035},"language":"english","review":"FIRE THE FUCKING DEVELOPERS.

It is a ton of fun to play the Wraith. Saying that, I also have to mention that I have lost rank three times now for getting stuck while trying to pick someone up. The other survivors even try shining a flashlight at me after noticing that I am stuck, and I continue to sit there until I just leave the game.\n\nEDIT: I figured I would give it a second try. I have had to leave a game twice today due to getting stuck while trying to pick someone off the ground. I also just had to leave the game because I had hung two people, and the \"entity\" did not take them into the sky. I am getting very disheartened with how this game is performing currently. Simple parts of the game that should have been solved before it even got released are becoming a common issue with my playing of this game. I have the feeling of buyer's remorse due to the lack of faith I have in this game going further.\n\nIt is now 02-16-2017. A new patch has come out that will make killer more fun to play. I try to log on to the game, and it says launch error. I try to re-open it through steam, and I get the same response. After opening and closing the game multiple times, I have almost given up. The game is fun. It also ruins my nights. If I am in a surviving mood, I have to wait until I hopefully get someone that isn't lagging, and not a bot. If I want to kill, I have to hope that all 4 survivors get in the game, so that I don't have to \"be a good sport\" and let everyone pip. Steadily losing faith. The game is a great concept. I cannot recommend a friend buy it with everything that I have experienced with it.\n\n07/08/2017 update -- I have tried updating drivers, installing the new windows update, went through the command prompt on my computer to fix corrupted files, and again to try to fix the easyanticheat error I was receiving. Fuck this game. Fuck the developers. I have tried e-mailing for help and received none. New update? DLC. Bug fixes? Next time. It has been nearly a year since I have played this game, and I still cannot. Fun game, and I am trying to remain patient with the hopes that a fix will eventually come. I now consider my library on steam one less because of this game. I've put 30$ into this game, put +300$ into updating my graphics card and power supply JUST TO PLAY THIS GAME, and now I cannot. If anyone asks me about this game, I will give severe harshness towards it.

You decide if its bad or good\n\nFor now I dont really reccomend it because of the bugs and campers in the game,but no one is stopping ya!\n\nUpdates! (My thoughts) : \n\n1st Update : Most of the infinites have been taken out of the game and I think it is fair for that to happen. Why? Because for me,as survivor or killer it gets boring to just abuse infinites or chase 1 guy the whole match.\n\n2nd Update,Nurse,Nea and New Map! : To be honest,I got very hyped about the new killer and survivor. I wanted to see how they look and what the offer us,what perks they have,etc.. People say the Nurse is pretty broken and Nea is the new ''Dwight''. I totally agree with these statements but I dont think the Nurse is ''broken''. Yes,it has powerful perks and can teleport but that doesn't mean you cant escape her or survive against her.The new map is gigantic and has loads of pallets,it reminds me of autohaven.\n\n3rd Update,Nerfing survivors and buffing killers? : Now as survivor you get less points for certain actions and as killer you get more points for other actions.I believe you only get 500 points if you sabotage a hook,250 for sabotaging a trap. As HillBilly,you get more points for chainsawing people,I believe it is 850.I forgot something,now you cant see the ranks of other people in lobbies for both killer and survivor.Atleast now many killers dont dodge lobbies :p.\n\nNotes :\n\nSince the last few updates there has been some ''problems'' and ''bugs'' such as taking forever to join a game as survivor or sometimes if a killer grabs you on the ground you might levitate in the air.Another bug that isnt new and that I would like for it to be fixed is that sometimes in the end of a match at the scoreboard I can see the results of the last match instead of the match I just played.","timestamp_created":1469564749,"timestamp_updated":1472487108,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526462256908416748","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24543714","author":{"steamid":"76561198048695055","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1484339006},"language":"russian","review":"Баланса нет и не предвидится.
