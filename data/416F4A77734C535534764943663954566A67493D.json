Но отсюда и вытекает один из главных минусов дбд. Дбд не рассчитана на игру через дискорд и другие мессенджеры , в результате чего страдают маны .Графика для игры с такими системниками просто кекс . Багов бывает много , как и спорных решений со стороны разрабов . Читеры как считают многие это главная проблема , так как код игры полностью открыт , но я за свои почти 700ч ни разу не видел читера , как за мана , так и за сурва . Но несмотря на эти минусы игра все равно уникальная в своем роде , она может приносить как радость , так и гнев .

game is not enjoyable if your planning on playing survivor the servers are absolutely terrible and they are completely killer sided and unfair for the survivor every time you encounter a chase interaction etc. with a killer. And the matchmaking system is also terrible and do not how me and and my friend are deep in green rank but still get paired with yellow and brown ranks it does add up. And its disappointing to play this game cause i see how much potential it has but falls off in these major categories witch in my opinion makes the game suffer severly. The skill gap also takes a hit do to my experience i can work on three gens ( generators ) witch are very important part to escape the killer and my friend all he has to is sit around running the killer in circles and get people off hooks and mabye get half of a gen and get more blood points than me and rank up\nway faster.

The devs push out systematic, regular updates and the game is only going up from here. Dedicated servers were just added recently and cross platform play and progression are in the works and already partially implemented. Now is a fantastic time to jump onto this game if you've been watching it for some time. The game has never been healthier in terms of balance and polish; I have been playing off and on since the beta.\n\nPROS:\n\n-The game is fun. Gameplay is completely unique and I haven't found any other game that can scratch that Dead by Daylight \"itch.\"\n-Balancing is done semi-competently, especially given the asymmetrical nature of the game (which I have never seen balanced effectively in other games). You will see lots of complaints about this but compared to most other games this one does it okay-ish, if a bit slowly.\n-Two completely separate gameplay styles means if you get bored of one you can swap to the other (Survivor vs Killer)\n-Sheer amount of perks and add-ons give lots of room for fun builds to try across the board.\n-Regular updates squash the worst of the bugs (usually) and occasionally even bring brand new mechanics to keep the game from getting too boring.\n-Regular DLC add new killers, survivors, and maps to the game every few months.\n-Regular events keep the community alive, and the devs regularly engage with the community with things like art contests, giveaways, and streamer promotions.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-The DLC is a bit prohibitive to someone just starting out as it's basically impossible to earn all the killers through in-game means, and IIRC the licensed killers (Michael Myers, Leatherface, Pyramid Head, etc) must be purchased with money. Many, many top-tier perks are also locked behind DLC, which sucks.\n-There is something of a learning curve on both sides; each killer plays differently and survivors play completely differently than the killers. Playing against a halfway decent survivor will make you feel like a joke of a killer, and playing against a halfway decent killer can make new survivors feel completely hopeless. Both sides are relatively balanced, though, especially at lower levels of play. If anything, the survivors have an advantage if they are cooperating competently. This is made worse since tutorials for basic optimal gameplay concepts like looping, closing loops, mindgames, etc do not exist in favor of in-game text and perks that encourage suboptimal techniques like stealth.\n-There are occasional glitches, and some of them can ruin a round completely.\n-Matchmaking is a joke. Because survivors can party up together, playing as a new killer can match you against a group of high-level survivors playing with their low-level friend.\n\n\n\nI have many, many more hours on the PS4 release and don't plan on stopping playing soon.\n\nPick it up if it looks interesting, it's well worth the asking price. Currently on sale with a bunch of DLC included for a very reasonable price.","timestamp_created":1592437096,"timestamp_updated":1592437096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70957006","author":{"steamid":"76561198125937559","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1189,"last_played":1623110538},"language":"brazilian","review":"daora","timestamp_created":1592437071,"timestamp_updated":1592437071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70956858","author":{"steamid":"76561198097433426","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":70662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":145,"playtime_at_review":12070,"last_played":1660359955},"language":"english","review":"it's okay","timestamp_created":1592436804,"timestamp_updated":1598057758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70956851","author":{"steamid":"76561198261174904","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1229,"last_played":1619137356},"language":"brazilian","review":"pog","timestamp_created":1592436796,"timestamp_updated":1592436796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70956841","author":{"steamid":"76561198413554648","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":75242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":161,"playtime_at_review":29337,"last_played":1659575076},"language":"french","review":"Rien que le fait de pouvoir exécuter de manières différentes des survivants quasi-inoffensif, cela fait de ce jeu un véritable plaisir.","timestamp_created":1592436768,"timestamp_updated":1592436768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70956811","author":{"steamid":"76561198284300362","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":19719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":7747,"last_played":1659539173},"language":"russian","review":"Радужные мрази захватили эту игру.\nПостоянно появляются все более и более скользкие сурвы, последние из которых относятся к толерантным.\nИгру просто убили, добавив в нее дохера дисбаланса.\nХвалю обнову, грязь действительно очень сильный и интересный, но без черной мрази было бы лучше.\nИ да, в игре постоянные промокоды, пропагандирующие еблю с мужиками.

Combine the lack of understanding with their refusal to listen to what the community wants unless they see something that becomes too powerful the day after its released. Even then, the game is written on spaghetti code, they dont have a way to give a truly fun experience for both casual and competitive players. No one is ever going to be satisfied with this game wholeheartedly. Take my advice, don't waste your money on the game. Its clear they don't care about the community, just that the game still has players.  \n\nOriginal Review:\n\nIs it fun? Yes.\nIs it good? Sometimes\nIs the community great? Depends where you look.\n\n1126 hours in and I still can't properly give this game a fair rating. You cant give this game a yes or no rating because of how it works. The game is good, but it isn't at all perfect. Its bug ridden with more to find or return after every patch, filled with latency issues, runs on an outdated game engine, has a Skill Based Matchmaking system that doesn't account for perks or add ons that can carry a player to high skill (It tires, but it doesnt account for enough to judge real skill), has no clear win condition defined by the game or the developers, and more times than not the devs don't listen to the community unless its a gamebreaking issue, and even then sometimes they don't listen... but hey, if you can get past that, it does have a vast cast of characters, a high skill curve, lots of cosmetics, can be played with friends or Solo, and has custom games. If that isnt enough, lots of licensed killers and survivors too if you wanna play as your favorite horror game and movie characters. \n\nWith a game like this, you get out what you put in. The game is easy to learn, but takes a long time to master. Im still far from a master on either side, but I've learned a lot after all this time. The game can be fun if you make it fun. It won't always be exactly what you want, but thats ok too. \n\nMy rating of the game is 3.5/5 Iridescent Emblems, strictly because of the downsides of the game. IMO, the game needs to be moved to a newer engine or rebuilt from the ground up with everything included. The game came from an era where the killer was the server, and a lot of functionality and has become a game based on dedicated servers. Since then the old issues are starting to bleed through and are only recently being updated.
