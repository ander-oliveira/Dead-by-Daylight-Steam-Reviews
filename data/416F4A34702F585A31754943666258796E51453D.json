new emblem system is fcking horrible...they KNEW it was RIDICULOUSLY unbalanced and geared towards making it WAAAAAAAYYYYY easier for killers to pip and WAAAAAAYYYYY harder for survivors to pip and they did NOTHING....u need over 15k just to get a single pip as survivor and youre PENALIZED for playing like a good player....if u dont get chased and NO ONE gets hurt so you cant be altruistic you LOSE pip...u can make over 15k points and NOT make a pip wtf.... \n\ni was excited for the new emblem system when they talked abouit it but the CLEAR imbalance between survivor and killer worried me, then they said they knew it was an issue so i assumed itd be handled. unfortunately i learned they didnt do anything and just left it how it was in broken test server status. as a killer its RIDICULOUSLY easy to level as youre rewarded for everythin u do and everything they give u points for youre gonna inevitably do whether youre trying or not. if you play as a good survivor, get all gens done and dont get chased ir hurt youre not gonna pip for being \"too good\" like wtf...and they STILL give you zero progression on leveling for doing totems...hex totems count(hoping a killer ACTUALLY brings one) but still no reward or love for the regular totems.\n\nif you thought ranking up as a survivor was difficult before? now u need 20k just to get a SINGLE pip...made 22k today with iridecent, gold, and silver emblems and BARELY made a pip by the skin of my teeth. This was a change for the MASSIVELY worse, and killers are gonna be camping 10x the amount because theyre rewarded for it now...\n\ni gnuinely love this game so im hoping the devs see this kind of feedback and do something but this system NEVER should have been implemented until they worked out the horrible imbalance.... and hats not even bringing up tyhe horrible issues with how pathetically weak killers are now so theyre promoted to play like cheaters essentially. tunneling, facecamping, bodyblocking, ect. because they have no other way of getting kills and those methods arent punished...this game is making a lot of CHANGES, when they need to start implementing a lot of FIXES. time will only tell the fate of this game. but if they dont start listening to and acknowleding their community this game is going to go down fast.\n\nand stop fucking banning players without a single answer...and especially when theyre popular youtubers that are PERSONALLY responsible for bringing thousands of dolars of revenue and hundreds if not thousands of of players to your game....like ffs","timestamp_created":1523410380,"timestamp_updated":1523410429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41408507","author":{"steamid":"76561198028051205","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3938,"last_played":1629130551},"language":"english","review":"Patch 1.9.4 Dead by Daylight Rest in Peace...","timestamp_created":1523410013,"timestamp_updated":1524084415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41408326","author":{"steamid":"76561198027012507","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11305,"last_played":1559380630},"language":"english","review":"Patch 1.9.4 Dead by Daylight Rest in Peace...","timestamp_created":1523409031,"timestamp_updated":1523409132,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598861277103424072","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41408170","author":{"steamid":"76561198094488135","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1878,"last_played":1648140373},"language":"russian","review":"Первые дня три-четыри, шугаешься от скримеров.

Dennoch gibt es einige Punkte die mich oftmals ziemlich aufregen. Zusammen mit Freunden zu spielen wurde in letzter Zeit immer schwieriger. Ich weiß nicht ob das ein Einzelfall ist aber Lobbybeitritte durch Einladungen von Freunden sind kaum mehr möglich da man entweder nur Ewigkeiten einen Ladebildschirm zu sehen bekommt, oder man wieder zum Titelbildschirm geschickt wird. Einzelrunden als Überlebender sind jedoch schon möglich. Sollte man es doch einmal geschafft haben zusammen in die Lobby zu kommen dauert die Suche nach einem Spiel oft so lang, das man es lieber gleich abbricht und alleine spielt. Ein weiterer Punkt sind manche Killer die den Überlebenden einfach viel zu überlegen sind. Darunter z.B. Amanda und Michael Myers. Amanda verfügt über die Bärenfallen, über Haken und über einen kaum hörbaren Terrorradius. Wird man vom Haken gerettet dauert das entschärfen der Falle oft so lang das man in der Zeit bereits wieder von Amanda erwischt wird und erneut am Haken hängt. Hier würde ich mir wünschen das man evtl. nur weniger Haken zur Verfügung hätte. Bei Michael ist es das sofortige Niederstrecken und der nicht vorhandene Terrorradius. Wobei es hier wenigstens so ist das Michael eine verlangsamte Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit hat. Vielleicht sollte man das Machtverhältnis von Killer und Überlebenden noch etwas anpassen. Ansonsten ist es nur oftmals die schlechte Community, z.B. Killer die andauernd vorm Haken campen und man so keine Chance auf Rettung hat. Trotzdem empfehle ich das Spiel da es mir persönlich trotzdem Spaß macht und nicht alles perfekt sein kann :D. Das sind nur Anregungen was man aus meiner Sicht noch etwas besser machen könnte. Vorallem hoffe ich darauf das dass mit den Lobbys gefixt wird.

Why am I putting a negative review with 400 hours + played? It's addictive as fuck bro, SWF is fun when you play low ranks. But as soon as you reach the rank 10 and below, this game is absolute garbage.\n\nKillers are stupidly OP (Nurse and doctor)\nEmblem system (Which is the rank system) is legit trash, killers pip so easily. \nOn the other hand susvivor emblem is legit way too hard. You get chased the entire game fpor 10+ mins? Oh you can't pip because you didn't help with gens or your team. You do gens but don't get chased? Fuck you you won't pip. Your teamates kill themsevles because they rage? You don't pip because you didn't help your DEAD team. You did everything right but didn't survive? You don't pip it's a survival game bro.\n\nThe devs don't listen to the community at all. They can't balance their game at all. The only killers played are Hillbilly, Nurse and Doctor. Why you wonder? Because if you don't get a 4k with them you are legit trash come on dude they are busted as shit.\nYou can call me a salty survivor main, I played this game since the beggining when survivors were OP and yeah it wasn't fun for killers. But why do you have to change the roles now? Just balance your stupid game.\n\nAlso killer perks are way too busted compared to survivors'. You can see survivor on the entir map for like 5 secondes when you hook someone, you see everybody healing in your 32m terror radius range. Hex: Ruin, it says it in the name it ruins fucking everything, fun gameplay, survivability because you can't do a single gen because of that shit. Whispers, killers knows if you are close to them, they will just search like a fucking moron for 2 years and a half to find you. \n\nThis game is not fun, it's frustrating as fuck, windows are useless and pallets the same because 8 out of 11 killers don't give a single fuck about pallets or windows they will just run you over.\n\nPeople will get bored of this game eventually if they don't do something major about all the problems. If they listen to their community it might get a lot better.\nBtw plz delete Nurse.

Also addictive.\n\nDespite that, I experience some terrible issues. This game is unfortunately not balance in terms of gameplay. Also, not to mention the toxicity community.\n\nI play this game for a long time and I can explain that some killers does not fit in the mechanics of the game. Some killers are boring to play or playing against. That means that you have to guess what the killers is doing, such as spirit. People can only make decisions HOPING it works. The game should reward you for learning and using that to make the right choice, not base as guessing what would be the best opportunity and hopping it would work. Why making some killers that removes the experience of the survivors?\n\nAlso, some terrible issues. Survivors uses tools to win extra time against the killer, but UNFORTUNATELY THEY CAN HIT THROUGH THE OBSTACLES. As we call pallets, survivors can throw it down to create some distances from the killer, also whEN you throw it momentarily on a killer, it stuns them. BUT the killer can manage to hit the survivor THROUGH  the pallet and get stun at the same times because of hitbox issues. Windows as well.\n\nYes I am a survivor main, but I can manage to explain also what playing killer have issues against survivors. Premade survivors can have add-on and perks times 4 to get the necessary chance of bullying or ''outplay'' a killer, such as Decisive Strikes, exhaustion perks, flashlights, Brand New Parts and so on. These are kinds of issues that killer are putting themselves in a tremendous stress or pressure, sure there is counter play, but it makes the decisions by playing ''toxic'' (as we consider it). By making decisions like this (example: slug tunneling, camp, patrol) killer can manage to win, which in my opinion it's ok, but not fun.\n\nThe Nurse, is a killer that can teleport (blink) in every direction and every distances that she can go through... how stupid. It makes the obstacles useless.\n\nThe RNG generator for maps makes the game impossible to balance. Let's say some maps has 14 pallets and in the same map generated differently has 8 pallets and has 1/3 of dead ends area, absolutely ridiculous!\n\nP.s if you want customization, you have to pay with your money to have them, or play 600 hours to have the right amount of Iridecent shards.","timestamp_created":1523388612,"timestamp_updated":1612765129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41403979","author":{"steamid":"76561198349576279","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":91094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8614,"last_played":1658853756},"language":"english","review":"I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes survival either by yourself or with your team.\nI've played so far 141 hours on this game and it gets better and better each day.\n\nespecially as they will be bringing out new content very soon which is exciting!\n\nThis game I give 10/10 *Big thumbs up* its such a fun Game \n\n","timestamp_created":1523388471,"timestamp_updated":1523388471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41403781","author":{"steamid":"76561198110775474","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":63324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33835,"last_played":1605971846},"language":"russian","review":"Было хорошо, до 2018 года.","timestamp_created":1523387813,"timestamp_updated":1619034398,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519756138324737549","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41403647","author":{"steamid":"76561198361656861","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2535,"last_played":1645889867},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bem elaborado","timestamp_created":1523387395,"timestamp_updated":1523387395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41403512","author":{"steamid":"76561198045606224","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":128120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43648,"last_played":1598106207},"language":"french","review":"le principe est bien pensé malheureusement c'est un jeu fait par des cancers pour des cancers.
