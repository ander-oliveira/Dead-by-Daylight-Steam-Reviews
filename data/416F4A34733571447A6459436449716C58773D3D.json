This is not a \"horror\" movie.\nYou'll play as a survivor and try to do max point by trolling, using broken mechanism and bug abuse. If you have friend, you can play with them and break the game even more. Voice chatting will give you huge advantage. \nAs a killer, you're not supposed to kill the survivor, just play with them. If you managed to kill 4 of them in less than 2 minutes for exemple, you'll get less reward than just playing. Have you ever seen  an horror movie where survivors just teabagging the killer behind a window?  \nMatchmaking is totally broken, you'll play with zero perks against people who have multiple perks. Killer will dodge, and as survivor you'll have to find another game (this is REALLY annoying)\nBecause of clipping, some killer may able to see you behind tree/rocks. \n\nLike someone already said \" killers and survivors calling the other side op without understanding the potential from playing the other side.\"\nThis is because of the rank system, and childish player\n\nIf this is ok for you, you'll enjoy the game. \nPro:\n-The devs seems to listen\n-Majority of time it's quite fun. \n-You'll shit your pants as a survivor (at least the first game! )\n-Web system (progression system) is really nice. \n\nBuy this game only if you're ok with the ranking/farming point system, don't expect a \"horror movie\" game. \n","timestamp_created":1471531403,"timestamp_updated":1471531403,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469314098358154297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24993351","author":{"steamid":"76561198140412119","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5425,"last_played":1659221438},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

The game is essentially Minecraft but with new skins and some different mechanics. There is a lot of tedious resource gathering with stone, wood, clay and other materials. The other thing I don't particularly enjoy are the nights lengths if you're playing the base game without adjusting settings, cowering for long periods of time is pretty boring despite understanding why they make you do it. I really enjoy the way this game goes about with status effects and adds a layer of depth that effects the way that people spend their time. The main draw to this game is surviving the hordes that attack every 7 nights, the difficulty which ramps up in scale as the game progresses. The various types of zombies you encounter are relatively interesting despite being used in other games, and it's fun to deal with some of the random groups that roam the world occasionally. Overall I would recommend this game, it has some flaws but not enough of them to make the gameplay unbearable.","timestamp_created":1471525034,"timestamp_updated":1471525034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499002009630203247","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24991939","author":{"steamid":"76561198120589376","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":14086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1613022414},"language":"english","review":"this game is lit","timestamp_created":1471524991,"timestamp_updated":1471524991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24991884","author":{"steamid":"76561198182271467","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1914,"last_played":1595123242},"language":"english","review":"Addictive and fun.

I can recommend it.\n\nFirst, I have to admit that there are some annoying issues: Matchmaking as a survivor can take a while. Especially so, if you want to team up with friends. Also, there are some bugs/glitches, but I only encountered two that were actually problematic. The rest of the time it's just graphics, e.g., the hook not actually touching my character as I'm supposedly hanging there.\n\nNow, what I really like in this game is that the mechanics are rather basic. As a survivor you sneak around and try to repair generators, which triggers some quick-time events but is otherwise rather easy. The killer on the other hand looks for the survivors, downing them in two hits and trying to sacrifice them to an \"entity\".\n\nThere are some items that help the survivors, but they are very well balanced, as they are by no means necessary. Same goes for the perks that enhance the survivors' and killers' abilities. They are (mostly) useful, but not necessary. The main factor deciding whether you win or lose is you personal skill and a tad of luck.\n\nWhat I really wonder is why some people here play the game for 50 or more hours and then call it bad. If they didn't like the game they wouldn't have spent more than two days playing the game, so they're either lying or dumb. I agree that waiting to find a game can be annoying, but for me, and apparently for most other people here, the thrill of being hunted relentlessly is well worth the wait.\n\nFor me, the breaking point of recommending a game is if I have more than one hour of fun for each buck I spend.

The issues with both the meta and online connection have improved significantly. \n\nThere are still problems, however. Naturally in a PvP game, some killers will be much much stronger than others but it does feel like some killers seem to be steamrolling the meta and leaving some of my favorite killers in a rather poor state that makes them hard to have fun with.\n\nYou will meet toxic and frustrating players for both killers and survivors, especially at higher ranks. But overall the game is still tons of fun especially with friends.\n\nThe only grudge I have with the game is that there is truly no incentive to reach the higher ranks and the game is actually more fun at lower ranks unless you like to play very competitive and sweaty matches very often.\n\nPast that the game is fun, exciting, allows for a lot of replay, allows for different styles of play, and has many aspects of the game that you can always improve on if you choose to!","timestamp_created":1471495607,"timestamp_updated":1599560884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24986275","author":{"steamid":"76561198311765636","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":24032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3946,"last_played":1658507532},"language":"english","review":"Best game i have ever got in my whole life!\n","timestamp_created":1471495553,"timestamp_updated":1471495553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24986273","author":{"steamid":"76561197964754548","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9063,"last_played":1655757517},"language":"english","review":"Great game too spooky sometimes.

There's also tons of bugs in the game. I was hooked and I couldn't struggle because I kept teleporting all over the place and kept getting tossed around. Another bug is sometimes you will get stuck on something which just makes you an easy target for the killer, same with you being stuck in the \"Carry\" animation for when a killer picks you up. Running around like that just shows the killer where you are all the time and makes it so you can't hide. \n\nI could keep going on but what's the point?

I'm not a survival horror fan at all, but DbD it's fun, exhilarating, scary, and even funny at times. \nI like the game, I really do, it's not perfect, but it's been keeping me engaged since the day I bought it. Yes, it has bugs, yes I died countless times, more than the times I have survived. I basically suck, but I still play. The only issue I have is the players themselves. That doesn't bode well when it comes to a pvp game.\n\nI'll be honest, in the forums, everyone complains, rather loudly, about anything that you can imagine. The killers and survivors, both call each other out. Killers complain that survivors are OP and that they abuse infinites (if you buy, you'll find out soon enough what that is...) and survivors complain that killers are OP and camp all the time. Then there's those that complain about the developers not fixing bugs, and that the game itself is riddled with bugs. \n\nHonestly, if you're pretty chill and just care about having fun, you'll do just that, have fun. Just don't take everything to heart and if you can't stand all the salt thrown around, simply stay away from the forum and participate in discussions that are pretty tame or show that a degree of civility. \nSo far, I've not experience thanks-for-ruining-my-experience-I-will-never-play-this-again bugs. Yes, I've got stuck in certain parts of the map a couple of times, and got \"failed to join game\" countless times, my game even crashed once and people disconnect from the matches be it because things are not going as they planned or just internet issues. \n\nI can't speak for those who want to play the game with friends, but as a solo player, despite failing to join games several times, I can get into a lobby pretty quickly. \nThere's also the problem of killers dodging lobbies when they see a high rank survivor, but I hear that's being addressed. In my opinion, that's not the game's fault, people have to stop worrying about pips and ranks so much. \n\nI pretty much made the game sound terrible, but trust me, I think it's worth it. You'll find really good matches where the killer gives the survivors a good chase and where the survivors work as a team, save each other, and avoid the killer like the plague. In others, you might not get so lucky, but that's the point; you can't win them all. The maps are random and no match is the same as the other (unless everyone's farming for points, then you can just simply do what you have to do and leave as soon as possible). The killer is basically the one that sets the pace of the game, so survivors have to adapt to his/her playstyle if they want to survive. If you are fair and don't exploit certain mechanics, the game can be great and loads of fun for everyone playing, even if you’re not playing with your friends. \nIf you just want to whack people with butcher knives, chainsaws, weird makeshift skull weapons, trap them with bear traps, hang them on hooks as a sacrifice to your spider demon, or simply enjoy the thrill of terrorizing survivors, go for it and buy it. \n\nIf you want to fix generators, save people, run away from maniacs trying to kill you, successfully stun them with pallets from time to time, sneak around and think that the killer might be possibly blind for not seeing you there crouching there in the grass in front of him, also go for it and buy it. \nFor hardcore gamers, I might not have played the game that much, but I’m looking forward to spending more time in it. I believe that the game has some interesting concepts and that those $20 is a fair price. \n\nP.S: I you get easily upset and can’t stand losing, several times, I wouldn’t recommend this game to you. Play fair, don’t falsely accuse because you lost a game, and this’ll be a happier community. \n\n","timestamp_created":1471485279,"timestamp_updated":1471485279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24984440","author":{"steamid":"76561198110251947","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1625144058},"language":"hungarian","review":"Imádom!

BALANCE THE FUCKING MATCHMAKING. Played this game for all of 4 hours and grew to despise it. Why? Because there is some seriously stupid things that happen. Like getting placed with high level people that have large numbers of high level perks unlocked, and you dont even get to start with lube for your butthole.\n\n3.) BALANCE SPAWN LOCATIONS. First four games, literally the first four I played, I spawned right next to the monster and died.\n\nThese are just a few of the issues I have with this game, however, I dont care to even bother trying to play anymore and getting a more rounded feeling about the game. Entirely because it feels lazily put together, with no good documentation for people to read up to determine how the game works, and absolutely no way to work together as a team.\n\nI thought that I would enjoy it more if I played as the monster, but, alas, that too was wasted as I was once again beaten multiple times by VERY high level players. When I mean high level, I mean I'm starting as a lvl 1 monster going against three lvl 25+ and maybe 1 level >14 survivors. I lost all of those matches, but I still got points because the game is stupid.\n\nOne final thing, a lot of the controls/movements in the game are done to deliberatly make things harder. Which is an interesting idea in and of itself. However when implemented, it means that unless you beat your face against the brick wall for countless hours you will not have fun.\n\nThough this is all my experience playing solo, and I dont think any game like this should be only fun when played with a group of friends. I should be able to play on my own and have a good game, which I have only had on rare occasions ( x=>5 where x=games had fun in).\n\nMaybe when I have time I'll try to give it another chance, but so far I'm rather furious at this game and wouldn't recommend anyone buying it unless they have a group of friends they intend to only play it with.","timestamp_created":1471476574,"timestamp_updated":1471476574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473995685577392578","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24982728","author":{"steamid":"76561198119390814","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":61608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20120,"last_played":1538889246},"language":"english","review":"This game is quite fun.

I like the concept of the 4 v 1 game where you have to work together to survive. And yet I'm uninstalling it because of the matchmaking system.\n\nA game like this should be challenging, but not discouraging. This game is the latter and I feel impossible for latecomers to get into. If you don't already have 300 plus hours in this by now, you don't have much of a chance to get into it.\n\nIf I play survivor, I'm going up against either a killer who will sit and camp your body, or I have a selfish team who lead killers to me or let me die. Or both, both happen more often than not. And there isn't a punishment for letting a killer sit and stare you in the eye while you bleed out.\n\nIf I play killer, I'm going against survivors who have ten times my play time on record, and have unlocked all the overpowered perks and put them on their character. The fact you can teach the ability to heal, run fast and destroy hooks to one person, rather than letting each character grow into a speciality build, is what ruins the game. Teachable perks just should not exist. I get the point is to experiment with builds but everyone just chooses the same three perks as survivor and unless you're a killer with at least four perks, you don't have much of a chance. I don't want to camp your body, I want to hunt people down, and I can't because my hooks are gone, you heal behind an infinite wall and you've been playing far longer than me.\n\nMatchmaking should not be based on rank, it should be based on character level or number of hours a person has in a game. And expressing an opinion on this game gets you labelled salty. The community to this game is honestly, one of the worst I have ever experienced because both sides claim the other is overpowered. So I'm retiring this game because I'm tired of getting pissed off at both my teammates and the people I play against. I have better things to get hacked off at.\n\nI know there is a new update tomorrow but unless it's going to put me against other people with 40 hours in game so I have a chance, I'm not interested. I want to play this game, and I love the idea of it, and it is fun when it works, but the broken matchmaking system means I can't go against people of a similar level, and it's no fun going against people I don't have a chance with. I didn't dodge lobbies because I want to learn how to play well, but now I just don't want to play because it's always against a team I can't even hope to compete against.\n\nDevs, please listen to the community and fix matchmaking. We don't need new content, we need a fighting chance.","timestamp_created":1471464990,"timestamp_updated":1471464990,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536784708499908447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24979689","author":{"steamid":"76561198228047664","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10801,"last_played":1480343682},"language":"thai","review":"ชอบที่เกมสนุกเป็นทีมดี  สิ่งที่ไม่ชอบคือหลุดบ่อยเด้งบ่อย.","timestamp_created":1471463659,"timestamp_updated":1471463659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24979620","author":{"steamid":"76561198030147516","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2629,"last_played":1646068489},"language":"russian","review":"10 забитых  ♥♥♥♥  на тиммейтов из 10","timestamp_created":1471463347,"timestamp_updated":1471463749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479797959327697754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s5qDzdYCdIqlXw=="}
