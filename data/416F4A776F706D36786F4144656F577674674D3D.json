The balancing is nonexistent and for a \"good reason\" tho.\n\nIf you wanna play killer then good luck with the matchmaking, the game has been losing players ever since mikaela was added alongside of the MMR system, a small playerbase that is already split around regions will never have a healthy matchmaking unless you are ready to eat 15minutes Q times in exchange for a balanced match.\n\nFor survivors it is pretty much that way, long ass Q's because there are not enough killers around, and understandably so, because playing killer is garbage in this absolutely survivor sided game.\n\nThe game cannot be more balanced for killers, because if the busted perks gets touched enough by BHVR, that will upset the vast majority of the playerbase, because there are way too many survivor players. So that's a problem they have to deal with and killers are just expected to be way above the curve of the experienced survivors to have an even match.\n\nA single survivor can carry an entire match with the busted perks and a flashlight, but this only happens if the killer is inexperienced and doesn't know any better than never chase this player and bait the flashlight. Now imagine having two of these, or three, because remember, there are 4 survivors in a match. That's how the games will go after you pass certain threshold in their \"MMR system\" yours games will be all sweaty.\n\nRecently they did address the issues of MMR and did some tweaks to make the matches fair. But honestly? I have experienced worse matches overall. At the start around the 10~ hours of gameplay I'd find myself having 2 even matches and then a very sweat match with 4 escapes, then the loop will repeat. Since the changes were added it's been 3 absolutely out of my level matches followed by a match with total new players, and that cycle will repeat. Not a single match felt fair. So for me the only change they made was hide the ranks so you could not tell if the matchmaking fucked you in the ass because the red rank survivor was in the Q for 7 minutes and was thrown against the first killer they found in the region or you faced a very talented/good player in your level.\n","timestamp_created":1651690575,"timestamp_updated":1651690575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543526232242584229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114949390","author":{"steamid":"76561199097609900","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1333,"last_played":1652249702},"language":"russian","review":"да

If you are new and playing solo queue matches I almost guarantee you will be DONE with this game after a few matches. Unless you have friends to play with be prepared to be left on hook, left behind, etc.\n\n*\"Kills = skill\" AKA MMR: Currently the way the game works as a survivor: it doesn't matter what you do, how you play, etc. unless you ESCAPE. Soooo you might as well run spine chill, urban evasion, and other stealth perks and just hide in a corner until the rest of your team does all the work for you so you can get out.\n\n*Events: The last few events have been kind of uhhhh ehhhhhh. You get some cosmetics here and there, but they are ALWAYS for the same characters (Dwight, Claudette, David, and a couple others). I generally main Elodie and she has like ONE outfit that is actually stylish which is such a RIP. Mostly they just throw extra bloodpoints your way which is cool, but like also sort of who cares? You can get bloodpoints so easily by running certain perks, using offerings, etc. so getting them as an event perk is pretty much a joke.\n\nWith all that being said, clearly I still play this game after 1K + hours and all the stuff I mentioned before so clearly something in my brain keeps telling me to go back. Maybe I am just a masochist and that is why, but yeah overall I would recommend this game. Just be aware of the aforementioned before buying this game.","timestamp_created":1651673859,"timestamp_updated":1653417339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114937689","author":{"steamid":"76561198406106729","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":10744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9551,"last_played":1655250504},"language":"brazilian","review":"ESSE

When i tried to appeal the ban,INCLUDING PROVIDING THE EVIDENCE I HAVE OF THE HACK,the response was \"Your appeal was denied. Its youre account youre responsible for the security and what happens to it.\" Excuse the fuck out of me? So if BHVR gets hacked,or their discord,or whatever.....the response we get as consumers is \" Sorry about the inconvenience,we are working to fix it\" (Even if account information gets stolen from their end)....But as a consumer who PAID these pricks (for a buggy mess of a game,which just keeps getting worse)(although i do enjoy playing it just for giggles) if my information gets stolen its tough shit? What a great way to run a company. Be leery,as i now have a VAC ban tainting my profile. (after roughly 12 years of having a steam profile with ZERO issues btw.)","timestamp_created":1651655547,"timestamp_updated":1651655547,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114926946","author":{"steamid":"76561198248729914","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":49731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48824,"last_played":1658262627},"language":"english","review":"Terrorize people with Spirit Fury x Enduring or by doing gens in under 30 seconds.

Do you love SBMM? Do you love having killers that were once cool, only to be nerfed to death and be horrible because of cry baby meta survivors? Do you love....the idea....of strong immortal killers being weak and playing on survivors time? Then this game if for you! Now while DBD isnt terrible, it sure isnt as good or as fun. As when the game first came out. So as of right now this game is only fun, IF you play META and you know what you are doing. Regardless the game has 2 sides you can pick in this spooky pvp. One of them is being a survivor, as a survivor your main goal is to turn on 5 generators and escape by using any means necessary whether it be hiding, using Decisive Strike, Dead Harding, Boon Totems, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, but anything to avoid being \"hooked\" or dying. Now the other side you can play as is Killer. Now your main objective as killer is.....well to kill. No matter by what tactic you use, whether it be by camping, tunneling, or using Nurse and Spirit only. Your only job is to kill. Of course, each killer has a special ability or power that they can use to make chases easier, but at the end of the day you have to kill by moris or hooking. But remember...you are a killer, and as a killer you don't care about the rules you just want to kill heheheh. Although be prepared, because as a killer you must always endure toxic entitled survivors in chat after the matches, even if you do play fair Muwhahah. But I digress, in the end while the games not as fun as it used to be.
