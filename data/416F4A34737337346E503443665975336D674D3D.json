Toxic SWF will suck the soul out of you. SWF (Survive with friends) allows you to play with your friends communicating over discord. All good unless you queue up a 3 man SWF and start bullying the other survivor.\n\n* You want to play killer? Want to win? Have you juggled 4 brat kids? I never did. Now, thanks to DBD, I know how it will look like. Survivors have every perk to demolish a killer. Go look up \"Dead Hard\", \"Borrowed TIme\", \"Boon Totem\". You will do your best as a killer and still get toxic crap and tbagging at the exit gate. At the time of this review, only two killers have a chance against survivors. Even then, you have to sweat really hard. You think it can't get any worse. Add \"SWF\" to mix again. Good luck fighting against a team with telepathic communication over discord giving the killer's location.\n\nMost frustrating thing is the devs can fix this but won't. I regret buying the game so much, I want to discourage the poor souls who decide to buy this game.

Yeah you get about enough in one 10 minute match to get maybe one perk out of the hundreds.\n\nOH I almost forgot, you're not getting the perk, you're getting a nerfed version of the perk. To get the best possible version, you have to get that perk 3 FUCKING TIMES for each perk. So that's about 300 matches to get all the perks all at max level for one single character. For survivor this isn't so bad since every survivor plays the same, but when each killer has a unique power that is very different from each other killer's power and each killer has different perk progress it becomes glaringly obvious this game has probably GTA online levels of grind.  Times three. Times ten. I've been playing for about 1,500 hours (none of those hours I will ever get back by the way) and I've gotten 8 characters with all of the perks. There are currently 27 killers in this game. Let that sink in. One thousand. Five hundred hours. For 8 characters to have all of the perks on. I can play trapper all day but if I want to have any of those 6 bearable perks I mentioned on any other killer I have to grind for 300 more matches to get enough stupid bloodpoints to buy each of the 100+ perks 3 times. What a sick joke. \n\nOh and these mentally challenged devs wont change it. Because, you see, the one brain cell that they all collectively share is smart enough to know that if they remove the ungodly grind NOBODY will play their game because the gameplay is boring and rage inducing.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay while I still have room in this review. The gameplay for survivor is to sit and hold your mouse button and press spacebar every few seconds. Hardly a game if you ask me. When the killer comes around, you hold W and shift and occasionally press spacebar as well to drop pallets. Oh and then when you finally get caught by the killer, they sit and stare right at you so that whenever a teammate comes to save you they just instantly kill you and the teammate and you die faster. As for killer, you walk around till you find survivors, chase them for a few seconds and hook them. All the while the survivors complete 3 of the 5 gens they need to win. You don't want to be an asshole and camp the survivor you hooked so you walk away and let their teammates have a chance to save them, which they do and then they procede to all use the exact same 4 broken perks to absolutely dismantle you as they win and T-bag you while doing so.\n\nEvery other match is exactly like I just described to you. You're missing out on nothing. The game is repetitive. The game is unfun. The devs don't care or are too stupid to care. The grind is the worst in any game I've ever played.\n\n\"What do the devs do that's so stupid?\" you might be asking. Well, the basic stuff that all incompetent devs do like ignoring community suggested balance decisions in exchange for their own terrible solutions. But the thing that separates DBD devs from the rest of the crowd is the BUGS. DBD isn't the only game with bugs of course, but here's what makes DBD such a unique case of stupidity. Every single patch, and yes I do mean EVERY. SINGLE. PATCH. some new bug is introduced that breaks the game in some way. The fascinating thing about these bugs is the fact that they arE IN NO WAY RELATED TO THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING BALANCED/CHANGED/PATCHED. Most recently, the devs changed 2 of the killers and updated an old map called Haddonfield to be new looking. That's basically all that was changed. But somehow these absolute buffoons managed to break a completely separate map called Midwitch so badly it had to be turned off so that nobody could play on it while they try to fix it and they made one of the characters make no sound whatsoever for no apparent reason. Oh, and the counter that tells you how many hooks you have (which is one of the most important UI pieces for the survivors by the way) is displaying incorrect data. How the fuck did a developer team change absolutely none of these bugged things and still manage to bug them? How small and smooth does someone's brain have to be to do that?\n\nDon't even get me started on the game director who literally told frustrated players to just go play Civilization (good advice by the way, playing anything but this dumpster fire is smart) and the lead game designer who told players who make skillful plays that their contributions do not matter towards a win.\n\nOh yeah, also Dead By Daylight is like the only game in the entire world that doesn't have a definition of what winning or losing is. You literally have no idea, the game doesn't tell you. You can't easily decide because so much RNG plays into how well or badly you play. This game is just a clusterfuck.\n\nDon't believe me? Check out the charts for this game https://steamcharts.com/app/381210\nEver since its peak average player count in July 2021 it has lost players 8 of the 9 months following till now. Literally one month after it had its biggest player count growth ever of 13,000 new players in July 2021 it had its biggest player count LOSS ever of 11,000 players in August 2021. Seriously think about that. 13,000 players joined this game (just for the resident evil chapter by the way) and instantly 85% of them left because they realized this game is completely unbearable shit.\n\nFor the love of all that is holy; for the love of whatever god, hell whatever religious figure you follow; for the love of no religious figure at all if you dont follow one; PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not buy Dead By Daylight","timestamp_created":1641664190,"timestamp_updated":1651804801,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107607711","author":{"steamid":"76561199005461650","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":67603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1358,"playtime_at_review":44637,"last_played":1660435160},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite game to play but can't recommend this.\n\nover 5 years ago but nothing new, hundreds of perks but most of them are unusable.

game is very fun to play, but there are so many issues that I would not recommend it. The community is incredibly toxic and salty - not everyone, but playing killer means you will get bullied by survivors. And playing survivor means you need to use the 4 meta perks every game, if you want to win all the time. This game can be a lot of fun but be aware that everything from the maps, perks and gameplay is survivor sided. The devs love nerfing killers - which is very funny because the whole \"story\" of this game is 4 people trying to escape from a bada** and scary killer...yeah, thats not the case. If you play killer you are the one afraid of the survivors and what they can do to you. There is also a huge problem with cheaters and hit registration in the game - reporting cheaters in game does nothing at all. Hit registration has not been fixed for months, if not years - you hit a survivor as a killer and you know you hit them, because your screen gets splashed with blood and you hear the survivor scream - but the game disagrees and the survivor runs away.

Il gioco in sé è divertente, soprattutto con gli amici, le dinamiche delle partite raramente annoiano e la difficoltà è abbordabile per i neofiti e allo stesso tempo aperta a sviluppi più complessi per i player più avanzati. Purtroppo un mix di meccaniche interne e cambiamenti degli sviluppatori hanno, per quanto mi riguarda, peggiorato l'esperienza. L'introduzione del matchmaking basato sull'MMR ha accentuato a livelli quasi insopportabili quei conportamenti \"sweaty\", sia dalla parte del killer che dei survivor, che prima erano, in certa misura, occasionali e ha notevolmente aumentato l'influenza del META (è rarissimo trovare una lobby senza survivor che usino Dead Hard/Decisive Strike/Borrowed Time, o killer senza Ruin). Inoltre la successione delle partite è diventata molto simile al tanto odiato \"script\" alla Clash Royale: se si vincono 2/3 partite consecutive (surv o killer che sia), alla prossima si è praticamente certi di trovarsi contro qualcuno di molto più forte di noi che inevitabilmente farà abbassare l'MMR. La scalata dei rank è quindi considerevolmente rallentata.\nIl sistema dei perk può essere confusionale per i nuovi giocatori (il gioco conta ad oggi un totale di 191 perk unici), ma una volta che si capisce dove tira il vento ci si accorge che un buon 80% di questi non verrà mai usato, o perché offre dei vantaggi peggiori degli altri, o perché semplicamente sono troppo esotici/occasionali.\nIl meccanismo del negozio è invece da apprezzare perché privo di lootbox o casualità del genere: se un oggetto ti piace, ti farmi i crediti di gioco e te lo compri (o se si tratta di contenuti con licenza, sborsi, per ovvi motivi). Niente pay to win, il \"pass\" è puramente di oggetti cosmetici o crediti.\nIn conclusione, penso che oltre alle varie problematiche comuni quali cheaters/bug (di cui non ho ancora fortunatamente fatto esperienza), il difetto principale di DbD è la frustrazione che l'evolversi dei META porta (il quale in questo momento sta trascinando il gioco ad essere estremamente survivor-sided per via dei vari boon totem e dei boost delle cure).\n7/10","timestamp_created":1641652102,"timestamp_updated":1641652102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602329790592193604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107595180","author":{"steamid":"76561198981800551","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1642360701},"language":"polish","review":"jd","timestamp_created":1641652058,"timestamp_updated":1641652058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107594619","author":{"steamid":"76561198866200886","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":14440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":141,"playtime_at_review":7022,"last_played":1660485590},"language":"german","review":"wallah gud","timestamp_created":1641651515,"timestamp_updated":1641651515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107594271","author":{"steamid":"76561198963774834","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":416,"playtime_at_review":4114,"last_played":1659920200},"language":"spanish","review":"fun lol\n","timestamp_created":1641651156,"timestamp_updated":1641651156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107594199","author":{"steamid":"76561198079487623","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":122156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3979,"playtime_at_review":84625,"last_played":1660601972},"language":"english","review":"never again","timestamp_created":1641651070,"timestamp_updated":1641651070,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532128989696502686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107594088","author":{"steamid":"76561198875810877","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6017,"last_played":1659222542},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1641650965,"timestamp_updated":1641650965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107593677","author":{"steamid":"76561198153804986","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":113257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":83,"playtime_at_review":96881,"last_played":1660584739},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo, lo juego desde  prácticamente su salida; ha evolucionado un montón.

Both killer and survivor have been a blast.\n\n- The new update kind of killed it for me. I'll admit I'm a survivor main, I've accumulated most of my hours on that side, and it's been filled with fun chases, cool people and unique builds to keep the game from getting stale. At this point though, it's just aggravating. Maybe I need a break from it in general and it's not the update, but the update was enough for me to follow through with uninstalling for a while.\n\nI can see where both sides are coming from usually, but this update literally crushed solo Q survivors, so if people were bitching about SWF's before, your only real chance at surviving now is with one. Out of everything they added to this update, where the hell is something to let you know what your team is doing when you're alone? They ran into this update with purely killer in mind, which again, I understand. Often I found myself getting irritated and bullied as killer, and it didn't feel great at all, which translated over into how I played survivor - trying to win but not make the killer feel 'bullied'.\n\n- Killer mains will sit there and declare that the rework of DH and DS was needed, but I've played enough killer. Sure, DH for distance was annoying as hell. But once they used DH, I just stuck to chase and got them down while they were exhausted. Sure it extended a chase, but that's part of the fun IMO. The DS nerf was unnecessary. I get removing it's activity once gates are opened, but the nerf 5s to 3s means that survivors get barely any distance from a tunneling killer. It just pauses a chase for a few seconds at this point. This coming from someone who rarely ran DS unless it was a night consisting of one tunneling killer after another, and someone who also never ran DH. I've always stayed loyal to lithe and head-on, sometimes even balanced landing. \n\n- I've played a handful of games since the launch of this update WITH a swf and we just can't win. Killers won't chase a strong looper and pick off all weak links, which makes sense, but being tunneled out for not being the best or strongest can be disheartening, especially to new players. The only game I've won on survivor is against an AFK doctor. Real fun. Real rewarding. \n\n- Which also brings me to other survivors. What the hell is going on? Every match I've played I've had survivors come by where I'm working on a gen and throw a pallet, or make some loud noise so the killer knows where I am while they take off into the night. So, on top of salty killer mains, I have to deal with other salty survivor mains? If people were actually willing to work together and not hide, bring the killer to you while you're on death hook and they haven't even taken a down, maybe survivor side would feel a little better. But with both sides feeling entitled and being massive toxic cry babies, the game just feels unrewarding, unenjoyable and overall irritating to play.","timestamp_created":1641648649,"timestamp_updated":1658432752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ss74nP4CfYu3mgM="}
