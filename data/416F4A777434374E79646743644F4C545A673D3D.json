Questo ovvìamente se si impersona un \"fuggitivo\", cosa diversa invece, per quanto riguarda la figura del killer che darà ovviamente del filo da torcere ai sopravvissuti al fine di evitare la loro fuga dal livello.\nIl tutto fila liscio molto bene e le partite sono molto divertenti, se non per alcuni nei che a volte minano l'esperienza di gioco:\n1- killer (qualcuno ha parlato di Michael Myers?) troppo OP se raggiunto il 3* livello di \"furia\"\n2- bug relativi la compenetrazione del personaggio con l'ambiente e soprattutto coi pallet adibiti alla fuga, che spesso portano il sopravvissuto a trovarsi dalla parte sbagliata mentre tenta il driblaggio ai danni del Killer\n3- bug del killer usato dalla Cpu, che spesso lo si ritrova in Afk  per tutto il match, minando tanto la suspense e l'atmosfera del gioco\n4- infine, il problemino della fuga dal killer in cui, anche superato un ostacolo, questo colpisce e affonda il colpo sul sopravvissuto.\nPer il resto il gioco è da provare, magari non ancora a prezzo pieno. Ricorda un pò il gioco Dead Realm per alcune meccaniche.\n\n\nVoto personale: 7.5/10","timestamp_created":1479945414,"timestamp_updated":1479945414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26952053","author":{"steamid":"76561198027399645","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2007,"last_played":1647421766},"language":"english","review":"Most fun experience I've had on a multiplayer game in a while.

Its got a community akin to league. It's got the biggest player base of all current asymmetrical horror games.\n\nAlso bugs tend to come and go, and any veteran can give you a history of the funny ones.\n\n\nLong opinion:\n\nReturning to the game after about a year hiatus, I have a couple of things to say on my return (for those who care i play solo-que survivor and killer about 30/50% each respectively, with the remaining 20% being swf)\n\nFirstly, as it stands, this is your only option for a decent horror multiplayer asymmetrical game. Other's like Friday the 13th, tend to flop, or others are small party games for friends. Last year might prove some decent competition, but reflecting on its discord release, its not likely. (Also important to mention, Identity V is also a nice similar game with a mobile and pc version)\n\nThe game's come a long way in balance. From what used to be a HEAVILY survivor sided game now is quite a bit more balanced, but saying killer's are op is too broad of a statement. It's better to look at killers on an individual basement. It does go to mention however, that most new killer perks are not clearly thought about if used on other killers, which has on many occasions caused broken load-outs. Most infinites are gone, there's 1/4 as many pallets on the map then before, and most broken survivor perks are either gone, or have a decent anti-perk that's worth running on killer.\n\nI do think some options on killer, specifically anything on nurse, can be borderline unfair to play against. I'm aware of the argument of you just have to learn to out play her but from a killer who was invented to prevent infinites, she's dated and frankly, a good nurse will almost always win.\n\nIn addition, survivors have around 5-10 good perks, another 10 decent ones, then the rest are either super situational, or just bad past your first 30 hours in the game. It feels frustrating how trying to mix-up your play-style on survivor just leads to a more difficult and frustrating time, as more gimicky play-styles get pushed out. Stealth perks require several to be equipped to be able to combat some detection but with situational requirements or limited use, and then leave you weak in other regards, as well as requires you to buy 5 dlc's, or wait weeks for the shrine to give you what you need. Killers like nurse, who's weakness was stealth, can be fixed by slapping on bbq, or some other gen monitoring perk. Also, no survivor is unique, and once you reach a certain point they are just glorified skins, with most females being shorter models, being the better option.\n\nKiller feels great, as in killers who have counter-play feel great once you play for longer amounts of time. Something about playing killers that basically boil down to spending about 5-20 (or more depending on your pacing) hours learning how to use their ability, such as spirit and nurse, to then only be able to be able to be countered if you're using your base kit, gets boring fairly quick. When there's little struggle, the rewards starts to feel unearned. Other killers, such as trapper, hag, pig, and huntress, will always have a weakness no matter what you put on them.\n\nBloodlust, still exists. When it was implemented it was understandable, there were a massive amount of loops that the survivor could just keep away from the killer for all time, and run them around the entire match. But now with all the map tweaks, there's 1-2 locations where bloodlust might be necessary. All it does now, is remove the ability for a survivor to outplay a killer. It's very simple to just wait around a medium sized loop, avoiding breaking a pallet, to just gain speed until the survivor has little to no options on what to do against you. There's already plenty of unsafe pallets as is, and you can't counter bloodlust without walls or not running away. While it does take time to build bloodlust, its marginally shorter of a time waster then then the survivor making it to a another place to run you around since they pulled off a juke.\n\nThe game sucks for solo que survivor. Much alike how swf groups are a pain for killers, the same goes for solo survivors. Balance tends to be more focused on dealing with a 4-man group. So things like noed, or blindness, are fairly weak against a 4 man. When you're solo with no communication, a perk like noed can alone end a match you were winning. Its not a simple fix to separate ques for a killer to opt in and out of going against swf, but if they made the option to, solo survivors should have the ability to win exclusive cosmetics, and killers who opt into swf the same. It would keep ques alive for swf, while not hindering killers who want to rank up, and survivors who wish to play solo. These opt-in modes would have a separate ranking, but upon certain thresholds, yield cosmetic rewards that would be all the worthwhile.\n\nThe game varies from states of being a buggy mess, to being semi-decent at normally operating. You will have games where a bug fucks you over. Other games it'll be funny. However, game-play bugs should take priority in fixing. I don't know how to code so I can't say it's easy, but there should be more quality assurance before full releases are made, and they can very well afford it.\n\nAs it stands tho, if you're survivor and want to have a good time, play with friends. If you're killer, I ask you, if you were on the receiving end of what you were doing, would you enjoy yourself? Though that statement is subject to bias, as I play trapper and despise nurse.","timestamp_created":1479944412,"timestamp_updated":1576579373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26946714","author":{"steamid":"76561198108562053","num_games_owned":678,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":80679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1003,"playtime_at_review":21053,"last_played":1660540300},"language":"english","review":"This game is hands down, one of my favorite games that stays fresh with the updates.

Я купил эту игру в июне этого года, когда крюки давали по тысяче очков и не оповещали маньяка, когда не были заколочены окна на втором этаже здания карты МакМиллана, когда на комбайне можно было бесконечно троллить маньяка (чем я редко занимался) и \"Найти выход\" еще был переведен как \"Найти выйти\". Нерфы конечно полностью оправданные, но немножко просыпается ностальгия. Впрочем, достаточно воспоминаний, приступим к описанию аспектов самой игры: Вы спавнитесь с остальными тремя вашими тиммейтами, или по совместимости друзьями, и идете [strike]сразу лутаться в подвал[/strike] чинить генераторы. Всего в игре их надо починить пять, дабы открыть ворота и сбежать. Так же сбежать может через трапдор один последний выживший (или все, если был взят с собой ключ). Может и даже случиться так, что во время починки генера вас увидит маньяк, положит и понесет на крюк. Что же делать? У маньяка хватка и вы не успеваете сбежать. Но вы верите всей душой, что ваши товарищи придут на помощь. На момент написания обзора альтруистов в игре малова - то. Всему же причина - кемперство. Кемперство - это когда маньяк стоит рядом с вами и ни на что не отвлекаясь [strike]рассматривает прыщи на вашем лице[/strike] вас охраняет, пока вы не умрете. Даже сейчас случаются ситуации, когда маньяк уходит на другой конец карты, а ваши тиммейты боятся даже близко к вам подойти. И это происходит не только на низких рангах, но и на высших. Естественно такое происходит не всегда. Бывает и так, что вся ваша тима сразу после вашего повешения бежит вам на помощь, еще и в подвал. Кстати о маньяках, в игре их на данный момент пять: Траппер, ХиллБилль, Колокольчик, Медсестра и Майкл Майерс в длц. На данный момент бомбежку вызывает именно последний. В день выхода медсестры кто - то может сказать, так же говорили мол, имба, но нашли же как контрить. Да, Медсестру нашли как контрить, нужно отбегать\\прятаться во время ее блинка, ибо после него она оглушена. У Майкла Майерса подобной же слабости - банально нет. Это еще более стелсовый колокольчик, только со встроеным НОЕДом. Его определенно позже серьезно пофиксят, как пофиксили медсестру, но все же. Ну, вот пожалуй и все что я хотел сказать. В целом игра [b]не плоха, даже для своего жанра оригинальна, но определенно нуждается в доработке. 7 бесконечных НОЕДов при выходе игры из 10.","timestamp_created":1479938492,"timestamp_updated":1479938492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26910244","author":{"steamid":"76561198202910514","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":54768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22321,"last_played":1641771129},"language":"spanish","review":"uno de los mejores juegos que he visto este año vale la pena la inversion a este juego tan genial.\nme encantaria ver en un futuro a Freddy Krueger.","timestamp_created":1479938438,"timestamp_updated":1479938438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt47NydgCdOLTZg=="}
