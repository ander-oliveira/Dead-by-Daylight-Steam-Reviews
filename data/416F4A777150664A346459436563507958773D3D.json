Gerade in einer Gruppe mit Teamspeak macht dieses Spiel Spaß. \n\nEin großes Manko jedoch ist das Matchmaking. Nicht selten sitzt man da und wartet 10+ Minuten um eine Lobby zu finden. Hierbei besteht auf jeden Fall noch Nachbesserungsbedarf. Die Spielmechanik ust durchgehend als schön zu bezeichnen. Selten hat ein Spiel mich vom Bedrohungspunkt aus so gefesselt. Das Setting ist düster und die Musik drückend. \n\nDie speziellen, freizuspielenden Fähigkeiten der einzelnen Killer und Überlebenden halten die einzelnen Spiele zwar auf Augenhöhe zueinander, jedoch gibt es keine Unterschiede im Level beim Matchmaking. So kann es sein, das ein unfahrener Killer auf eine Meute bestens gerüsteter Überlebender trifft oder anders herum. Hierbei kann es durchaus zu Frust kommen. \n\nAlles in allem ist Dead by Daylight jedoch ein rundes, solides Multiplayer-Spiel, welches gerade mit Freunden seine volle Pracht entfaltet.","timestamp_created":1472221953,"timestamp_updated":1472221953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25162657","author":{"steamid":"76561198110412754","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":13622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":103,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1660373324},"language":"thai","review":"ทดลองเล่นแล้วสนุกดีครับ","timestamp_created":1472221871,"timestamp_updated":1472221871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25162636","author":{"steamid":"76561198313421153","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":345876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":113769,"last_played":1659602791},"language":"russian","review":"На один раз","timestamp_created":1472221806,"timestamp_updated":1641280366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473860710859298706","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25162607","author":{"steamid":"76561198244656034","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":33699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2000,"last_played":1584645684},"language":"english","review":"So cool","timestamp_created":1472221668,"timestamp_updated":1472221668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487341791391372681","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25162391","author":{"steamid":"76561198150586576","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1495311634},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est un très bon jeu.

Don't get me wrong, the game is very fun but the fact that there are known game breaking bugs/glitches running around in this game tell me that the devs don't care much for the game. Recently, people have complained about killers being able to see ranks, so they heard us out and removed that. The twist was that they removed it for survivors as well, which is stupid. Now I have to confirm everytime with my friends if they're in the same game as me. They also haven't thought about putting a queue in when you click \"find match\". It's frustrating to sit through 30 minutes of waiting to play a 10 minute round.\n2 Comments\t Subscr","timestamp_created":1472204120,"timestamp_updated":1505440318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499459147453308105","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25158141","author":{"steamid":"76561197969855189","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":205888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4769,"playtime_at_review":9242,"last_played":1660593166},"language":"swedish","review":"COol game","timestamp_created":1472203024,"timestamp_updated":1472203024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421409100294113159","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25157869","author":{"steamid":"76561198326471681","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1472201411},"language":"english","review":"terrible in general\n","timestamp_created":1472201463,"timestamp_updated":1472201463,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521680235862731934","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25157663","author":{"steamid":"76561198079257281","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":47033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":98,"playtime_at_review":24608,"last_played":1659991545},"language":"english","review":"I have played this game since it's release and all this time the developer team has been making tons of new QUALITY content.

TL;DR at bottom.\n\nDead By Daylight is a unique game that fits the 4v1 asymmetrical genre similar to Evolve and Depth. I've been on the fence about this game for months debating whether or not to buy it and this past weekend I found my opportunity to give it a whirl for free and make my final judgement for myself; no reviews, no other opinions, just mine.\nI'm glad I took that opportunity because I had decided to make the purchase. $20 for a game isn't terrible by any means but my experience and fondness for the game has since diminished a fair amount since my transaction.\n\nAs someone who enjoys being a \"One Man Army\" I decided to play as the Killer, more specifically the Wraith since stealth is something I really enjoy. I played a few matches against truly uncoordinated teams and I had a blast tearing them to shreds; there's no fun like feeling you're in complete control over your opponents. Eventually though I did run into some glaring issues that I will later discuss but for now let's focus on the positives. After my time as the Wraith I had swapped to the survivor side and I've been playing it since then for what is likely my past 20+ hours.\nHaving to coordinate with your team the best you can and avoid the Killer is some of the most stressfull and pure infuriating experiences I've had with a game in a long time but the stress of being chased is either followed by the high of knowing you got away or the crushing disappointment of being caught and hung. This is where the game excels the most.\n\nHowever after my 30 overall hours as of writing this review the seams in the final product appear to wear down and show the not so pleasant insides of the game itself. Jumping back in my story, as the Killer and later as the Survivors I had come to the realization that the Killer has no control at all over the pace of the match, the Survivors are in complete control; the game is one giant Cat and Mouse. The mice run around repairing generators until they can escape while avoiding the hunt the Cat is on. Against a poor team it will be exceptionally easy to crush and have fun but against a good team you need the right perks to beat them otherwise it's simply impossible; this is because of how piss poor the matchmaking system is.\n\nI don't think I've ever played a game with a worse matchmaking system in place than Dead By Daylight, if you start a queue and no match is found it doesn't auto-queue it waits for you to \"Ready Up\" again. This leads to infuriating moments where I'm trying to find a match but every time I Alt+Tab I am forced to go right back to keep the search going. On top of that sometimes the game will just back out of the lobby for no reason or go into a loading screen only to go back to the main menu and sometimes it will even begin the match only to immediately end it for no apparent reason, eating up whatever \"Offerings\" you have put in place for that match.\n\nThere's a very basic party system, you can invite friends to the party or a private game to hunt them yourself but because the matchmaking system is so shitty it's nigh impossible to find a game with friends! Additionally my friends have had multiple crashes although I've had none and once you crash your character dies and there's no way to reinvite them back.\n\nOverall if I had to give \"Dead By Daylight\" a solid numbered rating I'd give it a mediocre 6 out of 10.\nIt's by no means a bad game and has a lot of potential to expand however by not labeling itself as an \"Early Access\" title is a mistake, animations are buggy and don't sync up correctly, sometimes the map doesn't even spawn, the matchmaking pairs you up with Rank 1 survivors at level 40 that have every perk imaginable when you're killer; etc.\nThe game has a lot to improve upon but it's by no means a bad game.

The way it's set up now, when a killer decides to look for a game, a lobby is created for them and the any group of survivors that start looking for a killer *after* the killer's lobby was created has a chance of getting into that lobby. If they dont get into that lobby the survivors are booted back to their pre-lobby and forced to ready up and start searching again.\nThe more people in your survivor group the harder it is to get into a killer's lobby, since someone playing survivor solo can be put into an empty killer's lobby, thus removing them from the list of available killers for a 4 person group. \nResulting in the survivors having to press \"Ready\" and search for matches many, many, many times before getting lucky enough to get into a killer's lobby as soon as it's created.\n\nOnce the survivors ready up they should be put into a queue where other survivors are matched to them until there are 4. Then the 4 person group is placed into a queue where any killers that want to play are matched to the 4 person group at the top of the queue.\n\nThat way no one has to constantly click \"Ready\" and players will be efficiently matched.\n\nOther than the Survive with Friends matchmaking, everything is GREAT, love this game and will continue to play it.

Lighting/sound/level design is fantastic.\n*Good game length of ~10min average; 25min tops (but that's an EPIC game).\n*Neat economy; keep items you loot from the entity realm, must survive to keep what you bring in from lobby.\n*Very high skill ceiling.\n\nCONS:\n*Bugs. Lots of them. Get stuck in random places, teleport due to lag, spend the match floating above the ground as if being carried, etc. (In fairness, that last one is pretty funny and doesn't impact gameplay).\n*Queuing/matchmaking. ~5min queue time for killer on average. Much slower queue time for higher ranks. Lobby dodging nonsense over rankings (recent patch helped by hiding rank until post-game screen). Survive with friends used to take ritualistic goat sacrifice/virgin into volcano level depth of dedication to use for 3+ players (no match after 30min+ of retries on one memorable occasion).
