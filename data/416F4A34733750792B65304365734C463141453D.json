Most of the killers perks give away your location with ease making hiding even more difficult and those with invisible or threat reduction radius options leave almost no time to react. There is also a huge problem in high ranks with camping and tunneling which leaves most new players a few games before they all but give up, especially when a killer de-ranks and shows up with pink level items and a full tier 3 perk load out. as well as this this in-balance creates such a toxic community that no one sees eye to eye.

Очень глючная заставка при входе в игру. А так же физика набора очков очень подозрительная. Если ты потеешь на максимум и выполнил 3/4 заданий, то тебя не повысят. Надо чтобы все 4 задания были в нормальном прогрессе. Что я имею ввиду? Если ты очень скиловый и можешь отвелечь маньяка на всю игру и твоя команда не потеряет ничего, то только ты проиграешь. Или если ты всю игру чинил генератор и ты все равно проиграешь, даже если выйдешь живым. \n В игре есть один плюс, это фан. Ты можешь фаниться, но до того времени, пока тебе не начнут кидать репорты.

The game is stacked against you.\n\nOVERALL:\nMetrics demonstrate a consistent 2 survivors to every killer. You need 4 survivors for a game. Sometimes you see 3:1, but NEVER the inverse. Always, too many people want to play killer.\nOver time the devs have consistently removed or nerfed the aspects that allow survivors to survive (vaults, pallets etc.), while buffing killers (bloodlust, more one-shot/instant find mechanics, end game hatch). Survivor mains did one of 2 things since release. Left the game or migrated to playing killer. The only survivor mains left are ‘new’ survivors who have no perspective or my favourite; killer mains that ‘play both sides equally’ -.-\nThe game is biased in favor of killers and the metrics show it. No ones wants to play on the ‘losing’ side as a result. This is human nature. \n\nNEW TO SURVIVOR:\nYou will get farmed. FULL STOP. Insidious (killer perk) ACTIVELY encourages camping. The counter to this? Don’t rescue, do generators and leave.... Boring mechanic that is designed for trolls with smurf accounts at low level rank play. BBQ and chill (killer perk) will let killers insta find you. Until you learn how to counter these types of perks, you’ll get farmed...... ALOT. It’s not uncommon to be used as a place holder in lobbies too, by the devs. As a survivor, if you’re in a long queue.... Leave and rejoin, chances are you’ll get into an instant game. Hex Ruin (killer perk) takes the single most boring aspect of the game for survivors ‘generators’ and makes them more boring, ab noxious and RNG based. Every high level killer runs this perk. High rank play depends on the killer keeping games ‘sporting’. If the killer proximity camps and tunnels you, there’s not a lot you can do. Your game will finish quickly with a minimal score.\n\nNEW TO KILLER:\nSo all this means its easy for new killers? No. Because of the metrics I mentioned, they don’t need more killers. If you’re a new killer, you will be placed in games with at least medium ranked survivors will full perks because 1) its biased against survivors so less survivors playing and 2) metrics show more than 50% of survivors die each game so they want to decrease those %. So as a new killer, they will let you get farmed by medium rank survivors to shift their metrics and try to get you to go back to survivor play where they need you. They in essence, try to force you into survivor play. Why has it come to this?\n\nFUTURE OF THE GAME:\nAs mentioned, since release, killer has been buffed, survivor nerfed. This is important to understand because in the following example you will be given an impression of why the direction of this game will struggle for survivors.\n\nAt release ALL the killers complained about ‘sprint burst’ (survivor perk) so this received multiple nerfs, to a point where its not even relevant anymore. Compare that to NOED (No one escapes death, killer perk) that survivors have complained about since release. A few changes over time but ultimately a strong perk, that killers still use and in addition even more ‘one-shot’ perks have been added to the game since for killers.\n\nWhat has this created? In short. Entitlement. Killer mains know if they whine, they get what they want. All promotion/advertising is based around killers. Each killer is unique, with unique perks and play style. Survivors are different skins with same play style. Survivors existence is to be farmed by killers and the devs have embodied that mentality.\n\nDBD forums/reddit, go to these places and read. It’s all about poking fun at survivors and giving you the impression that every second game is SWF (Survive with friends) and heavily biased against killers. This is a lie. OP SWF games are maybe one in 30 games with most swf games being friends who are just wanting to have fun and usually end up wiping. \n\nIn the recent PTB, devs wanted to address Nurse (killer). Nurse can hard counter any plays a survivor makes and has been fundamentally broken since release. A good nurse will kill everyone and is not fun to play against (imagine standing in an open field, running in a straight line). The result of the beta? Nurse mains whining, post after post about how Nurse shouldn’t be nerfed and its not fair to nerf it.\n\nTHIS is the environment the devs have created and the future doesn’t look good for survivor.\n\nOnly play this game if you want to play killer who initially gets farmed by survivors but ultimately is a point generating machine.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nDisconnecting.... Has become prominent in this game as a survivor and the reality is, you can’t blame them. Once you know that a killer is a camper and a tunneler there is absolutely no point to stay in a game like that. Your not going to get unhooks, your point generation is going to be low and if your the first hooked, 100% your going to have a quick miserable game. The devs have done NOTHING to incentivise survivors staying in a game like that. Rank means nothing.","timestamp_created":1571831694,"timestamp_updated":1571836568,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478487133979797363","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55729360","author":{"steamid":"76561198302159795","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":42303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14903,"last_played":1651950340},"language":"thai","review":"เกมหน้าหี","timestamp_created":1571830362,"timestamp_updated":1571830362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55729224","author":{"steamid":"76561198453068482","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":128121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":887,"playtime_at_review":1183,"last_played":1660415417},"language":"schinese","review":"————2000+小时了，目前版本6.0.1\n\n

english is my second lenguage sorry for this... im tired and use the power of the migthy google fu for this <3\n\n\nfor some this t¿is true for others is lies... the developers put a lot of effort into this game, as I have always said, every game always has errors and more when it is an online game where different computers of different ranges are used, maybe a small error of the user's internet caused the error we saw but they blame the developers, a character may be the best in the hands of an average player but this character is rubbish for an experienced or novice player \"the developers don't know what they are doing\" is what people say....\n\nI know we all compete to win but losing should not be the reason to ruin the experience of others, toxicity is inevitable in any game of this type and I can understand but there is no reason to say \"You suck for not catching me\" it's easy to make fun and also say \"you suck because you caught me\" it's easy to throw trash because someone is better or lucky, it's never okay to say it's just a game but treating others humanely is always recommended\n\nNow, the important thing, the game ...\n\nIt is a unique and very good game, I enjoy meeting newbies and trying to give them an experience, not mock and kill them quickly saying \"you are so bad you shouldn't play\" we were all newbies someday ...\n\nback to the topic ... it's good, each assassin with his unique abilities and there are a variety of ways to play\n\nunfortunately the survivors are... the only thing that is different is the initial kit of perks but in the end they are all the same, I would like them to have something unique each\n\nI would ask the developers that the private games with friends have more things to customize, that two are murderers and three are the survivors, something interesting, something that gives people reason to play with friends in groups of 5, fot those who don't like to play against random people and want to play with friends but it is repetitive after a while, something like this would make a big change to the game plus I think many streamers and I would like it :)\n\n\n\n'''''ESPAÑOL''''\n\naunque no lo parezca a algunos, los desarrolladores le ponen empeño a este juego, como siempre eh dicho, todo juego siempre tiene errores y mas cuando se trata de un juego en linea donde diferentes computadoras de diversas gamas son usadas, puede que un pequeño error de conexion del internet del usuario causo el error que vimos pero culpan a los desarrolladores, puede que un personaje sea el mejor en las manos de un jugador medio pero este personaje sea basura para un jugador experimentado o novato.\n\nse que todos competimos para ganar pero estar perdiendo no deberia ser la razon para arruinar la experiencia de otros, la toxicidad es inevitable en cualquier juego de este tipo y puedo llegar a entender pero no es razon para poner se en plan de \"tu apestas por no atraparme\" es facil burlarse y tambien \"tu apestas porque me atrapaste\" es facil molestarce porque alguien es mejor, nunca esta bien decir que solo es un juego pero tratar a los demas humanamente siempre es recomendable\n\nahora, lo importante, el juego....\n\nes un juego unico y muy bueno, yo disfruto encontrarme con novatos y tratar de darles una experiencia, no burlarme y matarlos rapido diciendo \"eres tan malo que no deberias jugar\" todos fuimos novatos algun dia...\n\nregresando al tema... es bueno, cada asesino con sus unicas a habilidades y hay variedad de formas de jugar\n\nlamentablemente los sobrevivientes lo unico que tienen de diferente es el kit o equipo inicial pero al final todos son iguales, me gustaria que tuvieran algo unico cada uno\n\nle pediria a los desarrolladores que las partidas privadas con amigos tuvieran mas cosas para personalizarlas, que dos ssean asesinos y tres sean los sobrevivientes, algo interesante, algo que le de a la gente en jugar con amigos en grupos de 5, aquienes no les gusta jugar contra gente aleatoria y quiere jugar con amigos pero es repetitivo despues de un tiempo, algo asi le daria un gran cambio al juego ademas que creo que le gustaria a muchos streamers y a mi :)","timestamp_created":1571815436,"timestamp_updated":1585823258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55727156","author":{"steamid":"76561198135341417","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":56332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25344,"last_played":1656446633},"language":"russian","review":"Игра

Treat lightly; finding this part is one of the hardest things I've done and how I fear what I lost in the process.\n\nPlease give me the strength to never come back to this.","timestamp_created":1571775779,"timestamp_updated":1637629266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55721492","author":{"steamid":"76561198913775771","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":195044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89251,"last_played":1626225811},"language":"english","review":"I like this game a lot hope they keep going with it for along time.","timestamp_created":1571773964,"timestamp_updated":1571773964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55721456","author":{"steamid":"76561198882750193","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1589222076},"language":"russian","review":"НОРМ","timestamp_created":1571773774,"timestamp_updated":1571773774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540039718151092529","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55721262","author":{"steamid":"76561198310589806","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1622275996},"language":"russian","review":"Игра круть всем советую","timestamp_created":1571772968,"timestamp_updated":1571772968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494545429944992065","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55721014","author":{"steamid":"76561198889272034","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":35223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12371,"last_played":1639819765},"language":"russian","review":"Разрабы пасиба за игру , ТАК OХУЕНO КOГДА МАН ЗА 5 ЕБУЧИХ МЕТРОВ ДОСТАЁТ ДО МЕНЯ , МНЕ ОЧЕНЬ СИЛЬНА НРАВИТСЯ ТАКОЕ ДЕРЬМИЩЕ , ПРOДOЛЖАЙТЕ ТАКЖЕ СТАРАТbСЯ , жду компенсацию в размере 25000 золотых клеток\nwaiting for compensation in the amount of 25,000 auric cells","timestamp_created":1571771848,"timestamp_updated":1605508821,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55720389","author":{"steamid":"76561198139840007","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":181765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5103,"playtime_at_review":59207,"last_played":1660604540},"language":"english","review":"Good game, needs some optimization but the content the developers put out keeps the game feel fresh and new every update. prepare your wallet if you want all the characters though.","timestamp_created":1571768785,"timestamp_updated":1571768785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719602","author":{"steamid":"76561198992874075","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":284,"playtime_at_review":2410,"last_played":1660585340},"language":"schinese","review":"一个这样的垃圾游戏居然会值得让人推崇，简直荒天下之大谬。\n不断出现有人掉线的情况，从根本上对于人类就是不公平的。最关键的就是这种BUG居然没修好也就敢拿上来卖。\n我头一次见到作为游戏开发商居然可以不负责任到这个地步，简直就是恬不知耻！\n垃圾一样的白痴制作商，这种垃圾游戏公司有资格开商城卖衣服？连自己的BUG都不管不问。\n去你妈的一群垃圾弱智。","timestamp_created":1571765126,"timestamp_updated":1571765126,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.347993910312652588","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719597","author":{"steamid":"76561198053612187","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":24954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9889,"last_played":1619022252},"language":"russian","review":"Наиграв в данный момент более сотни часов могу рассказать о паре тонкостей, которые так или иначе могут помочь вам определиться с выбором. Купить или всё же пропустить игру? Вопрос хороший. Для начала расскажу о плюсах данной игры.\n- Уникальная в своём роде игра. Здесь можно примерить на себе роль многих культовых маньяков. Можете использовать их уникальные способности. За кого-то из них придётся играть тактически, за кого-то можно тупо идти напролом и кромсать выживших как колбасу. Тут уже вам решать. Мечтали примерить на себе роль беспощадного маньяка? Можете смело брать игру. Также у вас есть возможность играть вместе с друзьями за выживших. Особенное удовольствие доставляет игра полной командой, когда вы друг за друга горой, так сказать. Любите играть в команде? Можете попробовать игру, взяв её на распродаже.\n- Атмосферность игры проникает под кожу. Играете за выживших? Готовьтесь к постоянной паранойе. Маньяк может прийти именно за вами! Может телепортироваться к вам и сделать из вас люля-кебаб. Играете за маньяка? Будьте готовы к куражу охоты. Кто из вас окажется хитрее и смекалистее? Игра погружает вас в себя с концами. Особенно если вы играет один.\n- Хоть игра и не простая, но в то же время она доступна для понимания большинства людей. Прокачка здесь довольно простая. Главное - понять, какие навыки подходят для вашего и маньяка и для вашего стиля игры.\n\nА теперь немного о минусах. \n- Глюки и баги. Этих ребят тут хватает. Но встречаются они не очень часто. Но всё же иногда случаются неприятные моменты.\n- Порою попадаются токсичные игроки. Хоть мне это и не доставляет неудобств, но многих может задеть.\n- Не на всех картах хороший баланс. Где-то маньяки могут реально разносить всех выживших. А где-то выжившие могут гонять маньяка по карте без особых трудностей.\n- Платные дополнения. Сразу скажу, что для меня это и не минус, но некоторых людей это может огорчить. Сами по себе они не дорогие. Особенно если брать их на распродажах.\n\nМинусы есть, но ругать игру, честно говоря, за них не хочется.. \nПодводя итог вышесказанному, хочу поставить игре 76/100.\nВ будущем, возможно, оценка станет выше. Это уже зависит от разработчиков.\nЕсли вам близки атмосферные хоррор-слэшеры, то смело приобретайте эту игру.","timestamp_created":1571765086,"timestamp_updated":1571765086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719436","author":{"steamid":"76561198930027474","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1629119111},"language":"russian","review":"Очень крутая игра","timestamp_created":1571764314,"timestamp_updated":1571764314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719245","author":{"steamid":"76561198453140895","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1333,"last_played":1608134542},"language":"schinese","review":"先打个好评在这。但是我好菜啊...","timestamp_created":1571763485,"timestamp_updated":1571763485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719231","author":{"steamid":"76561198819527974","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":261,"playtime_forever":17884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1654896423},"language":"brazilian","review":"a cada dia tem que saber mais habilidade pra saber jogar , ta foda bixo","timestamp_created":1571763445,"timestamp_updated":1657100099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719220","author":{"steamid":"76561198335326630","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":24583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3483,"last_played":1629302138},"language":"finnish","review":"HYVÄ","timestamp_created":1571763413,"timestamp_updated":1571763413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511645376682281494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719168","author":{"steamid":"76561198856489745","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":72412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":4934,"last_played":1660322228},"language":"polish","review":"Super","timestamp_created":1571763173,"timestamp_updated":1571763173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55719056","author":{"steamid":"76561198349989644","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":87083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":175,"playtime_at_review":46872,"last_played":1660568880},"language":"schinese","review":"一个玩了快800小时的萌新 来说一下对这个游戏的一些看法  和对刚入坑萌新的一些建议\n注;非单边玩家 但人类玩的较多 屠夫较少(因为菜 追不到人)\n游戏是17年(好像是） 舍友推荐入坑  断断续续玩的现在  还记得第一个买的dlc是杨教授 \n抛开一些大家讨论的热点 \n如;屠夫守尸（拉锯保护/ 巡回守尸/） 打针对（先把你三挂挂死）幻神高配 (红段 凛/护士）等\n又如;人类嘲讽 (三蹲/闪手电/爆点） 速修 （除了修机什么都不做 顶着恶咒修 ） 车队 (四黑）门皇 (终局机制后现在还好）拔线 (屠夫高配/队友智障/恶意拔线）等\n以下都是个人玩屠夫或人类观点；\n这些东西是没法改变的  从人类角度来讲  \n你屠夫玩个皮脸 电锯 麦叔(卡3阶段守尸) 把我挂树上之后就拉着电锯 贴脸守我 （队友来救的后果最好是一换一 不然 就是全GG） 我怎么玩 我出去肯定骂你(多了就习惯了)  其他一些屠夫 巡回守尸 (皮脸 电锯 也可以) 就在 你上树的地方绕 看到人 上去给一刀 或者不给 回来守你 人根本没有游戏体验。在这里说一个有趣的事情 官方是不鼓励守尸的 你守尸 在某种意义上会越越菜 (国内某平台 皮脸把把恶意守尸 鞭尸 都能当主播 注意是恶意鞭尸 有兴趣可以去了解）\n但实际上说这么多 这些都是个人行为 包括屠夫玩家说的一些什么人类修的太快(不是你幻神太强 人类也不会修那么快 而且 最近一年 屠夫基本上没有不带恶咒的 人不修 等死吗 请问屠夫玩家。 还说人类顶着恶咒修的快建议砍修机时间 那我觉得这游戏人不用玩了 你们五个屠夫 对着夯就好了）\n说这些不是引战 只是想和大家说 游戏他是游戏 玩游戏的是人 每个人怎么做我们都无权干涉 但希望大家都能有竞技精神 都能有素质 尊重都是相互的\n抛开上述不谈 我觉得相比之下 更重要的是 游戏的优化 以及BUG 问题 (Pretty good job so far）\n什么时候可以你们可以真正的 解决一下这些bug 不要每次更新修复旧BUG(未必能修复) 再出新BUG(越来越多)\n段位结算错误的bug什么时候修复 不是我喜欢玩这个游戏 我可能真的会喷死这个游戏 就这一个bug就够(有人说换电信网 不好意思我就是电信网 ）\n还有黎明罚站的问题 实际上到现在都没怎么解决 \n说一点对新人玩家的建议\n玩屠夫;
