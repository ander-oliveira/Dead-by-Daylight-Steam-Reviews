Für eine erfolgreiche Flucht gibt es 5000 Punkte, das ist nur knapp weniger, als man bekommt, wenn man alle 5 Generatoren alleine gemacht hat. Desshalb gibt es zu viele Spieler, die in irgendwelchen Ecken rumgimpen und sich dort die \"Eier\" schaukeln. Sobald dann allerdings die Tore offen sind, stellen sie sich mit dem Rücken zum Ausgang um den Killer mit Emotes zu ärgern und dann sobald er ihnen zu nahe kommt oder keine Punkte in der \"Tapferkeitskathegorie\" mehr gibt einen Schritt aus dem Spielfeld zu machen und die Punkte einzustreichen.\n\nMein Vorschlag dabei währe eine Recht einfache Formel:\n\nBonuspunkte = Eigene Punkte Generator * Anzahl der entkommenen Survivor * 5000 / Gesamtpunkte Generator\n\nDadurch würde es sich relativieren, wer nichts macht, bekommt auch keine Punkte aufs überleben, Hat man sich aber den Hintern aufgerissen und wird dann geschnappt, bekommt man wenigstens noch etwas falls die anderen es schaffen.\n\nAlles in allem sind die Entwickler auf einem guten Weg.

O jogo tem uma boa comunidade.\n\nO único problema que vi no jogo é quando o killer tem uma internet ruim, já que ele é o host da partida e não ter lag depende dele, mas isso é raridade.\n\nRecomendo pacarai.","timestamp_created":1472474338,"timestamp_updated":1472474338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25227236","author":{"steamid":"76561198096251513","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7014,"last_played":1627415132},"language":"spanish","review":"juego bastante bueno y original si quitas los bugs que solo joden a los supervivientes y al trampero 10/10","timestamp_created":1472473069,"timestamp_updated":1472473069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25226630","author":{"steamid":"76561198064196778","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":49437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9380,"last_played":1598712037},"language":"english","review":"Lobby simulator is pretty great.

Seriously I don't know what happend.. I guess the community whined so much about the OP killers cause thanks to that.. Now It's all about perks.. Im low lvl.. dont got any killer above lvl 5.. Yet Im constantly up against people lvl 50 With full inventory and full equiped with the best perks in the game.. I have survivors running all around me and juking the hell out of me with speed boosts.. And what not.. And flashliights.. As the killer all i can do is swing and down them as the moment i go to pick anyone up they stand infront of me and flash me so i drop him.. giving them a free revive.. And if i try to play smart, by downing all 4 of them before i go to do the hook.. They call me out calling it slugging and telling me to learn how to play the game. .The community is so fucking toxic.. \n\nThis game is amasing to play in custom games with all perks avaible with a few friends for some good laughs and fun..  But as soon as it becomes real games.. It's turned to shit for me.. Survivors don't fear the killer as they know they can just out run him and if they get hit by him once they know they wont go down.. And if they get down he can't hook them unless he manage to pick them up while facing a wall for some lucky reason. Most killers that have any use seem to be DLC locked, Honestly i tried most and they are fun.. But not all very competent.. I love the trapper.. But good luck VS a high rank premade team.. Cause you won't get any time to put down the traps.. In the matter of the first min the survivvors had fixed 2 generators.. \n\nI tried to camp the last, then they just used the skeleton key and opend up the hatch and escaped... Seriously.. I figured, they just good at it.. I went in with 3 of my friends.. And we escaped all of us 4/5 times.. By just communicating, telling others over discord when the killer is chasing so they can repair without stress.. By dealing out who goes to save and who goes to lure the killer.. It's so easy to be survivor.. \n\nPeople disagree telling me there's tactics, and ways and bla bla.. fuck you...  I don't want to farm loses for blood points to get perks.. And dont tell me perks dont matter.. Cause I faced people that can revive a downed player in like 2-3 seconds, That unhook a person faster then i hooked them.. That got flashlights with almost unlimited juice in.. That got speed boost to trigger every 60 seconds... \n\nThis just became a LAN game for me.. And im gona stick to that.. I put in another guy's review below this, As many probedly see my opinion as a tanterum and rage, But this guy wrote what i really feel about the game.\n\nForeshadows review: I totally agree with it!!\n\nEdit: The review was rushed, so I have updated it to the best of my ability. Edit 1: Please ignore the 27 hours, as I barely played the PC version. Edit 2: Thoroughly explained (As best as I could) as to what's wrong. As a fan of this game, I've decided to come forth and finally give my two cents.\nBe forewarned that I will be honest, and I will not sugarcoat anything.\nTL;DR Toxic survivors have taken over the game and constantly demand that everything be balanced in their favor, leading to decent survivors/killers to become toxic to counter the issues.\nFull review:\nHad you asked me if this game was worth checking out back in the day when both sides got along, I would have said yes, buy it if you can and try it out.\nIf you were to ask me today, I would simply tell you no, it's not worth the money nor time or effort.\nThe game has become a lopsided nightmare due to Survive with friends, which is now used primarily for just joining matches and leading troll runs toward killer mains/players, which has lead to toxcicity from the killer side in turn due to the survivors intentionally (With malicious intent, if I may be so bold to add) thwart all of the killers actions while the others go behind their back. (I.E. Pallet/environment/window looping, luring the killer away while the others heal their comrade/fix gens or the downed player uses Unbreakable, or rush the hook when the gates are opened (In one of my experiences) and use Borrowed time, run in front of their wounded allies and take the hit, etc.) \nKiller mains are treated as if they are war criminals by the now toxic survivor community, and killers are now paying a price they didn't ask for nor deserve because toxic survivors throw claims that they're overpowered.\nSurvivors now have a higher advantage over the killer than what they had before and are now leading coordinated trolls on killers via software such as Discord (Or so) on PC, and parties via the console ports, as well abuse their perks and items they have acquired, which has lead killer mains/players, high rank or not, to camp and tunnel nearly every match.\nToxic survivors also abuse the report options should the game not go their way, or disconnect the instant they come across a killer they dislike. While the DC'ing isn't really a major issue, the abuse of the report system is clearly a disgrace within itself.\nTo speak out about the issues mentioned above like I'm doing results in becoming a martyr as the toxic survivor side instantly becomes unhinged.\nThe toxic survivor part of the community runs rampant through the game like the black death, and has pretty much poisoned a once good game where people could have fun and make friends.\nIf you have good friends whom you love dearly, then this game is fun to play. Outside of that, the game really has no other future aside from going down in history as another casualty of good games that were taken over by toxic individuals.\nDo I love this game? Yes. Do I hate what it's become? Beyond a shadow of a doubt.","timestamp_created":1472470515,"timestamp_updated":1513798780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25226347","author":{"steamid":"76561198114194315","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44,"last_played":1519384602},"language":"english","review":"Fun for the first 2 matches, and then it becomes repetetive and boring.","timestamp_created":1472469588,"timestamp_updated":1472469588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462298750877380371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25226118","author":{"steamid":"76561198238136104","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":24152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3234,"last_played":1637089112},"language":"russian","review":"Скрюка на крюк, с крюка на круг, не разорвать порочный круг...","timestamp_created":1472468542,"timestamp_updated":1472468542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25226069","author":{"steamid":"76561198292840324","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":90,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1477932017},"language":"russian","review":"МНЕ ПОНРАВИЛСЯ МАНЬЯК","timestamp_created":1472468400,"timestamp_updated":1472468400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25225893","author":{"steamid":"76561197966812502","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1360,"last_played":1612782250},"language":"english","review":"So, I have a group of 4 mates who like to game together.

I'm writing this review right now because I've played two matches with my friend in the past hour and a half, because we for the life of us could not get into a match, and when we finally get into the two that we were playing, both times I went to repair a generator and both times the game crashed. I figured since the game JUST crashed on me and I'm a bit fed up at this point what with grinding the \"Ready\" button for 30 minutes at a time to get into a match and then having the game crash on me for no clear reason what-so-ever, that instead of sending a crash report that I cannot explain because there is no reason for it, that I would right this review. The game wouldn't be that bad if the premise of the game actually worked. It's an online horror thriller that is meant to be played with friends and in excitement, and when the online part is no good, there is no point.

game is borderline amazing. The game consists of a great premise and a kill or be killed aspect which thrills you beyond belief. You can either play as the killer and maul your friends to death and hear them cry in terror or be the survivor and grip your heart as the killer walks right past you. All in all I would say this game definitely deserves a 10/10. All this being said you never get to experience any of this for more than 30 seconds without being killed or disconnected by the killer leaving or dying from lagging. The best part is this usually happens after waiting for an hour and turning 865 years old and seeing generations fly by and grow up and the planet deteriorate. The best thing is that I didn't know waiting simulator 2016 was coming out already! This game proves that consumers are actually as dumb as the retailers think and will buy a broken game and waste hours of their life just to get a few minutes of gameplay.

Их четверо, ждать от них добрых слов не стоит. Максимум, что вы получите за свои старания - это тисак промеж булок. А ощущение того когда рабочая смена закончена, ворота открыты и такой бежишь и волосы назад, а в спину слышно \"солнце еще не село\", с чувством выполненого долга и показывая средний палец начальству убегаешь домой. \n\nЗа  маньяка:\nСимулятор начальника. Ходишь по карте и постоянно контролируешь своих подчиненных. Раз по хребту. Почему так плохо работаем. Еще раз по хребту. Почему ящики по открывали и ушли. Бывают еще особо ленивые. Проходишь мимо шкафчика и слышишь посапывание. Открываешь, а там уже спит кто-то. Спать захотелось, все трудятся, а он поспать решил. Ну пойдем. Закидываешь на плечо и до первого крюка, чтобы взбодрился. За ними нужен глаз да глаз. Постоянно ходишь и подгоняешь их. А то они так и наровят присесть где-нибудь под деревом и расслабиться. Бывают моменты когда они наровят пораньше уйти домой. И тут выходит на сцену старый добрый навык проженного начанька \"Никто сегодня не идет домой\" и все. Все. Домой уже никто не уйдет.  \n\n\nА по факту. Игра довольно не плоха. Такого еще не было. Выжившие, маньяк, на одной карте. Кто-то пытаеся выжить и сбежать. А кто-то пытаеся расчлинить их всех) В игре есть не дороботки и порой она кажется сыровата, оптимизация похрамывает, но ее потихоньку фиксят, добовляют новый контент и я надеюсь, что в итоге разрабы доведут ее до идеального состояния.  Баланс все дела. А так довольно не забываемые ощущения стаха и постоянного напряжения за выживших) И чувство доминации, чувство того, что тебе нужно найти четырех свинок на карте и наказать) Играя за маньяка) Дааа, бывает, что все наоборот и выжившие доминируют над маньяком, но со временем придет скил) Главное терпение) И не кемперить.
