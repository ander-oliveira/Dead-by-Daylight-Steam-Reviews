Every match SWFs prove again they are the most OP thing in the game.  Survivor ques are insanely long.  Maps are way too large.  Hold W meta is still going on because of the maps leading to extremely boring matches.  Keys are still a thing for something.  Nothing is being done about this by the developers.  So for anyone interested in the killer side of this game I recommend staying in lower ranks where matches are fair and fun. Better yet, just don't play this at all unless you are in a SWF, in which case it's a free win.  It's apparent survivor mains enjoy free wins and bully matches with how much the game is in their favor.  I'm in no mood to play only the strongest killers in the game in full sweat mode just to win or have fun.","timestamp_created":1632120906,"timestamp_updated":1651093093,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443505823612213135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99667018","author":{"steamid":"76561198118560077","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7452,"last_played":1658559507},"language":"english","review":"is

a great game compared to Friday The 13th!\n\nIt's much more expandable with content added quite frequently if you ask me, the game remains fresh in terms of that. \nIt also flows quite well when playing it, yes it does have it's issues wit the hitboxes and stuff sometimes lag too can cause issues but majority of the time the gameplay is fun for me and I've been enjoying it quite more recently. \n\nAnother thing to add that I wish this game did was make more skins and maybe bump down the pricing of a few especially recolours they don't have to be that expensive if you're buying with Auric Cells or even the Shards ingame you earn by leveling up. \n\nBut other then that, this is more of a positive review that I have for this

more time they went from bad to worse. The worst aspect of playing survivor has been amplified and empowered even further. As survivor you have a \"3 strikes you are out\" system, but killers can cheese that by camping or tunneling you to make it more like 1.5 strikes you are out. This was a frequently complained about design flaw, and in the patch designed to curb those actions the developers buffed them instead. Not only that, but they also nerfed some of the countermeasures to those that you could load up with prior to the match starting. \nTo add salt on the wound the hotfix patch just implemented today nerfed a weak but fun perk, brought back an unfun combo that was removed in the prior patch, and nerfed a perk for everyone other than the 2 problem case killers that could abuse it. This, mind you, is after a dev statement that \"we will not make kneejerk reactions\". 2 of these fixes are due to bugs/unintended interactions that they refused to fix. Mettle of Man had a bug preventing it from working due to the endurance nerfs across the board, and Merciless Storm had its intended 9 second effect extended in extremely niche circumstances. What was the solution? Practically delete Mettle of Man from the game, and bring back an overly punishing combo instead of fix those bugs.\nNumerous people have posted or made videos of the various problems and solutions to the game design flaws, but the devs are so arrogant to believe no one else can be correct. To make it even worse they balance around the statistics rather than the actual mechanical problems. They ignore how people are killed, and just count the deaths. If someone uses the in-game suicide feature because they don't like playing against a particular player/killer/perk/etc. the devs don't know that the player quit when the match first started, and even worse matches with DCs do not count toward statistics. If someone hates something so much they will soak a scaling DC penalty starting at 5 minutes, then it is clear something in that match was wrong or bad. In rare cases people may have to deal with real life issues, but when a spike of DCs/early suicides occur it is clear there is something fundamentally wrong.","timestamp_created":1632110357,"timestamp_updated":1659469096,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99660736","author":{"steamid":"76561198073008672","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":23528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16425,"last_played":1659147063},"language":"spanish","review":"Basicamente el mejor juego de esta categoria pero bajo el mando del peor equipo de desarrolladores jamas visto.","timestamp_created":1632109083,"timestamp_updated":1654713770,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489878535270690918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99660675","author":{"steamid":"76561198022979918","num_games_owned":1020,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":9895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9468,"last_played":1641237928},"language":"english","review":"an exelent game with 4 surviors one killer the surviors repair generators while the killer stops them its very fun and addicting","timestamp_created":1632108975,"timestamp_updated":1632108975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99660420","author":{"steamid":"76561198877396093","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":374,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1660545188},"language":"english","review":"Really good game, 10/10.
