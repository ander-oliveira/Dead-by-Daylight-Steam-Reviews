Баги. Баги в этой игре растут в геометрической прогрессии, с каждом обновлении появляется еще больше.\n2. Подбор игроков. Играя за убийц вы будете попадаться против гениев игры в пати, а играя за выжившего вам дадут мусор в тиммейты и убийцу с топ аддонами и красным рангом.\n3. Читеры. Сейчас их развелось очень сильно, от взломщиков аддонов и скинов до игроков, которые удерживают всех в заложниках в матче.\n4. Токсиков. Особенно токсиков консольщиков, я уже и не помню видел ли я не токсика консольного игрока, но что меня больше удивляет так это недовольство самих токсиков вашей токсичностью xD Вам будут приседать, если вы кемпили или нет, если вы туннелили и  если не туннелили, если вы фармили с выжившими, если вы пощадили выживших, если вы проиграли, если вы выиграли честно, если вы афк, вам всегда будут приседать, КРОМЕ тех моментов, когда все выжившие лежат или на крюке.\n5. Дисконекты ваших тиммейтов после первого падения. Если у игрока не задалась катка с самого начала, если он упал потому-что у него перк Освобождение, если заруинили ему челендж, не дали благославить тотем, убийца оказался умнее, убийца оказался сильнее, то скорее всего ваш тиммейт ливнет из матча, а вам дадут 600 очков компенсации. Радуйтесь!\n6. Недовольные игроки. Выжившие всегда недовольны убийцей, чтобы он не делал, они бывают довольны только если победят, а убийцы могут и после победы быть недовольными.\n7. Падения производительности из обновы в обнову, вы разоритесь на железе.\n8. Куча паллет за убийц и 0 паллет за выживших, снятие капканов с первых попыток у выживших против вас и с 4 попытки, если капкан на вас.\n9. Расизм.

The game is a 4 (survivors) vs. 1 (killer) in which the main goal is to either survive or kill. Survivors must repair 5 generators in order to power 2 doors to escape the match. They must work together in unison to help each other escape the killers grasp, repair the generators, cleanse totems to either disable or prevent powerful Hex Perks, and rescue each other from hooks. The killer must use all tools in their arsenal in order to catch and kill all survivors.\n\nThe match ends when either all survivors are killed, all generators are repaired and survivors escape through the doors, or if survivors escape through the hatch that will spawn.\n\nAs more killers/survivors are release, the endless grind of gaining \"bloodpoints\" to unlock perks, items, add ons, and offerings through the bloodweb continues. Some people have thousands and thousands of hours played and still continue to play. It's fun to play solo or with friends.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest flaw to this game is that it is a forced ranking system meaning that the only mode to play is a ranked mode. The intent of it is to place players in matches with similar skill.. this doesn't always happen and even great players keep themselves from reaching top ranks so that they do not play the same killers every match. Also, there are no rewards for the achieving a Rank 1 status aside from the achievement.","timestamp_created":1562364768,"timestamp_updated":1562364768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47486037015914917","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53719391","author":{"steamid":"76561198087691221","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":21183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10130,"last_played":1596252444},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo jogo pra jogar solo ou em equipe.
