I am officially fed up with this game. My patience has reached its boiling point as they say. Now I'm definitely ready to write a review. So... you are thinking about buying this game? You want to get scared as a survivor or maybe you have a low-key desire to try out the role of the killer. If your answers to these questions are \"yes\" then... you should stay away from this game as far as possible. This game is a freaking trap! And by reading this review you will know why. \n\nGREEDY AND LAZY DEVELOPERS.\nAfter buying this game you will be given a couple of free survivors and killers. Licensed chapters you can only buy via real money. Original characters can be bought through in-game currency but you will need to put in 100 of hours for each character.  Some licensed chapters cost almost as much as the game itself and I guarantee you that you won't be satisfied with the stuff you purchase (Most killers you might get are weak. Survivors are all basically the same. Most of the perks you will never use. Meta doesn't change much) \nThe game has tons of bugs (some of which have been in the game for years. Hell, some of you won't even be able to play the game normally because it constantly crashes and, to make things worse, if you get your game crashed you will get a nice gift- DC (disconnection) penalty. DC penalty doesn't allow you to play for a fixed period of time. With each and every DC the punishment gets more severe (The longest I have ever heard of is 72 hours. As far as I’m aware, it goes 5 minutes, 15, 30, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. It takes 24 hours for it to regress to the previous level). This brings us to the next point. \nIn the chase for easy money devs got tangled up with NFTs. They do not produce any( yet) but they support the company that does NFTs of Pinhead. \n\nTHE GAME IS CURRENTLY BEING OVERRUN BY HACKERS. \nYeah. You heard me right. And it's not something you can just look past through. It's not rare or anything. You will face lots of hackers in your trials. Some of them are obvious ones but there are tons of those who use hacks in a subtle, \"smart\" way. So you can lose a match to a subtle hacker without even realizing that you faced one, do you like how it sounds? But losing to a hacker isn't the worst experience you could go through. Hackers that hold you hostage - that's what takes the cake. Yeah, your eyes aren't deceiving you. You have read it right. Hackers can hold you hostage and if you found yourself being trapped in a match with a hacker then you have limited amount of options. You can either DC (and get a penalty of course) or you can just hope for hacker's mercy (sounds fun). \nAnti-cheat is just a combination of words in this game.  Smoke and mirrors. DBD doesn't have any defense when it comes to real hackers. Don't get me wrong, the game always had hackers( any online game has) but their amount has tremendously increased recently and it seems like BHVR do not give a damn about them( I'm sure they do, but it's been months and they haven't acknowledged the fact that hackers had overrun the realm of entity).\nReport button doesn't do anything. Hackers laugh at your face when you threaten them with a report. Some of them even managed to hack, wait for it, A REPORT OPTION. If you do not believe me, look it up on the youtube and see it for yourself.\n\nTOXICITY.\nThere are two different communities within one game. Survivor mains and Killer mains.  Both sides are extremely toxic and selfish. But statistically speaking, survivors tend to be more toxic and entitled because there are more of them in the game (4v1 ratio. You don't have to be a mathematician to understand that). I have played many online games but I'm yet to find a community more toxic than this one. This game is basically a clown fest, and we are, sadly the main entertainment for developers. \n\nMMR (Match Making Rating) IN A GAME THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CASUAL. \nMMR has a right to exist in such games like DOTA 2 or CS: GO (where everyone plays on an equal footing) but not in Dead By Daylight. This game is unbalanced but BHVR still added MMR for some unbelievable reason. Killer's experience becomes stressful as soon as you get to high MMR and unless you play Nurse or Blight( the only viable killers in the game) you will get screwed.  Every match you win hurts you in terms of matchmaking. You win but at the same time you lose because the very next team you face (or the next killer) is gonna be more sweatier than the previous one. You wanna win and have a good time, right? Nobody likes losing. It's in our nature. And that's why you will eventually find yourself sweating as much as everyone else. That's if you want to win.  You will begin as a player who just wanted to have fun and you will most definitely end up sweating, using the most unbalanced stuff... just like most of the players.  \nMMR slowly, but surely, kills the game. Some OG players have already quit. And those who remain do not exactly enjoy the game. Frankly speaking, I'm indifferent to MMR. I have used to playing sweaty, using the strongest killers (Nurse to be exact) or playing survivors with meta perks. And I still kind of enjoy the game because I'm a very competitive person but I'm one of the few. The community is crying over MMR. Survivors complain because killers camp, tunnel, slug and Killers complain because survs gen-rush, t-bag, click their flashlights, and use meta perks. Everyone complains and hates each other. To cut a long story short, MMR brought more toxicity to the game that was toxic to begin with.\n\nAnd still…I love this game almost as much as I hate it. It still has so much potential and it honestly hurts seeing it fall. I’m extremely passionate about DBD and that’s why I got so angry to the point of writing a negative review. I wish I could recommend you to buy this game, to support developers. But I just can’t bring myself to do it. I can only hope that the game will get better but until that day comes my review and overall attitude towards this game will stay the same.","timestamp_created":1634431080,"timestamp_updated":1650312205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.749465763568878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101171090","author":{"steamid":"76561198839664109","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":39079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1065,"playtime_at_review":28325,"last_played":1660463266},"language":"english","review":"game?","timestamp_created":1634431024,"timestamp_updated":1634431024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101170748","author":{"steamid":"76561197999093518","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1643829660},"language":"english","review":"while not for everyone, this game is reasonably suspenseful and quite fun(though its far more fun in a group as a team than as a solo player) \n\nwould recommend this game for survivor play only if you have someone else to team-play with.\n\nwould recommend this game for killer play \n\nits got a lot of power creep by now though...\n","timestamp_created":1634430394,"timestamp_updated":1634430394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101170732","author":{"steamid":"76561198070866271","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1141,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1660527303},"language":"english","review":"Annoying asf sometimes but fun nonetheless.

There are also many killers that decide to play the game just to be mean and goose guard you while you are hooked up meaning that no-one can save you and your forced to just sit there and have your life fade away while the killer watches you. Another thing that happens is the killer just lets you live and doesn't attack you which makes the game super boring.\n\nI'm sure that there are fun moments being a survivor because there is a genuine challenge to run and hide and what not but being a killer sucks, your too OP, there's no risk factor and I can tell that it wouldn't be fun for the survivors if I was a try hard who only cared about winning the game, the only time it would ever be fair is if someones 8 year old son was playing the game.\n\nI really wished that the game was more balanced, and a simple way to do that would be to add a vc so people could make strats and hold off the killer while the others repaired generators, another thing would be to add a map for the survivors so they could see where their teammates were and where the exits were, because it becomes a real hassle when a killer is chasing after you on a time limit and while your trying to open a door, another debuff for the killer should be not being able to see where the survivor ran, because we can't hide anywhere while there is a killer chasing us for an eternity.\n\nOther than that the aspect of the game and the killers designs are really cool, I just wish that there weren't so many basic survivors and that it was easier to obtain the other characters and abilities because it takes ages.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't like this game is because of the unbalanced teams and the goose guarding killers that like being a piece of shit. This game would be so fun if there was just some minor adjustments, even just the vc would make the game 10x better. Don't get this game if you don't have any friends or don't have any friends who have or are getting the game. Also don't play the killer, it's so boring and don't be a piece of shit if you do get this game.","timestamp_created":1634430301,"timestamp_updated":1634430301,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101170661","author":{"steamid":"76561199117241061","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1640834931},"language":"spanish","review":"ANASHE

Despite the amount of crossovers and its lifespan, the game is still incredibly unbalanced on top of buggy. There are players with thousands of hours invested in this game and they will tell you the exact same information I will but still swear by it.\n\nGameplay is fun, but you are at the mercy of a now proven defunct ranking system. \"MMR\" is the system the game uses to match players together. It \"functions\" as intended but that's largely part of the problem. For instance: if you play as a survivor, it does not matter how much effort you invest in helping your team mates, how many generators you repair, how long you distract the killer. All that matters is whether you escape or not. Further, if you are an exceedingly competent and knowledgeable survivor, you are penalized anyway by being matched with players that are simply not the same skill level you are, but they did \"escape\" about as much as you did. The developers of this game are aware of this, and recent interviews have proven that they feel it is a big joke. Hiding behind the excuse of, \"if you don't play for fun then you won't have a good time.\" Their arrogance is already creating a slow trickle of frustration in the community that is only building.\n\nAs a killer, the MMR system works somewhat better in your favor because you are the only person on your \"team\" and your rank is dependent on how many people you kill in a match. The most humorous thing about this though is that if matches don't drag on past a certain amount of time, you are penalized for being too efficient. \n\nBugs and mechanical issues with the game are constant and come in different forms with each update. Generally you won't find these to be an issue until they effect a crucial gameplay moment you're in the middle of.\n\nThe game's concept is fantastic. They have been blessed with so many great and beloved franchises to use at their disposal that other developers could only dream of using. I only wish that BHVR, the game's developer, put as much heart into their game as their fanbase has hope for the game as a whole. I do not expect BHVR to make much needed improvements to the game because they lack competition. Identity V is the most similar competitor to this game but it's niche is in Eastern markets. They have become complacent.\n\nAddendum after 50 hours more of gameplay: The MMR system becomes worse the more you play. You do not log in to the game to enjoy it, you log in to sweat. Survivor queue times are 5-10min on average while Killer queue times are 5-10secs. When I play as Killer I actively leave lobbies if I see or even suspect survivors are queued together. I don't mind playing against challenging players but the game is not meant to be played with voice chat. The game desperately needs a matchmaking mode that is not ranked, and it needs a matchmaking mode where you do not have to worry about matching against a pre-made group of survivors.","timestamp_created":1634423753,"timestamp_updated":1637999738,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51754385232925415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101166942","author":{"steamid":"76561198285151315","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":12736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12736,"last_played":1625929935},"language":"koreana","review":"처음엔 공포감 느끼다가 갈수록 술래잡기가 되는 겜\n열심히 할 마음만 있다면 재밌음","timestamp_created":1634423700,"timestamp_updated":1634423700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101166892","author":{"steamid":"76561198865339311","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1651877702},"language":"english","review":"great to know that this game is extremely killer sided, especially with the new haddonfield revamp. killers get the most powerful perks in the shrine of secrets while survivors get the most useless, and they consistently keep nerfing survivors and buffing killers despite killers having every advantage. hexes pop without the requirements being met, they get hits when they aren't anywhere near you, and there's like like 3 hooks for every 1 pallet on the map, with standard being like 3. barely any capability for survivors to survive. fix your fuck ass game.\n","timestamp_created":1634423611,"timestamp_updated":1651158686,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101166891","author":{"steamid":"76561198408038667","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":126136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2806,"playtime_at_review":60299,"last_played":1660543985},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego asimetrico, mejoras constantes pero aun le falta en relación a BUGs recurrentes en cada update.
