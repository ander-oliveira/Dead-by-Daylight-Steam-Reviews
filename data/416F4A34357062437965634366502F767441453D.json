The game is pretty solid, theres plenty of playstyles to choose from wether you want to be chased or be the one to chase. If youre the survivor you have to adapt your playstyle accordingly to the killer. Thats genius, but also makes you face 4 out of 13 killers most of the time because of balancing issues. For the price you will have alot of fun, but dont consider DLC's without playing the game for sometime and finding your prefered playstyle first,\n\nI like to enjoy games with friends whenever the option comes up and so when i struggle to actually join my friends lobby i get mildly irritated to say the least.

The concept was amazing and the gameplay was addicting, but over the years it never got consistently better. This idea of \"balance\" on a purely casual game is one of the reasons why, I believe there should be no such thing as a meta and the game should 100% be played how the player wants to play. A meta implies there's a right/strong way to play, which should have NEVER existed in a game like this. The large variety of perks and abilities each side has encourages creativity and experimentation which can never be put into practice because of the simple fact that one thing is significantly better then the other, so you have no reason to ever use your other options. The developer team behind this game is laughably incompetent and their idea of \"balance\" isn't even at least good. The game is one sided, anyone with over 100 hours will tell you that; killer isn't fun anymore, survivor queue times take around 10 minutes for a match that could end as quickly as it started. The developer team never listens to the community and when they do they choose to listen to the more toxic side of the community. Which, by the way, were created by the team themselves because in any \"competitive\" game, people want to naturally win, some more then others per say, which breeds the toxicity. The team themselves are greedy and care more about the short term health of the game over the long term health. For example the \"Darkness Among Us\" chapter was poorly designed, lazy, had absolutely no inspiration, and suspiciously seemed more like they wanted a killer whom they could make a bunch of simple cosmetics for, that people would want to buy. Even after that catastrophe they seemed to not have learned their lesson, for years the community have begged for them to lesson the grind players have to go through to get what they want in this game, which they still haven't listened to. \n\nI myself admit I was once in love with this game, and part of the toxicity it breeds. But over the years as I got older I realized these truths about the game and never want to touch it again. As an older, on and off player of this game I would not recommend this game, or at the very least if you buy it don't give this team any more of your money unless they truly deserve it, which they do not. Go buy left 4 dead 2 or something, it may be old but its sure as hell not a bad game.\n\nIf you have taken the time to read this review and are willing to have a reasonable discussion in the comments on why you disagree, you're more then welcome to.

O rumo que o jogo tomou torna impossivel avaliar como experiência positiva, o gameplay do mesmo. A quantidade de atrocidades que leva o jogo, passa os pontos positivos que até eram bem maiores em versões anteriores.\n\nGeral: Bugs... bugs, bugs, bugs...\nTudo começa quando os desenvolvedores (que eu desconfio nem mesmo saberem o que estão fazendo, mas que clamam terem feito um [i]pretty good job so far[/i](?)) resolveram tentar implementar um balanceamento (em um jogo o qual deveria ser desbalanceado, saca?!) Desde então, o jogo que era divertido e interessante, pois foi bem novidade na epoca de seu lançamento, virou essa desgraça que hoje temos aí.\nVamos a um resumo do que você pode encontrar dentro dessa caixa de Pandora após gastar 37 contos.\n -O jogo tem tantos que fazem parecer que o jogo ainda está em fase de acesso antecipado.\nAtrualização anual: Jogo virou agenda política e um completo scam. Pague pra ter personagens nerfados e qualquer coisa que os desenvolvedores acharem do momento. Um desperdicio total de um bom game que ja foi. \n-Bugs de survivor onde você não consegue passar por cantos onde forças do além tumulo te impedem, lags absurdos que te fazem teleportar mai que o Goku, coisas que horas podem ser feitas, horas não, dependendo da cara do freguês...\n-Bugs de Killer: Novamente, lugares que você não consegue passar por que o killer é muito \"gordo\" ou muito alto, física horas existe, horas não; Perks/habilidades que horas funcionam ou não....\n\n-A comunidade... aaahhh a comunidade....\nSe você quer jogar um jogo numa sala fechada com outros retardados, onde a tensão ja está no limite, esse jogo é para você! A comunidade no geral não sabe o que faz, não tem vontade nenhuma de aprender e acha que estão arrasando.\nVocê vai encontrar dementes que, após assistirem um ou dois videos de Ochido, pensam que, com 5 minutos de jogo, podem replicar as mesmas jogadas e truques. Resultado; Um bando de imbecís correndo sem rumo, caindo em menos de 10 segundos de partida.\n\nA um ano à trás, eu recomendaria esse jogo a todos e daria um positivo.... No momento, não existe como. Eu comprei em promoção, paguei 28 conto nele e hoje eu gostaria de ter esses 28 pra gastar em cartas steam, mas não nisso. Decepção total.\n\nQuer ponto positivo? Deixa eu ver... O som ainda é bom. Quando você consegue jogar com outras 3 pessoas espertas e em call, ou no modo \"friendly\", é divertido. Tirando isso, é um jogo que vai fazer seu sangue subir mais rápido que a nota do preço da gasolina.\n\n*Edit*\nDepois do Update de hoje, dia 11 de Dezembro, o jogo ficou injogavel. Mais uma vez, coisas mudaram de lugar, layouts diferentes, drop de frame rate de 60 para menos de 20 em certas ocasiões, ainda menos pallets, pallets gerados em locais inuteis.... A desgraça segue. Desenvolvedores não se decidem no que querem fazer e sobra para os jogadores que não conseguem nem se adaptar em tempo das mudanças anteriores e ja sofrem com novas mudanças sem sentido. Jogo absolutamente destruído.\n\nEdit 06-2019: Jogo ainda uma droga. Matchmaking ridiculo te põe com ranks totalmente aleatorio de survivor e de killer, a criação de um lobby leva entre 7 a 10 minutos. Muitos erros ainda e nada de fixes mas cosméticos eles lançam. O valor de UM cosmético chega a ser quase o preço do jogo. Modo de jogo totalmente arruinado com essa atualização de \"end game\" fazendo inútil o propósito de fazer geradores. Virou um jogo de \"quem abacalha mais e vive por ultimo\" vence. Chato demais.\n\nEdit 09-2019: Jogo lagado, pesado, travando. Nenhum lobby verde. Todos amarelos e acima de 120 ping. Injogável. Novos atributos ridículos, estragando ainda mais o que uma vez ja foi divertido.","timestamp_created":1544393733,"timestamp_updated":1606347851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481152147054672241","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47426749","author":{"steamid":"76561198404313693","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4140,"last_played":1651693960},"language":"german","review":"Mit mehr und mehr Updates, Killern und Überlebenden wird das Spiel immer besser!\nEs ist einfach nur genial!!!!","timestamp_created":1544392149,"timestamp_updated":1544392149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47426085","author":{"steamid":"76561198297276285","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":68896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":605,"playtime_at_review":5659,"last_played":1660071420},"language":"spanish","review":"No se puede pedir más.
