So many people keep saying, \"stay out of sight!  That's how you beat him!  DUH!\"  WELL FUCK ME SIDEWAYS I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE POINT OF THE GAME, TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE KILLER!  So what your saying is, if this one particular killer SEE's me for a period of time he can 1 hit me?  And so at places where I might take a slash to keep my speed up or keep running, I just get downed, and god forbid you save me from the hook, then we will both likely be downed.  \"OH BUT HE IS SUUUUPER SLOW DURING CHANNELING!!\"  SO IS THE WRAITH WHEN HE COMES OUT OF STEALTH, and Myers can still keep up a decent chase while he's building himself.  Had a good long runaway from him where one slash might have given me the boost to escape, but no, 1 hit, bye bye, no one saves you because they will die too.  PLayed 8 games yesterday, all Myers, all of us died everytime, and I used to be a rank 1 survivor.  Hahahaha.  This is the first killer without a serious downside to his ability, no punishment for missing a chainsaw, teleport, bad reveal (as the wraith) or down time with setting traps.  Why in the FUCK would you play any other killer?  \n\n\"HI GUYS IM MICHAEL MYERS, MY DOWNSIDE IS DON'T LET ME SEE YOU, WHICH IS HOW YOU SHOULD PLAY AGAINST ANY KILLER!

When you get used to everything, the ball starts rolling.\n\nStarting off, the game legitimately had me scared. Not cowering-under-the-covers kind of scared, but legitimately nervous and afraid of dying and losing the match because the killer is very intimidating. Especially during moments of pressure when you're being chased down or have to force yourself to not panic in order to sneak and not give up your position, because stealth is very much so rewarded.\n\nThis game is not easy, especially when starting off as a survivor. If you're coming into the game ignorant, you're going to be making a LOT of mistakes. That's why it's good to be with friends or \"survive with friends\" so that someone's there to show you the ropes. I feel a lot of newcomers jump into this clueless and get salty, which is honestly understandable. This game isn't so casual as it requires some commitment, especially with how grindy it can be with the bloodpoints system. On the contrary, the killer's part is a lot easier. Don't get me wrong, it's not baby mode, you have to at least know what you're doing or you're going to get trolled by teabagging survivors who constantly juke, stealth, and farm bloodpoints from your lack of knowledge. But with some commitment, you'll do just fine as a killer as well.\n\nSurvivor and Killer are completely different worlds, and which being more fun is all up to preference, Survivor is more difficult and focuses more on keeping you on edge, where you have to keep a level head and not give away your position. In the end, you have to be as stealthy as possible and not give yourself away unless you absolutely must have to, such as saving a friend from an impending doom. But you gotta be clever too and wary about the kind of noise you make when performing certain actions.\n\nKiller on the other hand is easier and is all about hooking them up. You assert your dominance and gain pleasure from their panic and despair. While Killer is a walk in the park in comparison, you still have to be clever about what you do, because survivors can be just as clever. With the first person perspective, it is surprisingly easy to lose track of your prey or have mind games be played on you. When you overcome this barrier, you'll soon learn that you get the most satisfaction from not only sacrificing survivors, but playing with your food (which coincidentally is a perk too). Camping and securing your kill isn't usually a good thing to do, as hooking survivors repeatedly can net you more bloodpoints (and fun, too). When you hook someone and walk away, they will stop doing generators to help each other, which can clue you in on where they are about to go next. Even if they successfully save someone, they only have a certain amount of times they can be hooked before an instant death. It's very much possible to get lots of bloodpoints without sacrificing a single survivor, because you are moreso rewarded on the amount of actions you perform. But in the end, you would want to get multiple hooks, and if possible, kill absolutely everyone after you've grinded them out.\n\nNow, I'm not here to tell people how to play the game, but the intention here is that you're suppose to be scared as a survivor. If you're teabagging all over the place, can you honestly call yourself scared? No. If you're discouraged from messing around and instinctively try to get out ASAP, can you call yourself at least a little bit worried? Yes. What confuses me the most is when people talk about balance and use that as their entire argument for downvoting the game. I understand that balance is very often important, but in this case, Dead by Daylight is a unique case. Yes, the killer will kill you once they find you. Yes, Michael Myers will one shot you if he keeps staring at you for long enough. But is he impossible to beat? The answer is no. Michael Myers is very strong, one of the strongest infact, but he is not OP like the Nurse once was. Once you figure him out, you'll once again learn that stealth is still very much so rewarded, because being one shotted isn't a thing when he doesn't even know where you are, right? And if he finds you, you're SUPPOSE to be scared and concerned about living or not. There shouldn't be a definitive strategy to never getting caught, such as infinitely juking or hiding. It's kind of dependent on luck. That's why the maps are randomized and never consistently the same. In a way, this games runs off of RNG or situations that are not very easy to control. If you know what to expect, that gives you a sense of security. But no, Dead by Daylight is a game where you should never feel safe and the devs try to make it so with every patch. The killers SHOULD have an advantage over the survivors, otherwise it wouldn't be a \"survivor horror\" game, now would it? Now don't get me wrong, there were plenty of times where both sides had unfair advantages or just completely illogical things happening, but the devs handle it as diligently as possible.\n\nAnd what's with all these people complaining about paid DLC? He's MICHAEL MYERS from Halloween. Do you honestly think the devs can profit off of a licensed franchise and legally get away with it? I feel like there's a bunch of kids these days with mob mentalities who just look at Capcom's DLC practices, then just use that as reference to start hating on all forms of DLC as if they know that the system is corrupt and that they're here to preach the truth and fight the power. Why don't you actually take a little bit of a time out of your day and learn about how corporation works?\n\nIn closing, this game is fairly new; a couple months old. It's got a long way to go, and I'm hoping that it goes somewhere within the next year or so. It'll either be dead or still kicking. I'm hoping it's kicking. Despite my hours, I felt I made this review very early. And besides, some argue that this feels like an early access game. And trust me, it sure does feel like one. I'm just hoping there's much more to come in the future. Not just new survivors, killers, and maps, but more objectives and content. I understand it might be kind of difficult to come up with new ideas since honestly, this game is a one-of-a-kind and requires a different approach. Why is this game, with as many bugs as it has, is still frequently played? Because literally no one else has made a game like it. But an exception might be Friday the 13th coming soon.","timestamp_created":1477914978,"timestamp_updated":1503391737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26334299","author":{"steamid":"76561198096245538","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1478423813},"language":"tchinese","review":"对新人极度不友好，非常不平衡的匹配机制，新人进游戏没有任何技能和物品，匹配到的却全是高等级玩家，购买前请三思。","timestamp_created":1477913865,"timestamp_updated":1477913865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546199619770050049","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26334272","author":{"steamid":"76561198208784053","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":1296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1509982195},"language":"schinese","review":"没毛病！","timestamp_created":1477913737,"timestamp_updated":1477913737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26334211","author":{"steamid":"76561198049824294","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1550,"last_played":1481745666},"language":"german","review":"Für mich einer der mit Abstand schlechtesten Spiele in meiner Bibliothek!

With the new Halloween chapter, it's made it even more fun with Micheal's Evil Within Weapon. Especially when I'm just sitting there minding my own business, then BAM! He's right there behind me. \n\nHowever, with the recent updates, it seems to have gotten harder for survivors to win. I'm not sure if it's just me, but it seems as if the generators take longer to repair. Also there are the killers in the game who like to camp the hook, making it nearly inpossible to help your teammate off the hook. On the other side, it makes it so you have to coordinate with another player to distract the killer while you/someone else rescue the hooked player. Then there are the killers who watch you while you crawl around dying and waste your time. This makes it incredibly frustrating. \n\nIf you manage to get into a gmae with friends, this changes everything. The game becomes incredibly easier as the people you are playing with can be in a chat program such as discord with you, and coordinating what to do and what's going on with the killer. Or you can kill your friends and have a good laugh. \n\nOverall, the game is still a working progress, and I think it needs to add some form of talk system for the survivors. The perks make it so the killer/player can be unstoppable (if they know what they're doing with them).

Matchmaking can be unbalanced, and requiring the killer to host is horrible. (dedicated servers coming soon)\n\nLong Version:\n\nThe game is unbalanced as a whole. The matchmaking doesnt componsate for the perks you have and the amount of time played. Once you get to a high level with one survivor or killer, you can train other survivors/killers with the perks of said one. For example, you can have survivor 1 have perks from survivors 2,4, and 7, which is exceptionally broken with some combos. The same happens with killers. You can have games where everyone escapes within minutes and you have games where everyone is dead within minutes. \n\nHowever, you occasionally have very well matchmade games as far as skill and perks are concerned but the connections are horrible. This game is running on the host/connected platform where you connect to the killer. If the killer has internet from the wifi of the nextdoor mcdonalds then everyone is fucked. In the same sense if the killer is EU and everyone is NA, there is a roughly 100MS lag for everyone. Dedicated servers are coming soon though, so no big deal.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, its incredibly fun, so long as you dont use completely broken combonations or someone can match your combos with their own. So long as there is some sort of challenge its fun. I have plenty of games where i kill the last survivor or one escapes with either no generators left or just one. I also have plenty of games where i never see anyone ever, and plenty where everyone is hooked and dead within 5 minutes. That being said, its more of a balancing/player issue than a game issue.\n\nSkins: Not a big fan of paid skins in any game. Never have been, escpecially when its mostly community members that make it, and it gets turned into paid transactions. IF the content creator receives some of the funds then cool, they deserve it, but there are plenty of times where its not the case and i feel thats why i dont like it. That and im used to getting skins/unlockables the old fashioned way of doing achievements and challenges. Theres no problem with the paid skin system, as most of the skins look decent, I personally however, do not like it.\n\nDLC: I hate some of the DLC but i love others. It seems like a huge hit or miss situation. I feel like leatherface is a reskin of hillbilly with a slightly different chainsaw. I feel like michael myers and freddy were great additions, despite their usefullness. In general, I hate paid DLC, especially on fullpriced games. However, this is not a full priced game, and its DLC for the most part is a fun addition to the game.\n\nRecommend?\nYes and No\n\nDo you have multiple friends that would play this with you? Yes\nDo you play this alone? (yes only if you want to be killer, as the players you get matchmade with often make you rage)\nTime killer? Yes, it is something you can hop on and play for a few hours and get off and feel like you had fun. However you can also spend a few hours on it and swear you will uninstall and never played again (this happened to two of my friends already)\n\nAre there cheaters/hackers?\nYES, there are plenty, though I don't come across them super often. Most notably i was streaming this game and had someone i was chasing go from normal speed to almost light speed and go invisible. Other than that its mostly just speed hacks, (faster repairs and faster move speed).\n\nFinal Score: 5.6/10\n\nScore Rankings:\n9-10: A must own, if you do not buy this i will be upset\n7-8: a good game. consider getting this game, in my opinion it is worth it at full price.\n5-6: Average. Has flaws/drawbacks, requires multiple people, glitchy, etc. Wait until updates/tuning/or play with friends. get this on sale.\n3-4: Below Average. Major flaws/drawbacks, super glitchy, and or hackers are rampant.\n1-2: Return this, even if it was a gift.","timestamp_created":1477885399,"timestamp_updated":1545169941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26329111","author":{"steamid":"76561198005722805","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1511271516},"language":"english","review":"Im sweaty, And I really have to pee...
