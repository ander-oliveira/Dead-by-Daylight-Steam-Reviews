As a beginner you are up for absolutely horrible experience, especially as survivor. Solo survivor is considered as worst experience possible even among more skilled players. This mostly because at first you need proper perks which require you to grind. Entire game progress is nothing but a grind for points. If you intend to grind know that it's a job for a killer because as survivor, you most likely will be getting 10 - 15k on average where as killer the numbers are 20 - 30k instead.\n\nBloodweb system is archaic and should be reworked entirely. Right now it's mostly randomized market where you get random perks as you level it up until you reach the point where you are spending your hard earned in-game currency in attempt to get a perk that your character needs the most ( each killer has it's own weakness so you need to mitigate it as much as possible by trying to equip the perk that helps, be it in chase or generator progression slow-down ) however due to the nature of randomness and the fact that bloodweb won't ''refresh'' until everything is taken out. There is a mechanic called entity which will ''help'' you by consuming items from the side of the random remaining perk so you can progress but this also might deny you a chance of getting the required perk if you don't start buying items towards it. The biggest issue of this entire system is it's randomness which only promotes more grind. Unless you equip 4 perks which help you gain more bloodpoints but likely don't help you at performing better in the game you should be ready to have your first 100 or 200 hours spent on acquiring the very basics. For comparison the same could be spend on AA or AAA game or other MP game where you will gain a significant progress, not the basic essentials.\n\n2. As a beginner killer you will start off getting beginner survivors as opponents who will play poorly and un-organized, but that won't last for long. Soon you will be matched against enemies who are either more experienced, use smurfs, cheat or are in a stack ( playing survive with friends mode ). Your gameplay experience will drastically change as you will learn that it's impossible to deal with decent survivors without losing your generators very quickly. The ratio of one hooked survivor equals one or two generators completed will be common which means large pool of killers will not suit such pace. Enjoyed playing a killer from a movie but turns out he has been recently nerfed after a patch? There go your 200 hours. Either switch to another killer and spend another 100 hours learning the basics of it and getting proper perks but know that at any moment devs may decide to turn your new favorite character into garbage on a whim. Shorty speaking your experience and time spent in the game may be all for nothing at any moment. To sum up - you control or own nothing. Your game pace is at the mercy of developers of this game and opponent survivors who may or may not be bad or decide to end the match quicker ( granted they have plenty of options to finish all 5 generators in less than 5 minutes ).\n\nThis is a trap game. People who are lured into this game by the prospect of playing as iconic villains / monsters with a promise of being a hunter, others who are baited by streamers telling them the game is easy and fun - they are all victims of false advertisement. Only few manage to realize early enough what is this piece of software truly is and avoid spending any extra bucks - everybody else are stuck here with hopes that this game does finally die because developers are beyond any redemption or when something remotely decent comes out. If you are new and are thinking about buying this game - don't do that. As developers once said - go play Civilization or something similar instead.[/strike]\n\n\nI usually don't change my mind but this time I believe it deserves a change for two major reasons. :\n\n1. The recent update made grinding much more manageable and progress is now more reliable ( prestige doesn't take your hard-earned perks, you don't need to ''hunt'' desired perks anymore as they are now share-able between killers when you do prestige ). No more you need to spend those hours farming BPs and then gambling in blood web for a desired perk. While getting high level prestige will take absurd amount of time, it's not a mandatory anymore so in terms of time cost, it's all more affordable.\n\n2. There's no mixed review to give. The reason why I'd go with mixed here is because there still is a problem with cheaters, some swf balance and perk changes may be 50 - 50. I feel it would be unfair to downvote the game at this moment so it gets and upvote instead.\n\nTo sum up this time at date of 5/8/2022 : There are improvements being made. Sure as beginner you may still suffer at start but know that you are more likely get a 50% win rate now with current MM and perk changes so if you are willing to endure the first 50 - 100 hours, it should improve by a lot later until you hit 500+ hours mark and crazy swfs start annoy you by a lot. When you get there, you'll have to learn how to deal with them until devs actually address them, but hopefully you will be experienced enough to take on this extra challenge on self.","timestamp_created":1651340509,"timestamp_updated":1659661730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114732994","author":{"steamid":"76561198865442401","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":38691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":293,"playtime_at_review":15115,"last_played":1660319957},"language":"spanish","review":"Estan haciendo cambios cada que hacen que cada vez el juego este mas desequilibrado. Han hecho que algunos asesinos como la legion no permitan a los supervivientes jugar y disfrutar del juego. en cambio hay habilidades que las han nerfeado y no tienen sentido alguno. Por ejemplo si adrenalina hace que cuando se repare el ultimo motor te cures, porque cuando estas a hombros del asesino no te curas? Un sin sentido la verdad. A ver si lo arreglan porque es injugable el juego","timestamp_created":1651340449,"timestamp_updated":1651340449,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499251872301101685","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114732653","author":{"steamid":"76561199093736162","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":2700,"last_played":1660413980},"language":"german","review":"I think we did a PRETTY GOD JOB SO FAR\nThats why you have to play the game ;)","timestamp_created":1651339985,"timestamp_updated":1651339985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114732327","author":{"steamid":"76561199038172189","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1365,"last_played":1657909984},"language":"german","review":"nice gameplay","timestamp_created":1651339591,"timestamp_updated":1651339591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114731493","author":{"steamid":"76561198854645723","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8441,"last_played":1655363855},"language":"german","review":"Ich bin Schwul","timestamp_created":1651338568,"timestamp_updated":1651338568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlNzcvYADdZ7VtQM="}
