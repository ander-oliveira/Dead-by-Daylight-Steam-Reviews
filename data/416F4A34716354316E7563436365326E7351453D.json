Here I am after 1000+ hours with my review. I'm gonna start off with this: this game is changing pretty much always. When I first started playing Dead by Daylight the meta was completely different than it is now. That, and the community is different. My first impression of the people who played this game, was that everyone is an elitist and that if I wanted to play this game I should play with friends because random players were usually jerks. Nowadays I feel like the community is more welcoming and the devs are very involved. So without further ado I'm gonna start with the cons of this game, and then end on a lighter note with the pros and an overall summary.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b] \n[list] [*] There are a ton of bugs in this game that completely ruin this game some times. Something I find astounding given how many years this game has been out. One notable bug being the one where you start a trial and you can't move or do anything besides crouch. So you either sit there and teabag and make the killer angry, or you leave the game and get the other survivors angry for leaving the game. It's a lose lose, and it's not like there's an in-game voice chat (or any chat for that matter.) So you would have to wait until post game chat, or get into Discord with the other survivors to explain yourself before you get reported. Which leads me to the next con.\n[*]There's no in-game voice chat, and the only way to convey a message is by pointing or telling someone to come with you by pressing 1 or 2. That and there's a universal code that if someone is on the hook and they're moving their arms up and down, they are being camped. If you're a newer player you wouldn't know that though, so you would have to get into the forums or meet more experienced players to learn that.\n[*] There's no incentive to rank up after you've gotten the rank 1 achievements (if you even care about achievements.) So people who aren't interested in just facing Nurses and Spirits all the time tend to try and keep themselves from ranking up. So the common misconception that \"red rank players are the best players\" is completely wrong because all the good players have already been in red ranks and have no incentive to keep ranking up because we get no reward for playing the game to rank up.\n[*] There's a constant struggle with balancing the game for killers and survivors. Which is something that I think is going to be around until the game eventually dies. Devs hear the pleads of killers saying that a perk is overpowered and they nerf survivor perks. Then survivors will complain that killers are too overpowered and the killers perks will be nerfed. No one is ever happy, but we're all delightfully content with it being unbalanced. I mean that in the most sarcastic way possible.\n[/list]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list] [*] Devs are very involved and try to respond to most, if not all, of the community complaints and try to fix those for the most part. So bugs like the one I talked about in the cons section have a good chance of being fixed eventually. The developers also do dev streams pretty much every week to update the community about what changes are coming and events that are coming up. So it's hard to really hate the game because the people behind it are just so nice and understanding of the players' problems.\n[*] The community is very robust. Sure there are still trolls and elitists, but there are alot of nice players as well who are willing to help other players learn different play styles. This is apparent in the official forums, reddit, and the various streaming platforms like Youtube, Twitch, and Mixer. There's no one \"perfect\" way to play a killer or survivor. There are various builds and quirks to learn about in the game. Also, like I stated previously, the meta changes with time. It used to be that a survivor could run perks like self care, sprint burst, adrenaline, and decisive strike or vigil to get out, but nowadays that meta is completely gone. With all the various killers and survivors there is a huge pool of perks to use to change the way you play the game.\n[*] There's alot of content in this game, and there's more to be expected in the years to come. I know one of the dev streams stated that there is something like a 10 year plan to keep content coming to Dead by Daylight. We've evolved from just doing double bloodpoint weekends to doing awesome events that reward you with more than just bloodpoints, but also new cosmetics. Also, pretty much every season we get a new killer, survivor, and map. So there's always more to be excited for.\n[*] The new cosmetic system is awesome, and allows players to really express themselves. Also I like that cosmetic and DLC isn't locked behind a pay wall. You can unlock the DLC and cosmetics by just playing the game and earning bloodshards to buy those things. You can also earn teachable perks that way as well. So the game does reward you for playing the game. People who DO buy the DLC also get special bonus items for paying for them. So it really isn't bad. Thank god there aren't any loot boxes though.\n[/list] \n[b] Overall Summary: [/b]\nThis game has a weird way of making me love and hate it at the same time. However I recommend it because there are genuinely very cool people to meet in this community. From the devs to the streamers, there are alot of people who really care for this game and the people who play it. I would say if you get the chance to try the game before you buy it, definitely give it a try.

game is pretty superb, although with a few downsides.\n\n+Fun, gripping gameplay\nThere's two roles in this game, survivors and killers (4v1 in each match). No matter which one you play as, you'll always feel the other one is overpowered. This is a good thing, as it leaves you scrambling for any chance of a victory.\n\n+No specific win/loss\nIn most games of Dead by Daylight, you won't \"win\" (either kill all 4 survivors or escape), but you'll not usually lose either. Even if a couple people escape, you still win as the killer. Even if you die, as long as you contributed to the match (repaired a generator or two, or saved someone from a hook), you'll recieve a generous amount of bloodpoints. Most games end with 4 or all 5 players winning (although not a complete victory).\n\n+Almost infinite progression\nIt will take hundreds of hours for players to unlock everything, even for non-dlc characters. The system does rely on luck, but players will have to make choices between what perk they want to unlock for each character.\n\n*Slow, creeping gameplay\nThis is really great for survivors, it builds up the tension, but it can lead to a lot of boring games for killers.\n\n*Requirement of cooperation (as survivor)\nTo survive, you will almost certainly need to save your fellow teammates. While thata's great and all, it can lead to someone spending the entire game hooked, then dying, getting them almost no bloodpoints, people unhooking others during a chase, often getting the rescued person immediately killed, or an absolute bloodbath where all 4 survivors die trying to save one (which isn't too bad, at least for the killer)\n\n*No communication between teammates\nSurvivors can use a \"come here\" or \"go that way\" emote in game, but that's it. I think this is really good, but there's also a \"Survive with Friends\" mechanic that allows you to play with friends... against killers who can't choose between SWF groups and solo-queuers... so that makes the game incredibly unbalanced if you have friends.\n\n-Lack of dedicated servers\nEvery game is run on the killer's network. This leads to long loading times and lots of lag. If you can't stand the occasional laggy game, even if you have a great network, this might put you off Dead by Daylight\n\n-Toxic players\nThis game has a decent amout of survivors who disconnect, teabag, perform unsafe unhooks (killing the person they \"saved\" and get themselves killed ASAP. There's also some killers who facecamp and tunnel, although they're not quite as bad as some survivors. There's also a postgame chat where things can get pretty heated. If you can't handle this, maybe don't get this game.\n\nOverall, I certainly reccomend this game, just be prepared to get a bit pissed off at times while playing it.","timestamp_created":1542933175,"timestamp_updated":1542933175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46485697","author":{"steamid":"76561198056733245","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":23354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11690,"last_played":1650165936},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego estilo hide and seek, aunque mas complejo. \nDe superviviente con el pasar de las partidas y el entendimiento del juego se vuele demasiado sencillo.\nDe killer es otra la historia, demasiada desventaja, si tocan 4 survivors que saben jugar las probabilidades son muy bajas. \nEn menos de 10 min de partida pueden haber reparado todos los generadores y escapado.\nEl sistema de rangos creo que tiene que reeverse.

много времени прошло с момента появления игры в Steam.\nС тех пор было введено множество обновлений, включающие маньяков, выживших и карты.\nТа ли это игра, что вышла в далеком 2016 году? Однозначно, нет!\nНа сегодняшний день, Dead by Daylight представляет из себя огромный кроссплатформенный мир, в котором можно здорово повеселиться с друзьями (находясь при этом на разных платформах) или знатно подгореть от команды токсиков. Мир, в котором, как и в любой другой игре встречаются баги (а куда же без них).\n\nТак что же такое Dead by daylight - это постоянно развивающаяся и не стоящая на месте, но такая неоднозначная для множества её участников игра.\n\nТолько ступив на этот путь, ты познаешь, что такое страх. Будешь учиться попадать в скиллчеки и на первых парах, станешь считать, что край карты - это единственное спасение от маньяка. \nВторым шагом твоего мансерского становления, будет использование полосатых досок на карте, которые так здорово преграждают убийце путь, даже если в этот момент он находился на другом конце карты.\nТретьим шагом, ты поймешь, что эти полосатые доски, именуемые паллетами, отлично оглушают убийцу и оказывается, гораздо удобнее следить за действиями маньяка, оглядываясь во время бега.\nНу а дальше тебя уже будет не остановить. Окна, паллетки, фонарики, коронные приседания и фейки. На этом этапе, жертва - это убийца. Теперь это твоя игра!\n\nПосле пары сотен часов пропадает тот накал, та атмосфера хоррора, включается холодный расчет и теперь ты уже не чувствуешь себя беспомощным, ведь в твоем арсенале так много полезных предметов.\nТвоей ключевой задачей становится не сбежать, а как можно дольше отводить маньяка, как можно дольше сохранить палетку. Здесь начинаются своего рода соревнования, кто кого!","timestamp_created":1542932313,"timestamp_updated":1606335860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46483962","author":{"steamid":"76561198073756633","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2788,"last_played":1638874317},"language":"koreana","review":"dsdsdsdsds","timestamp_created":1542932247,"timestamp_updated":1542932247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46483618","author":{"steamid":"76561198194192893","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":28864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16536,"last_played":1652939728},"language":"spanish","review":"divertido
