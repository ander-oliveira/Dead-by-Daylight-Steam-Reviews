It's so abysmally tedious to even just level up one single character with the perks you want, to the point it took me 20 hours just to get 2 of the perks I wanted to use.\n- Many gameplay mechanics are never explained and extremely unintuitive. The game makes almost no effort in teaching new players how to play well, and instead often encourages bad gameplay habits. If you want to learn the game, you will have to rely on external resources just to cover all the basics.\n- The game is insanely unintuitive for new players. The learning curve is EXTREMELY steep. Not only do you need to learn the basics of playing as a survivor, which the game's tutorial barely covers, but you need to learn about every single killer, their perks, their add-ons, and their mechanics, on top of trying to figure out how your own perks work. With 26 different killers, each having 3 perks of their own alongside a dozen add-ons each, you are going to be overwhelmed and confused for most of your first games, and since most Killers are locked behind paywalls, you won't be able to play them yourself to get a better understanding unless you pay more money.\nWhile there are a lot of community-made resources to help learn the game faster, you're going to spend more time trying to read those guides and watching those videos than actually playing the game if you go with that route.\nCombine all of this with the complete lack of a training mode, the aforementioned lackluster tutorial, and the only gamemode being online PvP with an MMR system that doesn't even work, and you've got a recipe for a game that is extremely unfriendly for beginners an frustrating to learn.\n\nSpeaking of the MMR system; It doesn't even work.\nWhat is supposed to create balanced lobbies, instead looks more like completely random pickings - You could get paired up with survivors who have thousands of hours against a killer who just started, or you might end up with teammates who have barely started playing, going up against a killer with thousands of hours of experience. The matchmaking might as well be completely random, because it has no semblance of balance whatsoever and it results in most rounds being a completely one-sided stomp.\n\nThe game's performance is also pretty terrible, being extremely poorly optimized and even having performance issues such as severe FPS drops and stutters for something as minimal as mouse interpolation being set to a high value (the game only seems to support 500 and lower).\nThe default FPS cap is also only a measly 60FPS. This can be raised to 120 with some file changes, but most of the time you'll be struggling to reach that even with a decent PC.\n\nAll of this doesn't even touch on the community yet; While a handful of players are laid back and just trying to have fun, a lot of people in this game seem to make it their sole purpose in life to be as condescending and toxic as possible, all while maintaining an inflated ego bigger than the burj khalifa.\nIf you thought LoL or CS:GO were bad, DBD is going to give you a terminal disease with it's levels of toxicity - Everything bad that happens is always the opponent's fault, and everyone always knows better than anyone else what changes the game needs.\nSurvivors are constantly whining about Killers, and Killers are constantly whining about survivors, the incessant crying over the most menial things is all you will hear in the community hubs, along with perpetual trash talking of the dev studio.\nOn top of that, trolls and griefers are abundant and they [i]will[/i] find a way to screw over you and your team at any given opportunity.\n\nAll-in-all, the game might look cool and fun with lots of content, and I did enjoy playing it when I was queued up with friends, but I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who's looking to have a fun time on their own, because DBD does everything in it's might to ruin your experience at every turn.\nUnless you have 3-4 friends to consistently play with, Dead By Daylight is not worth your money.","timestamp_created":1640565462,"timestamp_updated":1641219767,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.709303677082061768","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106619980","author":{"steamid":"76561198907876643","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1655739412},"language":"brazilian","review":"da pra se divertir bastante","timestamp_created":1640565019,"timestamp_updated":1640565019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106619935","author":{"steamid":"76561198197921022","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1659818157},"language":"czech","review":" 100 %","timestamp_created":1640564974,"timestamp_updated":1640564974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106619712","author":{"steamid":"76561199214137650","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":856,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1660552107},"language":"thai","review":"ok","timestamp_created":1640564758,"timestamp_updated":1640564758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106618917","author":{"steamid":"76561198388449473","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":440,"playtime_at_review":16529,"last_played":1660518088},"language":"french","review":"good game ,","timestamp_created":1640563944,"timestamp_updated":1640563944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106618885","author":{"steamid":"76561198054224186","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":11774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11571,"last_played":1648221795},"language":"polish","review":"Its a great game until you get facecamped or tunneled, which unfortunately happens a lot at low ranks, but I guarantee if you get through that you will get a lot of fun and it doesnt happen that often later in the game\n\nAs killer its mainly you who dictates if the game is fun for the survivors, no matter what you do they will say you camp or tunnel anyway, so just ignore it, dont ruin other games because last survivors you had were toxic, have fun and let others have fun","timestamp_created":1640563910,"timestamp_updated":1640563910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106618863","author":{"steamid":"76561199006560069","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5897,"last_played":1658429320},"language":"english","review":"This game has given me something no one or thing else has given me, love and hatred.

Das zu allererst einmal, damit ich und meine Sicht auf dieses Spiel eingeordnet werden kann.\n\nWürde ich DbD empfehlen ? Nein. Nicht mehr.\n\nWarum nicht ?\n\nDie Grafik ist hervorragend, das Prinzip - ein asynchrones Multiplayer-Spiel, bei dem eine deutlich stärkere Seite gegen eine schwächere antritt - war seinerzeit revolutionär. Das Spiel wird  von den Entwicklern laufend angepasst und stetig weiterentwickelt und um (zu bezahlende) Inhalte erweitert.\nDas klingt auf den ersten Blick sehr gut.\n\nDas Prinzip ist leicht erklärt: es gibt einen Killer und vier Überlebende. Die Überlebende müssen 5 Generatoren reparieren, die Ausgangstore öffnen und das Level verlassen.\nDer Killer muss jeden Überlebenden an den im Level verteilten Haken aufhängen. Jeder, der drei mal gehangen hat und nicht von einem anderen Überlebenden wieder abgenommen wurde, wird dauerhaft aus der Runde entfernt. Ist kein Überlebender mehr dazu in der Lage den Hängenden abzunehmen oder zu entkommen, hat der Killer die Runde gewonnen.\n\nUm einen Überlebenden aufhängen zu können muss man ihn fangen, indem man an ihn heran kommt, ihn zwei mal trifft (nach dem ersten Treffer wird der Überlebende kurzzeitig schneller um den zweiten Treffer hinaus zu zögern) und somit zu Boden bringt. Anschließend hebt man ihn auf und bringt ihn zu einem Haken, wobei die anderen Überlebenden eingreifen können um dies zu verhindern.\n\nGanz einfach.\n\nJedoch ist in diesem Spiel, bei dem ein Killer gegen vier Überlebende spielt das Schlüsselwort \"asynchron\".\nMan sollte meinen, dass die Überlebenden die schwache Seite wären, die nur über Teamwork und Kommunikation gegen den starken Killer ankommen um ihre Zielvorgaben zu erfüllen und zu entkommen. \nDas Gegenteil ist der Fall.\n\nDie Entwickler verändern das Gleichgewicht der Kräfte seit dem Release kontinuierlich zugunsten der Überlebenden, die ca. 80% der Community ausmachen, wobei zum Zustandekommen einer Runde sowohl vier Überlebende als auch ein Killer notwendig sind. \n\nDas hat im Verlauf der Zeit dazu geführt, dass die Killer zu Witzfiguren gemacht wurden, die die Überlebenden - deren Spieler innerhalb der Community im Laufe der Jahre in zunehmenden Maße eine wirklich toxische Arroganz gewonnen haben - mit Leichtigkeit ausmanövrieren und dann in regelmäßigen Abständen besiegen. Es ist für Killer-Spieler eine Art Mobbing-Simulator geworden, bei dem sie der Prügelknabe sind, während man als Überlebender entspannt nebenbei noch andere Dinge tun kann, da das Entkommen so unendlich leicht ist.\n\nDie Level sind zugunsten der Survivor designt, die Fähigkeiten der Survivor stechen im Zweifelsfall die des Killers und da die Verbindungszeiten nicht absolut synchron laufen ist die derzeitige Einstellung, dass im Zweifelsfall (was überraschend häufig vorkommt) der Killer einen für ihn eindeutigen Treffer - also es spritzt Blut und der Überlebende schreit auf - nur sieht, dieser aber nicht gezählt wird. Der Überlebende also unverletzt bleibt.\n\nDas sorgt dafür, dass Teile der Community abwandern, neue Bezahl-DLCs zum Kundenfang herausgebracht werden, die Perks verändrt werden um neuen, unerfahrenen Survivorn leichte Siege zu ermöglichen, was einen weitere Abwanderung bedeutet - und da man Killer braucht um das Spiel zu spielen gehen die Gruppen-Suchzeiten trotz aller Versuche der Entwickler das Ganze per Statistiktricks bei der Priorisierung zu beeinflussen immer weiter in die Höhe.\n\nFrüher suchte man als Überlebender maximal 3-4 Minuten für eine Lobby und hatte dann maximal eine Minute Vorbereitungszeit bis zum Rundenbeginn. Heute kann man froh sein, wenn es so schnell geht, da immer weniger Killer da sind, und somit die Wartezeiten mit 5-7 Minuten jenseits der Neuzugangswellen an den Feiertagen normal werden. \nDas mag nicht nach viel klingen, aber es ist ein Trend, der spürbar wird, wenn man das Spiel länger spielt.\n\nKurzum: Behavior ist offen parteiisch innerhalb der Community bei deren Wünschen und Ratschlägen zur Weiterentwicklung des Spiels und zeigt in den letzten Jahren vor allem an einer Sache Interesse, ohne sich länger hinter irgendwelchen Feigenblättern zu verstecken: eurem Geld. Punkt.\n\nDas Spiel macht einfach keinen Spaß mehr, wenn der Beste, weil stressfreieste Teil, das Tutorial mit den Bots ist (ja, es gibt Bots im Spiel und die sind AUSSCHLIESSLICH im Tutorial, da Behavior fest in seiner Aussage ist, dass es keinen Singleplayer-Modus geben dürfe) und man als Killer-Spieler ganz offen gezeigt bekommt, dass man bloß ein Spieler 2. Klasse ist.\n\nInsbesondere seit der Boon-Totem-Mechanik, die mit dem DLC \"Hour of the Witch\" eingebracht wurden, ist das Spiel immer schneller zugunsten der Überlebenden verlagert worden. Mit allen Boni können Überlebende nun schneller geheilt werden, als die Abklingzeit der Standard-Schläge eines Killers sind und die Abschwächung der Killer wurde ebenfalls beschleunigt. Wir sind von einer linearen Entwicklung bei einer exponentiellen angekommen.\n\nZum Vergleich eine kleine Anekdote: ich war früher in der Lage auf regelmäßiger Basis als Main-Killer mit all meiner Erfahrung 3-4 Kills pro Runde zu schaffen (also 3 von vier bis hin zu allen vier Überlebenden auszuschalten). Heute kann ich froh sein, wenn ich 2 Haken - also aufgehängte, aber nicht ausgeschaltete Survivor habe.\nIch bin weder unerfahrener geworden, noch schlechter. Das ist das Ergebnis eines mangelnden Balancings, dass früher Erfahrung der Spieler ausgleichen konnte, aber das nun durch die Veränderung der Spielregeln zugunsten der Überlebenden ausgereizt wurde.\n\nDiese Review ist mein Abschied von diesem Spiel, dass ich jahrelang gespielt habe. Sicherlich habe ich einen gewissen Bias, \n dass will ich gar nicht leugnen. Ich bin enttäuscht und es einfach leid von arroganten Survivor-Spielern das Gegenstück zum gestreckten Mittelfinger - das sogenannte Tea-baggen - gezeigt zu bekommen, da diese aus der Leichtigkeit des Entkommens, die ihnen die immer mächtigeren, neuen Fähigkeiten geben, eine wertende Überlegenheit ableiten, die nicht nur unbegründet ist, sondern auch den Spieler des Killers ganz bewusst herabwerten.\n\nIch war hier auf Steam stets der Meinung, dass man am meisten über ein Spiel aus den Negativ-Rezensionen lernen kann. Daher wollte ich dies nicht unter den Tisch fallen lassen, für alle, die sich nicht sicher sind, ob sie es sich holen wollen oder nicht.\n\nIch rate ab, da ich nicht glaube, dass die Entwickler dieses Spiels die Kurve noch einmal kriegen werden. Sie hatten vor Jahren eine harte Lektion erhalten, als einer von ihnen das eigene Spiel gegen erfahrene Überlebende spielen sollte (und meine Güte hat er damals auf den Sack gekriegt) und im Anschluss das Balancing verbessert. Aber sie haben sie mittlerweile wieder vergessen.\nDaher steht das Spiel momentan vor dem Weg, dass die Killer weniger werden, die Überlebenden warten müssen um die Runde zu beginnen und dieses Missverhältnis sich immer weiter einfrisst, bis es kippen und das Spiel zugrunde gehen wird, weil es niemanden mehr gibt, der seine Zeit darin investieren will.","timestamp_created":1640556829,"timestamp_updated":1640556829,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551470577716827393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106610610","author":{"steamid":"76561199002496755","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":841,"playtime_at_review":2944,"last_played":1660360843},"language":"english","review":"No\n","timestamp_created":1640555909,"timestamp_updated":1640555909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106610355","author":{"steamid":"76561198846779219","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":69696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":459,"playtime_at_review":62600,"last_played":1660160834},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu assez répétitif qui peut-être lassant, mais qui reste très sympa à jouer seul ou accompagné !

can't imagine a game with so much potential and how good the game could. All the bad drags it down such as bad practices such as making it take so long to get killers or survivors with shards. As well making cosmetics so expensive to buy with shards or real money. Especially with licensed killers where i understand they have to make back the money for the licensed but also don't give the opportunity to buy any licensed killers cosmetics with earned in game shards. So if you paid 5 dollars for a DLC you must pay another 10 dollars to get one skin for Leather face or The pig aka Saw. As well as the balance in this game that has killed killer players number as survivor que time is about 5 minutes and killer que time is 20 seconds. Since no one wants to play underpowred killers. At this rate i think i'm more powerful then some killers in game that get bothered with a flashlight so much or someone bumping into them. \n\nTLDR Behaviour please do better in almost everything in this game such as balance and pricing of skins.","timestamp_created":1640548838,"timestamp_updated":1640548838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106601332","author":{"steamid":"76561198172083417","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":156857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":265,"playtime_at_review":147488,"last_played":1660351671},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun, but very unbalanced.","timestamp_created":1640547988,"timestamp_updated":1640547988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106601254","author":{"steamid":"76561199185385783","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":62,"playtime_at_review":6413,"last_played":1659636794},"language":"russian","review":"короче игра топ но есть тимейты дауны которые не могут  спасти с  крюка и которые не умеют играть совет \nтаким дауном УДОЛЯЙТЕ ИГРУ","timestamp_created":1640547902,"timestamp_updated":1640547902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106601017","author":{"steamid":"76561198863391819","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2012,"last_played":1657482674},"language":"english","review":"Good and fun game to play with friends and by yourself lots of variety in the killers and survivors and a good ranking system to match it","timestamp_created":1640547698,"timestamp_updated":1640547698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106599754","author":{"steamid":"76561198918634211","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1646176218},"language":"english","review":"dont even understand why i was postitive about this game its not fun at all and the community is just bad","timestamp_created":1640546679,"timestamp_updated":1640546679,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106599745","author":{"steamid":"76561198176718277","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":39,"playtime_at_review":6499,"last_played":1660446420},"language":"brazilian","review":"ótimo pra passar raiva <3","timestamp_created":1640546673,"timestamp_updated":1640546673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106599302","author":{"steamid":"76561198863796469","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1642871422},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor Game survival multiplayer\n","timestamp_created":1640546302,"timestamp_updated":1640546302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106599196","author":{"steamid":"76561198287515164","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":33355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":9446,"last_played":1659899179},"language":"english","review":"LOVE this game!

senti mais do que suficiente os perks são bons e a leatherface é interessante.\n\n- sobre os sobreviventes, os de graça já faz uma build muito boa sem precisar gastar muito tempo, não faz diferença os sobrevivente já que ele são a mesma coisa só mudando as skin e perks iniciais mas se vc colocar todos lv 50 não muda muito de um para o outro\n\n- eu diria que vale a pena o game por 39,99 mas ele sai em promoção muitas vezes onde já peguei ele por 15 reais e atualmente ele tem saído por 20, \n\n- eu amo esse game e desejo uma boa experiencia caso decida comprar, independente de killer ou
