constantly trying to find a good balance*\nGraphics and sound - more than playable at minium, but max settings are NOT required to be sucsessful\n\nAs a final note, this game is definatly worth some time to play and learn, new killers and survivors are being added to add new ways to play. \n*Because of pevious updates and perks, balnce can be hard and the devs try there best to appeal to all

When I originally wrote this review, I really didn't see any positive direction in the game, but now it appears the developers are pursuing betterment of the game! For that reason, I do recommend this game ON ON OF THREE CONDITIONS.\n\n(1) You have friends OR anticipate making friends that play this game. This game is LOADS more fun with friends. The only reason I play it is because of that.\n\n(2) You are genuinely interested in the horror genre/ love horror icons.\n\n(3) You get it at a sale. \n\nIf one of those three apply it is an easy sell, otherwise I would consider it a hard maybe.\n\n-------------------\nI used to love this game a lot! I think that I am sort of jaded, and I have a little over 500 hours on the game. I have purchased DLC for it, and there are a few cosmetic things that got ahold of me. If you are planning to play this game with a few friends and have fun here and there then it's def the game for you! I got into the game, but the more I played it the more bugs I have found that haven't been resolved. Furthermore, it seems that the developer has opted for a pseudo \"pay to win\" by having specific perks tied to DLC only characters who must be purchased with real money as opposed to in game currency (which there are three of by the way). \n\nThe game hasn't changed much since I've gotten it, and from my understanding it hasn't changed since launch all that much. You will experience the inevitable bad-mannered killers that will make it virtually impossible for survivors to have fun because they \"hook you\" and stare at you so your friends can't come and save you OR they can but they immediately go down. \n\nThat's not to say that the game isn't fun! I just find those moments to be fleeting, whereas I used to love playing this game daily, it infuriates me too much now a days with toxic survivors and toxic killers that both strive to make the other angry. That, coupled with the developer focusing on cosmetics (at $10 an outfit) to get quick cash as opposed to fixing the bugs, this game has personally run its course for me. But I did get my money's worth, I've played this game for 500 hours! \n\nOn a true scale of 1-10 where 5 is truly average, I give this game a straight 5; 6 if you plan to play with friends.","timestamp_created":1611102019,"timestamp_updated":1655761903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85004598","author":{"steamid":"76561198828229428","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3263,"last_played":1651751587},"language":"russian","review":"Сейвы хорошо откатывают прогресс.

There's no in-between. The fact that the only gameplay mechanic is generators is also a bit boring, dull, and downright repetitive. This is primarily due to the clueless matchmaking system, but also just the way the game is set up to play.\n\nI do somewhat enjoy the game, but the mechanics and \"cash-grab\" DLC and skins are just laughable. Being this is Behaviour Interactive Inc.'s \"One Hit Wonder\" it's no surprise they're milking it for all they can, it would just be nice if they spent more time adding different gameplay elements (perhaps an entirely different mode altogether).\n\nOverall the game is a decent grinding experience, but only with friends (unless you play Killer). However, where the game falls flat is with the developers unwillingness to add more balanced features or experiment with ideas. There are certain numerous items and perks in the game that are utterly, and painfully useless (both for Killer and Survivor).","timestamp_created":1611097398,"timestamp_updated":1611097398,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85001836","author":{"steamid":"76561198834160005","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1651608994},"language":"spanish","review":"s","timestamp_created":1611097177,"timestamp_updated":1611097177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85001798","author":{"steamid":"76561198319434875","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3006,"last_played":1658086434},"language":"english","review":"hella fun and runs very well","timestamp_created":1611097137,"timestamp_updated":1611097137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85001445","author":{"steamid":"76561199095859133","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":160591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":388,"playtime_at_review":96505,"last_played":1660424429},"language":"english","review":"basically\n\nupdate: basically","timestamp_created":1611096502,"timestamp_updated":1638637798,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85001335","author":{"steamid":"76561198808209067","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":4126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1651259817},"language":"turkish","review":"Sarıyo","timestamp_created":1611096312,"timestamp_updated":1611096312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85001217","author":{"steamid":"76561198260712502","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":28996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":640,"playtime_at_review":20042,"last_played":1660594250},"language":"polish","review":"Gut Gut","timestamp_created":1611096143,"timestamp_updated":1611096143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85000861","author":{"steamid":"76561199130169210","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1641024869},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo com mais bug's q eu mais gosto de jogar!!","timestamp_created":1611095602,"timestamp_updated":1611095602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513888895511627197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85000755","author":{"steamid":"76561199040638544","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":74,"playtime_at_review":1806,"last_played":1660037432},"language":"spanish","review":"no te tiltea a menos que el asesino te empiece a tunelear xd","timestamp_created":1611095391,"timestamp_updated":1611095391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85000702","author":{"steamid":"76561198247323348","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":10010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1188,"last_played":1651006126},"language":"english","review":"fix the lobbies (1/19/2021)\n\nThis new update is so bad, the hud is great but the hitbox and the bugs are bad(2/16/2021)","timestamp_created":1611095287,"timestamp_updated":1613503293,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85000660","author":{"steamid":"76561198116954773","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":47286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":331,"playtime_at_review":11379,"last_played":1660406616},"language":"english","review":"I spend way too much time in this game lol.

Идея игры хорошая, много разных маньяков и выживших. У каждого маньяка свой геймплей, не нравится один взял другого. Оптимизация тоже не плоха, но нужно учитывать, что для такой игры нужно как можно больше fps. Ну и без багов никуда... Сурвы могут застрять в шкафах, земле и стенах. Система рангов не работает, да и смысла прокачивать свой ранг нет, только если хотите похвастаться перед пацанами на райончике. Мачмейкинг - это как русская рутелка, повезëт или нет, вы можете играть на 20 ранге и вам попадëтся топ ман на 1м ранге. Или же играете вы на выживших у вас 1й ранг и вам попадается 20- 15 ранги как на Мане так и на сурвах. Радует, то что над системой рангов начали работать, и я надеюсь что дбд будет дальше процветать. Стоит ли брать эту игру? Это решать вам, но если она вам понравилась и вы готовы терпеть токсичность комьюнити, то вперëд!","timestamp_created":1611087002,"timestamp_updated":1611087002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmZeRjvcCcridxAI="}
