如果你一开始玩人类疯狂开局三挂，可以考虑玩玩屠夫。但如果国服环境很差导致你每场都毫无体验，可以考虑换服。\n2.游戏设置默认是60帧并且开启了垂直同步，有需要144hz或者关闭垂直同步可以去贴吧精品贴看教程或者直接百度。\n3.有些地图会非常的黑，可以考虑提高屏幕亮度和将画面的色彩饱和度降低等方式。 这个比较麻烦，但如果屏幕自带FPS模式开启效果会好很多。\n4.关于游戏萌新上手，人类技能都是可以传承的也就是后期哪个人物都一样，屠夫有自己的专属技能。萌新屠夫优先推荐夹子

The only reason I remain playing the game is because of it's remarkable potential, and my friends who play the game as well. I will go over the major problems of the game that, if fixed, would hoist this game to an incredibly fun level.\n\nThe most glaring issue with Dead by Daylight besides the playerbase is the mechanically broken hitboxes that can be increasingly dissatisfying for both survivor players and killer players. It's unbelievable how degressed hitboxes have become since the initial release of the game many years ago. Nowadays, it is almost very common to be hit by a weapon that is noticably far away and not making contact, yet it is still frustrating every single time. And as killers, hitboxes involving hook techs and dedicated server lag also leave you questioning the commitment the developers have to making this game great. Hitboxes are a relatively easy fix to the game, and doing so would greatly improve the experience and leave players of all strengths much more satisfied, and it is perplexing that these have no been fixed yet.\n\nThe second most obvious issue is the playerbase and Behaviour's lack of enforcement and punishment of rulebreakers and toxic behavior. Problems such killers tunneling survivors or face camping are deliberate sabotage of another player's experience in the game, which is bad for business if anything, and it's shocking Behaviour has little enforcement of players abusing these issues. Countless times killers have targeted me, for no other reason other than their self satisfaction, and tunneled me while blatantly ignoring survivors or objectives as a whole. This behavior is glaringly toxic and ruins gameplay for many players and discourages new players from joining, but as of right now it is not punished for some unknown reason. There is not much that needs to be said for toxic behavior other than that enforcement is needed to cultivate a more welcoming and fair environment for new and veteran players alike.\n\nThere is other minor issues in the game right now such as balance but most of that is subject to opinion. With the current state of the game anyhow, I HIGHLY do NOT recommend playing Dead by Daylight as the experience is 90% of the time only frustrating and unenjoyable. With commitment to fixing the problems listed above, however, I think this game has amazing potential to be a very fun game.","timestamp_created":1578442988,"timestamp_updated":1578443033,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507220208644866943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61498399","author":{"steamid":"76561198091326469","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1594793443},"language":"english","review":"The game has improved a lot.

Until some things change in the developers mindset, its not worth it.\nThis game is the definition of \"Good Idea, Bad Execution\"\nit could be so much better if the developers would actually try to balance the game instead of fixing what isn't broken and ignoring the actual problems (Gen repair speed has been a problem for YEARS now, and then they decide to nerf the one thing that actually helped with it? They do not care about their fan-base). I hope some other studio buys this game and fixes it, because these fuckers have no idea what they're doing\n\nBut the game has its ups.
