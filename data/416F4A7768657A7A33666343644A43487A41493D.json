The developers announce features and then release a public test beta. They ignore all feedback, they don't care if things are broken. The excuse is always they want to test in live and get a larger base of feedback. This leads to them releasing broken patches every single patch and then fixing some issues and leaving a large amount of patches. They generally fix bugs more then a year later unless it's a major bug. They've recently broken the UI, broken player models, broken hit boxes, broken killers, broken perks. All of these things were complained about before the recent PTB, during the PTB and now in live. The developers only care about the money, not the player base. That's why they leave bugs in and push DLC constantly.\n\nSave yourself some money and buy a different

Потому что дэфолт быстро надоедает.[/i]\n\n[u]-Расскажи про сердце игры.[/u]\n\n[i]-Игре уже 5 лет, говорить здесь уже не о чем, время её уже прошло. Ждём в этом году замену. Первые месяц(два) страшно и сидишь в одном месте с в давленной кнопкой Ctrl. И ждёшь пока маньяк будет занят другим игроком что-бы начать чинить генератор. А уже после года жанр хоррор пропадает и для вас игра становится просто как обычная другая игра. Скучная, потому что вы знаете как сделать так что-бы маньяк вас не заметил когда вы у него за спиной, а не так как в первые дни игры, слышишь пугающую музыку и уже ищешь глазами где по близости ящик находится что-бы в лесть в его.[/i]\n\n[u]-Но ты же играешь?[/u]\n\n[i]-Играю, потому что играла я всё время на телефоне в её а потом мне её подарил друг что-бы я играла с ним вот так. Могу сказать только одно, это игра ещё находится в раннем доступе. Оптимизация на телефоне лучше в 100 раз. Так что долга игра у меня эта не протянет, удалю с выходом новой игры в релиз.[/i]\n\n[u]-Но всё же...[/u]\n\n[i]-О господи, отрицательный отзыв был бы сразу поставлен и без этого текста если бы не забросили сюда парочку DLC с моими любимчиками.

É simples, existem duas classes para os jogadores: os sobreviventes, e os assassinos. O objetivo dos sobreviventes é reparar 5 geradores de energia espalhados pelo mapa para assim poderem abrir a saída e escaparem vivos, enquanto o objetivos do assassino é impedir a conclusão dos geradores e matar todos os 4 sobreviventes vivos na partida.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nA jogabilidade de Dead By Daylight parece ser “Ez” para o assassino numa primeira impressão, isso se não houvesse barricadas e janelas que formam um sistema chamado de “loop” para assim atrasar o assassino e concluir os geradores. Enquanto cada assassino possui uma habilidade única e distinta para ganhar vantagem sobre o sobrevivente e quebrar o seu “loop” fazendo-o cair no chão mais rápido e colocá-lo em um gancho (se um sobrevivente for enganchado três vezes, ele é morto e eliminado do jogo) para que você, o assassino, possa ir logo atrás de sua próxima vítima. Existe também as chamadas “perks”, que te possibilitam ganhar vantagem sobre seu oponente, em diversas situações de jogo, tanto para sobrevivente, como para assassino, podem jogar até com quatro perks que possibilitam um leque de estratégias e jogadas para se ganhar a partida. Sem falar nos itens usados pelos sobreviventes que os ajudam em sua gameplay, sendo eles:\n\n- Kit Médico: Ajuda o sobrevivente a se curar sozinho, e a curar mais rápido seus colegas de equipe.\n- Caixa de Ferramentas: Ajuda a quebrar os ganchos preservando a vida dos seus colegas, e também reparar geradores mais rápido.\n- Lanterna: Cega o assassino, permitindo o sobrevivente tomar distância e se esconder do assassino, e também liberta outro sobrevivente do ombro do assassino caso ele seja cegado enquanto estiver levando o sobrevivente ao gancho.\n- Chave: Abre a escotilha, uma rota de fuga alternativa caso não seja possível reparar os 5 geradores.\n\n[h1]Gráficos[/h1]\n\nPor se tratar de uma empresa pequena e independente, os gráficos de Dead By Daylight não são lá uma obra de arte, mas são aceitáveis e vem sendo melhorados conforme o tempo desde seu lançamento. O game já está no seu quinto aniversário, e se for comparado atualmente com suas primeiras versões, o game já evoluiu muito com o passar do tempo.\n\n[h1]Comunidade[/h1]\n\nInfelizmente o jogo possui uma comunidade tóxica, que não parece melhorar e é mimada pela Behaviour (desenvolvedora do game). Vale ressaltar que além de um gênero survivor horror, o game necessita de estratégia por conta de seus elementos de gameplay. Porém a comunidade chorona adora ficar mandando na gameplay de outros jogadores como: “Não pode tunelar!”, “Não pode campar!”, ou até mesmo: “Não pode gen rush!”, “Não pode usar comunicação por voz!” (Tunelar: focar em um sobrevivente para eliminá-lo o mais rápido possível do jogo. Campar: ficar perto do gancho para que evitar o salvamento do sobrevivente. Gen rush: terminar os geradores o mais rápido possível). E outra causa que fortalece esse “choro” por parte da comunidade é a própria desenvolvedora, que adora desbalancear seu jogo, buffando a classe sobrevivente, deixando a gameplay muito difícil para a classe assassino, tudo a fim de sugar o máximo de dinheiro dos players, sem se preocupar com a saúde do jogo.\n\n[h1]Considerações Finais[/h1]\n\nA premissa de Dead By Daylight é sim, muito boa, porém a execução já não dá pra dizer o mesmo. Dependendo do seu gosto, você poderá enjoar fácil do game, como também poderá jogar por horas e horas. Você vai sim, passar raiva com certas situações dentro do jogo (tunnel, camping, gen rush, comunicação), vai ser xingado por jogadores tóxicos, vai perder partidas por conta do desbalanceamento e vai sofrer de bugs que podem atrapalhar sua gameplay. Como também você poderá se divertir com seus amigos, provavelmente vai rir de jogadas mal feitas dos seus (ou seu) oponentes, e irá aprender cada vez mais sobre o game conforme for jogando. A cada 3 meses é lançado novos personagens com novas perks e skins (sim, você pode customizar seu sobrevivente, ou assassino), o que volta o jogo a se tornar relevante e atrai novos jogadores e também jogadores antigos que tinham parado por algum motivo.\n\nBy:

Broken desync hit-boxes (which of right now was and still is in since 4.5.1) will probably consist until 4.5.2 at minimum, at most it won't be fixed until we complain again. If you want basically up to date news on BHVR's bullshit then I suggest popping in and checking Scott Jund's channel. Check out his content as well as he's genuinely a hilarious guy.\n\n-- If you are playing on patch 4.5.x (from 0 to whenever they fix Desync) --\nThere are a lot of things you will need to understand about what's been going on. Survivors are having Desync issues where the killer is a couple of feet behind where they actually are. BHVR has heard us as of writing this but previously they didn't listen to what people said about the PTB or didn't have enough time to revert it. They need to learn to take their time on updates and actually listen to their community. They also need to stop putting in things that NOBODY wanted or asked for. Don't get me wrong, the new UI was a little bit of eye-candy but it's all-over the place and generally isn't good for a competitive scene/feel. I get REALLY competitive in this game and I want to keep improving but now 'n days, it seems impossible. I play both Survivor and Killer, both with their fair share of issues. Right now, the main problems are Survivors getting Desync and (I have no idea if they boosted the chance of this but) survivors plundering a key by chance without any luck increasing perks/offerings. If you are planning to get this game then search up what BHVR has done and make sure the Desync issue is fixed. If you don't then you will regret getting this game. I would say they are prioritizing the next update to fix Desync issues but last few things I saw from their twitter was an slightly updated UI and a profanity filter on post-game chat which really doesn't matter at all.\n\nP.S. BHVR can't revert to a previous build because they don't keep them. They should keep the previous build of very build they make just in case this happens again. (Or better yet, BHVR needs a hard-drive or a database to keeping old builds in so they can revert stuff) No builds means everything is final and that's disorganized as fuck.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-- If you are playing when Desync is fixed --\nCongratulations... If you are a vet. player reading this in which case... great job on surviving this shit-storm. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck playing this game. You are probably going to have to try to suck up as much BP as possible to catch up (I would suggest trying to get Doctor with Barbecue and Chilli, Distressing and maybe two other perks as soon as possible) and be prepared for the game to take a turn for the worst every single time BHVR updates the game. BHVR may have fixed possibly by far the WORST update in DBD history (as of writing this) but they probably are going to find some way of fucking it up so hard, they will make it even worse.\n\nIf you aren't up for being stressed out then I would suggest playing literally anything else. At the start, you will feel discouraged, the community will treat you like garbage and it's really gonna suck but once you get enough to get anywhere in the game (which to be honest, I still don't really even know when that is other than maybe just unlocking all teachables) then you might have a little bit of fun playing this. If you don't have a lot of time on your hands though then it's better to play something else like Civilization. (DBD meme. lol)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn short, this game had a LOT of promise and even got Pyramid-Head in the game but the BHVR team (as of writing this) is lazy as fuck and put minimal effort into DBD. If you are still insistent on buying this game then I wish you the best of luck and welcome to hell. Watch some Otzdarva to get started as he is VERY educational about this game.\n\nSorry this was quite long but I am genuinely pissed off at BHVR and this stupid game right now and I just want to warn everyone of the dangers of getting into this game.

I was aware of the issues it had but they didn't really affect me and I still had a lot of fun playing this game. But the more hours I played, the more these things become unavoidable.\n\nThe core game design is flawed in that the most effective strategy for both sides is really boring. For survivor: hold m1 on gens for as much of the match as possible, play really safe in chases, use god loops, predrop pallets. For killer: focus on killing off one survivor as early as possible and secure a 3v1, camp, don't engage in chases that will be difficult.\n\nThe most effective strategies of both killer and survivor is to show your skill as little as possible. So basically a tryhard 3k hour player plays very similar to a 50 hour player that has no clue what the're doing. Incredible game design, super interactive /s\n\nYou can't even be mad at a killer facecamping you when there's literally no incentive to go anywhere else on the map, and in fact you'd be actively disadvantaging yourself if you did. Just camp a hook in a 3-gen 4head. What the fuck are they gonna do? Choke themselves by doing all the other gens?\n\nAnd what's even worse is that killers aren't even objectively strong. The same thing happens on the survivor side. You can play a game of DBD where both sides feel like they've lost and that the game is unfair for them.

They Reverted the new survivor animations so it's back to normal which is perfect. They updated the HUD so it is no longer awful and everywhere on the screen AND they made it so you could increase or decrease the size of the skill check HUD which is amazing. I am leaving my previous review up but I am back to being happy with this game.\n\n\nIt pains me to write this review because DbD is one of my favorite games of all time. But this recent update where BHVR update the UI, and new player animations is just awful. The new map changes are pretty good but that's the only good part and it isn't enough to salvage the BS that is going on. The UI is god awful, why is it even remotely close to where you SHOULD be looking at on the screen, it should be conveniently placed at the bottom of the screen where it isn't bugging anyone and won't get in the way sometimes if you are looking at a certain angle and a killer/ survivor happens to be there. The animations... take the cake by a landslide. Why do the survivors stand up like they just got yelled at for bad posture? It looks like they aren't scared when originally their stances somewhat implied tension and worry that there is a killer hunting them. You can't turn around without spending a quarter (or half, idk I didn't time it) of a second, and that is too long, by that time the killer has already lunged at you before their red stain has touched you and you've been hit. It feels like the survivors BACK hitbox has been extended by 3-5 feet depending on the killer... It's getting to the point where it is unplayable. After all of that BS I wanted to check the reviews, my mind was blown at how many positive reviews I saw. Now granted I am pretty sure it's a record high for both negative AND positive.. but I checked both of them out. The positive reviews are (mostly) from people with ~30 hours on record who have 1 review, no profile picture, roughly 5 games at max, and who say one sentence responses like \"good game\" or \"fun to play with friends.\" and there are a BUNCH of those types of reviews while if you check the negative reviews... they are well thought out reviews with people that have 500+ hours. It kinda makes me think BHVR paid people to make bot accounts to balance out the negative tsunami they were expecting. I am sad that the devs went through with this update, the game was fantastic prior to this dreadful update. To everyone who read through this long review just go compare the reviews of positive and negative for yourself. It's just disappointing.","timestamp_created":1613766597,"timestamp_updated":1614455427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87048674","author":{"steamid":"76561199018862357","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":33773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1660095098},"language":"english","review":"It's Nice!","timestamp_created":1613766179,"timestamp_updated":1613766179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87048594","author":{"steamid":"76561198153931799","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5302,"last_played":1620355262},"language":"english","review":"Memeburgular bad player.","timestamp_created":1613766092,"timestamp_updated":1613766092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87048298","author":{"steamid":"76561198858367737","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1635967891},"language":"english","review":"thank","timestamp_created":1613765763,"timestamp_updated":1613765763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87048074","author":{"steamid":"76561198345541531","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":15276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1621085397},"language":"turkish","review":"müq","timestamp_created":1613765535,"timestamp_updated":1613765535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87047800","author":{"steamid":"76561198319908553","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42695,"last_played":1657991600},"language":"english","review":"maybe fix the hitboxes but the rest is good","timestamp_created":1613765214,"timestamp_updated":1613765214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87047642","author":{"steamid":"76561198810335684","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28927,"last_played":1646889283},"language":"spanish","review":"La última actualización es una basura ¿de que sirven los pallets si el asesino te puede pegar a través de ellos?
