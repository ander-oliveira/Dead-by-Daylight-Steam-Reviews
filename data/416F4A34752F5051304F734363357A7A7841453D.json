This game can be pretty fun, but also can be very annoying to play. It's a mix bag of good and bad points that you can probably easily read from other reviewers out there. The only 2 key issues to be perfectly frank is slight balancing issues (you need specific perks if you want to get very far) and some of the community toxicity (which is to be expected in practically any Player vs player game).\n\nAs long as you don't take most of the people that just start randomly cursing you out, it only really leaves one issue of certain killers being better than others and specific perks being ran because they're practically required most of the time.\n\nNow then, my perspective on both playing Killer and Survivor...\n\nKillers tend to be more entertaining to play as since if you play well enough without actually sitting 2 centimeters next to the guy you just hook to have a staring contest with, it can be satisfying to actually get a win out of it, or at least be happy with the points you get after the match finishes. As long as you get enough separate hooks out of all of them, it can usually be more than what you can earn as a survivor. Just be sure to face a wall when you pick someone up and avoid trying to do it near a pallet if you can.\n\nSurvivors on the other hand, in early rankings you can have a somewhat easy time since some killers are either just doing their dailies or just getting used to playing something new. Mid-ranks tend to be a tad more difficult as to be expected and High ranking being near impossible for someone that doesn't have all the high ranking perks.\n[Most of this however can be made indefinitely easier with the right Survive with Friends group which can be easily found on the Dead by Daylight Discord or with your own friends that may own the game.]\n\nAll in all, the game can be really fun. Just some people rather ruin the fun for others with petty insults. Just ignore those kinds of people and always be sure to at least drop a gg.","timestamp_created":1561780649,"timestamp_updated":1561780649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51632228","author":{"steamid":"76561198035290794","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":243024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2005,"playtime_at_review":71051,"last_played":1660571629},"language":"english","review":"pretty

DBD started out a really good game but after time the developers stopped listening to the community and just totally wrecked the game. Killers still get the hit if you pallet drop. There are very few pallets now than there were in the beginning. The has been completely handed to the killer. The community is soooo toxic, it just makes you so sick to even play. This game  is a perfect example of developers trashing a good game. Now that they have added END GAME, and here is my take on how stupid it is. If you are the last survivor and the hatch opens, forget it. The killer shuts the hatch immediately which leaves you to proceed to the doors, forget that too. Killer camps both doors, sooo... game is already handed to the killer. End Game was a horrible idea to force the survivors out. \nSurvivor perks are worthless  since garbage killers use at least 3 perks to see where survivors are at all times. And your going to run into those killers 99.9% of the time. Lobbies suck since 9 out of 10 lobbies you get with a killer in China.. so yeah 300-400 ping; with no region restrictions. It's too easy to be killer these days since perks allow you to see where everyone is and there is no balance. \nI would advise not to buy this game at all, spend your hard earned money on something else that is better and where a developer actually listens to the community and cares about its fans.\nPRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR.?

You have some casual players, and some who want competition, and then the fact that the game is, by engine, going to be biased towards survivor, with how many more survivor only players there are then killer. When you have a 4v1 asymmetrical game like this, majority of the playerbase will be that 4, so patches and balance tend to lean towards them, as they also complain the most. That being said, all things considered, including the spaghetti code, balance issues, bugs, and overall let downs of new content, I do think the devs are on their way to improving the game, just very slowly. Truthfully even as I said many bad things about it, the game is easily one of my favourites, and has only become more fun with the deeper knowledge gained from playing. I hope the developers continue to take risks rather than making small, insignificant changes, and aren't afraid to get backlash for making another strong killer or really shaking up the experience. We've already seen some mobile games that are clones of DBD, and they have some very interesting ideas. I personally, would love to see this genre explored outside of BHVR, but for now, they've done a pretty good.... Job so far.","timestamp_created":1561779466,"timestamp_updated":1561779466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51622598","author":{"steamid":"76561198085723524","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":85372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2623,"playtime_at_review":69450,"last_played":1660418273},"language":"russian","review":"shit","timestamp_created":1561779453,"timestamp_updated":1657219131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519774019718170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51622442","author":{"steamid":"76561198068263774","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":38173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":182,"playtime_at_review":20783,"last_played":1660268645},"language":"english","review":"great game, got it when it first came out and it has greatly improved over the years.
