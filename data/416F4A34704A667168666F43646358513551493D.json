My critiques in the first paragraph have mostly only gotten worse between even worse bugs and some maps that have been disabled seemingly 4 out of the last 5 months and now a perk that has been disabled less than a day after release because it's utterly broken in that rng can make it literally uncounterable depending on totem spawn locations. Further with the introduction of skill-based matchmaking (in an asymmetrical game with one side being demonstrably stronger than the other) that yes, makes the game easier on beginners but utterly unfun after you hit a certain time investment. Add this to growing issues with hackers that never seem to be dealt with, external controversies with voice lines being removed, characters being removed from purchase, and an entire fiasco involving NFTs and you get a game that has an awesome concept get absolutely ran into the ground because greed. Seriously, save your money and your time and don't make the mistake I did getting sucked into this dumpster fire\n\n                                       ___________________________________\n\nI'm not going to lie to you, this game has problems. It's a buggy mess with every new update fixing one or two glitches but creates three new ones. Certain killers or woefully underpowered, and others are busted between perks and add-ons. You'll as killer encounter swf (survive with friends) groups that will run you around a single pallet until the game is over and teabag in your face at the exit gate. As survivor you will get focused down and tunneled out of the game in the first five minutes. You will deal with toxic entitlement in the end game chat, and yes you will occasionally run into bots and hackers that will break the game wide open. And not to mention the absurdly long grind needed to unlock teachable perks and then earn them on other characters.\n\nAll that being said, I love this stupid game.\n\nSome of the bugs are absolutely hilarious, including a current one that can make survivors stuck in a pose that makes them look like they're driving an invisible car. As a killer (even the weaker ones) you will encounter games where everything goes right, you're power works near every time, and you get twelve hooks with only two generators being done. As survivor, you'll eventually figure out how to loop and suddenly you're making amazing plays, taking protection hits, last second dead hards, and flashlight saves; though personally I have yet to figure out timings on flashlight saves, harder than it seems. And sometimes you'll run into the meme-iest playstyles, like trapper that doesn't even go after gens but just traps your items, or survivors that are just trying to summon the crow god by standing in a circle as their heads shake and swivel convulsively. And none of this even takes into account the horror aspect of the game, and playing as michael myers is a blast at times. Even if he's one of the harder killers, just the nostalgia of the chase music on haddonfield can almost make you forget how utterly broken that map is.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, it's not all that competitive because between bugs, lag and rng the game can flip on a dime even if there are folk out there that take it super seriously. It's also somewhat of a repetitive gameplay loop, but if you can see past that to the potential mind games, or you just really want to play a game that just doesn't really have anything else quite like it, maybe give this a shot.\n\nSee you in the fog","timestamp_created":1623721662,"timestamp_updated":1634767256,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93778499","author":{"steamid":"76561198244692394","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2595,"last_played":1658267188},"language":"english","review":"FUN","timestamp_created":1623721118,"timestamp_updated":1623721118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93778459","author":{"steamid":"76561199012969789","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":136,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1660550387},"language":"russian","review":"Очень весело бежать от маньяка клоуна, 20/10","timestamp_created":1623721021,"timestamp_updated":1623721021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93778375","author":{"steamid":"76561199055801195","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3898,"last_played":1650572222},"language":"spanish","review":"fguf","timestamp_created":1623720863,"timestamp_updated":1623720863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93778361","author":{"steamid":"76561199150359230","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":227,"playtime_at_review":12590,"last_played":1660228480},"language":"schinese","review":"我是傻逼\n这是我花四十四块钱买来治疗低血压的良药\n现在血压已经爆表了\n","timestamp_created":1623720825,"timestamp_updated":1623720825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93778216","author":{"steamid":"76561199129374456","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1626283989},"language":"english","review":"S","timestamp_created":1623720535,"timestamp_updated":1623720535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93777922","author":{"steamid":"76561199098227947","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1657459740},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun to play once you get the hang of it, and more then enjoy it!
