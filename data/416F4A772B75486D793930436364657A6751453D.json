All of the recent negative reviews are just pure garbage, let me tell you why... A few days ago, a recent patch came out that nerfed some meta perks for survivor. This has the lower/mid tier survivors extremely butthurt. Do not let the recent negative reviews deter you from picking the game up and giving it a try. The killers had good quality of life changes to some of their perks, as well as The Trapper and Hag buff were both pretty necessary in order to make them more viable in higher ranks. The balance of this game is in a better state than it has ever been, in my opinion. Killers SHOULD feel powerful and survivors SHOULD have to work every second in order to make it out of the trial alive. At the end of the day, the Devs are doing everything they can to bring more balance into the game and they are listening to their players thoughts and opinions. The game is easy to learn and hard to master, and just like all things, the more you play/practice the better you'll become. Now, this is not me saying that you won't run into some toxicity, but for the most part I love the game as well as the

La idea en la teoría es buena, (asesino de sacrificar para subir rango),pero el problema es que en la práctica lo más notorio ha sido un incremento de la cantidad de campers a lo largo de las partidad, sin importar si estas en rango 20 como en rango 6.\nPese a todo esto sigue siendo un juego que constantement intenta buscar un equilibrió y que hace lo posible por mejorar el juego (aunque hay algunos bugs y cosas que deberían de ser la prioridad num 1º), y sin olvidar que aunque sigue siendo un juego de modo competitivo que trae consigo bastantes horas de entretenimiento y diversión (aunque no te vas a librar de enfadarte de vez en cuando, como en cualquier otro juego).","timestamp_created":1501498649,"timestamp_updated":1501498649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477845340967178345","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33924977","author":{"steamid":"76561198286257376","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":47942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3103,"last_played":1655147249},"language":"english","review":"i got banned :(\nBut I still love this game <3","timestamp_created":1501497998,"timestamp_updated":1562426043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481751799583435059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33924841","author":{"steamid":"76561198375941364","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1503474096},"language":"schinese","review":"前俩天 玩的好好的 今天想玩就 玩不了了\n进去点开始  就退出来    卸载了 游戏重新按了  也不行","timestamp_created":1501497457,"timestamp_updated":1501497457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33924779","author":{"steamid":"76561198171647326","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":122576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5822,"playtime_at_review":45824,"last_played":1660537601},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, toxic community if you turn chat off you have fun.","timestamp_created":1501497201,"timestamp_updated":1607608055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458715617656707764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33924740","author":{"steamid":"76561198118680645","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4055,"last_played":1598955279},"language":"koreana","review":"매튜새기야 이게 게임이냐","timestamp_created":1501496982,"timestamp_updated":1517469042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33924619","author":{"steamid":"76561197999224316","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":2928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2820,"last_played":1501077538},"language":"english","review":":(","timestamp_created":1501496477,"timestamp_updated":1524238458,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33924532","author":{"steamid":"76561198043182977","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":55351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10606,"last_played":1509034567},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую!

Пусть игра и монотоная , завести геники, спасти тиммейтов, открыть дверь, найти проклятый тотем(если таковой и нужно найти), но всё равно ситуации бывают разные и смешные и порой грустные.
