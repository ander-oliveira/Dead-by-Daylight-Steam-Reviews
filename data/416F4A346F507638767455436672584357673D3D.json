Quite a few bugs (Progression being blocked by empty nodes, characters clipping in to walls, unable to pick up or revive them, stuck with certain animations). There are some balancing issues as well with certain perks and the infamous \"window cheese\",  but these are all being worked on and will be balanced and/or fixed. The biggest issue by far, however, is people rage quitting in the middle of the game to save their rank; this prevents them from losing their rank and also prevents you and others from gaining extra experience for killing/saving them, but this is, supposedly and hopefully, being fixed on this upcoming patch. \n\nThe game, right now, features 4 survivors who each get unique perks; Dwight has perks which increases speed of actions (Healing, repairing) when other survivors are close by, Jake is able to destroy hooks without a toolkit Claudette can heal without a medkit, etc. Every character has 3 unique perks which become available to all other characters of that type (AKA Survivor or Killer) at level 30. \n\nThe Killers all have a similar base playstyle, but their Power is what seperates them; The Trapper can lay down bear traps which immobilize Survivors if they get caught in it and deals a hit of damage, The Wraith can turn himself somewhat invisible and move slightly faster during this mode, and The Hillbilly has a chainsaw which he uses to charge down survivors at incredible speeds, downing them instantly if it connects. \n\nThere are 3 different type of things you can equip as a Killer, 4 as Survivor. There's the Power (Fixed for each killer, interchangeable for survivors), Add-Ons, Offerings and Perks. Powers (As survivors) and Add-Ons are temporary; they will last until you die, thus losing the item and add-ons equipped to it. Offerings are one-use only; once it is used, it persists through the match then vanishes forever, whether you live or die. Perks are permanent bonuses which you can equip; you start with 1 slot, but can unlock up to 4 (1 at 15, 20 and 25).\n\nThe Power would be the Chainsaw, Invisibell or Bear Traps for the Killers, but for Survivors it includes a Flashlight, used to blind and temporarily stun the Killer, the medkit which heals an ally to full health and the toolkit which drastically increases generator repair speed and allows you to destroy Hooks, which is the main way the killer kills survivors.\n\nCurrently, there is only one gamemode; Repair Generators and escape through one of two exit doors or, as the last survivor left, get out through the escape hatch while the Killer slashes and downs them, then hangs them on meathooks for a giant spider-beast thing (The Entity) to devour their soul.\n\nThere are also 3 maps, with 4 different layouts, but certain objects are randomized, making each game different, to some extent. \n\nSurvivors cannot attack, but that doesn't mean they are defenseless; they can hop through windows much faster than the killer can step through them, they can knock down pallets to stun the killer or they can use the flashlight to temporarily blind and stun him, though, admittedly, the flashlight is rather bad at the time of this writing. Crouching down and teamwork, however, are your best defense. \n\nThey have said they are working on balancing existing stuff, fixing bugs, and are going to add new killers, new survivors, new maps and cosmetic items, as well as a new Mode, Survive with Friends which is just how it sounds; you and friends can join a lobby together which will allow you to progress in bloodpoints, as opposed to Kill Your Friends which lets you use items without risk of losing them, but you gain nothing as well.\n\nThe game does lack in content right now but as long as the devs stay as enthusiastic about the game for a while, there will be a whole slew of brand-new content, and I really do not see them giving up any time soon.","timestamp_created":1466731193,"timestamp_updated":1466731623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23740238","author":{"steamid":"76561198057229455","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2376,"last_played":1541229700},"language":"english","review":"Fun game to play alone or with a group of friends.

Но! В игру добавлены доп. вещи вроде ящика с инструментами или аптечки, но за каким хреном с горы разработчики добавили фонарик?! Это самая бесполезная вещь во всей истории видеоигр. Кто-то говорит, что фонарь нужен для ослепления на некоторое время маньяка или для привелечения внимания той же двухметровой злой елды с топором (или молотом). Но они, все те кто так говорят, ошибаются. Эта цилиндрическая здоровенная срань размером с голову осла нужна лишь для большей  затраты и без того малого количества очков опыта на прокачку персонажа, а тут их четыре, не считая маньяков. А также в этой игра вас ожидае: маньяк с ловушками, больной косплеер убийца с бензопилой вместо руки (косплей на зловещих мертвецов), самый читерный маньяк за всю историю хоррор видеоигр (может появиться из-за спины в любой момент и из-за звона колокольчика которого в начале игры ливает хотя-бы один человек точно), рыжая спидозница (сугубо личное мнение), мужик в очках, негритянка и чел азиатской (как мне показалось) наружности. Да-да они вам такими и запомнятся. Кастомизация персонажей хромает (по две вещи на каждую часть тела), но это скорее всего скоро вылечат целебными патчами.

You have the nerdy guy Dwight, the popular girl Meg, the strange outsider Jake, and the most frustrating character Claudett.\n\nEach of these survivors have special perks about them, for example Jake can learn a perk that allows him to sabotage hooks used to sacrifice survivors, or sabotage the Trappers traps so he can’t use them anymore.\nalong side these 4 survivors there are 3 killers in the game, the Trapper who seems to be inspired by our good friend Jason Vorhees. Basically he can set up bear traps that if you step in them will trap you until you hope that RNGesus helps you break free by struggling, or that one of the other three survivors will have the compassion to save you instead of leaving you to be the trappers play thing.\n\nThe second killer is the Hillbilly, my personal favourite. I’ll give to three trys to guess who he’s inspired by. If you guess Leatherface, you have just earned yourself a single golden star that can be redeemed at any participating Tim Hortons for one medium Peppermint tea, I have 3 stars. \n\nAnyways the Hillbilly runs around with a chainsaw that when activated can be heard across the map, it grants him a huge speed boost and limits his turning radius when active. Also if you hit someone with it, it’s an instant kill. \n\nWell not kill, in this game you get downed first and then the killer has to hook you where it takes 45 seconds to a minute to kill the person. During this time another survivor can get him off the hook, or if the person on the hook is very lucky and wants to gamble with his life he can try to struggle for the 10% chance of escaping the hook, but each time they’re not successful it takes a huge chunk out of their time left alive.\n\nThis brings us to our last killer. The worst killer. Literally completely useless against any competent survivor. The wraith.\n\nWhy is the wraith useless? because his special ability turns him “Invisible” the invisibility is so terrible that you can still see him across the map while it’s activated. The only benefits being invisible gives you, is that the survivors can’t hear your heart beat, and you move a little bit faster. Now you might be thinking, damn son that’s pretty OP, but here’s the thing. you can’t attack while invisible, and when coming in and out of cloak you ring a bell 4 times, which takes one and a half to 2 seconds till you’re fully unlocked to finally hit someone. Also while de-cloaking, you move incredibly slow. Any competent survivor would already be gone.\n\nSo what are the survivors objectives, well they have to escape of course! This is done by locating and turning on 5 generators to power to two escape doors. Repairing the generators is done by holding down primary click and hitting the space bar within the designated areas to make the repair go faster, get it in the solid white you get 150 points and it boosts a huge chinch in the repair. Get it in the outlined white section you get 50 points, still increasing the repair, but if you miss it the generator explodes which prompts a huge bubble on the killers screen showing him where that generator is. The same thing happens when the generator is fully fixed, except this time the noise of the generator starting makes the bubble appear. \n\nHowever you don’t have to power all 5 generators to escape… If you’re willing to live with all your friends being killed you can search for the Trap Door. You need to have two generators online and once all the other survivors are killed and you’re the last one, you can escape down the hatch to safety.\n\nOne thing that I advise everyone not to do when playing this game is sprinting. When you sprint you leave a little trail of red slashes on the ground which are very bright and and smart killer can see those from very far away and will follow you. \n\nOf course with any game there are some negatives, at the time of writing this review there is no party system included in the game, this increases que times drastically since people who want to play with their friends will hope lobbies until they get into the same one as their friend. They have said that they’re including one soon, so lets hope that’s here within the month.\n\nAnother issue with the game is vaulting, you can vault over a window for pretty much ever. There are several maps which have infinite vaulting locations where it is impossible for the killer to do anything. It kind of makes the game a bit of a joke. But here’s the flipside, if you take that out there is basically no way to escape from a killer. They already run faster than you and can see where you’re running with the slashes. So the devs have to be careful here\n\nOne more issue is laggy killers. So in this game a killer hosts a lobby and survivors join it by clicking the que button. There is no server browsing in the game so you can’t see the ping to the killer meaning you will have games so unbearably laggy that it will be impossible to play. I’ve personally have had 5 games like that and it makes you want to quit as soon as you see the lag.\n\nAdding to the pile of issues we have the biggest piss off of all, players quitting games because they’re pissed off over being beaten. So in this game if you’re a survivor and leave the game right before the killer kills you, the killer gets no points. If you ALT-F4 you don’t even lose a rank for it. I had 3 people that I fairly hooked and killed right off the bat, they all left. I got no points and de-ranked because they were pissed off that I beat them. Seriously this needs to be fixed, especially when a rank one does it. Shows just how salty the community for this game is.\n\n\nIt just doesn’t stop, one more problem is the balance is completely thrown out the window, this isn’t just me sitting here bitching because I’ve lost one game as the killer, this is after 45 hours in the game on both sides, if you have any competence as the survivor you will not lose, at all. This is a survival horror game where the killer is made a joke of. \n\nAnd one more heads up from me to you, never sit in one place for to long. If you sit there, crows will start to caw above you, drawing the attention of the killer. and once he’s on you. There’s no escaping.\n\nAlright my final verdict on this game is a 6 out of 10 it’s a decent game, I’ve had so much fun with this game over the past few days, I already have over 45 hours played in it. I feel like with the addition of the party system, buffing the wraith and trying to do something with the vaulting, this game could be a solid 7 out of 10, the only thing that worries me about the game is the developers not being supportive of their game, I mean the put off fixing their game on launch because they’d rather be partying at E3.\n\nIf the developers start showing support for the game and for their new founded community this game could be big for a long time, and could even be the next Chivalry.

Putting the (lack of) balance aside, the devs have been progressively getting lazier and greedier and sadly that's partly because this game houses one of the (leaning more on THE most) toxic and dedicated fanbases I've ever seen. Rewind a year ago, the Halloween event (arguably the most important for a HORROR game) was pretty fun; harvest flowers, obtain a capped special currency, and get some free skins (with the option to buy the rest), perfect example of a fun event that rewards players for playing with incentive to pay for the skins you can't obtain due to the soft-cap. Given the ability to mix and match cosmetic pieces, this was a lot of fun to play with. Fast forward to today? No event, just double bloodpoints and skins locked behind a paywall.\n\nThe community of this game boils down to this; \"haha this game is bad imagine playing DbD unironically xDDDDDDD\" and then that same person spends $60 on skins, queues up with 3 other friends and plays exclusively with the intention of making the killer as miserable as possible. They may not be the majority, but they're certainly the loudest and BHVR has proven that they have no interest in displeasing the people who feed them the most money. 4 years later there is still only one game mode with one objective. There's no excuse for a game of this popularity to still be so bare bones.\n\nBeen playing this game since beta. I've wanted a game that uses the concept of a player controlling a killer hunting survivor players since I was extremely young as a die hard horror fan so trust me, I wanted this game to succeed more than anyone and it has. The issue is that this success did not come with progress. Just complacency and greed. No risks, no formula adjustment, No passion. The artists and sound designers carry this game because wow do the devs lack any sense of creativity. Enjoy killer that runs and stabs, killer that crouches and stabs, killer that runs, bumps, and stabs, and killer that stares and stabs because we haven't gotten an interesting new killer since the Plague. :feelsbadman:","timestamp_created":1466722439,"timestamp_updated":1603531392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543212771415710449","comment_count":22,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23737207","author":{"steamid":"76561198274841254","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":53559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":1028,"last_played":1660239821},"language":"spanish","review":"muy divertido te hace sentir ese miedo que las peliculas de terror ya no hacen","timestamp_created":1466722438,"timestamp_updated":1466722438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23737166","author":{"steamid":"76561197962763296","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1515882481},"language":"english","review":"A very creepy asymetrical horror game, it has a great atmosphere and you can choose between the killer or be a survivor.

Are you that incompetent? \n\nThen we get to the bloodpoints, probably one of the best Exp systems i've seen, you farm Bloodpoints which you can gain as both killer and survivor, but if you want any decent amount of BP's guranteed, you have to play killer. You get around 14-20k in a decent game. up to 50-90k if multiple exp boosters are on, but that'll probably never happend, 27 hours of the game so far, and only seen that ONCE. \n\nI experimented and the bloodpoints caps on 1mil, so i capped and spend 1 mil, its enough to get 1 charecter to level 35. Now getting about 1 mil took me 5 hours and ALOT of gataou boosters, gives 103% extra BP. At the start, this was decent, but now that the game is 3 years in, and has over 12 surviors and 12 killers, thats Several days of \"normal farming without boosters if you dont get them\" To get just a few up to level 50. \n\nSo basicly this game is more a farming simulator than a -have fun- simulator. And because of the devs disgustingly lazyness on doing ANYTHING about the DCers after 3 years, i'll call this a downvote, simply because of the BP farm just becomes tedious in the end. Aswell as the ridicilous DC denials on exp, you do get a quitter bonus if they DC but its quite measly and bad.","timestamp_created":1466717596,"timestamp_updated":1562178004,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23734757","author":{"steamid":"76561198087371176","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1512754510},"language":"english","review":"First of i see a lot of mixed reviews about this game, but i believe it is a great game that has the potential to be loads better. a lot of people i believe write there reviews without giving the game a chance or reading the development twitter. here are some points i have en counted and my taught on the matter\n\n1) play ranked with friends, so many people rate this game badly because its not implemented, yet they are working on it once this is added it will be a lot more fun to play as strategy can be talked over online chat with other friends in the same game. they are vocal about developing it people need to chill with the hate about not having this feature im sure people want a good implementation that take longer to develop than a buggy quick one\n\n2) no new content just bug fixes I have seen this a few times, guys the game is like 2 week old some games do not even get bug fixes after like 6 weeks, I my self would rather see a stable game before adding in content to something that is broken. The creates seem active in the development I like that \n\nmy suggestion to make it better\n\n1) few balancing issues or even make escaping more skilled like a generator spinner for the super quick but for getting off hooks obviously this would have to be hard and balanced , once off the hooks I believe it would be good it it stunned the killer if he was in a close proximity, this would make escapes to be skilled to get them off the hook but camping is not an issue\n2) proximity voice chat so if you are close to a ally you can chat to them, maybe if you spoke to long the killer could see it like befor if its balenced it would be nice to see\n\nthings I like\n\n1) level tree perks and items, I love seeing progression in a game and this makes you feel like you are getting somewhere while being benefiting at the same time, how the map can be influenced by offerings brings you closer into the game\n\n2) the maps these are well engineered and flow nicely making both player and killer have to play smart to kill / not be killed. \n\nOverall its a game that I would recommend, and the bigger the player base the more the players voice can be heard to make changes, hope you find this helpful don’t blame me if you don’t like it its not every ones cup of tea but I like it give it a solid 9.4 / 10","timestamp_created":1466717121,"timestamp_updated":1466717121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23734618","author":{"steamid":"76561198006709958","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1480463391},"language":"german","review":"DANKE  :)\n\nWie ich versprochen hatte werde ich mein Review positiv bewerten wenn man mit freunend zusammen spielen kann.\n\nHAMMER GAME - Nervenkitzel pur ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlte Review:\nKein Spielen mit Freunden möglich, auser in einer Privaten runde was erst ab 3 Spielern Sinn macht aber Punkte giebts dann keine ...

Идея далеко не новая (Симуляторы аркадных псевдослендеров с записками вместо генераторов и не так уж давно анонсированный симулятор не без известного Джейсона Вурхиза. Хотя многие утверждают, что DBD его и сплагиатили, но по заявлениям разрабов, над игрой работали 2 года), зато первая, которая вполне доработана до идеала. И по традиции начну с плюсов и минусов. \n\n[h1] Плюсы [/h1] \n[list] \n[*]Хорошая и приятная на глаз графика, но некоторые текстуры оставляют желать лучшего. \n[*]Хорошо проработанный баланс Убийц и Выживших (После несколько недавно вышедших патчей, это стало весьма спорным...) \n[*]Продуманный и интересный лор. У каждого персонажа есть своя биография и история. \n[*]Игра не требует каких - то особых скилов и навыков, что бы победить, как и своих собственных, так и тому, за кого игрок выживает\\убивает. Достаточно уметь прятаться и бесследно убегать\\отслеживать и предугадать движение вашей жертвы. \n[*]Увлекательная система прокачки \n[*]Большое количество перков, некоторые из которых доступны исключительно одному персонажу. \n[*]Великолепная оптимизация, фризы возникают крайне редко не мешая текущему игровому процессу. \n[*]Ценовая доступность (На фоне думов, каталистов, овервотчей и прочих 2-3к игр с DLC для фолла по 599 за набор с нексус мода для построек и ремейка игры 20летней давности первого постала, где подтянули чутка графон и управление за 349 - Цена DBD куда более чем приемлемая!) \n[/list] \n\n[h1] Минусы [/h1] \n[list] \n[*]Сырость игры. Даже после беты мало что изменилось: Невозможность поднять выжившего; Застревание убийцы у шкафа\\крюка после анимации; выживший спрятавшись в шкафу все равно виден сквозь него; попытка выйти из лобби или в главное меню после пройденной катки за убийцу чревато зависанием от 10 секунд до 2 минут; провалы под землю; вылеты, когда юзаеш второстепенное оружие и многое другое... Посты в баг - репорте растут в геометрической прогрессии. Что - то разрабы уже пофиксили в недавно вышедшем патче, а что - то все еще процветает и мешает нормальной игре. Ждем последующие. \n[*]Бесполезность предметов, такие как фонарь который работает 5-10 секунд и слепит убийцу на 2-3 (Если хорошо прокачать, даже станит его, при условии, что вдоволь успеете насветить ему в хлебало) и карта, которая показывает пару генераторов на 10-15 секунд. \nКуда полезнее было бы добавить станящий на короткий промежуток времени огнестрел с малым количеством боезапаса. \n[*]Система рангов - это самое убогое, что есть в этой игре: [strike] Убийца вышел\\вылетел из игры - ранг всех выживших понижен [/strike](Пофиксили). [strike]Кто - то из выживших вышел и убийце не хватило 10к очков убив остальных трех - ранг убийцы понижен.[/strike] (Пофиксили, смотрите логи 1.0.2 патча) Если будуче за Убийцу вы наткнулись на подобный случай, то у вас есть два варианта: [strike] Убиваете процесс игры в диспетчере задач ничего таким образом не теряя [/strike] (Теперь за это твой ранг втаптывают в грязь, и не важно вылетела у тебя игра или ты сам осознано убил процесс) или попытайтесь договориться с последнем выжившим дав ему понять, что вы не хотите причинить ему вреда и как бы награждаете его свободой, следовательно он продолжает чинить генеры а вы к примеру играя за Wraitha вставайте к нему вплотную входите и выходите из инвиза зарабатывая по 350 очков и так, пока не достигните проходимых, а как действовать дальше - сугубо ваше решение: Проводить его к найденному вами открытому люку отблагодарив его за то, что он позволил пофармить блудпоинты на новый ранг, ну или оторвать от генератора и донести до ближайшего крюка))) \n[*]Мизерное количество взаимодействий с выжившими, а именно: Отсутствие голосового чата и таунтов наподобие \"Ok\", \"Стой\", \"Пошли\", \"Помоги\" и т.д., которые по заявлению одного из разрабов должны были добавить в итоговом релизе. \n[*][strike] Невозможность играть с друзьями в паблах [/strike](Пофиксили)\n[*]Диджитал издание, которое ничего существенного не привносит, к примеру убогие маски для пайки, артбук и прочая общедоступная хрень. \n[/list] \n\nВывод: Не смотря на свои недостатки, игра как мультиплеерная может дать вам незабываемый экспириенс, заставив вас испытать фонтан эмоций, как пугающих, как негативных, так и положительных.

Originally the game flopped around for a while trying to get it's bearings but lately it's been heading in the right direction as far as bug fixes, customer service and free dlc goes. \n\nDead By Daylight once had an issue of killers who turbo sped, who insta killed, or survivors who couldn't be found but the match would never end. Those days are passing. Much like when the sun sets on a global empire, the bads of Dead By Daylight program wise are fading away. Sure we still have a salty player base, don't expect too many friendly conversations on community hub, but thus is the nature of a game of cat and mouse.\n\nDead By Daylight decently executes the horror genre, while not spot on, it took a few weeks before I lost my nervous tick while doing something in-game. I still remain vigilant, still remain one with the shadows and am pretty good at becoming one with the bush to remain unseen because uncertainty of the unknown has fadded. I now know the killer's limitations but it doesn't make it any less stressful when they finally wise up and beeline for me.\n\nI recommend this game if you're looking for a thriller slasher game or a Most Dangerous Game type of game. In this world as a killer, that is your job. Slay until they are as dust. As a survivor, keep your dang head down, keep your crap together, ignore the increasing heartbeat and don't panic.

I say mildly because I think with enough time this will shape up to be an extremely entertaining game.   However, its technical flaws were not something I was willing to overcome.  To begin with, usually when a game says it has partial controller support it's because it has a launcher or some other minor element that needs a mouse and keyboard.  This is not the case.  \n\nHere, the controller is completely dead, save for the b button to go back in menus, until you get into the actual game.  And even then it can be kind of spotty.  There aren't any resolution options.  What is there in its place is a slider that goes to 100%.  Sliding this makes only the slightest bit of difference in visual fidelity.  \n\nIt looked to me like it was set to 720p or even lower than that.  The text and all the edges of objects, naturally, were very blurry at this resolution.  This is on a 4K tv by the way.  There is an auto detect option, but ticking it did not make any noticeable difference.  \n\nThe game itself is great, but I play first person action games with a controller.   The amount of back and forth between controller and KB+M just wasn't worth it to me.  It became too annoying.  But if this is not at all an issue for you, there is definitely a lot of fun to be found here.  \n\nPersonally, I plan to wait until much later, when all the kinks are worked out.","timestamp_created":1466697462,"timestamp_updated":1466697701,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504320681095123291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23729075","author":{"steamid":"76561198042381654","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1604438409},"language":"russian","review":"лучший симулятор пряток,и единственный в своём роде с неповторимой атмосферой +бухие маньяки +4 выживаемых,не всегда понимающих кто где как куда откуда зачем бежать) 4 подвешаных на крюки ботаника из четырёх","timestamp_created":1466697237,"timestamp_updated":1466697237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23729001","author":{"steamid":"76561198045129962","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":111073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":338,"playtime_at_review":96820,"last_played":1660122410},"language":"english","review":"Bring back 2 window shack (:<","timestamp_created":1466697002,"timestamp_updated":1618098517,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23728998","author":{"steamid":"76561198230590016","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":159685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113126,"last_played":1624660551},"language":"english","review":"The best mind games hide and seek game ever made. 10/10 ♥","timestamp_created":1466696997,"timestamp_updated":1533094288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473663359880447388","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23728990","author":{"steamid":"76561198232426576","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":40,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1466360143},"language":"russian","review":"Играть только в пати","timestamp_created":1466696981,"timestamp_updated":1466696981,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oPv8vtUCfrXCWg=="}
