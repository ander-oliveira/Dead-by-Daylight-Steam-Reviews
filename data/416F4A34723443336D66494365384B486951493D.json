That said, for some reason I keep coming back. The biggest saving grace is playing with friends and family which is good times. Not sure if I'd play it without friends.

There are so many small quality of life improvements the devs can make, and they just simply don't. I actually feel like the devs don't care about their playerbase, or actually just cater to the survivors. The hit validation in this game is an absolute joke. The survivor will scream, blood will splatter on your screen, you will STILL have your cooldown attack animation, and it was all for nothing because you didn't actually hit the survivor. Almost all of the maps are so incredibly survivor sided that it isn't funny. Almost everything in this game screams \"God, I love catering to survivors\" straight from the devs mouths. And it sucks. Because honestly? This is a great game, and I feel like it is only a great game because it has no competition. There is no other game out there where you can play as Bill from Left 4 Dead while being chased by Nemesis from Resident Evil. And now they're getting the girl from The Ring. It's such a shame that this game is getting all of these licenses, because it just further implements the devs not needing to do anything for this game. Balancing solo survivor and swfs around the killer is what needs to happen, that way the killer can't be bullied into oblivion by swfs and solo survivor can actually have a chance (not saying they don't, but just simple quality of life improvements like HUD changes to let survivors know what others are doing, or pressing a button to say \"Hey, I'm going for the save.\" etc. I have over 2,000 hours into this game, and it's a shame that I can't recommend it. The only reason I keep coming back and playing it, is because there's unfortunately nothing else like it right now, however, as soon as a new game comes along, and the devs prove to be competent (won't take much, seeing as I'm going to be leaving DBD for that new game) I'm jumping ship. I love this game, and absolutely hate it.
