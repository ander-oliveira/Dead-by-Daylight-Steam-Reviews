The lower rank wait times are 40-50 minutes EASY for a killer and if you don't play enough, when rank reset happens (MONTHLY), you will find yourself back in the lower ranks struggling to find matches. The game also has major balancing issues with matchmaking. No reason new players should be matched against top tier players. It has ruined this game. Sorry BHVR, but you've had time to fix this and you haven't.\n\nUPDATE 19 Sep 2021:\n\nGame is still terribly balanced and not fun for lower levels.

If you want to enjoy this game, don't go past rank 10. As a rank 1 survivor and killer, red ranks are even worse than hell. \n\nSolo Q as survivor at rank 1: at the beginning of the game usually 1 DC immediately, 1 DC after being downed for the first time, and if you are lucky, killer will be friendly and let you and your living teammate go. Otherwise enjoy free depip and stress and anger and frustration. Killers are usually camping assholes that don't actually know how to play the game, they just got to rank 1 because of ULTRA EASY ranking system and because they run into very altruistic survivors that don't do gens at all, they just want to farm BP for WGLF. Very rare you see an actual good killer with talent for the game. On the other hand, your teammates are as stated above, overly altruistic,  can't hit skillchecks, they go down in 15 seconds, don't repair gens, make stupid plays and so on. DON'T PLAY RANK 1 IF YOU DON'T HAVE DECENT SWF TEAM.\n\nPlaying killer at rank 1 : Now is 2019. Devs finally decided to fix the lobbies so now it is actually possible to get survivors instantly. However, survivors you go against are 80% 4 man SWF, and the other 20% of time you get solo survivors in the lobby that are actually RANK 1! AND THEY KNOW HOW TO PLAY. On very rare occasion, survivors in your lobby are noobs. Start of the match: If you are lucky, Hex:Ruin will last 1 minute instead of half a minute and in that time if you don't down at least 1 survivor the game is practically over. Group will start to genrush and all gens will be done in less than 5 minutes, EVEN IF THEY AREN'T SWF, BECAUSE YOU GO AGAINST DECENT SURVIVORS. Everybody knows how to loop the pallets, juke, use jungle gyms and so on. If you play anyone else than Nurse or Hillbilly, prepare to depip and get frustrated even more than when playing a survivor. Huntress was also good before, but now people have learned to counter her too well and it is really hard to play at rank 1 with her now. \n\nThe game itself : UNBALANCED AS HELL\nI don't want to go into details, if you ever reach rank below 5, you will know what I am saying. \n\nThe game is full of various bugs and they can really ruin the experience of the game. With every new patch there are more and more of them. But devs, instead of fixing them all, they fix only about 10% of them every patch, but then there are 10 more bugs than before. Also, instead of putting more effort into fixing and optimizing their game, that is very badly optimized, devs make a lot of new skins which require a lot of time. I understand that game has to make money somehow, but still there is to many skins, and TOO MANY BUGS THAT ARE NOT BEING FIXED.\n\nIn this current state, I wouldn't recommend the game because of toxic community and all, but the game is very addictive and will keep you for at least 100 hours of gameplay, unless you reach rank 1 before that and get proxy/face camped for 10 games in a row or get teabaged by 4man swf at the exit gate. So my advice is to stay at rank 10 and enjoy the game.","timestamp_created":1549144092,"timestamp_updated":1549144092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48720501","author":{"steamid":"76561198090936173","num_games_owned":735,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":90479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62212,"last_played":1608754721},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Симулятор рандомных багов.[/h1]","timestamp_created":1549143214,"timestamp_updated":1606564422,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552128314971923828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48720260","author":{"steamid":"76561198340997123","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":50265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49212,"last_played":1518658681},"language":"russian","review":"ну вы поняли...","timestamp_created":1549142287,"timestamp_updated":1549142287,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48720128","author":{"steamid":"76561198334850946","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3948,"last_played":1659086495},"language":"english","review":"Game is good.

Цена. Совсем символическая.\n2. Атмосфера. Испытываешь животный страх, аж поджилки трясутся.\n3. Геймлей. Можно забить на команду и спастись самому, или же помочь своим друзьям по выживанию и попытаться спастись вместе. В первом случае меня мучает совесть и я всегда пытаюсь помочь, от этого мне становится еще интереснее играть.\n4. Геймдизайн. Очень детально и красиво построены локации, я, как зарекомендовавший себя с лучшей стороны эстет, испытываю настоящее удовольствие, на уровне с сексуальным. Возможно, я извращенка. \n5. Звуковое сопровождение. Сердцебиение в игре сливается с моим воедино. Шорох и любой шум заставляет постоянно оглядываться. Чувство загнанного зверя.\nЯ однозначно рекомендую эту игру, и ко мне стоит прислушаться любителям хорроров, мистики, триллеров. Почему? Потому что я с самого детства интересуюсь исключительно хоррор-индустрией, фильмы, игры, иногда даже музыка, иллюстрации.

Thanks to the recent changes, most players will be sitting at mid-to-high ranks at all times; this means that you'll have to wait ages to find a game and, when you do, you'll be matched with and against people a lot more experienced than you. This also happens to very high rank survivor players.\n\nAt the earlier ranks, killers are very strong as they generally are much more intuitive to play with; once you actually learn of this game works though, you'll quickly find out how much of an advantage survivors have and the entire game's balance will break. Killer games at higher rank are immensely frustrating and survivors are boring to play (you like to hold M1?), unless you play with friends - but, to be fair, ANY game is better with friends, so what's the point?\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, killers have some tactics to make their job easier (usually referred to as camping, tunneling and slugging by the community). They work when used properly, but they are VERY frustrating for the receiving survivor. This is a design issue and the developers can't fix it - sometimes they release a \"fix\" which all it does is nerfing killers somehow, but really doesn't address the underlying issue.\nThe survs will then blame the killer for using them, leading to an overall less enjoyable experience for everyone - but, for real, don't blame the killer, BLAME THE GAME.\n\nAll of this without even mentioning the outstanding amount of bugs, netcode issues and disconnects (both on purpose and from crashes) from people in-game and the general toxicity of the community.\n\nThe only things keeping this game (barely) alive are the on-license killers which attract attention and the recently added Archives (which are just an overly complicated battle pass to keep you hooked with limited time rewards and arbitrary, game breaking *jobs* to complete).","timestamp_created":1549106966,"timestamp_updated":1578226888,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":20,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48708736","author":{"steamid":"76561198089801686","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":54977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24782,"last_played":1633882260},"language":"english","review":"I love playing DbD despite the salty player base however I won't ignore that it DOES have issues.\n\nBalance does often come into question especially on the killers side as a rank 1 survivor and a peak rank 7 killer i can say it is considerably harder as a killer to win a game. \n\nAlso after hitting rank 1 i see no incentive to carry on playing survivor as losing just one game will make you de-rank as they removed the pip slots at rank 1 a while back.\n\nAlso prepare to spend alot of time looking for a good connection lobby (hopefully this is solved with dedicated servers in August)\n\nThere are also many bugs that arrive with each new patch and it feels that each patch breaks more than it fixes.\n\nDespite this DbD is a very fun game even more so with friends and i would recommend it for anyone who either like's survival horror games or to anyone who thinks they need more salt in their diet.","timestamp_created":1549105390,"timestamp_updated":1549105390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48708685","author":{"steamid":"76561198035878379","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":51107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42366,"last_played":1648824819},"language":"german","review":"Pretty good game so far","timestamp_created":1549105236,"timestamp_updated":1549105236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48707674","author":{"steamid":"76561198073577336","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12628,"last_played":1620600864},"language":"german","review":"Einer der besten Spiele die ich seit langem gespielt habe!","timestamp_created":1549100991,"timestamp_updated":1549100991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48707667","author":{"steamid":"76561198335084122","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":220677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21117,"last_played":1622114738},"language":"russian","review":"Поиграв пару часиков, я понял, что сидеть с берданкой в расте всё же лучше чем бегать от мана и ловить хиты в 10-20метров.

This was one  of the main ways It would allow me and other noobish players to escape from the killer but now the killer can also jump over windows and still keep a visual on you.\n\n- Jigsaw killer reversed bear traps that he puts onto you are a joke.

I could go hide in a random closet or crouch behind a tree and these killers know where I am no matter what due to the perks.\n\n-Not enough free content for the survivors. Most of the time you are probably playing as a survior, yet i'm still wearing these bum ass clothes and get like budget haircuts to choose from.

I bought the game but i'm expected to drop more money if I want to wear something half decent. \n\n-The free killers are underpowered compared to the DLC killers. What am i expected to do with garbage bear traps.. 1 person can have the trap perks on and completely counter what your killer is supposed to specalize in, trapper my ass.\nThese free killers are so trashy, I purchased the game and this is all I get? I'm expected to buy dlc to get on a even playing field? I bump into the odd guy like myself who only has the free killers and it's so hard to win a match and kill ALL survivors. Try using the trapper then switch to legion.\n\n- When I bought the game is was all good, we were all on a even playing field. Now everyone has dlc killers.  Now I feel robed of my money, apparently all my cash got me was the base game, if you want a way more enjoyable experience you have to be willing to drop more cash.

This game is honestly a joke.. killers are almost unfair to play against, teams are usually trash unless you're playing SWF (Survive with friends)\n\n(Original) Wouldn't recommend it right now, even though i really want to. When I first heard of this game I absolutely loved the idea of a survivor outplaying a killer or vice versa, it's a lot of fun. With that being said there's a lot of downsides to this game.\n When you first get the game you load in to find you have many choices of survivors and killers that have specific skills you need to survive or kill efficiently. Many of the top rated skills are spread out among all the characters which means A LOT of grinding, also bringing me to my next point. I actually love to grind in video games, however it's a little difficult to play the game when you as a newbie are put up against people that clearly out level and out rank you. The matchmaking system leaves MUCH to be desired and honestly just doesn't make any sense. You also have to watch out for the killer's (Host) ping and make sure he isn't lagging so you can get some decent gameplay. On top of that the game crashes in the loading screen half the time and wastes any of the rituals you spent your hard earned bloodpoints on.\n In conclusion I really want to recommend this game because its addicting and you might have a lot of fun, however i just wouldn't recommend paying for this. If you're the type of person that gets upset easily and throws a keyboard often over dumb plays or crazy lag spikes then you might be buying A LOT of keyboards...","timestamp_created":1549065916,"timestamp_updated":1580510910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48700441","author":{"steamid":"76561198410351317","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":38843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25108,"last_played":1654715745},"language":"turkish","review":"bazı yıkık orospu evlatları sırf siz iyi oynayıp adamı deli ettiniz diye suratınıza bakarlar onların yedi ceddini niagara şelalesine götürüp amlarına nutellayı sürüp bal arılarının oraya  bırakıcaksın bak bakıyım bir daha suratına bakıyormu asınca yurdunu siktimin yıkık orospu çocukları adam senden iyiyse ağla amk ama pusma ananı sikerim oyunu öneren kafamı sikiyim ewet beyler bayanlar kadın olan ama bayan olmayan orospu evladı feministler ve benzeri am suratlı kepazeler bu oyunu oynıcaksanız iyi oynayıp rankınızı yüksek tutun ki amına bastığımın döl suratlı killerları suratınıza bakıp sizi delirtmesin tek yapmanız gereken rank 10 olana kadar sabretmek ondan sonra ne bok yersenız yiyin ananızı sikicekler killerlar ilah gibi oynıcak ama FACECAMP atmıyacaklar dolayısı ile sizden iyi oynayan birine sövme hakkınız olamıyacağından dolayı yarramı yiebilirsin afiyet olsn bal şeker olsn ananın amına eüb olsun saygılar.. -eüb","timestamp_created":1549065460,"timestamp_updated":1599322423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506329119205474854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48700375","author":{"steamid":"76561198121000190","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":69878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1289,"last_played":1658374733},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente  genial y aterrador xdd","timestamp_created":1549065134,"timestamp_updated":1549065134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48700225","author":{"steamid":"76561198376987637","num_games_owned":684,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":19451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":3389,"last_played":1659614709},"language":"spanish","review":"juegaso.","timestamp_created":1549064492,"timestamp_updated":1549064492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48700023","author":{"steamid":"76561198263994729","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":48707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17586,"last_played":1594938453},"language":"russian","review":"Наиграл достаточно чтоб сказать одно - в соло игра надоест за часов 50, в команде же затянет на долгое время.
