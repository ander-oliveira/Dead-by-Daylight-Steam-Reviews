Es ist wie Glücksspiel. Du hast Spass obwohl du genau weisst dass du verlierst. Ich spiele das Game jetzt ein Jahr aber jetzt habe ich die Nase gestrichen voll. Was bringt es dir wenn du gepipt wirst wenn du nicht gewinnst. Das Erfolgserlebnis ist einfach nicht mehr da. Die Killer sind zu op und die Spileentwickler scheren sich einen Scheissdreck darum. Man wird von anderen Spielern oft unnötig reported, weswegen ernste Reports garnicht mehr wargenommen werden. Es gibt immernoch viel zu viele, auch noch offensichtliche Buggs, bei denen man meinen könnte dass die Entwickler einfach zu faul sind, diese zu beheben. Viele Perks funktionieren nicht, wie z.B. das Perk entscheidungsschlag. Der Killer legt dich einfach hin, hebt dich wieder auf, legt dich wieder hin, solange bis er den Haken erreicht hat. Und wenn der Skillcheck kommt, während du aufgehangen wirst, zählt das Perk als verbraucht, obwohl du garkeine Chance hattest es zu benutzen.\nUnd dann wundern sich ernsthaft noch welche, dass es immer weniger Spieler und zu viele Hacker in dem Spiel gibt? JA WEIL MAN GARKEINE CHANCE HAT ZU GEWINNEN.JA WEIL ALLE VORTEILE DIE MAN FRÜHER MAL HATTE RAUSGEPATCHT HAT. Beispiel 72HRS: Er war ein guter Dead by Daylight Spieler und hat auch seine eigene Kleidung hier im Spiel bekommen, jedoch wurde alles was er gut konnte, zu nichte gemacht. 360s kann man nicht mehr machen da die Killer gefühlt eine 360 Grad Hitrange haben und die Taschenlampenaddons wurden auch verschlechtert. Deshalb aht er jetzt mit Dbd aufgehört. Ich habe Legacy aber das heisst lange nicht, dass man gut ist. Man wird einfach vom Spiel unfreiwillig z.B auf Rang 9 aufgewertet, was es nicht besser macht, wenn man schon auf Rang 10 keine Chance hatte, jedoch trotzdem immer irgendwie die 10k Blutpunkte in einer Runde erreicht. Ich werde das Spiel weiter spielen weil es mir einfach zu viel Spass macht und ich dieses ehemals wundervolle Spiel noch etwas geniessen möchte, solange es noch existiert, jedoch fällt einem das Geniessen immer

We'll just say yes to that then.\n\nNow first off, I LOVE THIS GAME!\n\nFrom the amazing ideas with the killers and survivors, to the quiet sounds of the woods into an intense chase with intense music, and to the moments that mean either life and death, this game is just really fun. \n\nNow this game is pretty survivor-sided with how much chances they have to make a killer feel like killing themselves (Get it cuz 'kill' and they are a killer). But of course the killers also have those chances...just not as much. Now in the beginning it may not seem like it, but in the higher ranks thats when it starts to show. With the 1 second blinding flashlights, to perks that take one button to press to win, to swf (survive with friends in case you don't know) groups that know everything you do. But of course there are ways to counter these things, since i've done them before. They may not work all the time, but it is enough to give the survivors a hard time to deal with you. It just takes time to learn what survivors do and what they are! OOOOOOOOOOOH!\n\nThe devs are quite...how do i put this? VERY INTERESTING. They do listen to the community, but at the same time they don't. Like something might be fine as it is but then people complain that its apparently \"OP\" and then BOOM! nerf. There are a little bit of bugs in this game that people keep talking about too, though i haven't come across any in 3 months! So thats not a problem hopefully. Except for the 'losing all your data' thing, not sure about that :S. \n\nNow the community itself is toxic. Not saying everyone is toxic, but just like 70% of it probably is which is basically 100% right? So say you do well or do bad right, then after the game ends you say 'gg' and then someone says \"KILL YOURSELF FGT\". Pretty toxic. But people will just complain about EVRYTHING. No matter what. You 4-man a game, toxic. You don't do good, toxic. YOU DO ANYTHING, T O X I C. Hell, survivors teabag and taunt you just because they hit you with ONE pallet. But then again there are the people that are chill and just play the game for fun. You say 'gg' they say 'gg'. Nothing bad, just a regular game. And if you're lucky, you might come across someone who is, and i quote, \"N I C E\".\n\nNow for the moment of truth, SHOULD I BUY THIS G A M E ? Yes. This game has a lot of replayability since every killer you play against will always do something a little different (campers not included). Even you, yes you, will play the game a little differently each killer you face (Toxic survivors not included). Finally, as i said above, its fun.

Survivor is very fun because there is alot of things to do and the suspense makes it very cool and terrifing especially when you make the clutches, its very satisfying. you can get more fun as survivor but thats just my opinion, however, killer is pretty cool to play with especially when you master the killer thats when you start to have alot of fun. The game is great in many ways and is half the price of f13 and the devs are working on it constantly giving us cool new survivors/killers and bug fixes. Overall the game is worth it and people who are looking for these kind of games should get this for a start.","timestamp_created":1510371205,"timestamp_updated":1510371205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49679487943649292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36433094","author":{"steamid":"76561198342366306","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2405,"last_played":1603544638},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из самых моих любимых игр. Класная атмосфера (рекомендую играть на максимальной громкости). Играю давно, и уже приобрёл все DLS для этой игры было не жалко, добавляют офигенный шмот для выживших и убийц. И донацкие маньяки все имба, со своей темой всегда всех тащим(мы опытные ребята) тимой играть намного веселее чем соло, и намного проще. За маньяка тоже весело(жалко нет режима там где не один маньяк, так бы с друзьями можно было). За маньяка главное уметь правильно действовать что бы эти сурвы не сбежали, почти всегда делаю -4, играю за фреди или тень(маньяк с белым лицом).\nИгра зашла 10/10.

Moreover, spending only $20 to be able to play +700 hours is the best thing the devs can give to their players. Also, remember that there are roughly about 60-70 people working on the game, yet they are able to release new DLC/content/event every 1-2 months, make weekly twitch stream for updates, balances, and bug fixes, and change the meta once in a while by buffing and nerfing perks...
