The premise of the game is to match one terrifying Killer with unique abilities against four unfortunate Survivors. The main task of the Survivors is to repair five generators and then escape through the exit gate (optionally through the hatch). For this purpose, cooperation is important - mutual protection, healing, and also destroying cursed totems. As the Killer, your job is to sacrifice the four Survivors to the Entity.\n\nThe graphics, music and sounds of the environment, along with an extensive pool of specific and interesting maps, awesome skins, constant updates & events (fe. Lunar, Halloween, Winter) and a variety of content in the form of over 25 survivors and 25 killers [also licensed ones from your favourite movies, tv series, books & comics - like \"The Saw\" (Pig), \"Hellraiser\" (Pinhead), \"Resident Evil\" (Nemesis), \"Silent Hill\" (Pyramid Head), \"Stranger Things\" (Demogorgon), \"Halloween\" (Michael Myers), \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (Freddy Krueger), \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (Leatherface) or \"Scream\" (Ghostface)] are a definite advantage of the game.\n\nA decisive downside of the game is the hitbox system as well as dedicated servers (main source of lags, broken hits etc.) - some of the received or missed hits can literally break your soul. The ranking system is also unfavorable. Many players are in the wrong place - skilled players are associated with people who literally cannot play and do everything expect the survivor objectives. MMR (SBMM) is a one big joke. When you reach the top level, the game is practically unplayable due to the lack of balance - a well-coordinated team of survivors will almost always win against the killer due to the too short repair time of generators and effective looping by dropping pallets early and using map resources. You have to be prepared that on some maps you will simply fail due to the map size and the technical maladjustment of the killer. Sometimes, as a survivor, you will be proxy camped and tunneled due to which you hardly ever experience any fun in some particular games. The sad fact is that players are not innovative and in practically every match - on both the Survivor and Killer side - use the same meta perks, so you won't experience different build combinations as much as you expect even though each side has access to almost 100 perks - perhaps because developers do not balance the game properly. Game developers rarely add new realms (maps) - what's more, due to their own oversight and bugs, they turn off the existing maps for many weeks (fe. 'Raccoon City Police Station' or 'Dead Dawg Saloon'). Developers DO NOT listen to the voices of the community and DO NOT adopt certain solutions.\n\nOverall, DBD is a good game that has both huge pros and significant cons. Personally, I rate the game at solid 7.5/10 and I hope the game will only get better with time.","timestamp_created":1606608505,"timestamp_updated":1632836463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80963206","author":{"steamid":"76561198155447763","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1607668059},"language":"russian","review":"Мне понравилась, выбор убийц и выживших, он очень большой.

Zdecydowanie najlepsza tego typu gra na rynku. \nTwórcy stale ją rozwijają dodają nową zawartość, co jest warte pochwalenia, bo gra ma już 4 lata na karku. Jest to gra z serii \"easy to learn hard to master\". Dzięki podzieleniu graczy na rangi nowi lub słabsi gracze mogą mieć radochę, a bardziej doświadczeni lub lepsi gracze mają szansę prawdziwe wyzwanie w miarę zdobywania wyższych rang. Fakt licznych zadań i wyzwań, które zachęcają do poznawania mechaniki gry lepiej oraz próbowania nowych taktyk, sprawia że gra się nie nudzi nawet po kilkuset godzinach spędzonych z tym tytułem. DbD to świetny tytuł na półgodzinną sesję jak i na dłuższe granie. Gra co prawda posiada płatne DLC oraz mikropłatności, aczkolwiek ich zakup nie wpływa nadto na samą rozgrywkę, a sami twórcy też nie próbują ich na siłę wciskać graczom. \nMam nadzieję, że DbD będzie rozwijane i wspierane jak najdłużej i będzie się cieszyć niesłabnącą popularnością. Ja w Dead by Daylight gram aktualnie dość często i jak najbardziej polecam ten tytuł. Zwłaszcza, że bardzo często pojawia się on na różnego rodzaju promocjach STEAMowych.","timestamp_created":1606601291,"timestamp_updated":1606601291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80947928","author":{"steamid":"76561198132936401","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6318,"last_played":1622747479},"language":"japanese","review":"最初の50時間くらいはとっても楽しいのでセール中なら迷わず買い\nDLCは3つくらいで十分です\nマッチ1回が結構長いので休憩を忘れず楽しみましょう","timestamp_created":1606601262,"timestamp_updated":1606601262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80947741","author":{"steamid":"76561199072491474","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1467,"last_played":1638579228},"language":"english","review":"asas","timestamp_created":1606601187,"timestamp_updated":1606601187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80947189","author":{"steamid":"76561198361141807","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":67278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":456,"playtime_at_review":1525,"last_played":1660402200},"language":"english","review":"youre gonna have to spill 500 hours of grinding to get the perks you need but once you get good it can be really fun","timestamp_created":1606600964,"timestamp_updated":1608663050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80947176","author":{"steamid":"76561198059261039","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":51429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":298,"playtime_at_review":20325,"last_played":1660570061},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольная игра с хорошей идеей, которой не хватает баланса, нормальных игроков и разнообразия.
