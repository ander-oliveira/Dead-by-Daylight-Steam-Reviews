The short TLDR yes you should get it if you enjoy horror especially if it's on sale. \n\nDead by Daylight is \"an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game.\" Meaning you can play as a survivor and a killer. There is a total of four survivors in a game at a time. The objective as a survivor is to (obviously) survive and finish generations to open the exit gates (the way to leave the game and win.) You also have to assist your teammates and escape chases in the meanwhile. There being other features too of this role, but that's a general idea of what to do. \n\nThe other role is killer with their job being to deny survivors of winning. By kicking generations regressing their progress, injuring survivors so you can place them on meat hooks, and overall applying pressure towards the game. (once a survivor has been hooked three times they are out of the game).  That's the basic concept of killer of course there are also other things not mentioned such as the basement and the hatch. \n\nPROS:\n-Also has independent characters such as the trapper and wraith. \n-Fun to play with friends.\n-The first hundred hours are scary to most. \n-Has iconic characters such as Ghost Face, Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers. \n-You can now buy non licensed characters without spending real money. \n-There is dozens of perks that change gameplay for survivor and killer. \n-Interesting leveling up system. \n-Currently 25 different survivors with different perks and 24 killers. (soon to be more on the 15th of June)\n-You can create your own custom lobby that you can invite your friends to. \n-Survivors can bring items and change the stats of those items with addons. \n-Killers can also bring addons to change the stats of their abilities. \n-Tutorial for both roles. \n-Around 36 maps. \n-Special yearly events such as the anniversary event. \n-Tons of cosmetics.\n-Can bring offerings that can alter the map or give you bonus currency. \n-You can buy perks for characters you don't have through the \"shrine of secrets\".\n-There are usually monthly codes that allow for free loot.  \n\nCONS\n-The community can be extremely toxic.\n-Balancing can be questionable with addons and perks.\n-There is meta perks a good amount of perks in the game aren't seen at all. \n-The game is killer sided towards lower ranks with it being survivor sided at higher ranks.\n-Communication among survivors  makes a majority of perks useless on both sides. \n-Majority of killers are weak at higher ranks unless you have dozens of hours sunk in.\n-The game favors killers that can negate having to chase survivors for a long time. \n-The perks for the licensed characters appear in a different store\n-You have to buy licensed characters such as Ghost Face and Leather Face with real money. \n-The currency for buying characters is the same as buying cosmetics. \n-Have to buy a majority of good cosmetics with real money again. \n-Lots of information. (some people like this) \n-Maps can favor one side more than the other,\n-You can encounter bugs such as your game just crashing, people locked in animations, messed up hitboxes and more. \n-The \"Shrine of secrets\" can hand out perks you already have owned. \n-Most of survivors on average earn less bloodpoints due to it being team based. \n-Some killers are extremely underwhelming. \n-Some killers are also just never seen. \n\n","timestamp_created":1622585215,"timestamp_updated":1622585215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93017213","author":{"steamid":"76561198178478373","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1639594285},"language":"hungarian","review":"really good\n","timestamp_created":1622585190,"timestamp_updated":1622585190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93017167","author":{"steamid":"76561198165954827","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2342,"playtime_at_review":1441,"last_played":1660472235},"language":"english","review":"Is Fun.

[/b] \n\nFor starters, the game really was an incredible experience, lots of fun, friends, and stupid glitches and montages that made the game all the funnier. In honesty, this game was great for at least 500 hours.\n\nThe game is definitely worth getting for its price-- especially if the game is on sale, the better for you. \n\n[b] Here is a comprehensive look at positives and negatives for this game's aspects and gameplay, which may change over time: [/b]\n\n[u] Pros: [/u]\n + Amazing graphics for higher end computers, aspects such as the flames, entity (hook monster), light distortions, survivor and killer skins, and new map graphic updates are beautiful. \n+ Graphics can easily be fixed to suit lower end computers/console players via a resolution percentage bar and other settings (And changes in percentage are drastic).\n+ Matches are quick to join (5-8 minutes tops unless there is some crazy new matchmaking system that's broken). :)\n+ Matches are an educational experience, particularly in training the brain to respond quickly and smartly towards fast-paced situations, where even a player may feel some adrenaline (or panic if that's you).\n+ Players and killers have access to items/addons, which make for more interesting gameplay, allowing matches to be diverse.\n+ Generally, a single match tends to be a unique experience (until after ~500-600 hours of gameplay). \n+ A large DBD community exists with some great leaders allowing lesser experienced players to learn some great tips and tricks. (Otzdarva, TrU3Ta1ent, etc).\n+ You get better the more you play; this is true for pretty much any games, but games like DBD make you experience this full-force. Sometimes this is bad (if other survivors are new or suck), but tends to be great in good matches.\n+ Tons of killers and survivors to choose from, all for a custom experience.\n+ Rift pass and tome challenges give goals for players to work for. In fact, I think it would be awesome if DBD made tome achievements named after a tome, like: \"Divergence -- complete Tome VI\".\n+ A constantly active development team that provides a great amount of new killers and survivors every year.\n+ A great amount of perks which allow for millions of unique experiences for both players and killers alike. Perks are limited to 4 per player in a match, items to 1 per survivor, and addons to 2 per player.\n+ A ranking system that at least distinguishes players~ there definitely is a difference between playing against rank 15-20 players and playing against rank 1-5 players, so that you as a player are matched with other players that share some experience/mistakes/victories as you (this is not true for every match although). \n+ An incredibly expansive plethora of customization options for players and killers, which can be earned for free just by playing the game long enough.\n\n[u] Cons: [/u]\n - Rare crashes or disconnection may occur, which actually can lead to DBD punishing a player with a disconnection penalty. (A penalty where you are locked out of matchmaking for about 10 minutes).\n- As with a large supportive community, DBD unfortunately does have a large toxic community. Sometimes this is so nasty, that you as a player feel powerless.\n- Many items, cosmetics, and addons are abused, being able to be used in a way that would be considered \"bullying\" in DBD. For instance, it is not fun to be a rank 8 killer learning to play as a killer main and have go against a team of SWF blendettes all carrying utility flashlights with all battery addons (if you are new, you will learn what this is/means). These groups of teammates will finish 3 gens within 5 minutes of a match starting, have one of their teammates work on the last 2 gens, while the other three teabag, dance, and troll the killer with the flashlights, because they absolutely love to rub their \"superiority complex\" all over a killer.\n- As aforementioned, troll matches and other experiences lead most players to become survivor mains, or camping/slugging/severely tunneling killers. And I mean these terms should be used rarely-- because a lot of survivors will overdo taunting in the post-game chat with \"tunneling trash\" or \"camping slugger *****\". As a result, expect to quickly get into a match as a killer, but expect to wait longer as a survivor.\n- A majority of matches will be a below average experience, especially for solo-queue players.\n- There is a great polarized community between killer mains and survivor mains. To be honest, as a killer main and great survivor, I just wish these communities got along better. Maybe if Behavior would support a conjunction group, it would be great. \n- Tutorial really isn't that great, although it teaches the basics, it really neglects strategies. In order to become a great player, expect to rely on some articles/watching videos.\n- One of the biggest community failures in DBD is recognizing match progress. I beg everyone to understand the importance of timing. TrU3Ta1ent does a great job of explaining this-- in my experience that I'm sure others will agree with: if a game starts and two survivors get hooked, or even worse, one survivor gets hooked twice before even 1 generator is completed, the game is practically over (killer victory). If two gens are completed before the killer hooks 4 times, the game is also practically over (survivor victory). In all honesty, generator regression needs a rework, so that new survivors really understand the importance of working on a gen, and so that killers are given an opportunity to win against greatly experienced survivor teams. \n- Some DLCs are absolutely not worth paying money for: for example, the All-Kill chapter has a trash killer (that hopefully will get reworked), the A Binding of Kin also has a trash killer period, Cursed Legacy has a killer that is too hard to play for most players, the Demogorgon from the Stranger Things DLC is too weak against good teams, Ash vs. Evil Dead is a money grab, and many perks are just \"trash\" for experienced players in most DLCs. The reason why I didn't put the Halloween chapter on this list despite it containing the worse killer, is just because the killer and survivor perks are strong, and in fact, Decisive Strike is probably one of the most used survivor perks in all of DBD. \n- Perks are categorized as \"meta\" or not. This basically means which perks every survivor should use to \"instantly become a better player\". Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Object of Obsession, Sprint Burst, Head-On, Desperate Measures, and more are a good example of the only perks \"professional survivors\" will use-- this ostracizes a major aspect of DBD gameplay. In short, most survivors will literally never use 80% of all survivor DBD perks and rely on a small list of \"meta\" perks. As a killer main, I will say that these perks are just proof of incapability. If a survivor has to rely completely on one perk, in order to play a match right, that tells an experienced person something. \n- The ranking system is fairly broken at the time I wrote this review, matchmaking for survivors just sucks, no need to explain this, as any player who plays DBD will experience why this is.\n- The DBD development team is mostly survivor mains, which means that future updates/etcetera will mostly likely inadvertently have survivor bias. \n\n[u] In short: [/u]\nThe game has a lot of flaws, but also a lot of positives. For the price that it is and for the experience it offers, this game is totally worth achievement hunting, having fun with friends, and much more. I do recommend this, as even some of the cons listed here might make you or others a better player in the gaming community as a whole (we need to experience negativity, in order to understand how to fight it and become cooperative gamers). \n\nRemember this: [spoiler] Death is not an escape.
