At the end of the day, no matter how serious some people take it, this is a CASUAL game. Personally, I would like the killer to be more viable against pre-made groups, but as it stands, any good 3-4 man will wipe the floor with the killer. The game has it's fair share of problems as well. Sound issues, bugs, balancing, and probably the worst part - TOXIC PLAYERS. That being said if you can get past the Killers spamming \"Gen Rushers and Keys\" and the Survivors crying about \"Camping, Tunneling, Moris, NOED, ect.\", you can have ton's of fun with this game. This does not mean there aren't some amazing people that play this game, because there are and I have met many down to earth and chill people. \n\n\nCommunity:\nI think one of the biggest factor is the fact that the ranking system doesn't properly reflect skill. Rank 1 is the highest and represents nearly 10% of the player base which leads to a HUGE variation of skill in the top ranks. This generally tends to lead to egos built up by players with no real outlet to judge their skills - aka EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE A GOD. I even think that that is ok as long as you are having fun. Just don't let that get to you and play how you want. If you want to play Killer or Survivor a certain \"scummy\" way because it is fun for you, just do it! HAVE FUN! Don't let the predetermined metas and whiny player base control how you play the game.\n\nIf these are things you can get over, I highly recommend this game to anyone who like asymmetrical horrors. It currently is the king of the genre right now and offers a ton of variety whether you play as the Killer or Survivor. Be warned, it is a grind and potentially can be costly to get the right set of perks that you want. While you can unlock most stuff freely, it will take a decent amount of time to do so. I recommend playing both Killer and Survivor equally when starting off to get the feel on how each side plays, learn the map tiles (as maps are semi random but are built on set tiles where you will see patterns), and just have a good time!","timestamp_created":1599743668,"timestamp_updated":1599743805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75745666","author":{"steamid":"76561198076416795","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":7009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":74,"playtime_at_review":1624,"last_played":1659663134},"language":"latam","review":"Es un muy buen juego multiplayer y jugarlo con amigos es aún mejor, con la nueva actualización mejoraron algunos gráficos que no afectan en la jugabilidad pero visualmente hacen mejor la experiencia.

Though there are several positives, I fear the problems and negatives that come with this game make it generally unpalatable to new players.\n\nFirst, the pros:\n\n1.  It's a novel idea and the best 4v1 game of its type out there (though most others are blatant copies of DbD).\n\n2.  There are plenty of characters both survivor and killer to play as and master, and the perk system means the game offers hours and hours of playtime and progress.\n\n3.  There are loads of cosmetics available for survivor and killer alike, and although some are flat-out recolors of the default costume, most are appealing and well thought-out (though the do require spending actual money).\n\nAnd now for the cons:\n\n1.  Having played survivor and killer more or less 50/50, I can say that the survivors are too powerful.  If the survivors have any idea what they're doing it can be borderline impossible to catch them in a chase before the others band together and knock out every generator on the map in 2.4 seconds.  Combine this with the huge number of crutch perks survivors have and playing killer can be a daunting task.  God help you if you're paired with a 4-man SWF group.\n\n2.  The developers are extremely out-of-touch.  between game-breaking bugs and extremely unbalanced perks, I think I have seen a grand total of one change at least some people asked for (ruin being nerfed).  Other than that, the devs would rather introduce new killers/cosmetics and so on than fine-tune the ones in the game already to balance them well.\n\n3.  The community in this game goes beyond toxic and into radioactive.  Aside from perhaps Mordhau, I have not seen a more toxic community; survivors regularly wait at exit gates to taunt killers, drop pallets and t-bag to taunt killers, rapidly click flashlights on and off, etc. and nearly always stick around to rub in a loss in the post-game chat (or complain about your choice of killer/perks if you win).  Racism, homophobia, etc. are rampant and reports almost never generate results.  After a while you learn to tune it out, but it is something to be aware of.\n\nOverall, not an altogether bad game, but it has some SEVERE flaws that show no signs of being fixed.  It appeals to a very specific type of player, and you will likely hate it if you don't fit into its
