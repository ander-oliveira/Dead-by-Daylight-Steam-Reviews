The amount of \"good games\" I've had can be counted on one hand. Survivors not only have to battle against extremely high odds, with every new killer being more broken than the next. From a doctor that corrupts your screen and punishes you for playing the game correctly, to a hillbilly that has a oneshot ability and is so fast that even if he doesn't one hit you, you can escape from him unless you run in circles like an idiot and frustrate the killer into leaving you alone. That being said, with the community as toxic as it is, if you overfrustrate the killer, he will catch you and stare at you on the hook until you die or punish your friends for trying to save you. \n\nAll of that aside, I really found myself enjoying the killer portion of it. I LOVED playing as killer. Of course, they had to ruin that too with the ranking system. Being as I just started playing killer, my ranking isn't high. That being said, I guess I'm cursed to stay in low ranks because the matchmaking refuses to put surviors in my lobby. I'll wait for 15 minutes and never find anyone, close the lobby, reopen it, and wait another 15 minutes. \n\n10/10 great game. Wouldn't recommend if someone paid me.","timestamp_created":1540062829,"timestamp_updated":1540261896,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45362298","author":{"steamid":"76561197987662023","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14199,"last_played":1649564233},"language":"english","review":"Where to start, I started playing this when beta hit and boy did it have issies, more bugs than I care to think about and compared to now, few options between killers/survivors to pick from.\n\nAs of now, this DEV team has came a long way with this project. It's very enjoytable and they do a great job at trying to keep it balanced all though that can be difficult between all the perks and characters you can play. They do a great job on pumping content out (DLC) and they keep it reasonably priced. There are bugs from time to time but there kept to a minimul and they usually roll out a hotfix quickly to get them corrected.\n\nI recommend this game if your looking for a fun horror themed environment and have the expectation that you will get \"those\" teammates from time to time and your gonna die. If you can accpet that then I think you will like what Dead by Daylight has to offer.","timestamp_created":1540060770,"timestamp_updated":1540060770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533477306365966797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45362043","author":{"steamid":"76561198112102144","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19328,"last_played":1647015967},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩歸好玩\n不過為了抑制SWF團而一直buff殺手\n該修的bug也不修(像是血祭品抱摔)\n搞到後來會玩的大概也只有SWF團吧\n對新手入門來講根本......\n最近BUG又這麼多 而且幾乎都是生還者的\n明明就門開了卻出不去 唯一能走的只有下水道\n還被殺手關起來","timestamp_created":1540059759,"timestamp_updated":1564833278,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45361456","author":{"steamid":"76561198747643211","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":409117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3707,"playtime_at_review":56923,"last_played":1660583046},"language":"english","review":"This game has taken over my life and ruined many relationships of mine. i come home from my 12 hour job and just come home to ignore my girlfriend so i can play.

The graphics are terrible, the game is riddled with bugs; both for the killers and the survivors (i.e. slow vaulting over pallets or crates when you are sprinting or fast vaulting which you will STILL be hit by killers despite being away from that area as far as possible.) Experienced Survivors will either teabag and waste a new killers time or a killer will tunnel on a single new survivor and make their life a living hell until they are dead on hook. Tunneling and camping are not bannable/reportable by a killer. But a survivor who \"rage quits\" or leaves a match because of it will be punished... the irony isn't lost.  As of 10/14/2018 survivors who dodge or leave a match no matter the reason will get a 1 week, then 2 week, 3 week and on their 4th leave a perma-ban.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.\n\n\nWell, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.\n\n\nWell, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed.

Firstly the game gives the players the choice to become killer or survivor. Over the past year or so I have seen various updates and additions that have changed how to survive and adapt to killers. Survivors have the upper hand when it comes to surviving the killer and its really easy to rank up (lower competition). There has been recent updates in dedicated servers, to try and offset how long it takes for the killer to get people in a match, still takes 10-20 min as killer to wait for players to join. Additions of recent killers is admirable to keep people interested. \n\nMy previous review i had not recommended this game because of the glitches, and utter lack of developer attention to fans/players critiques. As well as there seems to be quite a bit of cheaters/hackers in the DbD servers. Constantly I see many things that should not happen in game. This could be to exploitation, but hacking is most common, especially when you see a survivor running around the map at 10x speed. \n\nOn another note the graphics have changed in that there is more shadows/lighting, but at the cost to detail and foreground processing. DbD is somewhat Gpu taxing and thus even on one of the best graphics cards it still has its troubles, whereas in other games ultra setting with greater than 60 fps can be achieved. In game there is no option to change the graphic settings, just standard options which is a bad thing to have.","timestamp_created":1539987695,"timestamp_updated":1596955368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45345824","author":{"steamid":"76561198853011606","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41255,"last_played":1547224585},"language":"english","review":"Want to play a game where the company promotes toxicity? \nYou're in the right place.\n-Event? killer sided (just look at the recent event, you barely get any points) \n-Patches? killer sided (been a year since survivors were boosted)\n-Bugs? killer sided (the list is endless)\n-Bans? killer sided (they don't ban lag switchers, they mostly ban people who leave the game which most of the time are survivors who face lag switchers)\n-Hacks? very easy to hack, people even live stream hacks and they don't get banned","timestamp_created":1539987099,"timestamp_updated":1544006218,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464878350496292114","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45345813","author":{"steamid":"76561198106898849","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":27349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14723,"last_played":1658321207},"language":"english","review":"Great game regular updates just the community tends to be Toxic half of the time in OCE you dont see much cheaters or toxic people but you still get your fair share of them.","timestamp_created":1539987060,"timestamp_updated":1539987060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45345434","author":{"steamid":"76561198357014535","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":72691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31648,"last_played":1657582922},"language":"english","review":"WORST HALLOWEEN EVENT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1539985224,"timestamp_updated":1539985224,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484684675931930542","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45345152","author":{"steamid":"76561198811775765","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":590,"last_played":1611386253},"language":"english","review":":D","timestamp_created":1539983826,"timestamp_updated":1539983826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45344959","author":{"steamid":"76561198191427951","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":54164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14215,"last_played":1576337879},"language":"polish","review":"Sama gra jest bardzo fajna lecz mam problem.

For many reason.\nThis game is a asymetric game were you play either as a survivor who is trying to flee from a killer that try to murder you but putting you on meat hook.\nThe gameplay is intense as well as the survivor, who have to repair motors, with sometimes QTE, and get scared when the killer jumpscare you by coming from an angle you didn't see.\nAs the killer, you have to be quick to find the survivor not prevent them escaping.\nYou get in the end blood point to make your character (Either Killer or survivor) more powerfull\nThe game is intense, fun and spooky sometimes.\nNow the problem:\nDespite being a game you pay, it uses the same scheme as the free to play.\nFirst you have 3 money:\n-The blood points you can get from just playing, and will be more and more depending on you score. Fair enough.\n-The Iridescent Shards that you get by leveling your player level, they are REALLY LONG to get (Currently level 7 and I have less than 691) and allow you to eventually buy a killer (Which cost around 9000 Shard) But NOT ALL KILLER can be bought throught shard. Same for survivors.\n-Auric Cell which are the money you can only buy using money.\nProblem is that you pay for a game, that have half of the killer available only through DLC, and uses the same system of pay to win.\nThe thing is that, Killers you can obtain throught DLC are (or at least feel) really hard to deal with, making the surviving experience really tough and even more if you didn't bought the survivor DLC too.\nObviously, there are also cosmetics you can buy... but same as before, pull out your (rare) iridescent shard or break your piggybank. Plus each DLC Killer cost around 7€, the base game cost 20€ so for a total of approximately 73€ you have a game that is only multiplayer, with just a few maps (that are at least free).\nAnd let's not talk about the community that is... really horrible (Camping killer, survivor that mess you up so you get caught etc etc)\nOr if you want to play as a Killer ? Good luck finding survivors, the connexion can be horrible...\nIs this game fun ? Yes\nIs it good to play with friend ? It's awesome !\nDoes this game worth the price ? Without the DLC I would say yes, but not at all with the DLC.\nDo I recommend it ?
