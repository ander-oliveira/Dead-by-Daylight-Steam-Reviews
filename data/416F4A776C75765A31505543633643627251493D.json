If you just start off as killer, you'll probably get bullied a lot since more people have hours. \nIf you're new to survivor, you'll probably get tunneled to death by the killer. \n\nDespite the ups and downs, I'd still recommend the game for anyone who look for fun on either side of the game.

Lo deje de jugar en Enero (junto a otros 4/5 amigos). Lo probe luego de la actualizacion, jugue las peores 3 partidas de mi vida. Me hizo enojar y lo cerré. Muy triste.\n\nOjala salga alguno parecido pero bien hecho, es buena la modalidad.\n\nReseña previa:\nCuando arranque a jugar me parecía un juego muy divertido, el objetivo era escapar o dont be dead by daylight. Una vez que empece a bajar de rango y la cosa se pone mas seria, ya empieza a tornarse aburrido. Es un juego muy pro killer, con habilidades que pueden marcar el desenlace de una partida antes de comenzar. Items como memento mori que el unico objetivo es hacer bajar de rango a los sobrevivientes porque ni el killer suma puntos al usarlo.\n\nSe desconecta y te saca puntos, hice 0 púntos y me sacó 1 punto, bugs y errores que terminamos pagando con nuestro tiempo. \nMuchas ventajas para los asesinos y no tantas para los sobrevivientes, te dan habilidades como poder saltar y salir corriendo pero el killer salta atras mio y me pega en el aire con una precision increíble. O se teletransporta y pega a distancia,  pegan a una pared y te matan.\n\nHay killers que estan rotisimos, freddy, la enfermera, ghost face.\n\nHay partidas que no podemos reparar ni 1 generador y te saca puntos, y hay partidas donde reparamos todo rapido, escapamos y te saca puntos tambien......\n\nPareciera que quieren que seamos todos killers, ya que todas las ventajas están ahi.","timestamp_created":1604892452,"timestamp_updated":1613768381,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78977606","author":{"steamid":"76561199073988935","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":41055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":61,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1660317472},"language":"english","review":"i like this game","timestamp_created":1604892262,"timestamp_updated":1604892262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78977519","author":{"steamid":"76561198953794315","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":38623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1654173082},"language":"russian","review":"top","timestamp_created":1604892083,"timestamp_updated":1604892083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78977229","author":{"steamid":"76561198064055416","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2831,"last_played":1630292273},"language":"english","review":"I love chasey game \n","timestamp_created":1604891519,"timestamp_updated":1604891519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78977021","author":{"steamid":"76561198061254518","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9764,"last_played":1658973555},"language":"english","review":"love everything about this game!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1604891106,"timestamp_updated":1604891106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78976890","author":{"steamid":"76561198177909310","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7230,"last_played":1658772875},"language":"english","review":"Fun game.

Es cierto que si no hay superioridad por parte del asesino, nadie querría serlo y por lo tanto no se jugaría,pero si no hay supervivientes que jueguen, el asesino no tendrá nadie a quien colgar. El sistema de reportes es pésimo, los asesinos generan abuso sobre un único jugador, haciendo las partidas aburridas y toxicas, sin contar algún caso descarado de uso de cheats y no se aplica ningún tipo de castigo para estos.

are you? Survivor? Killer? A little of both? They call the game survival horror, but I think it's more than that. This game and how we play it is a manifestation of our primal instincts.

Maybe you're more the more [b]Altruistic[/b] type that heals other survivors when they're wounded and/or rescue them from hooks?

Your role may vary from match to match, but when the gates are powered and opened do you maintain that role? Do you help others survivors escape too or is it everyone for themselves at that point?

Is the [b]Sacrifice[/b] all you care about and one by one you hook survivors until the entity takes them or meet the conditions to kill them by your own hand? Do you [u]respect the 4% when a survivor gets themselves off a hook after they've been left behind[/u]? Will you show mercy to a good survivor that had bad teammates that you made short work of?
