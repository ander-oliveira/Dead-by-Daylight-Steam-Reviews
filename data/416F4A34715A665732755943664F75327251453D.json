Even though I enjoy playing the game, I would not recommend it. It is a very unfriendly game for a new player. The community is extremely hateful and self entitled that unless you main a Killer, Survivor players will only really enjoy it if they have 3 other friends to play with. With that in mind, I'll go into details in Pros, and cons regarding the game itself.\n\n:Pros:\n-A fun cat and mouse game that's relatively 'simple'. Kill the Survivors, or Escape.\n-A wide variety of Killers of various horrors, and guest fighters/killers like Micheal Myers. The characters ARE interesting, and even likable.\n-The Survivors are all the same, they simply look different, and have different perks so play whoever you like.\n-There's a legit catharsis factor for both sides. Successfully killing all 4 Survivors can feel very satisfying, while slamming a Killer who won't leave you alone with a Pallet can feel great, and of course, escaping.\n-In the worst situation for Survivors, near the end of the game a Hatch will appear as their numbers dwindle. The last Survivor has no chance of fixing the gens, but he can find the hatch to possibly escape. This isn't a foolproof plan though, the Killer can close the hatch, but hey, you got a chance still, also you might be lucky and have a key.\n\n\n:Cons:\n\n-The Community. I played a lot of online games, a lot of MMOs. This games community is so far, the absolute worst one I've seen. Period. Lots of people who are just looking to harass you over nothing. It's actually because of these people I've had to make my profile for alittle while because they don't stop harassing your comment sections. They're petty, obnoxious, and you're just better off just not engaging anyone in discussion.\n\n-Every Killer functions very differently and you'll need a lot of practice to learn how each one functions, either playing as them, or against them. There's almost 20 different killers at the moment this review is originally made. This is like a living nightmare for new survivors as one of your main keys to survival is knowing how a Killer works.\n\n-Some of the cosmetics and characters are just terrible, and impractical. Jane for example is notably thicker compared to others, easier to spot behind trees. Then you got bright, pink clothes hiding in the dark. I think you can imagine how this is bad for blending in. Killers can also suffer from this, but hiding isn't as vital for them.\n\n-The horror aspect grows weak as you keep playing. For a Survivor in the beginning it's scary hearing your heartbeat as the Killer draws closer, but quickly loses it's scare factor after the first few games. You might still get a good startle from certain killers popping out of nowhere, but very mild.\n\n-Long waiting queues.\n\n-So much DLC, The base game only has a few Killers, and survivors on the roster for you to play but expect you to buy pack, after pack. This wouldn't be so bad if they just bundled them up after all this time. It's also cheaper to simply buy the game shop currency and just grab 1 character vs the bundle for people you probably don't want. Like Ace and Hag, Hag is okay, but Ace is pretty weak. You also won't get a chance to Demo these Killers.You can obtain a leveling up currency to unlock characters, but only Originals, and the level currency price is staggeringly high.\n\n-Perks, jeez, these perks...Okay so remember how I said this game is very unfriendly for newbies? Imagine playing your first game as Killer, you got 1 perk, in it's weakest level. You are 99% likely to go up against survivors who already have the best perks they can get and set up at max level. New players are in for a severe hazing as they will need to go through a long grind to rack up points, and earn perks that will help them. Oh and of course, you have to mix and match the perks from multiple characters for a good set. So you best have your wallet ready for that as well. Every character you need to level 30-40 to unlock the perks for other characters, which will cost hundreds of thousands of blood points, which you can earn up to 32K + Modifiers in a really good game. On average you'll probably earn 6K-24K depending on how you play. Yes, I know, you can be patient and hope the games shop has the perks available on the weekly shrine that uses leveling currency, but good luck getting the perks you want anytime soon.\n\n-The Rift, an incredibly obnoxious cash grab by the developers. Dozens of levels for you to grind through slowly to unluck cosmetic rewards. You can buy a PREMIUM for it which doesn't even speed up the leveling. No, you have to marathon the ever loving hell out of this game, and I mean marathon it. Clear up your schedule if you wanna get these goodies, and break open that wallet. You can actually pay EVEN MORE to auto-level it, but again, you're only doing this for cosmetics. Might as well just be a middle finger to you as a player.\n\n-Matchmaking is utterly broken! You can have a greenhorn rank 20 run into games with rank 5 opponents, even though the lower ranking indicates this guy has been playing for quite awhile. Not only that, but you can easily de-rank yourself so you can bully newer players more frequently.\n\n-The Hit Boxes can be pretty wonky. Like if you clearly should have hit that person but somehow you don't, or when the killer is like a mile away, and still land that hit somehow. Huntress suffers this the most with her ranged attack, sometimes hitting junk for no reason, or somehow going through said junk! It's a notable con cause the messed up hit can really mess up your composure, even some of the most popular, and seasoned streamers have a \"WTF?!\" moment cause of it from time to time.\n\n-Cheating is very common with Survivor groups. The idea is that you don't know who, or where the killer is until you figure it out, and have to find your friends with your own skills. Instead players in groups usually use Discord or what have you, relaying all sorts of information to one another. One of the Killers best weapons is the element of surprise, so having the team constantly reporting sightings can severely hurt the Killers experience. Despite it not being fair for Killers, these jackasses will justify it by saying the Killers are OP to start with, which isn't even true. Every Killer can be beat, period. It's unfortunately not a bannable offense as it seems no one, not even the Mods know if it counts as actual cheating or not. Good luck proving they were anyways. There's also been reports of wall hacks, speed hacks, and hacked perks. I've personally had to deal with a few of these.\n\nCrappy Killers: Okay so plenty of these guys look/sound good on paper, sometimes they WERE good until they were quickly ruined by patches/nerfs. Legion for example got hit the hardest. Originally when he could use his ability and not worry about missing, but now if he misses, he's going to get stunned. Combine that with the bad hitbox mentioned earlier, Survivors easily ruin the entire point of the power with what's called a Juke, it's like a quick timing bit where they dance in a circle to mess up your aiming.\n\n\nThe game IS fun to play, I wouldn't say fun enough to marathon, but unless you know exactly how to start off, you are in for a very long, rough hazing, you will be harassed, it will not be enjoyable. What's funny is this isn't a problem on console. On console the players aren't as intense and you have a much easier time settling in with your Killers/Survivors without needing to invest money for other characters for their perks. If you have a choice between Console, or PC, for the love of god go PC.\n\nI give the PS4 version an 8 out of 10, but the PC a 4.5 out of 10.
