Можно взять жертву и пытаться выжить, что сделать ох как не просто, а можно взять маньяка и играть по фану ни о чём не беспокоясь. Объясню как( ибо в игре туториал скучный и нихуя толком не объясняет) \nжертва.\nВ этой игре вам как жертве надо включить все генераторы (что просто при наличии глаз и реакции), открыть дверь и сбежать. мешать вам будет маньяк, и его примочки. Если же он вас найдёт, то надо убегать, перепрыгивать через окна, вилять, прятаться в шкафу и кидать перед ним баррикады). Если тебя поймали, то тебе надо дёргаться чтобы выпасть у него и рук, или можно просто ждать смерти или чтобы тебя спасли. Спасать приходится с крюка жертвоприношения (вроде как, сам хз чё там происходит)  спасение очень простое (подошёл, снял, убежал), но усложняется обычно ждущим маньяком рядом. Так же можно поставить в начале предметы(фонарик, аптечка итд), усиления предметов, фишки карт (будет меньше крюков или больше баррикад которые можно скинуть итд) и перки (быстрее починка генератора, быстрее бег или быстрее лечение союзника итд). Иииииииииииии...Главное. при приближении маньяка у вас стучит сердце (у персонажа :D)\n\nманьяк.\nвам надо всех убить (да ладно))) и принести в жертву богу (-пауку чтоли?) на выбор даётся 3 вида маньяков.\n 1-стандартный с капканом (лишает жертву возможности двигаться).\n 2-пугало с колокольчиком (делает наполовину невидимым и  быстрым, но лишает возможности атаковать, имба крч). \n 3-кожаное лицо с бензопилой( при включении пилы замедляется, после включения начинает очень быстро бежать с бензопилой. но повороты будут только градусов на 20, также бензопила ложит с одного удара). При взрыве генератора (у жертвы отказали глаза или реакция) вам покажется какой генератор взорвался. Также покажется, какой генератор починили (отметится жёлтым цветом). Также проверяйте шкафы (чаще всего из них будут идти стоны, так что не потеряете). найдя жертву, вам надо повесить её на крюк и ждать, пока бог(-паук?) заберёт её, ибо её могут освободить. Правда со второго раза Жертва обычно умирает на крюке сразу. у маньяка, как и у жертв есть улучшение карт(больше крюков, меньше баррикад итд) улучшения скилла (быстрее заряжается бензопила или колокольчик, дольше снимается капкан итд) и перки (маньяк быстрее бьёт, бежит, ломает баррикады итд). вроде всё\n\nосновные плюсы и минусы.\n+ атмосфера\n+ геймплей\n+ много маньяков\n+ неплохая реализация\n+- для хорора графон очень даже ничего, но для настолько хайпанутой игры он слабоват\n- так себе оптимизация\n- тимплея тоже нет, ибо чаще всего все жертвы огромный XYU ложили на него.\n-  небольшой дисбаланс с очками крови (за маньяка их реально получить проще)\n- сырость, как в дедушкином подвале\n- WRAITH (поиграете-поймёте) \n\nа так игра на мой скромненький взгляд 7,5\\10\n\nP.s. на этом моя работа закончена)\n(но ведь ты ничего не сделал)\n *медленно ухожу в закат* :D","timestamp_created":1466006630,"timestamp_updated":1466006630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23571726","author":{"steamid":"76561198000435584","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1467494504},"language":"german","review":"Heyo!\nWie viele Andere wollte auch ich eigentlich ein positives Review schreiben, aber leider gibt es für mich zu viele entscheidende Probleme zur Zeit.\n1.

Let's talk about the hate it deserves. One of the few things that some people have complained about that I actually think is legit is the settings, like for a modern game 2k16 you would think that the devs would give you the option to change your settings for quality a little more than low , medium , high etc. I mean it does not really bother me but I think that it is an option that is needed. \nAnother thing that needs to be addressed is the connection to steam, a lot of people have been dcd from the game because it says that steam is offline (myself included) but most of the time steam is still up. There is a lot more things that are legit to complain about but let's talk about the things that I really hate that people are complaining about. And that is the \"You can't que with your friends\" the thing is if you can que with your friends it will put the killer at a disadvantage but the devs have already said that they are working on it. And the whole que with friends, if you only want to que with friends and don't really care for other players then go play \"Kill your friends\" if you are only playing the game to be able to play with your friends does your rank/lvl really matter?\n\n[h1][u]Good stuff[/u][/h1]\n\nNow let's talk about the good things about the game. I've always liked the horror genre and was really excited when I saw this game. I just love the feeling as you run for your life hoping you will get away or that someone will distract the killer so you could survive. The game has a *v1 concept and the survivors need to turn on generators in order to escape while the killer will try to hinder them at any costs. I really love this concept, it both builds on teamwork and betrayal. I've had my fair deal of teammates trying to save me and my fair deal of teammates luring the killer to me or just blocking my path with wooden objects ;_;. \n\n[h1][u]Game stuff[/u][/h1]\n\nThe lobby layout is fairly simple, you click join lobby(sometimes a lot because you can't connect or something) then you wait for the whole lobby to fill out, in the meantime you change your loadout to make it easier for you to survive(med kits, flashlights, add-ons, sacrifices and perks) and check out the other teammates lvl/rank, it's a shame that you can't see the killers rank or level anywhere(well you can see his rank after the game is done but that isn't enough) and I think that is a shame because you would not know if you are meeting an experienced player or a completely beginner, so you can't really adapt your playstyle(You can kinda, it puts you with kind of the same rank but still). Then in game you start of fairly close to your teammates while the killer is pretty close himself so you could easily get caught within the first 10-20 seconds if you aren't careful. If you are caught the killer will most likely guard you while you are sitting on a hook and that will give your team two choices. Either 1, save you (Which will be the more risky choice and someone will most likely be killed instead of you or with you) or 2. Turn on the generators while you are struggling (This is the more obviously choice since you barely get any rewards saving your teammates which is a shame) after all the generators have been turned on you try to open the exit and escape, or if you are alone left you can find the escape hatch and ditch the others.\n\n[h1][u]End[/u][/h1]\n\nI really love the concept of being in an old horror movie and trying to survive but I think it would make the game better if they added some sort of VON/VOIP 3D broadcast to the game, it would benefit the survivors but the killer would be able to hear them as well.\nCurrently I would rate the game 7/10 just because of the missing things and some balancing issues.\n\n\n[h1][u]UPDATE[/u][/h1]\n\nNow that I have more hours into the game I feel like I can point out some more things.\nThe devs have added a mode called Survive with friends which is basically a mode that lets you play with your friends online and that is great, if it wasn't for the fact that you need to spend on average 30-40 minutes in the fricking lobby pressing \"READY\" over and over again. This is a shitty way of treating your \"Customers\" by letting them wait for hours only to have the host (aka the killer) leave and you will feel robbed of your time. \nThey have also added a feature which gives killers points in case a survivor leaves, but not vice versa????? I mean like if the killer gets something if someone rage quits shouldn't the survivors get something if the killer rage quits?? \n\nI just want to say one thing after this fucked up development and that is the Developers are bloody stupid, like common why do they keep buffing killers all the time when it's not even needed....\n\nI just feel like they don't even care about the fans but only about the money they have already gotten. \n\nUntil they fix a lot of bugs (Did not mention the bugs) and still balancing issues then I can't recommend this game to people.","timestamp_created":1466004526,"timestamp_updated":1470179394,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23571231","author":{"steamid":"76561198075049983","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":23578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1640079866},"language":"english","review":"It is a really good game, I can only recommend it.

I bought it 2 weeks before release and I really don't regret it. Gameplay is fun and so tense I almost shat my pants a few times (especially when you fix the generator and you hear those fucking bell chimes and Wraith appears behind you). And this rising heartbeat sound.... It can be really scary sometimes :D I didn't experience such problems as other people describing in their reviews. I was disconnected from Steam once but it was my Internet connection. No crashes, no \"failed to join lobby\", no neverending loading screens. Very few occasional bugs/glitches, one round with lags. When creating a lobby as a killer, max amount I had to wait was ~3 mins. \n\nPros:\n- really intense gameplay\n- great atmosphere\n- deep progression system\n- 3 killers to choose from\n- nice locations and procedurally generated environment - no round will be the same\n- graphics and sound quality\n- feeling that you get when being chased by a killer !\n\nCons:\n- no party system (yet)\n- no in-game voice chat when playing with randoms\n- no customizable controls\n- only pre-defined graphic settings (for me it's not exactly a problem)\n- killers camping by the hook (it is good and bad thing actually - you can't save your fellow player and unhook him but you have time to fix generators)\n\nTo conclude. for me it's very well made game, giving ton of fun, with great atmosphere and great progression system. No other game could get my heart beating so fast and so pumped with adrenaline. It has some flaws like lack of party system, but developers are working on it and it's their priority. And playing with randoms can be fun as well.

I guess let us eat cake.\n\nStill Alpha...\n\nLack of key bindings, load times, lack of graphics options show this is running on a game engine not ready for release. \n\nThere is no AI, so when the killer rage quits or someone goes AFK the game is nothing but a objective hunt to get out or a kill free for all.\n\nThe game lacks depth. In under two hours I did everything there was to do multiple times and only 1 person tried to save me. To be fair the later point could be due to the game balancing that allows the killer to simply sit at the hook until the player is dead then repeat on the next player.\n\nThe camera is really sluggish and poorly implemented (on purpose to help the killer?) so once the killer is close they got you unless they are really bad. Oh and quicktime events to interact with objects or climb through windows are flaky at best, likely a network code issue.\n\nHas potential but don't all babies? Wait to see what this matures into. I'm guessing due to the poor launch the player base is going to fall quickly and this will be on sale during the Summer sale a few weeks from now to try to bolster the player base. \n\nThere is no published roadmap of further development plans and given the number of missing features and bugs there should at least be a ETA on issues present since BETA.

Самая идея очень неплохая, игр подобного жанра уже давно не видел, ну-с, где я там слыхал про Friday 13th The game, но всё же она ещё не вышла, и говорить мы будем про неё уже в дату выхода. В общем за реализацию идеи и воплощение страхов в виртуальный мир это плюсик. Медленно переходим к графике... Я здесь лично не могу придраться к чему либо, всё сделанно качественно, а главное добросовестно. За графику тоже небольшой плюсик рисуем. Оптимизация... На моём компьютере матчи проходят не так гладко, а игра иногда подлагивает, но всё же по сравнению с другими играми, эта хорошо оптимизирована. Тоже плюс. Карты... Хммм... Вот здесь есть свои буйки с порохом... Карт не так много как казалось бы, по факту мы чаще играем на разновидностях этих самых карт, вот за разновидность карты и рандомную генерацию похвала, за малое количество карт обидно. Но всё же я поставлю милипизерный плюс. Идём дальше... Минусов здесь хватает... Начнём с того, что анимация часто багует, и игра выглядит немного странно, за что складывается впечатление, что поторопились с этим моментом. Так же очень горько меня приветствовала загрузка, ну уж очень она долгая, есть с чем сравнить. Ну ещё я хотел отметить свою принадлежность к такому жанру игр, посути анигилируя в матче, создаётся волна настроения. Собственно забыл упомянуть метки, которые поставлены на превью игры в стиме. Атмосферность - несмоненно есть, дух захватывает от знания того, что где то рядом ходит маньяк, что бы грохнуть тебя за милую душу. Хоррор - ну тут говорить ничего не буду, оно само собой виднеется. В общем в результате моих некоторых наблюдений в течении часа, я сделал следующие выводы: 1. Немного поторопились; 2. Хорошая реализация; 3. Ощущение абстрактного присутствия чего либо после матча.
