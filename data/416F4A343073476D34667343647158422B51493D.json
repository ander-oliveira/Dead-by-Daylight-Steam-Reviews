En muchos juegos gratuitos es más fácil conseguir personajes y skins nuevas. aquí se pasan de ambiciosos. \n\n*el juego está desbalanceado y cada vez esto empeora. esto es lo peor que pueden hacer con un multijugador. el desbalance viene favoreciendo a los survivors. y como son más, los desarrolladores les hacen caso a sus lloros y el desbalance es cada vez peor. \n\n*derivado de lo anterior, muchos jugadores ya se alejan o dejan de jugar como killers. por lo que encontrar partida como survivor es algo tardado y tedioso. \n\n*aunque esto no es del todo culpa de los devs. la comunidad de este juego es horriblemente tóxica. \n\nen fin. que con todo lo bueno que puede tener, al final es un juego frustrante y que te desanima a jugar, y todo va empeorando de a poco.  \n6.5/10.

From the surface level it is a very simple competitive horror game, but the more you play the deeper and more complex the experience becomes.\n\nTo put it simply DBD is two different games with entirely different experiences mashed into one. You either play as a killer or one of four survivors put into a semi-randomly generated map where your goal is either to escape as a survivor or hook and kill everyone as the killer. In other words you are choosing between being the predator or the prey. This creates an interesting dynamic that I don't think any other game really comes close to. When playing one side you actually learn how to better play the other side. \n\nSurvivor: When playing as the survivor you are part of a four man team versus a single killer. Your main objective is to work together with the other survivors to repair five generators that when finished will power exit gates that your team will then escape through. While repairing the generators you will be given skills checks in the form of quick time events that can speed up or slow down the process. Another aspect of playing survivor is avoiding / being chased by the killer. While being chased you are going to try to loop the killer through parts of the map that include pallets that you can throw down, windows you can jump through and a few other options. Your ultimate goal when being chased is to either escape and lose the killer or waste enough of his time that your fellow survivors can finish the generator repairs and then come save you later. I personally believe everyone should start out playing survivor in order to learn the tactics they use to avoid killer attacks. This will help you when starting out your killer gameplay.\n\nKiller: When playing as the killer your main goal is to hunt down and kill all of the survivors before they can finish the generators and escape. Each killer is different with unique perks and kits available. Some are very simple with one ability and a regular attack while others are much more complex and have a few abilities at their disposal. When playing as killer you should be putting pressure on the generators and constantly looking for survivors to take out with your abilities and hook. After three hooks a survivor will permanently die and be removed from the game. The more people you take out the easier it will be to finish the game without the survivors escaping and anyone surviving. I recommend that you start with one of the simpler killers such as wraith, trapper or hillbilly to learn the game and then delve deeper into the list of harder more complex ones.\n\nOverall Dead by Daylight is a unique and deep experience that I think anyone interested in online competitive co-op games or the horror genre in general should try out.","timestamp_created":1631060428,"timestamp_updated":1631060428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98963673","author":{"steamid":"76561198303967683","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":5055,"last_played":1660550464},"language":"english","review":"\n","timestamp_created":1631060418,"timestamp_updated":1631060418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98963636","author":{"steamid":"76561198962890232","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2477,"last_played":1652636252},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenardo","timestamp_created":1631060347,"timestamp_updated":1631060347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98963623","author":{"steamid":"76561198152106534","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":8567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5072,"last_played":1658664104},"language":"english","review":"Is bad game.

The game tends to lean more into the direction of favoring the killer. But, the biggest flaw is Behavior's inability to balance the game. Rather than add new DLC, the company should look at fixing existing errors such as hit boxes still not making sense; deciding on what is, and what is not balanced (the nerf to DS, which I do not use); updating existing perks/powers; etc.\n\nBehavior needs to re-evaluate where they were in the beginning to now, and bring all beginning content up to current speed. For example, when was The Shape truly evaluated, and compared to existing killers to see if he was balanced? Rather than throw more gimmicks at killers, I believe Plague was the beginning of the problem, why not adapt the existing killers to a more fair level. Some killer mains are already screaming about being weak, or having to use sweaty/tryhard builds to be competitive. \n\n(I am looking at you No One Escapes Skill. Sadly, this crutch perk teaches many killers to rely on their end game for kills, and discourages better game play. Why try, when I can slug at the end? I am fine with the speed buff, it is the unnecessary one-shot mechanic that I have issues with, especially when a Bubba (who is a one-shot wonder) is using this ability.) \n\nAs a survivor, solo queue is the devil. The ranking system is a joke because you are not matched with people of your \"skill\" level. The pipping system is a poor way to match people, because you can easily pip up doing the bare minimum.  I do believe some of the perks need to be re-evaluated, but overall I enjoy playing survivor.\n\nThere are differing play styles between console, and PC gamers. Sadly, console players seem to be weaker in many aspects when compared to PC players, or make worse mistakes than PC players. Turning off cross play is almost not an option depending on the time you play, because you could be waiting in excess of 15 minutes for a match, which is the average time of a match. When it come to killers, there is also a VERY large distinction between console, and PC killers. Console players tend to tunnel/camp hooks much harder than PC killers. PC killers will actually progress the game, where console players hold games hostage if they start to lose. It is also obvious in the first minute of the game as to who you are going against as a survivor based on the ability of the killer.\n\nOverall, I would not buy this game in the state that it is in currently, nor would I recommend it to a friend. Earlier patches, before Behavior's aggressive DLC schedule, were fun, and enjoyable. Now, it feels as if Behavior is like \"who can we get as the new killer/survivor to make money?\" (I know they want to release content that appeals to the player base, but please fix what you already have!) That said, Behavior does care about their players, or tries to get involved with them, but DBD is losing the fun it once had.","timestamp_created":1631057521,"timestamp_updated":1631057728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98962006","author":{"steamid":"76561198843856322","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2084,"last_played":1629660348},"language":"english","review":"fire","timestamp_created":1631057481,"timestamp_updated":1631057481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40sGm4fsCdqXB+QI="}
