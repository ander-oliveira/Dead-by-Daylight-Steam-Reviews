And I have spent over 18hrs playing it. It is June 15th.\n\nGeneral:\nThis game is super fun. Well worth the money. Keep in mind. You get items, perks, add-ons, and offerings. When you use an offering it is gone forever. When you use an item you keep it if you survive and it is not fully depleted. If you use an add-on you have to escape with the item you brought in. If you want to stock up on items. Start the match with northing and go in and look for a chest. Then get out of there. Finally, perks are things to help you every game. They never go away if you die. Like perks in COD or other games like it.\n\nPros:\n- Intense\n- Awesome leveling system\n- Character Customization (more soon to come)\n- Private Matches with friends\n- Daily Challenges for extra points to lvl up\n- Ability to prestige\n- Ability to have up to 4 perks at once\n\nCons:\n- Not enough customization on launch\n- Games can get laggy\n- Matchmaking mechanic is trash\n- Sometimes when you when a game and should rank up it doesn't rank you up\n- Wraith should move slower when cloaked.\n\n\nSurvivor Side:\n\n- Loves your friends when they are good\n- Wishes them death IRL when they suck\n- Wraith is too OP\n- Matchmaking is terrible because I always get the worst teammates\n- Connection Issues\n- Heartbeat is the reason I have anxiety IRL now\n\nKiller Side:\n\n- Hates the survivors when they are good\n- Trapper and Hillbilly need buffs\n- Matchmaking is terrible because I always play against best survivors\n- Everyone is lagging when I try and hit them\n- Cusses at people when you find them and they escape\n\n\n\nTips:\n- If I see another survivor hide in a locker in the basement....... [heavy breathing] I'm going to go insane\n- If I see another survivor crouch walk to someone on a hook from across the entire map......\n- If you are going to rescue someone from a hook. Finish the rescue. Or they will just die instantly.\n- When the game starts and you have full health. Get a generator....\n- If you see a teammate that is hurt. Heal them.\n- If you are the teammate that is hurt. Don't run from other survivors. They aren't trying to kill you. They are trying to help\n- If you are a killer, please find the trapdoor so if everyone dies that last guy can't escape easily.","timestamp_created":1466058624,"timestamp_updated":1466058624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557796478271484375","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591841","author":{"steamid":"76561198119412893","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6730,"last_played":1658352039},"language":"english","review":"Everyone needs to quit the whining and acting like babies.\nThis is an amazing game and the Devs are doing there best to fix all problems and make every player happy and most importantly fair. .","timestamp_created":1466058603,"timestamp_updated":1637793583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591804","author":{"steamid":"76561198084042844","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":26164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":327,"playtime_at_review":1189,"last_played":1660551334},"language":"turkish","review":"Betadan beri oynamaktayım size olan bitenden bahsedeyim.Oyun 1 katil 4 hayatta kalandan oluşuyor.Ana ekranda seçiminizi yaptıktan sonra maceranıza başlıyorsunuz.Oyunda çeşitli perkler ve katillerde özellikler var doğru dizilimle gerçekten karşı taraf için zorlu bi oyun gerçekleştirebiliyorsunuz.\n\nSurvivor tarafında, jeneratör yapıp 2 ana kapıdan birinden veya haritada rastgele spawnlanan kapaktan kaçmaya çalışıyorsunuz.Bu sırada katil sizin veya ekip arkadaşlarınızın peşinizde olacaktır.Birbirinize yardım ederek kurtulmalısınız.\n\nKiller tarafında,kaçmaya çalışanları öldürmeye çalışıyorsunuz.Bunu şu şekilde yapıyorsunuz;survivoru yere düşürdükten sonra haritada belirli hooklara asıyorsunuz 3. asışta öleceklerdir veya memento mori ve belirli perklerle bir defa astığınız kişileri olduğu yerde öldürebilisiniz.\n\nİyi ve kötü yanları;\n\nİyi yanları;\nPerkleri çok çeşitli tutuyorlar hep yenisi ekleniyor\nİki tarafında dengesi iyi\nPiyasadaki en iyi gerilim kaçış oyunu\n\nKötü yanları;\nBelirli ranka geldikten sonra kanser oluyorsunuz.\nOyunun belli taktikleri bir süreden sonra kendini tekrarlayabiliyor.\nYeni çıkan killerlar satmak icin çok güçlü oluyorlar\nKaç senedir killer matchmaking'i düzeltmediler bekliyorsunuz oyun bulmak için","timestamp_created":1466058271,"timestamp_updated":1598422786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545876145362854004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591769","author":{"steamid":"76561198054100485","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":398,"last_played":1474313491},"language":"english","review":"Meh\n\n---edited---\n\nI've preordered this game and when I could install it and play, it felt like a regression to 2003. \nGraphics are too basic, most of the scenary is repeated (for example a scenario featuring a corn plantation, all corn plants look almost the same, this is a common resource: re-using items instead of designing variations. There is no option to turn down the music, there's only one volume setting... \n\nPoints system is hard if you are a low level, items are expensive and you may need to play qute a few times in order to use/purchase any item. Beware because if you get caught during the game, those items you have been carrying get lost. If you get caught you wont live, even if you keep clicking your mouse button as instructed, when it reaches 99% wont allow you to get up and scape, so dont follow instructions. There is another annoying visual aspect to the game, there are 5 players, one being the hunter and the rest being \"victims\", and there are only 4 characters, so you will mostly play with clones of your character because the game doesnt avoid that.\n\nFinishing my review I would like to state that since this morning multiplayer is down (comes and goes erraticly) its now saying that my steam app is offline, the same app I'm using to post this review. So for now, this game is unplayable.\n\nThe game is very basic, if a demo was available I wouldn't have bought this game.","timestamp_created":1466058038,"timestamp_updated":1466126341,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591742","author":{"steamid":"76561198058941960","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":4936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1861,"last_played":1635715186},"language":"english","review":"………….……………………. „-/*\"\\„,„,\n…….…………………….¸„-^\"¯ :\\_ / o '\"*'\"¯/' WOOF WOOF\n……………………¸„„-^\"¯ : : : : : : : : ¸„,-~\" I'M A WIENER\n**¯¯¯'^^~-„„„----~^*'\"¯ : : : : : : : : : :¸-\"\n.:.:.:.:.„-^\" : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :-\n:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.: : : : : : : : : : ¸„-^¯\n.::.:.:.:.:.:.:.:. : : : : : : : ¸„„-^¯\n:.' : : '\\ : : : : : : : ;¸„„-~\"¯\n:.:.:: :\"-„\"\"***/*'ì¸'¯\n:.': : : : :\"-„ : : :\"\\\n.:.:.: : : : :\" : : : : \\,\n:.: : : : : : : : : : : : 'Ì\n: : : : : : :, : : : : : :/\n\"-„_::::_„-*__„„~\"","timestamp_created":1466057750,"timestamp_updated":1635460247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591725","author":{"steamid":"76561198059246476","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":10787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3986,"last_played":1534707816},"language":"russian","review":"БАГИ У КИЛЛЕРА ТОЛЬКО ТОГДА, КОГДА Я НА НЁМ ИГРАЮ","timestamp_created":1466057655,"timestamp_updated":1469017743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499451160430908203","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591699","author":{"steamid":"76561198036628232","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1467227793},"language":"english","review":"-cant group with friends\n-impossible to get into a game because everyone hops from lobby to lobby\n\ni would comment on game play but idk what thats like yet","timestamp_created":1466057419,"timestamp_updated":1466057419,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478794336318969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591692","author":{"steamid":"76561198063989334","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1345,"last_played":1471826754},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would be butchered again.","timestamp_created":1466057362,"timestamp_updated":1466057362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467407196760177612","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591683","author":{"steamid":"76561198127288055","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1634640092},"language":"english","review":"This game is a very well-made multiplayer suvival horror game that has an interesting concept done right.

This just really adds to the immersion in my opinion. You dont see any players name, no voice. All you see is your fellow random player who may risk it all to save you over his/her life. The music is terrifying in this game thus adding to the world. Knowing you are slower then the killer adds a whole new thinking to hiding over running. You must outsmart your killer.

Yes, it's fun. Plenty of \"omg noise... he's coming! OMG OMG OMG OH SHIT!\" moments when playing as survivor, and devious good fun using wounded survivors as bait when playing as the killer. My favorite thing to do is ring the wraith's bell as I chase down victims.\n\nThat said, this game is not without faults. Here is a list of what's wrong with the game so far. (Current as of June 16)\n\nLobby Hoppers: There is no way to join a public server with friends, so you'll go through about a dozen people lobby hopping before you find four that are actually ready to settle down and play a match.\n\nDisconnecting Asshats: Earning rank is very difficult and you'll lose it unless you have a perfect match. There's a big problem of people disconnecting to protect their rank. If you're chasing someone down who has any sort of rank progression, there's a good to fair chance they'll disconnect the moment you stick them on a meathook.\n\nWindow Vaulters: The killer is a big dude who can't go through windows as fast as his victims, so some cheeseball players think it's a fair tactic to jump back and forth through a window while the killer tries to go around the wall before they can hop back over.\n\nTrap Door Campers: Some victims have figured out that if they're the second to last survivor on the map, all they have to do is camp out by the trap door and wait for that other guy to get killed. As soon as they're the last one alive, the door opens and they escape. The only way to prevent this as the killer is to somehow remember where the trap door is and make sure it's clear before you put one of the last two victims on a hook.\n\nRepetitiveness: Every match is the same thing, four victims try to start up a bunch of generators while a killer sacrifices them to some sort of sky cthulu. Different objectives and different means of killing would liven things up a bit.","timestamp_created":1466053772,"timestamp_updated":1466053840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":58,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.69734346866607666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591139","author":{"steamid":"76561198013485575","num_games_owned":690,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":275076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105916,"last_played":1649735588},"language":"english","review":"All in all I enjoy this game and definitly think it was worth the cost. \n\nHowever, it did have some major errors at launch and it seems like the devlopers did not pay much attention to the community from Beta to Launch.\n\n\n**editing this for shitty steam badge seqKEK","timestamp_created":1466053346,"timestamp_updated":1606416681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591086","author":{"steamid":"76561198016123747","num_games_owned":3931,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":66744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":293,"playtime_at_review":39500,"last_played":1660489656},"language":"english","review":"A Glorified Cat and Mouse game but which one is the cat and which one is the mouse?","timestamp_created":1466052974,"timestamp_updated":1549148653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591082","author":{"steamid":"76561198062597936","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1519865861},"language":"thai","review":"จากที่ได้เล่นนะครับ \nปล.ยังไม่เคยเล่นเป็นKiller\nจากที่ได้ลอง ฝ่ายsurvivorนี้จะตื่นเต้นมากๆ ทั้งซาวและต้องคอยหลบ Killer และหลบหนีออกไหนจะต้องเข้าไปช่วยเพื่อนที่โดนจับอีก\nสาเหตุที่ไม่เคยเฃ่น Killer เพราะพอเลือกKiller จะต้องสร้างห้อง แต่ไม่มีใครเข้าห้องเลย เหมื่อนไม่สมดุลรึป่าว ไม่แน่ใจคนอาจจะยังน้อย\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn-Gu59yT08\nและนี้คือเกมเพลคร้าวๆ","timestamp_created":1466052940,"timestamp_updated":1466052940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591067","author":{"steamid":"76561198273028551","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1492082557},"language":"schinese","review":"貌似服务器不稳定吧，总是会从LOBBY里自动退出来","timestamp_created":1466052758,"timestamp_updated":1466052758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23591001","author":{"steamid":"76561198067387274","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":75356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71870,"last_played":1581015804},"language":"english","review":"Just disable v-sync and the fps will be as smooth as kpop girl group thighs.\n\nEdited: worth it.","timestamp_created":1466052268,"timestamp_updated":1534622328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":45,"votes_funny":85,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602351725101470947","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23590995","author":{"steamid":"76561198016655070","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1471767214},"language":"english","review":"my medbox go where?","timestamp_created":1466052237,"timestamp_updated":1466052237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23590984","author":{"steamid":"76561198293948759","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69,"last_played":1625948130},"language":"russian","review":"Никакого онлайна...","timestamp_created":1466052171,"timestamp_updated":1466052171,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23590959","author":{"steamid":"76561197993253409","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":67767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":393,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1660559799},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight is easily the best multiplayer slasher out there.

by Daylight, also known as \"Murdered by Morning,\" \"Slaughtered by Sunrise,\" \"Annihilated by AM,\" \"Culled by Cockedoodle,\" and \"I'm Having Too Much Fun With This: The Game,\" is an asymmetrical player versus player murder simulator in which one player controls a friendly masked killer and four other players control superhuman mutes with the ability to sprint at supersonic speeds. Activate five generators to power the exit gates of a magical murder-realm and skedaddle your way out to safety, but beware, for the killer is angry.\n\nJust angry.\n\nIf you're looking to play with friends (even though the game was NEVER designed and is absolutely not balanced for people able to communicate over an outside VOIP client) and gleefully repair generators to the merry tune of people screaming on meathooks, this game is for you, a highly lethal and entertaining game of hide and seek.\n\nIf you want to BE the masked psycho killer, do NOT buy this game. The community hates you. The devs hate you. The balance of power is hideously skewed in the survivors' favor and it's NEVER going to change. You won't have very much fun after you rack up a level or two, and the matchmaking system makes doing anything with your lower-level killers nigh impossible, as you'll be constantly matched against better skilled, better coordinated players with a full set of overpowered standard perks. Any attempt at securing a kill will get you screamed at. Even if you're new, expect to be teabagged, infinitely looped and mocked in the after game chat.\n\nIf you want to play as a survivor, this is the game for you. If you want to play as a survivor with your friends, you're cancer, but this is still the game for you. If you want to play as a killer, buckle up, buttercup, you're in for a wild ride of disappointment and frustration.","timestamp_created":1466043542,"timestamp_updated":1502834975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505208373069763184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23589719","author":{"steamid":"76561198083973434","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1381,"last_played":1653460432},"language":"russian","review":"Охотник, призрак и деревенщина.

Es gibt quasi ein Monster und vier Freunde die Überleben wollen. Kurz so am Rande, es gibt 3 verschieden Monster zur Auswahl die ich euch aber hier nicht verraten möchte bzw. sagen möchte was Sie so alles drauf haben. Jeder hat aber seine eigenen Eigenschaften.\nZiel ist es als Überlebender 5 oder 6 so kleine Betriebsmaschinen zu Reparieren, um wieder Strom zu erzeugen. Doch Achtung, beim Reparieren muss man wirklich vorsichtig sein, denn es gibt momente wo ein Kreis kommt und ein kleiner Bereich dargestellt wird in den man anhalten muss. Scheitert man daran, so macht die Maschine ein lautes Geräusch und erstrahlt im Lichte. Das Monster wird somit \"Informiert\" das dort herum hantiert wird.\nDoch wenn man es einmal geschafft hat erhellt die Maschine und man sollte aber dennoch schleunigst verschwinden wegen des Lichts. ^^\nHat man alle aktiviert, so gibt es nun zwei Ausgänge durch die Ihr gehen könnt um zu Fliehen!\nMan muss aber vorher noch einen Hebel ziehen das ca. 20-25 sekunden dauert und sogar da euch das Leben kosten könnte. Doch man sollte schon viele Risiken eingehen um zu Überleben. ;)\nGrafisch gesehen ist es auch soweit ganz gut.
