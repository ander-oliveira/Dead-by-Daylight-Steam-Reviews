Since it takes multiple hits to hurt someone critically, you are forced to go half speed while wiping down the blade before you are allowed to return to normal speed. It shows lack of creativity/design. \n- Control movements when interacting with the environment(pushing down the numerous crates and barriers) is non fluent and all movements similiar to this are the same. There is no chance for this fail, different style of it, etc.\n- Takes you 2 seconds to stick someone up on the spike but takes the people half of a second to get them down regardless of how long they are up on the stick. This again seems to be a lack of creativity not to mention really bad design. Being stabbed multiple times and they are able to get away at half speed. \n- The crashing of this game is about 3/5 chances as the killer. This means the game is over and 0 xp. Way to high!\n- No XP for playing with friends.\n- Match making is horrific\n- Skills?

Сплошное кемперство. Нет, я не бегаю с фонариком и присаживаюсь, когда сбрасываю поддон на маньяка. Я играл за убийцу, но больше нравиться играть за выживших. за маньяка можно спокойно убить всю команду не стоя у крюка и не наворачивая круги вокруг него, не сидеть за свинью под крюком, не стоять у рюка за Майкла на 3 стадии, за Фредди, за Билии, пупса с пилой и за любого маньяка, котрый есть и выйдет в дальнейшим. Я с беты играю эту игру (забрасывал на долго, но заходил, когда выходила обнова), и скорее всего может наплыв школоты из говнафейса или майна, которые не понимают в чем заключается игра (не просто так перки для выживших, которые помогают спасти сурва с крюка и вылечить его по-быстрей и много других бонусов) или создателям насрать, они ввели дох*я DLC, рубят с них бабло, ведь маньяков много в игре, они уже наплакались, нарыдались разрабам, что их обижают сурвы, они же такие сильные, их догнать не реально. Играешь ты за маньяка, ну повесил на крюк сурва, ну нахрена фармить очки кемперством? Игра умрет, т.к. это надоест многим. Не советую покупать игры от этих разрабов, т.к. много кампаний, которые зарабатывают создавая игру и потом просто забрасывают ее. Бабла срубили - збс. Го делать новую. И ее забросим. Х*йней полнейшей становится игра.

So, after all this time, how does the game fare now?\n\nAwful.\n\nKillers and survivors both have aspects of their gameplay that make it infuriating to play.  Killers can punish individual survivors heavily with unfun, scummy play, that is actively encouraged by the Devs and has been a problem since its Beta launch six years ago.  Survivors who are coordinated have way too much control of a match, and minor mistakes in these matches can spell most of it for you before you even complete your first hook.  Survivors who aren't coordinated can have a troubled time even getting half the gens done, and versus a strong killer that can spell disaster for you.\n\nI've played the game on-and-off since 2016 to see if it improves over the years.  Many things have improved, but there are several issues; Tunneling, Camping, Hackers, Rewarding Scummy Play and Punishing Fun Play.  The game has eroded over time.  Acquiring high-end licenses and continually releasing content to keep its player count high, but as soon as it hits a peak, the dips right back down.  Its kept this steady pace, due to players like me who return to see the new content, then be hastily reminded why I uninstalled in the first place; you can make the hardest, best plays in the world as a survivor, but if your team is twiddling their thumbs you die and drop in the MMR.  If you're a killer and you play fair and hook every survivor once or twice, gens get done and they all escape, and you drop in MMR.\n\nThe Devs themselves seem to be on a right track but are missing a key drive to alter some fundamental aspects of the game that keep it locked down for people like me.  That being, unfun design and mechanics.  Some of these are unintentional, like facecamping, but many of these are intentional, such as Dead Hard, a common complaint from the community since its release, and has yet to be fixed for many years.\n\nIf this is the rate of release for content in the game, its no wonder why the player count is dropping again.\n\nI really hope some sweeping changes to the unfun mechanics of the game are done.  With the introduction of 'skill based' matchmaking, which as said above, rewards scummy play and highlights the issues in the game.\n\nI've given the Devs the benefit of the doubt for years.  I've handed to them hundreds of hours of my time.  But it only felt like I had more bad matches than good ones.  And by good ones, I don't mean ones where I stomped.  I mean matches where I actually had fun.\n\nFun in this game isn't given.  It has to be sought after, and in a game as frustrating as this, where minor mistakes can spell out the end of a match, I don't see why I should spend my time looking for fun here when I can go to other games for more fun.","timestamp_created":1466581886,"timestamp_updated":1652366709,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.378254562616348267","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23701021","author":{"steamid":"76561198048397932","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":6548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5373,"last_played":1626428594},"language":"english","review":"Good and addictive game!","timestamp_created":1466581709,"timestamp_updated":1466581709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490556418895721436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23700975","author":{"steamid":"76561198180550023","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1341,"last_played":1580127574},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight — качественный, чертовски эмоциональный и страшный хоррор.

He de decir que después de casi dos años el juego si que mola. Con sus carencias y demás, pero me está resultando muy divertido. No se cuanto durará la diversión, pero pillandolo por 6 pavos como lo he pillado es más que recomendable, si te interesa la tematica.\n\nPros: Es muy original, las partidas son rápidas y divertidas. Es muy diferente jugar de asesino o de superviviente.\n\nContras: Podría resultar repetitivo (a mi hasta el momento no, pero no llevo tanto jugado). Los jodidos DLCS, manda cojones la politica de DLCs de esta empresa... muy mal poder jugar solo con 4 asesinos y 5 supervivientes con el juego base.\n\n\n\nLAS VENTANAS: EL ENEMIGO NATURAL DE UN PSICOPATA SLASHER...\n\nLa ídea del juego es interesante, los gráficos aunque algo cutres pueden pasar, el sonido esta bien... pero hay detalles de la jugabilidad que echan a perder el título. Y repercuten especialmente en la inmersión en el mismo. Por ejemplo: \n\n- Como asesino, la torpeza y lentitud de la cinematica cruzando ventanas hará que muchas veces cazar a los supervivientes sea tremendamente estupido. Si el supervivente en cuestión ha jugado mas de 2 horas sabrá perfectamente como darte coba continuamente simplemente cruzando una ventana.... Y claro, toda sensación de ser el malo de peli slasher que provoca pavor desaparece al ver lo tremendamente gilipo*as que pareces mientras que los supervivientes estan riendose de ti mientras que cruzan la misma pu*a ventana una y otra vez. Al final, ellos son los que estan jugando contigo...\n\n- Como superviviente las cosas son más pasables. Quitaría la vista en 3ª persona, la sustituiría por alguna otra ventaja. Que cuando te metas en un armario se quede la cámara fuera tambien corta el rollo... pero bueno...\n\nExperiencia de juego:\n\n4 partidas, 2 como superviviente y 2 como asesino. En las 2 como superviviente he escapado bastante facilmente, sin practicar salto de ventana. En las 2 como asesino, he perseguido como un gilipoyas a gente que jugaba conmigo, y una de las veces despuesd e esperar 10 min. para que se uniesen los 4 jipis. No voy a jugar más porque voy a solicitar reembolso.\n\nA no ser que los desarrolladores se pongan a tope a mejorar y sacar contenido, la gente empezará a aburrirse pronto, porque las opciones son bastante limitadas y no parece que haga falta mucho tiempo para dominarlo totalmente. No tiene modo un jugador, para iniciar una partida hace falta que esten los 5... y no puedes jugar con amigos a no ser que sea una partida privada (para la que imagino que habrá que llenar tb los 5 huecos).","timestamp_created":1466578315,"timestamp_updated":1623436538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479651182889938354","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23700416","author":{"steamid":"76561198101298292","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":8449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1579882678},"language":"russian","review":"Dead by Daylight - это, когда игра за жертву находится за 5 секунд, а за убийцу гребаные 30 минут?!\nDead by Daylight - это, когда ты заводишь один генератор целых 10 минут.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда ты не можешь задеть полоску в круге.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда все мертвы, а ты боишься выйти из шкафа.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда ты спас друга с крюка, но попал на его место.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда твоего школьного английского хватает для понимания всего происходящего в игре.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда ты исследуешь аптечку туеву хучу раз.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда ты еще ни разу не играл за убийцу.\nDead by Daylight - это, ты не можешь отыскать генератор, зато находишь убийцу.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда Пятница 13 уже не нужна.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда ты второй раз попадаешь на крюк и пути назад уже нет.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда удар бензопилой оставляет твое туловище целым.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда неведомая хуетаа забирает тебя с крюка к праотцам.\nDead by Daylight - это, когда тебе не с кем в нее поиграть ((((((\nDead by Daylight - это, когда твой любимый шкаф занят.","timestamp_created":1466578273,"timestamp_updated":1466583202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23700218","author":{"steamid":"76561198169716657","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":72566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1558969306},"language":"koreana","review":"게임 자체는 상당히 재미있는 편입니다. 다만 아직 업데이트나 개선해야 할 부분들이 많이 있습니다.\n\n우선, 게임을 하던 도중 crack이 발생하였다고 하면서 게임이 꺼졌습니다.\n\n그 이후로 접속이 계속 되질 않아서 지우고 다시 깔아보았더니 레벨이랑 랭크 등 모든 것이 초기화되어 있었습니다....\n\n이러한 점들 때문에 강제종료에 대해서 패널티를 줄려고 해도  그 사람이 강제종료를 한 것인지 아니면\n\n오류로 접속이 된 것인지 알 수 없다는 단점이 있습니다.\n\n우선적으로는 각종 버그들을 수정하고 나서 강제종료에 대한 패널티로 랭크를 다운시킨다던지\n\n블러드포인트를 마이너스로 한다던지 하는 방안을 만들어야 할 것입니다.\n\n게임 자체는 재미있습니다.","timestamp_created":1466577283,"timestamp_updated":1466577283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23700200","author":{"steamid":"76561198229303448","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1598959871},"language":"koreana","review":"What the FUCK!

Its receiving a bad reviews because i cant stand technical errors such as but not limited to visual bugs where you should be able to see something such as generators or friends on hooks but unable to. Im also afraid this game has a number of hackers who have the abilities to see through objects and allow themselves to rapidly attack if they are the killer even if you check to see if they had some sort of perk or advantage in anyway when they had none. \n\nThere is also one major game flaw thats not a bug but is poorly designed, the ranking/point system. First off the ranking system is based off how \"well\" you survive like turning on generator and unhooking people; the killer for how many hooks and chasing. The purpose was to make sure survivors did not just afk hide while there teamates do all the work and they get a free win. What was not considered however was people leaving the game which causes a huge wreck for both survior and the killer. For the survior, if a player leaves even if its at the start of the game you still must get the same amount of generators, the math of the generator and survior count is this\n4players=5generators\n3players=4generators\n2players=3generators\nonly player=2generators\nit has a proportion system in case you wish to play with your friends (which btw you can only do in a private match)\nThis is problematic because now there is only 3 players that have to get 5 generators which is not designed for and makes it so much harder for the survivors and there is ZERO litteraly ZERO compensation for this in any way for anyone and more likely you will be demoted.\n\nThe killer is arguably worst; lets imagine a scenario, you are really good as the killer and you are hooking people left and right, and now people dont want to play that match anymore and quit. What happens? if the killer hooks someone, and that person leaves the game while hooked, the killer gets ZERO POINTS FOR HOOKING. How does this affect the killer? well less points means you cant be promoted and guess what? If just ONE thats right just ONE survivor leaves, the killer cant get enough points even if he gets the rest of the survivors and ends up being demoted no matter what he does. The killer loses points and actually gets demoted for people quiting.\n\nNow what happens if the killer quits? some games the survivors outplay the killer really well and can make the killer quit and basically the survivors are about to win the game, now the killer leaves because he does not like being outplayed guess what happens? the survivors dont finish the game and dont get a win game bonus or escape bonus or anything that would be dealt with winning a game. \n\nWith all of that you gain less Bloodpoints which you can use to upgrade your characters (you can use bloodpoints gained from one charcter and use it on another) so its a pain.\n\nNow you want to know whats the worst of it? THIS IS ABUSABLE BY THE FAREST EXTENT. Heres how; your the survivor, your about to die and you want the killer to pay for it? leave the game he gets less points; your the killer and about to lose to many survivors? leave the game they wont gain an escape bonus. This is appalling and needs to be fixed immediatly.\n\nThe ranking system does not provide any sort of apparent advantage but for competitive people such as myself and others dont like being cheated out of our ranks but it does not matter due to horrible matching \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=716669710\nWhy is the killer rank so high and has all these perks while none of the survivors have very low ranks and no similar advantage? its not like this normally and this shouldnt happen at all.","timestamp_created":1466571622,"timestamp_updated":1467569508,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23699206","author":{"steamid":"76561198079118501","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1635384203},"language":"english","review":"A game so good i feel Dead by Daylight sometimes hahahahah. alright jumps off cliff,","timestamp_created":1466571563,"timestamp_updated":1466571563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23699184","author":{"steamid":"76561198102341040","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1495058226},"language":"english","review":"If I had to explain this game with one word it would have to be \"nervouscited.\" Playing as the survivors is a paranoia fest if you dont know what your doing and especially when you botch a skill check but juking the killer is always a thrill.

I will admit though playing against higher ranked monster or survivors with rare perks is a bit lopsided and could use some tweaks or limiters for playing with people of similar skill.

game reminds me of Depth, which is why I'm not recommending it.\n\nThe progression trees feel like a very ham-handed way to keep you invested in the game. I had to lose 4-5 times before I could get a flashlight. On top of that, there are individual progression trees for each character. Really, why would I have to earn/spend nearly 20000 points just to get a [i]flashlight[/i] for each survivor character?? In a co-op/vs horror game no less?\n\nSpeaking of co-op, there's absolutely no way to communicate in-game. No 'walkie talkie' mic chat, no 'texting' type chat. There is a lobby chat, so you can know which people say \"No man left behind\"- and proceed to hide near the escape hatch while everyone else is turning on generators and dying.\n\nThere's only one game mode. You can have plenty of maps, characters, items- but after a while, only one gamemode is gonna get boring as all getout. Not to mention this one gamemode is incredibly convoluted and tedious. As a survivor, you have to perform a 'stop the spinning dial in the right place' minigame in order to activate several generators; mess up the minigame and you'll have your ears blown out by the generator exploding in your face. \n\nIf only the explosion killed you. \n\nInstead, the killer is alerted to your location. And you as a survivor have to decide where and when you should run. You're pretty much dead if the monster is anywhere within 5-10 meters away from you, so you're safest bet is to constantly [strike]run[/strike]walk and hide in a closet or crouch behind something and remain still. Repeat this until every generator is activated.\n\nSound fun yet? \n\nGetting chased by the killer is terrifying for the first 3-4 times before you realise he's just an errand boy for some lovecraftian spider-legs.  The killer doesn't really do much killing, sad to say. No executions, no mutilation, he just slings you over his shoulder and throws you onto a hook.\n\nThis game has mechanics that allow you to help each other escape from the monster.
