While the game is certainly not perfect and the devs still make silly mistakes every other patch, I find myself coming back for that gameplay loop that really is not like anything else.\n\nCombine this with the loads of grinding you can do, plenty of cosmetics you can unlock with in-game currency (though grindy), and the relatively new tomes with challenges to beat, there is always something to work towards in this game! \n\nIf this game looks fun to you, give it a shot, you'll likely enjoy it. :)\n\nEDIT 2.0: Now 3 years later and this game is still being updated with quality DLC and plenty of balancing. While I certainly will admit there has been a drop in productivity (wish we got more brand new maps), it is clear that the devs are committed to this game. Now, if only they could add some new modes...\n\nEDIT: Wow, 2 years later and I am still finding serious enjoyment in this game! Not only that, but the developers are genuinely trying to support the game with good content and have added 2 free DLC chapters as well as plenty of fun and interesting killers and survivors. If this looks fun to you, I'd highly recommend buying this game (on sale) and then supporting the devs through buying cosmetics. :)\n\nA good asymetrical horror game. So, what do I like about this game:\n-Playing as the killer and feeling so powerful\n-Playing as the survivor and outsmarting the killer\n-The Template maps being \"randomly generated\" every round to give it some variety\n-The DLC, which is appropriately priced for the content it offers\n-Sound Design: gets my heart beating everytime and really gets me in the horror mood\n-Atmosphere: this game will make you scared when you first start out, and will still entertain those of you with weaker wills (like me)\n\nWhat's not really good nor bad:\n-The leveling system: while grindy and abilties randomly earned, it is an enjoyable system that offers the ability to make decisions as you go through the blood web\n-Map Randomness: while it is logical that you shouldn't know what map you are going to get, there should be a higher chance of getting the DLC maps by default so you have more opportunities to experience them\n-Dev Updates: while it is great that they are trying to keep the game balanced, some of their decisions have been debateable at best\n-Graphics: they serve their purpose, but nothing more\n-Achievements: It will probably over 500 hours of grinding to 100% this game, which can be good or bad depending on how you like your game\n\nWhat's bad:\n-Matchmaking: no dedicated servers or matchmaking system, so it is all based off host (killers) connectivity. It takes far too long to find a game because of this system, as well as pissing you off in the process\n-Bugs: many have been fixed, but they do exist and can ruin a round for you\n-Ranking system: why is there only 1 matchmaking mode and it is competitive?! Honestly, it is pretty silly\n-Players: there will always be camping killers and weak-willed survivors that ruin rounds for you, but thats a staple in every multiplayer game now-a-days\n\nOverall, it's worth the buy if you want to have some scary, asymetrical horror fun, especially if you have some friends who play it!! If you are too weak-willed or incredibly impatient, than I would watch some gameplays before you buy.","timestamp_created":1480315208,"timestamp_updated":1619479630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512195110321044922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27921723","author":{"steamid":"76561198291794030","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2644,"last_played":1626255979},"language":"schinese","review":"作为一个屠夫，我现在只想把偷电贼挂在树上！","timestamp_created":1480314818,"timestamp_updated":1480314818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27921462","author":{"steamid":"76561198332302333","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1498797919},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกมากๆค่ะ ซื้อมาเล่นด้วยกันได้นะ ^^","timestamp_created":1480314528,"timestamp_updated":1480314528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27921091","author":{"steamid":"76561198307038750","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1630592255},"language":"schinese","review":"从未遇到如此优化差的游戏，要不退出，要不晒退，各种BUG，黎明杀机就是今年的BUG大奖，游戏模式好玩但是游戏优化太差，完全不能娱乐","timestamp_created":1480314119,"timestamp_updated":1480314119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27920940","author":{"steamid":"76561198045183142","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":93070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14478,"last_played":1658257194},"language":"english","review":"10/10 Great for getting my daily salt intake.","timestamp_created":1480313945,"timestamp_updated":1480313945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487804889678955078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27920865","author":{"steamid":"76561198093061343","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":81785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":15199,"last_played":1659880591},"language":"english","review":"This game as come a long way since it first showed up.

Разрабы пытаются что-то сделать, но получается лишь платный доп. контент\n3)Отсутсвие детальной настройки графики(есть только перечень от низко до ультра)\n4)Механика ударов маньяка(начиная от автонаводки под 90 градусов, заканчивая той же наводкой, но в стену, за которую убежал выживший)\n5)Как говорили разрабы игра не предусмотрена для игры вчетвером, но играя на высоких рангах за маньяка вы с легкостью попадайтесь против тимы из 4х человек, которые вас выебут и разденут. Убирать пати, я думаю, не будут, так как кол-во игроков резко сократится, так как никто не хочет играть с аутистами, которые либо сидят в шкафу, либо бегают по краю карты.\n6)Возможность ставить любые перки на любых выживших, хотя они имеют каждый свои индивидуальные, возникает вопрос зачем эта индивидуальность нужна. Клодетт - аналог медика, Джейк - саботажник, ломающий крюки, Мэг - спринтер, Дуайт - ремонтник, Неа - кусок говна. Но какой в этом толк, если ты можешь взять все лучшшее на 1 персонажа и сделать имбу.\n7)Разработчик не играет в свою игру, так как я уже довольно много наиграл и некоторые проблемы для меня очевидны, то для них нет, из этого и сделан такой вывод. Пример: они сказали, что крюки после саботажа будут восстанавливаться через определенное время, отсюда следует - перк саботажник не нужен, так как то, что ты сломаешь восстановится. Зачем делать еще больше ненужных перков с которыми никто не будет играть?\n8)Наличие бесполезных перков и подношений(зачем маньяку сгущать туман или выжившему рассеивать его? таких примеров полно, просто поверьте)\n9)Отсутствие подбора игр по рангу, так как играя на 20 ранге вы можете без проблем попасть против киллера 1ого уровня и наоборот\n10)Последней каплей стало то, что слетели сейвы и все персонажи стали опять 1ыми уровнями при том ,что у игры есть стим клауд(все мои 300ч игры в помойку, спс)\nИтог: для беты неплохо, покупать только с огромной скидкой ибо эта игра по наполнению и контенту не соответствует заявленной стоимости","timestamp_created":1480292988,"timestamp_updated":1541158554,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552104771137237549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27901476","author":{"steamid":"76561198208051652","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":51367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1560,"playtime_at_review":34542,"last_played":1660429040},"language":"russian","review":"Игра на самом деле классная, особенно в коопе.\nНО\n1.

На более высоких рангах (начиная с 12 примерно) маньяки попадаются такие отшибленные, что играть совершенно не возможно, вплоть до того,что вы тупо ни один геник не заведете.

I dont know if it was a recent update that has been causing all the DC's or if people are just leaving games because there is no consequence or what.","timestamp_created":1480290476,"timestamp_updated":1480290476,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499923884868621826","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27899020","author":{"steamid":"76561198310207070","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5104,"last_played":1497853039},"language":"schinese","review":"挺不错的一款游戏，希望能多增加点地图和玩法，有时候更新完屠夫和人类不是很平衡，希望官方注意","timestamp_created":1480290354,"timestamp_updated":1480290354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27898308","author":{"steamid":"76561198114653289","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2187,"last_played":1646486417},"language":"schinese","review":"单看游戏的话 8/10,  良心开发商 10/10\n虽然现在玩的少了，加上很多直播平台也禁播了，这个游戏的热度不及以前，但是还是为开发商的态度点赞。\n\n“今天不是你死，就是拉闸！”——杨永信","timestamp_created":1480289762,"timestamp_updated":1496300628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27898047","author":{"steamid":"76561198310920039","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":26207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4776,"last_played":1645823015},"language":"russian","review":"И мотор завести и на крюке повисеть... \nОтличная игра!","timestamp_created":1480289532,"timestamp_updated":1561577333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27897319","author":{"steamid":"76561198345698237","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6126,"last_played":1630639035},"language":"schinese","review":"很好玩","timestamp_created":1480288949,"timestamp_updated":1480288949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27896994","author":{"steamid":"76561198126641634","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3185,"last_played":1652647908},"language":"english","review":"Ive nominated this game for \"Villian Most In Need Of A Hug\" award because just look at how lonley the trapper is :(.

If you can look past that, this game will keep you entertained for hours. The devs truely care for this game, by releasing hotfixes and updates on a weekly/monthly basis, and do a Twitch stream every Thursday. They do communicate with their fanbase through the steam forums and on the subreddit, which is very cool of them.\n\nThe game itself is pretty challanging in lower ranks (low ranks meaning you're better), and gets your adrenaline pumping when the killer chases you, especially when it's \"The Shape\" (or Michael Myers). The perks are very interesting and aid you A LOT when you play. Some perks are just dead and shouldn't be used/should be reworked. Matchmaking is...eh..1 time you'll get in a match will people higher rank than you, and the next they'll be lower than you. \n\nMy concerns for the game right now are for them to balance some perks and optimize the game some more. I have a good rig and games like Rainbow Six Siege, I can run at higher framerates than this. AND GET RID of the toxic players (killers and survivors).\n\nPros:\n- Adrenaline pumping - Survival horror\n- Spooks you sometimes\n- Unique survivors and killers\n- Perks\n- Michael Myers is a killer! (Extremely cool, and well-fitting power in the game)\n\nCons:\n- Optimization is not the best\n- Matchmaking is a not the best \n- Some perks need re-working\n- Dwight doesn't bite his nails anymore\n\nBeings that I love this game, 9.1/10.","timestamp_created":1480288348,"timestamp_updated":1480288501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27896387","author":{"steamid":"76561198088585241","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":139965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101580,"last_played":1646778059},"language":"english","review":"Bad lol","timestamp_created":1480288205,"timestamp_updated":1498795688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515347301959991455","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27896384","author":{"steamid":"76561198029805779","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":62118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2809,"last_played":1657203856},"language":"russian","review":"Трээээш!!!","timestamp_created":1480288200,"timestamp_updated":1480288200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463428914546966553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27896000","author":{"steamid":"76561198076338968","num_games_owned":686,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13958,"last_played":1637537735},"language":"english","review":"Hide from someone who is trying to kill you, fix generators, help the  other 3 survivors and try to escape.\nRealise your whole day has just flashed before your eyes whilst you play this game. \n*** WARNING*** Students beware you will not get your assignments in on time, workers guess it’s going to have to be another sick day.\n\nor\n\nBe the killer and try to hunt out 4 survivors, hit them, chase them, put them on hooks and kill them, repeat until all 4 survivors are dead.
