It scratched an itch that other games just don't. I play both killer and survivor, and have enjoyed the cosmetics for both.  I used to highly recommend this game, and really wish I still could, but I can't.  It's been shown on many Twitch, and other gaming streams how prolific the problem with hackers is.  I took a multimonth hiatus from DbD to let my rank degrade and give the developers a chance to adjust the game and maybe set myself up for some games that felt like a fair challenge.  previously hacking was mostly at higher rank. However my first two games back and there were hackers in both of them.  What's worse is that there is no way to know for sure who is actually hacking to know who to report.  I know that hacking is difficult to fix, and that banning hackers is a tedious process, but Behaviour needs to figure something out, because there's no real sport in playing DbD anymore.  People are instantly reviving from the dying state, and completing generators that they are no longer working on. As a survivor this isn't anymore enjoyable than as a killer. There's nothing like dying because the other survivors were hacking and didn't need to play cautiously or cooperate with you and get you killed.  I support them trying to re-balance the game, so it doesn't allow survivors to troll killers as hard as they can, and make them play more cautiously, but I feel like the biggest issue, and what is ruining the game is actually the amount of hacking.","timestamp_created":1659020372,"timestamp_updated":1659020372,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503579497337341309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119644764","author":{"steamid":"76561198804192521","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":379,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1660558850},"language":"koreana","review":"고인물게임.","timestamp_created":1659020323,"timestamp_updated":1659020323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119643960","author":{"steamid":"76561199255685941","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1569,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1660569344},"language":"english","review":"ehhhh is good bu ragey\n","timestamp_created":1659019482,"timestamp_updated":1659019482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119643780","author":{"steamid":"76561198092091629","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":555,"playtime_at_review":27217,"last_played":1660591474},"language":"spanish","review":"He jugado suficientes horas a este juego como para decir que la experiencia de juego es terrible.

This game as of now is catered towards players who are very experienced and not towards casual and new players. Also good ol functioning MMR working as intended!\n\n\nFull review so far (FROM THE UPDATE)  (6.1.1) \n\nThis update has made playing survivor FROM MY PERSPECTIVE feel like it’s a full time job. It makes you feel so drained for practically no reward in return. (Not to mention the large amounts of tunneling and gen regression perks that killers use now more than ever makes this game so draining). Also not to mention MMR right now, some killers will slug for the 4k at 3 gens left and on the other hand are brand new killers who literally just picked up the game and get gen rushed. \n\nI do agree that even before this update, killers did need a buff. However, I think they did a bit too much for killers and didn't change/buff enough meh survivor perks. I get that the WHOLE POINT of this update was so survivors didn’t have to feel like they needed to use perks like BT, Dead Hard, Unbreakable, and DS to simply avoid getting tunneled and camped. On the contrary for killers, to not feel like they have to use perks like Corrupt, Ruin/Pop, and Scourge hooks to simply slow down the gens to get some sort of pressure and stop getting gen rushed. But from what I’ve played thus far in the update, all I feel like is that survivors have to use these perks more than ever. The base kit BT is not long enough to do anything and they did nothing for camping. Of anything this has gotten worse. As for killers around the 20 matches that I’ve played so far, nearly every killer had roughly the same builds, which was gen regression perks. Idk this game as of now just feels awful to play.\n\nI've also watched a lot of DBD steamers/content creators over my time with this game and from what I got, most of them say that this update is more or less \"fair\" and even ones who are killer mains that played survivor say it's fine and that people are just over exaggerating. From watching them play, it seems that way. However they also have to take into consideration that most people who play this are playing for fun on their own time.....not for a job. I get that SWF are annoying for killers. But really what this update did was hurt solo survivors even more than ever.\n\nWell, I feel like I rambled on long enough, but this is how this game has been for me for this update, people may have different experiences so far, but for me it’s just been rough.\n\nI want this game to be fun for anyone who plays, so I hope that in the future, some changes can make this happen!\n","timestamp_created":1658998255,"timestamp_updated":1658998255,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.726090669631958008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119628668","author":{"steamid":"76561198090034465","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2085,"playtime_at_review":18663,"last_played":1660597050},"language":"english","review":"᲼᲼᲼᲼","timestamp_created":1658997189,"timestamp_updated":1658997189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119628662","author":{"steamid":"76561199354291885","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1659077399},"language":"schinese","review":"6","timestamp_created":1658997176,"timestamp_updated":1658997176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119628591","author":{"steamid":"76561199378734409","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":6477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":321,"playtime_at_review":1179,"last_played":1659444368},"language":"schinese","review":"好评+1···\n\n现阶段企图通过打折招募一群萌新供大佬娱乐罢了！！！\n逃跑是不可能逃跑的，这辈子都不可能逃跑的！救人又不会；只能靠摸摸电机赚点分维持生活这样子，被逮到挂上树就像回家一样，感觉比外面好多了！这里的屠夫各个都是人才，说话又好听！我超喜欢这里的。","timestamp_created":1658997049,"timestamp_updated":1658997049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119628550","author":{"steamid":"76561197980939911","num_games_owned":1072,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":47265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":199,"playtime_at_review":47066,"last_played":1659871164},"language":"english","review":"The new update pretty much breaks the game for survivors.
