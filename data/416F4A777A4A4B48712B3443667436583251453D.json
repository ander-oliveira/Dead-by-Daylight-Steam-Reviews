В игре имеется разнообразный геймплей из-за большого количества маньяков и выживших.\n2. Игра также содержит множество разных карт, локаций, навыков, предметов и улучшений к ним. \n3. Бесспорно достаточно хорошая графика и звуковое сопровождение (эпичные аудио-эффекты), придающие игре ту самую приятную атмосферу ужаса. \n4. Присутствие относительно недорогого DLC контента (большинство маньяков и выживших доступны за игровую валюту \"Радужные осколки\" в игровом магазине)\n5. Богатая и качественная кастомизация. \n6. Хороший баланс в плане подбора игроков (после последних обновлений стал сравнительно лучше, чем раньше)\n7. Частые обновления, игра постепенно улучшается, становясь всё лучше.\n\n Из минусов:\n 1. Главный минус, как по мне, заключается в некачественно сделанных серверах (но я уверен, что разработчики обязательно исправят этот недостаток), данная неполадка временами проявляется в вылетах в лобби из игры. \n2. В игре встречается большое количество токсичного комьюнити (ну, конечно, не как в Dota 2), но это не критично - игнор всегда поможет.\n3. Множество багов, но не слишком критичных (багаюзеры останутся довольны).\n4. И последнее, при игре за маньяков встретился с крайне неприятным недостатком - достаточно долгим поиском игры. \n\nВот и всё.\n\nВ заключение могу смело сказать, что лично мне игра очень понравилась, остался доволен.\nВсем любителям хоррор-игр настоятельно рекомендую, думаю вы оцените и разделите мою позицию ;)","timestamp_created":1573416019,"timestamp_updated":1573416019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56947690","author":{"steamid":"76561198451212032","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1659273296},"language":"english","review":"It is a fun game and very goof for its type of game.
