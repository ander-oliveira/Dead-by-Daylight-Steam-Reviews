Lange Rede kurzer Sinn: Ich habe das Spiel wieder installiert, gestartet und erstmal angeschaut was in den letzten beiden Jahren dazugekommen ist und es ist sehr viel! Nicht nur das Spiel ansich wurde positiv verändert sondern auch viel guter Content zum Beispiel die neuen Killer, Survivor, Perks und Maps sind nicht schlecht. Die Performance wurde auch stark verbessert, denn früher hatte ich immer kleine Ruckler bei den Skill-Checks, das auch viele von meinen Freunden dazu gebracht hat aufzuhören einschließlich mich. Das neue Shop System und die neuen Währungen finde ich auch sehr gut und auch dass man mit echten Geld bezahlen kann gut. Jedoch was ich sehr ärgert ist dass ich meist 30 Minuten warten muss bis ein Survivor meiner Lobby beitritt und an meinem Internet liegt das nicht. Naja im Großen und Ganzen ein gutes Spiel jedoch verliere ich sofort wieder die Lust wenn ich 30 Minuten warten muss dass ich eine Runde Killer spielen kann deshalb würde ich in dme Fall das Spiel nicht weiter empfehlen.","timestamp_created":1534695940,"timestamp_updated":1534695940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44256311","author":{"steamid":"76561198357059490","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1044,"last_played":1613645709},"language":"russian","review":"Игра топ советую всем поиграть","timestamp_created":1534695792,"timestamp_updated":1534695792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51538461446762085","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44256272","author":{"steamid":"76561198382468852","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11072,"last_played":1639908660},"language":"schinese","review":"好","timestamp_created":1534695702,"timestamp_updated":1534695702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44256255","author":{"steamid":"76561198834467040","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":74967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":75,"playtime_at_review":63416,"last_played":1660171812},"language":"russian","review":"отойди от генеротора  он ваняет","timestamp_created":1534695661,"timestamp_updated":1557625096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44256165","author":{"steamid":"76561198119367412","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7840,"last_played":1590831865},"language":"russian","review":"откатился прогресс на пару дней... разрабы, пофиксите свою ***ню","timestamp_created":1534695374,"timestamp_updated":1534695374,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44256039","author":{"steamid":"76561198137896376","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":75925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":103,"playtime_at_review":51606,"last_played":1660060333},"language":"latam","review":"Te campean?: tiempo prestado \nTe tunelean?: golpe decisivo\nlos survivors tienen una solución para todo, ademas de tener \"LLAVES\", astringente y todo lo demás.

Well, first off it is stupidly fun. If you like pretty much consistent character progression (via unlocking skills, skins, etc.) then you'll enjoy this game. I've played quite a bit and have unlocked all the teachable perks for the all the Survivors. Started working on Killers but the queue for them is a bit long. Managed to hit Rank 6 as a Survivor.\n\nI do have to give this game the thumbs down, unfortunately, because of the players themselves. The game is pretty well done and fun to play. The thing that absolutely kills any fun in this game is the players DC'ing when they get caught, when they feel they have been \"wronged\" or whatever other reason they get upset over.\n\nAs of right now, NOTHING is being done about the rampant DC'ing in the game. While the game is fun, until they do something about the DC'ing (just like every other game out there with a competitive ranking), this game will go downhill due to the players.\n\nIt would be in the developers best interest to start doing something about this NOW rather than wait until their game goes the way of

really think DBD is a real fun and amazing concept for a game, I've been playing it pretty much since release however I didn't grind it like I did other games I came back now and again when new Killers were released, just to keep up to date. \n\nI do agree with some points Survivors have been op in the past, but so have certain Killers as well all this talk about op / nerf happens in literally ever competitive multiplayer game. \n\nIn my opinion the bugs are minor, but they do happen from time to time but i've never experinced anything proper game breaking, (Apart from one time I fell through the map > but it only happened once so it's not a big deal in my eyes but I digress) \n\nRight now I still really enjoy the game however its not at matter of whether which side is more op, it's how you play them and honestly no offence to new / bad / young / players who keep dying get tunneled just not knowing how to play is really fustrating but it's all down to the experince at the end of the day, yes there will always be toxic Survivors / Killers there's no doubt about it but when you get a good team that all work together / Killer who doesn't camp or tunnel but still manages to kill everyone or a few it's still really enjoyable. \n\nAnyway in my opinion if you're interested in the game check it out, it's not a very expensive game and if you really dislike it for whatever reason don't hate on the devs for how the game is played and if something is op or not the game has constant updates and changes for a reason, it's mainly the toxic community that gives the bad experience. \n\nIf anyone has actually took their time to read this I appreciate it and I hope you found it helpful in some way ^^

game is fun indeed...but it has its problems. Being asymmetrical, that is, 4v1 indeed the stats are for the killer -understandable, but when you have 2 or less players -it's as if it's unbalanced somewhat. It's hard to win as surv (if you have a real good killer).I'm not a good player i've reached only surv rank 12, but i've heard that a vast majority of the community is rank 10 or higher. and that being rank 10 or lower its hard to find matches or they can be frustrasting. I've never really seen toxicness like this before. This was the most toxic commmuity I have ever played in a gaming community.  But also met some new friends. I dont care about the DC's and the Perks, whose overpowered and what needs nerfing. A really good killer can wipe out all 4 survs fast and think the killer is cheating, not making it too fun for survs -happens on new seasons. But 4 really good survs on SWF can make a good killer hate this game. My guess is the balance is 2 really good survs vs 1 good killer, 4 noobs vs 1 noob. It's a guess i could be wrong -probably am. \nTo all the new players, advice is this, read up on the game play, watch youtube vids, read posts and forums or whatever before playing. you are gonna want to catch up on some tactics before you play. noobs agaist noobs probably the most balanced. I love this game no doubt and since I had it for less than a year I've had updates about 10 times. Which means the devs are working on it good or bad but mainly means they are still investing time on it. This game promotes competiveness so if you're not a competitive gamer I dont know if you would like it. But there are some golden matches that you will play that will make you love this game. Unfortuanatly it's about a 1 in 4-6 chance. Generally/pubicly I want to recommend this game but I cannot, if I do recommend get it on sale just in case you don't like it. If you do like it well then you saved some dough.\n","timestamp_created":1534664847,"timestamp_updated":1534664847,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494905322790145874","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44246063","author":{"steamid":"76561198070615621","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":607,"playtime_at_review":22031,"last_played":1660584660},"language":"japanese","review":"キラーがフックの回りでキャンプしてる時点でやる気なくなるので消えてください。\n熟練者のくせしてそうゆうことするからむかつく。→「いやいや戦術だしｗｗ」市ｎやが○ｚ\nキラーやりたいけどマッチングしないのはどうにかしてほしい。（鯖変えてもかわらず）\nゲームは面白いが民度が低いって感じだな。分からない人は実況動画とか見て学んで実践しての繰り返しでうまくなると思う。\nどのゲームでも言えることだけどね。\nー追記ー\n最近アプデで鬼がかなり強化入ったせいでサバイバーが不利になりました\nもう二度とサバイバーはやりません。くそゲーが加速しましたね\n鬼は雑古鯖を蹂躙して脳汁ぷしゃーして脳死状態でも全滅できます。\nたのしいですね\nー追記２ー2022/8\n最近復帰したんですが最近のパッチが調整したのがやばいセルフケア\nあとナースが復活したのか知らないけど全盛期になりつつあるのがあまりにも気に食わない。理不尽を押し付けられる気持ちが運営はわからないらしい。あまりにもひどい。","timestamp_created":1534663181,"timestamp_updated":1660584387,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495495498180389404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44245891","author":{"steamid":"76561198416430109","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":45491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8550,"last_played":1640679958},"language":"schinese","review":"人不能动的bug

This perk cancels so many of those moments where you die on first hook because no one got you off of it. Your other survivors know who is going for saves thanks to it.\n\nAs a beginning killer, I recommend sloppy butcher. It makes survivors bleed more and have to heal for longer when they get hit. The long heals can help games not go by as fast if the survivors are paranoid of you and want to heal. Plus, the increased bleeding helps newer players whose ears are not use to finding survivors via grunting, to find them and to stick to the chase easier, due to the blood sometimes being easier to see at times compared to scratch marks.\n\nAnyone can be good at this game with enough practice.

New UI is better, could be improved tho. Hitboxes are better i guess. Overall dbd is working a lot better than it used to before the latest bug fix. I still can't recommend this game to anyone. I can't predict how the next update breaks the game, maybe killers get infinite duration one hit or perhaps survivors can tank 3 hits by default. These devs are completely unpredictable, and they could break the game at any time at any second.\n\nUpdate #3: 2021 dbd in summer was actually great. Dbd was in a good place, player count kept growing bigger, dbd even made player count records. I played shit load in summer and was satisfied overall. I kinda overdosed on dbd during summer, so i stopped playing after august. Bhvr released mmr which made the game pretty unfun, player count keeps dropping as we speak. Bhvr also released new killers, which obviously were antiloop killers which makes me wanna play less, so i just continued my break. I started playing again in late november - early december, been slowly recovering from summer and getting my motivation back to dbd. I am playing dbd currently, its pretty dogshit tbh. MMR was probably the biggest mistake bhvr made, it just doesn't work. I am ash IV and i have like 100-200 hours on killer, and every single game i get a team with 10-15k hours combined. Bhvr should just remove MMR, it would be the easiest and most effortless fix. Survivor gladly isn't as bad as killer, survivor is somewhat playable. As much as i love circle of healing, the perk is still after the nerf too strong and ruins the hit economy, coming from a survivor main btw. We also got the dev Q&A a while back, and it just shows that our lead game designer is actually delusional and pretty uncapable of doing his job. Thats it for the negativity, there is something positive too. The new killer sadako looks actually pretty nice and it also looks like fun to play against, so that is a nice change. Bhvr literally didn't release a single fun killer to play against during 2021. Thats pretty much it. I still can't recommend this game to anyone.","timestamp_created":1534630358,"timestamp_updated":1645318629,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536585330963134766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44238907","author":{"steamid":"76561198360599155","num_games_owned":594,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1649800990},"language":"english","review":"I dont remember buying this so it is a good game.","timestamp_created":1534629083,"timestamp_updated":1534629083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44238906","author":{"steamid":"76561198136532413","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":13368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7353,"last_played":1632273691},"language":"english","review":"Really fun game.
