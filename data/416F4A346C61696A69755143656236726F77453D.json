decido rehacer mi critica después de haber jugado tantísimo a este juego ya más de 800 horas.\n\nEn términos de terror con factor online este juego es con diferencia el que mas me ha gustado y más disfrute he sentido jamas, adoro el terror y poder jugar con personajes iconicos de muchas licencias es un sueño hecho realidad y una experiencia asombrosa e inigualable, pero no todo es perfecto lógicamente.\n\nVoy a dividir mi experiencia en dos apartados al igual que ofrece el juego en primer lugar killer y en segunda superviviente.\n\nAl principio elegí jugar Killer: Fue mi elección predilecta, siempre me ha llamado la atención y lógicamente el poder es algo intrínseco que todos deseamos tener, el generar temor con tu presencia es algo gratificante ademas es el rol más importante. (Los supervivientes que sus principales objetivos son no ser cazados y hacer motores nunca fueron grandes aliciente para mi).\n \nActualmente jugar killer en niveles altos es muy complejo y difícil requiere un gran conocimiento del juego en todo su apartados, perks, mapas, palets, estrategias, etc.\nDebes ser rápido de reflejos, haber jugado bastante y sobretodo tener mucha paciencia, lógicamente no siempre es tan agobiante ni agotador. Pero sin duda es preocupante lo diferente que son las partidas en si, puede ser tan sencillo que incluso te aburras o contra grupos de amigos los cuales te harán todos los motores a la velocidad de la luz y te loopearan toda la partida sin llegar a tocarles.\n\nCualquier persona que quiera jugar este rol le recomendaría un par de consejos:\n-Que jamas te importe perder la partida, por que te va a suceder mucho y de maneras bastante injustas a veces.\n-No leer el chat o no tomárselo en serio por que la gente es muy desconsiderada ademas de que son 4 personas contra ti y jamas piensan en lo que se siente desde otro lado. (puedes cerrar el chat con un botón con una flecha que hay por debajo)\n-Disfrutar y no agobiarse, lo digo enserio por que dan ganas de llorar literalmente a veces de la presión que sientes cuando te están ganando tan rápidamente y no tienes ni una oportunidad.\n\nYo recomendaría que solo juegues cuando estés con energías y ganas por que tienes que dar lo mejor de ti y saber mantenerte estoico.\n\nEl rol de superviviente: Últimamente lo estoy jugando mucho más por que sin duda es más relajado y divertido, principalmente consiste en hacer motores y distraer al killer, lógicamente también entraña su dificultad de hecho si eres bueno puedes literalmente ganar partidas tu sólito si los demás hacen motores.\n\nTambién puedes sentirte desamparado cuando los killer son buenos, o cuando tus compañeros no ayudan, cuando te tunelean, etc. Pero a diferencia de siendo killer puedes morirte y buscarte otra partida sin tener que estar sufriendola hasta el final.\n\nLa mayor parte de cosas que he mencionado tal vez sonaran mal pero todo juego online es complejo e injusto a veces, pero eso no quita todo lo maravilloso y genial que es por ejemplo:\n\n-Como podría olvidar lo increíble que fue jugar con la villana de Saw, también por su increíble  mapa que ahora con su reciente rework es aun más fiel al de la película, totalmente acertado.\n-Jugar con Pyramid Head y con Cheryl es inigualable, de todos los dlc han sacado son los que más he disfrutado y más me han emocionado, también su mapa esta hecho con un mimo y cariño a la licencia que deja sin palabras.\n-Ver a Ghosface tambien me llena una sonrisa por que adoro a ese villano, verle por ahí asomado acechando es muy gracioso, no se pero me encanta ^^.\n-La inocencia a veces de los supervivientes o de los killer también jugando con ellos sin centrarse en ganar, es muy entrañable y todo eso no es algo que sea raro de ver, sin duda el factor humano y las risas que te echas son lo mejor del juego.\n\nPor ultimo me gustaría decir una cosa sobre los desarrolladores “Behaviour Interactive“.\nHay muchísima gente descontenta con ellos sobretodo últimamente, los acusan de que no escuchan a la comunidad, que no solucionan bugs, que cada vez son menos transparentes, etc.\n\nYo también creo que podrían hacer un trabajo mejor sin lugar a dudas, pero eso no quita en todo los bueno, en toda la ambición y buena voluntad que han creado como este juego, hace unos años era prácticamente de nicho y ahora esta logrado ser casi el smash bros del genero del terror sin duda.\nPuede que sean lentos y tarden mucho en sus decisiones pero espero con todo corazón que triunfen por todo lo alto y que no se les suba mucho ego.","timestamp_created":1529404803,"timestamp_updated":1626054978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42837974","author":{"steamid":"76561198166816831","num_games_owned":537,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":24551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1659170449},"language":"turkish","review":"we

you are a multiplayer gamer this games could be cool for you. This game is only 2 years old and it's really fun! \nIn this game there are 4 survivors and 1 killer. The survivors need to activate 5 generators so they can open the exit gates to run away from the map. There are a total of 7 generators around the map and 2 exit gates. There is also an extra exit which is called the hatch. You can olny unlock it with 2 generators already repaired and you can only escape through the hatch if you have a especific item to open it or if you are the last survivor in the match. There are a few survivors in the game. Each one of them has his own perks. Each survivor and each killer has 3 teachable perks, which once unlocked, you can have them to all your unlocked survivors and killers. Now the killer's job is to try to kill all the survivors in the match. He needs 2 hits to knock down a survivor so he can pick him up and hook him. In the hook the survivor can't do anything but wait for anyone to rescue him. But if no one comes, he has a total of 3 chances to escape the hook, depending on the timing you're there, but only with 5% chances od succeed. In the hook you have 3 phases. The 1st one yoy can try to escape the hook. The 2nd one you need to strugle so you don't get killed. The 3rd one. Well... you DIE! Once you are dead you can't play in that match anymore. You can either spectate or leave and join another one. At the end of each match depending on what you did you can lose, win or don't get anything from the survivor or the killer's rank. Then you ALLWAYS ger bloodpoints, shards and level's XP. Depending of what you did you can get less or more. The bloodpoints are used to get add-ons, items and perks and to level up your killer or survivor. The shards are used to buy DLC survivors and killers and to buy outfits. Iforgot to mention. As survivor when the killer has picked you up you have a chance to escape the killer by wigleing. Each killer has his own habillity, so choose your favourite. \nIn game, you have windows you can vault and pallets you can stun the killer and be breakable by the killer. The killer can also kick generators to slow their progression until they are touched again, but he can't kick generators that are already done. There are also lockers where the survivors can hide and the killer can open them to check and chests survivors can open to get items. \nThere are also rarities in this game and each perk has 3 levels. By the way, you can also get cosmetics to your killers and survivors and you can also prestige them.\nWell, that's it for now.

[It's worth noting some of the best perks now require you to grind up survivors and killers that cost additional money]\n\nMany players are already an absurd level with massive perks that make them unbeatable.

Have fun being a killer against survivors that can heal themselves and each other seemingly an infinite number of times.\n\nThe player base is toxic.

Survivors are notable worse] and it's usually due to this:\n\nMany times survivors will block the hook to prevent the killer from hooking a dying survivor [Not so much an issue anymore, but can still happen]  Apparently this is a common tactic in most games I've played in.

I don't even care about the new event for the chapter. I'm just so sick of the imbalance. Killer buff and buff, playing survivor is not even a chore because chores can at least be finished. It's a slog to play survivor now. Killer has become the easiest it has ever been in years. I got videos to prove I played both sides for years, Rank 1 when that actually mattered. It's just not fun. Killer is too easy if you stack a ton of gen regression and survivor just feels like it would be more enjoyable to do math homework on the night before a big exam and you suck at math. I just cannot play this game anymore. It's just not fun anymore. I use to defend this game for years. Even when something was released that made me question a few things but I just cannot any longer. Maybe you'll like it but just know this. If you play survivor and you get high enough mmr, you'll get nothing but the most annoying gen regression, face camping garbage of your life where you might get the last gen but the match will drag on for almost 20 minutes until the killer just slugs everyone at the end. They killed my favorite game. They legit sucked the enjoyment out of it. If you choose this game, just hope you're ready for what I warned you about after you start getting good. That's all I have to say.","timestamp_created":1529356940,"timestamp_updated":1652073503,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42819502","author":{"steamid":"76561198043759977","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":123995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":105,"playtime_at_review":28037,"last_played":1659996303},"language":"english","review":"The game, as an idea, is fun and cool as hell.\nThe problem is that the balance has always been off since the game came out. From Sprint Burst and Sabo being busted to Unrelenting and Play With your Food making life unbearable for survivors to Descisive Strike STILL being in the game and being unfun even after nerfs, Behaviour has not once been able to make the game balanced in a reasonable way. Survivors, at rank 1-5 (highest ranks), are not afraid of the killer. Running around, teabagging and looping killers while they desperately attempt to slaughter the innocent is common, making the 'power role' (The killer) feel like the weak role and the Survivors as the ones in control.\n\nThe grind is ridiculous for Killers as well. While both Killers and Survivors have to level each character to 40 to gain access to each character's teachable perks, Survivors don't differ in playstyle at all, meaning you can pick one survivor you like the most and just play them once you get all the other survivors to 40. Each Killer plays completely different and to get the full experience out of each one you have to level them all up to obtain all of the perks. Perks spawn randomly, meaning you could go through hundreds of thousands of bloodpoints and not find a single perk that is considered strong, leaving you with a horribly gimped build when trying to fight against a 4 man group of survivors with all the meta perks.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is the fact that Survive With Friends is an option for Survivors and it doesn't give the Killers anything to make up for the added difficulty. Friends can team up and face a Killer and while IN GAME there is no voice chat, it isn't hard to boot up discord and communicate between survivors. \"Hey, the killer is Myers keep your eyes peeled.\" \"Ah, he's camping me don't bother coming.\" \"I died... Oh by the way the killer has *lists off the perks* so watch out.\" This is a VERY big advantage and the Killer doesn't get a single bonus for playing against these groups, not even bonus bloodpoints which might help ease the pain of being pushed around all game.\n\nSurvivors will taunt, shittalk in postgame and outright leave the game if you do anything they don't like. I don't know how many times people have spewed anger at me because I \"camped\" (Where you don't leave the hook making saving them very difficult.) Many times camping is NEEDED because the survivors will swarm the hook area with no attempt at being stealthy, making it painfully obvious that they are attempting to save the dying survivor. They are essentially saying \"Wow why didn't you let us save our friend? I don't understand?? You're doing your job????\" Anything you do to help you beat them is frowned upon. People will HATE on you if you run powerful and unfair killer perks while running around with busted survivor perks and sporting flashlights (Which essentially act as free stuns if they happen to be around you when you lift up a survivor or try to break a pallet.).\n\nAs you can tell, if you've read this far, I main killer. I still play despite all of this. It could be a very fun game, but the refusal to balance the game around good players by the developers and the horrible toxic garbage a chunk of the community spews daily is so detrimental to the health of the game that I can't imagine many would have fun if they start as new players. I've owned this game for years and I can only name 1 time where the killers were the broken ones despite being the single power role. Survivors are always in control, even as a single person, despite them being the fractured weak role.\n\nWatch streamers play the game for a bit, on both sides, if you think you'll still have fun after that go ahead and buy it. Until the devs start balancing the game properly, I'd stay away.","timestamp_created":1529356844,"timestamp_updated":1529356844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42819499","author":{"steamid":"76561198097304536","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":11759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10052,"last_played":1623544785},"language":"english","review":"Dead by Daylight 2 will have battle royale","timestamp_created":1529356842,"timestamp_updated":1529356842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472620606422424316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42819420","author":{"steamid":"76561198094703704","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5610,"last_played":1568036283},"language":"russian","review":"Разработчики данного творения , Вы совсем уже облинились , свинье зажравшиеся !

Weither you like to be scared, or be the one scaring, It creates a playstyle for everyone.","timestamp_created":1529354725,"timestamp_updated":1529354725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48908647894859314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42818915","author":{"steamid":"76561198411786628","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":59478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15893,"last_played":1639488863},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень понравилась советую","timestamp_created":1529354570,"timestamp_updated":1529354570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42818545","author":{"steamid":"76561198113669693","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":17522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9024,"last_played":1617567191},"language":"russian","review":"..Где-то　　　° ☾ ° 　¸. ● ¸ .　　★　° :.　 . • ° 　 .　 　:.　.　¸ . ● ¸ 　　　★　　★☾ °★ . 　　　　.　 ☾ ° 　¸. ... в этой игре... ● ¸ 　　　　° ☾ °☆ 　.  ¸.　　　★　★ ° . °☆ 　.  ¸.　　　★ .　　　　.　☾ °☆ 　.  ● ¸ .　　.прямо сейчас...　★　° :.　 . • ○ °★　 .　 　.　　　　　　. 　 .● 　　★　　★ ° ☾ ☆ ¸. ¸ 　★　 :.　 .　...в какой-нибудь катке....　　　° ☾　★ ° . .　　　　.. ● .　　　　° ☾ °☆ 　¸.● .　　.  ● ¸ .　　　★...есть гр♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ый кемпер...　. 　 ° 　. ● .　　 • ○ ° ★　 .　 　.　.　　¸ .　　 ° 　¸.  ● ¸ .　　　　° ☾ ° 　¸. ● ¸ .　　★　° :.　 . • ° 　 .　 　:.　.. у которого во рту... °☆ 　.  ● ¸ .　　　★　° :.　 . • ○ ° ★　 .　 　.　　　　　. 　 ° 　. ● .　　　　° ☾ °☆ 　¸.● .　　★　　★ ° ☾ ☆ ¸. ¸ 　★　 :.　 . • ○ ° ★　 .　 　...ОГРОМНЫЙ ХУЕЦ...°","timestamp_created":1529353181,"timestamp_updated":1529353181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42818537","author":{"steamid":"76561198438787735","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":22730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12729,"last_played":1626265558},"language":"turkish","review":"sex","timestamp_created":1529353159,"timestamp_updated":1626177070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4laijiuQCeb6rowE="}
