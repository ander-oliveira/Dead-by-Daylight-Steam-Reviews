Bueno, la verdad hace mucho tiempo que vengo jugando a este juego (valga la redundancia) y me pareció el momento oportuno para hacerle una buena review:\n [b]Momento de disfrute[/b]: Generalmente se da entre los rangos 15/20, no tenes idea de que hacen los perk (o capas si) y son todos mas o menos de tu nivel [spoiler]igual te vas a engranar (enojar), así que no te preocupes[/spoiler], por lo cual vas a poder jugar un poco con el asesino y disfrutar del juego.\n [b]Servidores dedicados[/b]: Algo que le hizo muy bien al juego, buenos servidores, buen ping, \"buenas partidas\" [spoiler]lo de buenas partidas esta entre comillas por ser algo subjetivo, ya que para mi, mis ultimas experiencias no están siendo muy gratificantes[/spoiler].\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: Aquí viene lo bueno jóvenes!!! (busquen el meme de los simpson). Una real y completa bazofia, si jugás solo, te vas encontrar con gente random que generalmente no saben que hacer o hacen todo mal y un asesino que cuando se las ve feas (va perdiendo como Brasil frente a Alemania) recurre a la vieja confiable (campear y tunelear). Ahora si vas de asesino, es otra la historia, si no conoces las mecánicas, te vas a comer un baile que te van a hacer revolear el teclado y el mouse como una boleadora (buscar video para mejor idea). Bueno para no hacerla tan larga el resumen.\n[b]Resumen: Haganse el favor de no comprar este juego, a menos que le guste la toxixidad de la gente y comerse un garron (pasar un mal

A 4 player coop game with strangers, trying to survive and escape an enclosed area, guarded by a killer with a unique ability. It was an exciting experience, and opened up a new concept of gaming that many other companies have tried and, for the most part, failed to replicate it's success. Behaviour Studios, the developers behind Dead by Daylight, have deserved the credit and title of a company that has successfully pioneered a new genre of gaming, and they've done it with excitement, care and love for their game.\n\nAs this game has gone on, patches have been introduced. And when new perks, new killers, new maps, and new ideas in general have been implemented through content, the game has become far more complex. Depending on the way you look at it, it is a double edged sword. More content is never a bad thing, and is always an exciting aspect to explore as a passionate fan. Discovering it's ins and outs, how it compares to previous gameplay, and purely, just the excitement that a game one loves has been given attention and care. On the other end of the sword, the more content, the more attention it draws. The player base grows, and becomes a bit harder to contain. People mention the amount of toxicity in this game, not because people are mean via what they say, but also how they play (whether they are the killer or survivor). The degree of what's fair for 4 people equating to one person is hard to judge, especially as the degree of complexity rises from content patch to content patch. Not to mention excitement-breaking bugs, long queue times, graphical errors, crashes, etc.\n\nNow we're at a time in development where there have been plenty of great, love-filled content that the developers are very proud of, as they should be. They have implemented great and unique ideas have fans at the edge of their chair in excitement and pure joy, knowing that the game is still fresh and that there is something to look forward to. However it's player base has also grown to a substantial amount, for better but also for worse. Balancing a game with such a degree of complexity while maintaining consumer happiness seems improbable, as problems always seem to arise from seed, and grow into something that is harder to handle the longer the problem persists. Whether it is bugs, balance, back-end matchmaking, players ruining the experience for other players, and the list goes on, it's gotten to the point where the game feels so far from polished that it sits as one of the most toxic games conceived by the gaming community. There has been improvement, but as previously mentioned, the more that's fixed, the more becomes broken.\n\nAll in all I feel sorry for the developers. A game that they love and give a lot of attention to has given them a lot of fame, a lot of wealth, and a lot of meaning. But one has to ask at what cost? The pure joy and thrill of this genre has evaporated and has turned into a flame that where it can be extinguished in one place, it can spread in another. And at this point in development, it is too large to contain. They're vision of simplicity in this genre has grown into a competitive experience, where there will always be something to complain about from anyone's point of view. And yes, if you're reading at this point and wondering, \"Why don't they do anything about it?!\" The answer is: They are! But it's that our actions have consequences, and improving one aspect of the game can create several other issues in another aspect. They're vision of this game has been shaped by the community over the years, and as we all know, the community does NOT have a single voice. A great example of developers that have it right is Battle State Games, the developers behind the hardcore shooter, Escape From Tarkov. It's a hardcore intense first person shooter with an incredible amount of detail. The developers listen, and take in feedback, but they don't let it affect their final product of what they vision Escape From Tarkov is, and will become. Dead By Daylight unfortunately has taken the wrong turn at the fork in the road, and it's too far to come back.\n\nIf you haven't explored this genre of games, go ahead and explore it! As previously mentioned, Dead by Daylight really pioneered the asymmetrical horror genre, and got it right. But please for your own sake, play it for the sake of thrill and excitement. If you start to think about it competitively, meta this, not useful that, tier list this, useless that, you really need to start thinking about whether this game is good for your mental well-being. As for new players? Go ahead and give it a shot, but I wouldn't be surprised if you get frustrated very quickly. And please understand, it's not because you lack the experience, it is because of so, SO much more.\n\nI stopped playing this game a while ago, even though it's one of my most played games. And I have to admit my gaming experiences have dramatically become more positive. My interactions with other gamers on the internet have gotten a lot better. And although I, much like everyone, have my own individual and personal problems to deal with, my time away from Dead by Daylight has definitely attributed to my mental strength. That's not to say you're not allowed to enjoy this game, however just watch yourself, that you don't go too deep into the rabbit's hole.","timestamp_created":1582571200,"timestamp_updated":1582571940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64061706","author":{"steamid":"76561197979394622","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":18610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"playtime_at_review":1850,"last_played":1660083034},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun game.

wayyyy behind others as i have literally no perks or anything, the match making is a lil weird and needs some fixing as even when i was rank 20 (im only at rank 14 now still no perks haha) i get placed versus people i should never face who are rank like 8-12. which is off since they just run me to the ground and i am clueless while they know exactly whats going on. but other than match making people who are 10x better/played for hundreds and hundreds of hours longer, the game is amazingly fun! even had my kids play it and they loved it!","timestamp_created":1582563596,"timestamp_updated":1582563596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64056931","author":{"steamid":"76561198444231202","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23552,"last_played":1645794309},"language":"russian","review":"Какая
