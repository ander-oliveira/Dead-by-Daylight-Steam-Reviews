Вообще такого терпилоидного коммунити я нигде не встречал: маньяки лютуют, разрабы развивают игру в пользу киберспорта, а не всеобщей доступности, (Какой, нахуй, киберспорт в играх подобного жанра ? Зачем он тут ? Для чего ?) но сурвы терпят...\nДа, я говорю про обычного человека (нуба, если хотите) зашедшего поиграть после работы/учебы, а не задрота знающего все места для мансов и играющего в фулл пати, где каждому отведена своя роль и т.д\n\nДля человека (и даже киберкотлета) играющего в рандом, с рандомной  тимой - шанс победы равен нулю. \nИграть за маньяков - не интересно.(побеждаешь в каждой катке или отсасываешь у киберспортивной тимы, а золотой середины нет).\n\nПо моему мнению, эта игра быстро надоедает (ну вот какого *** прошло кучу времени с момента релиза, а в игре только один режим без каких либо его вариаций) и затягивает на неделю-другую. \n\nP.s. и да блять в игре не предусмотрен чат, а есть только жесты ( Я знаю про эту фишку, но почему его нет, когда в пати ты сидишь в дискорде и у тебя есть, соответственно, преимущество,  а с рандомами связаться не ты можешь?) \n\nP.s2.

After being increasingly annoyed at the killers, I decided to take a crack at it and try to be someone fair with survivors.\n\nWhat a mistake that was. Played 2 games and both were just people trolling to harass the killer and not complete the generator. I, as a level 1 killer with 1 perk equipped, went up against a 4 stack of all rare perks full players who only ran around healing each other, spamming flashlights at me one after another, and dropping pallets to tea bag. It's a joke. No wonder why you only get queued with killers who are toxic, they probably learned that's the only way they'll win.\n\nMatchmaking is downright unfair. If you're just starting out or a practical expert, you'll be paired with anyone when queueing. I've had a full perked survivor carry me and a friend when we were just 1 perk people as they constantly harassed the killer so we could do gens. The only reason I even got so many hours in this game is 1. Playing private matches with friends and 2. believing it'll get better if I level up for more fair match making, and it solved nothing.\n\n*I've seen a lot of comments talking about how toxic the game is, but honestly I never got to play it when it was big and wanted to try. I continue to play R6 and other shooting games with a bad toxic rep so I figured I can handle this as well...no. At least you can do something in those games, in this one you just have to watch as they mess with you with no chat or abilities to help being hook camped or utterly trolled.","timestamp_created":1587765332,"timestamp_updated":1587766155,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957681","author":{"steamid":"76561198353010879","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":43871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5574,"last_played":1655164408},"language":"brazilian","review":"show","timestamp_created":1587764959,"timestamp_updated":1587764959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484565317630767822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957616","author":{"steamid":"76561198058561578","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":26388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6107,"last_played":1643137759},"language":"russian","review":"Весело но жопа загорается только в путь.","timestamp_created":1587764866,"timestamp_updated":1608365177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957565","author":{"steamid":"76561198064490201","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":119,"playtime_forever":46666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1261,"playtime_at_review":24802,"last_played":1660374251},"language":"english","review":"As a casual DbD player, I am clearly not the target audience of the developers... well I am not even sure who the target is anymore... cause everything they do contradicts itself... and with the latest change, the so called \"SKill-based system\" it became unplayable for me. Its no fun how they calculate your \"Skill\" and makes every game way to negativally chanrged...\n\nThe game in general is really fun, and my pulse goes up a notch whenever i am hunting...\npersonally can't play surviver, hate co-op games so I have to go killer only... but well nothing lost there, the player models look ugly anyways...\n\nPros:\n- Unique Game, still one of its kinde! (Home sweet home survival sucks and VHS ist out yet for comparison)\n- frequent new content (that is sadly mostly paid DLC)\n- Very atmospheric game world that can mirror any other horror game you have played...\n\nCons:\n- Half od the time archivments do not work... most likely the adapted ones\n- Cosmetic items are STILL VERY BORING and OVERPRICED!\n-- buy a surviver + killer for 7 bucks, while a good skin ccosts 10 bucks... the ♥♥♥♥!\n-- For killers, only the weapon matters, cause its First person so you never really see your own skin\n-- for Survivers, anything flashy makes them pop out more and makes it easier for the killer to spot them\n- Matchmaking is still not existant... I end up with players that are way ahead of me... with perks that basically render me useless...\n- Toxic community that gets pretty violent if you either are to newb-ish or to good...\n- survivers are actually all the same, no difference other then their look... you buy a surviver if you want their perks (but even that isn't need with the shrine)\n- the Bloodweb is annoying and the more teachable perks you got, the longer and more tedious it becomes to get the wanted perks\n- Anti-Cheat is useless but people who constantly disconnect are still not banned... if you go crazy as killer, you are doomed with 3/4 survivers leaving the game...\n- the game breaks so often i wonder how they can see any difference betweenr age quiters and server problem disconnects...\n\n\n-And for me the biggest negative is the fact that: THE DEVELOPERS ACTIVALLY WORK AGAINST THEIR FANBASE and ignore all feedback. They fight creativity of sustom made icons and even made an update to prevent people from using them... how backwards can you be... take a nod from Riot Games, they work closely with their fans and make LoL better and better...","timestamp_created":1587764805,"timestamp_updated":1655754830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957316","author":{"steamid":"76561198846639538","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1655328704},"language":"english","review":"-","timestamp_created":1587764436,"timestamp_updated":1587764436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957169","author":{"steamid":"76561198082196479","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1965,"last_played":1649601762},"language":"english","review":"its good","timestamp_created":1587764229,"timestamp_updated":1587764229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957161","author":{"steamid":"76561198040013536","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":11363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11363,"last_played":1605048720},"language":"english","review":"I like when the Trapper says \"You guys are gonna be Dead by Daylight!\"","timestamp_created":1587764217,"timestamp_updated":1637697213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67957090","author":{"steamid":"76561198377599945","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1623704655},"language":"polish","review":"Tak","timestamp_created":1587764132,"timestamp_updated":1587764132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67956785","author":{"steamid":"76561198996425480","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":151221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22473,"last_played":1657635089},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo ruim, n compre isso, se vc é um otario que comprou o jogo sem ta na promoção ou de graça na epic, e tem mais de 1000 horas que nem eu vc é um otario se fode aí n da pra voltar no tempo ent ja era otario, mas se vc é bom e pelo menos aproveitou suas habilidades em campeonatos por dinheiro vc é um pouco mais inteligente, boa!!","timestamp_created":1587763716,"timestamp_updated":1655074575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67956618","author":{"steamid":"76561198021628257","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1240,"last_played":1646045726},"language":"russian","review":"Купил игру по скидке. наиграл 20 часов.

А тут смотрю 200 рублей всего стоит. Дай думаю глянуть, что там такое вообще творится. Поиграл пару игр за убийцу, естественно я играл не тупого маньяка из типичного клишированного дешманского фильма ужасов, где убийцы оставляют без присмотра своих жертв,  которые при помощи рэндомных событий сбегают, и маньяк потом за ними опять бегает, а именно умного, рассчетливого(как оказалось в итоге пидорасного кемпера), который  следит за своей жертвой на крюке и не оставляет ей шансов на счастливый конец.  Вообщем за 19 часов, на меня вывались тонна дерьма из токсиков, которые будучи выжившими диктуют как тебе отыгрывать свою роль. Я думаю, когда она вышла еще не было как такового деления на кемперов, фейскемперов, пиггикемперов и т.п. и она была лучше в плане коммьюнити, но к сожалению щас я наблюдаю такую картину: \"Новичек заходит поиграть, ему говорят - ебать ты долбаеб ты играешь не так как мне бы хотелось поэтому отправлю тебе репорт за нарушение негласного правила ебать просто патамушта.\" \"Новичек - удаляет игру.\" Следовательно тут остаются в основном те \"олды\" которые диктуют свои правила и \"закаленные новички\" которым поебать на всех и вся, они просто играют.

But, It didn't do any justice on how bad this game really was. In short, Don't Buy This Garbage. \n\nThis excuse of a video game is REALLY broken. In the sense that there is no balance in the gameplay. This poor excuse of a Cooperative Horror is vacant and barren. For a Horror Cooperative Multiplayer, you would assume that there was an in-game communication; There is none here. For instances, I don't know how many times where I was 'Hooked' or when the Killer was setting traps and all of my teammates charged my position for a rescue. This is frustrating. A simple voice or text would warn them of the trap or there wasn't the need for ALL 3 teammates charging for the rescue. \n\nThis game is strictly for the benefit of the Killer player. It's unbelievable how OP the Killer is. You can't un-run them, and you really can't impede their pursuit, 2 hit and more commonly a 1 hit will put you down. Ending the 'trial' pretty quick for the survivals. \n\nMy first Win as a survivor was when Micheal Myers killed my teammates and assisted me through to the exit. The simplest communication as crouching is not a  cooperative horror survival game worth playing. The price for this game is not worth it. Wait for a sale day.
