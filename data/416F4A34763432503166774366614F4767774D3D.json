DBD is pretty easy/simple to understand early on with basic objectives like repairing generators to escape for survivors. The killer side is pretty self explanatory besides the fact that you have to put survivors on hooks to progress a sacrifice to the \"entity\" 1-3 times.\n\n Now here comes the warning, DBD can be a sweaty/Hard game on either side of the Killer or Survivor, So it's best to keep an open mind that \"winning\" doesn't always = Fun.You're going to have a bad time when you either Lose super fast to a SWF( Survive with friends group) or an unfair(subjective) Killer(someone who tunnels you for example).That's not to say it's all bad, but like all multiplayer games, Expect an A**Hole from time to time. \nTLDR : Pros\n-Horror Icons\n-Great gameplay loop\n-Surprisingly complex with Perks and Killer abilities\n-doesn't feel one sided with Killer or survivors being OP but rather comes down to Skill/Build \n-Randomized maps (they won't be dramatically different but keeps things a bit fresh)\n-Doesn't feel pay2WIN because a lot of the killers/survivors that come with the base game are amazing.\n\nCONS\n-Community can be toxic at times just like any multiplayer game with chat ( My experience has mostly been great but with a few bad apples)\n-Can be very stressful if you let it by either, feeling like you have to \"win\" all the time and expecting to Kill everyone or

The first one is that killers have more range than the actual weapon is like the hitbox is much larger than the weapon it self. The second one is the community itself because there are a lot of Campers or Tunelers, imagine being a survivor and the killer is just focusing on you and when he finnaly succeed to catch you and he hooks you on a hook then he is just straight camping in front of you to not let other players to save you.

I've enjoyed this game for the longest time but you can never be happy with the same game for that long, When you start for the game for the first time it feels like you're literally in the game, you have the adrenaline running through you. Any sudden move or mess up could lead you to potential death or loss in game.\n\nNow i'm not saying that you cannot recapture that feeling there are plenty of in game items that can help you feel that but without those it just feels empty. When you rank up more and more it becomes like a chore.\nWhen you keep ranking up it gets harder and harder, and that is when most people feel like either uninstalling or to take the challenge and keep going. Lucky me i kept going because i found a game that i enjoy and that my friends enjoy as well but when you rank up you need learn Dead by Daylight tricks like spinning, meta perks, looping, ETC. You are almost obliged to learn these if not you're going to fail over and over again.\n\n(The community of Dead by Daylight)\nI think The community of this game is really funny and enjoyable to see and talk with! and they are not afraid to give out there honest opinions to \"BHVR\" (Behavior Interactive),that could be either positive or negative and they are not afraid to hate on a game that they enjoy. They can also help you with tips and tricks for going against higher ranks and like that is how i learned to keep playing the game and to keep enjoying it,\n\nEverytime i play this game alone at high ranks, i enjoy it not as much with friends but i enjoy it, I play both survivor and killer equally. Everytime i either win or lose i don't feel satisfied with the game, it feels dull like its already a good game but there just that one thing it needs that would make the game perfect because at high ranks all you get it toxic players that make you slowly lose your sanity and fill you with anger or you just get annoyed. \n\nIn all honesty, I feel neutral about this game, sometimes i love or hate it but i just don't feel satisfied with the games, this games is probably one of my top 10s. I'd recommend this game if you're in for the thrills or you like horror icons! If you're looking for something more competitive and life draining just get to high ranks :,,,) \n\n","timestamp_created":1634944295,"timestamp_updated":1634944295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101462949","author":{"steamid":"76561199122216846","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1660273529},"language":"english","review":"Scary Man","timestamp_created":1634944288,"timestamp_updated":1634944288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101462731","author":{"steamid":"76561199142527320","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":97,"playtime_at_review":11312,"last_played":1659604688},"language":"english","review":"i play this game to fill a void. i also main nurse","timestamp_created":1634943868,"timestamp_updated":1634943868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101462669","author":{"steamid":"76561198420553922","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":218130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1345,"playtime_at_review":182638,"last_played":1660171630},"language":"brazilian","review":"Com três mil horas de Dead by Daylight, acredito que posso fazer algumas considerações sobre o estado atual do jogo. Minha fala é baseada em alguém que joga / gosta de jogar muito mais de assassino do que de sobrevivente.\n\nO jogo é completamente balanceado em torno de novos jogadores, quando você começar a jogar, vai ser uma experiência bastante gratificante. Jogando de sobrevivente, você vai se emocionar bastante ao ser perseguido pelo assassino; e jogando de assassino, vai ser muito prazeroso usar seu poder para perseguir os sobreviventes. Mas toda essa animação só acontece quando o jogo entende que você é novato...\n\nConforme você vai jogando, seu MMR (Match Making Rank) vai aumentando, e você vai caindo cada vez mais contra oponentes mais experientes. Em níveis altos de MMR você vai ter uma experiência terrível. Jogando de assassino, você vai enfrentar times super coordenados de sobreviventes que vão reparar os geradores tão rapidamente que em geral não vai dar tempo nem de matar o primeiro sobrevivente. E se você estiver jogando sozinho de sobrevivente, vai desfrutar igualmente de uma experiência terrível, o jogo vira killer side quando os sobreviventes não estão em comunicação (faz muita diferença).\n\nE não se engane, uma vez que seu MMR esteja alto, é difícil ele diminuir, você vai ter que perder dezenas de vezes para que isso aconteça.\n\nO jogo só é realmente viável em altos níveis de MMR em duas situações: quando você está jogando com um assassino que tem um poder forte, como A Enfermeira, O Flagelo ou O Espírito; ou se você jogar de sobrevivente com mais três amigos, com comunicação e coordenação.\n\nJogar com assassinos com poderes medíocres ou fracos (a maioria dos assassinos) em MMR alto é muito, mas muito estressante. Você sente que não há absolutamente nada que se possa fazer contra bons times de sobreviventes. O Caçador, O Caipira, O Michael Myers, A Porca, O Palhaço, A Legião, O Pesadelo, O Trapaça, O Mercenário, O Nemesis, O Cenobita... todos esses são completamente inviáveis se você jogar contra times experientes.\n\nExistem também os assassinos medianos, como A Caçadora, O Carrasco e Os Gêmeos. Com estes, se você se esforçar muito talvez consiga 2/4 mortes contra bons times.\n\nA empresa desenvolvedora do jogo diariamente recebe críticas sobre o estado de equilíbrio, no fórum oficial, mas eles parecem não dar a devida importância pra isso.\n\nMinha avaliação é negativa porque atualmente o jogo mais me estressa do que anima, então não recomendo para ninguém no momento. Espero que a Behavior passe a valorizar mais os jogadores de longa data e comece a mudar no equilíbrio, se isso acontecer, minha avaliação pode se tornar positiva.","timestamp_created":1634943777,"timestamp_updated":1634943777,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554013907909393311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101462630","author":{"steamid":"76561199170129351","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16657,"last_played":1657026470},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая помойка в мире\"","timestamp_created":1634943714,"timestamp_updated":1634943714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101462589","author":{"steamid":"76561198446330893","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1652171007},"language":"english","review":"Nea is killer\n","timestamp_created":1634943659,"timestamp_updated":1634943659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v42P1fwCfaOGgwM="}
