Takes 2-5 minutes to find a match as a killer and most of the time you are going against the pay to win players that spend real money to unlock the perks that you get late game. Which means you have no chance to do anything as a killer by the time you find a player 1-2 minutes in they have all five gens done and unlocking the door in 3 seconds.

You might enjoy the game at the beginning, but when you get to higher ranks, when people actually know how to play the game, you'll realize that Behaviour ballances the game to be enjoyable for survivors. They basically treat killers as intelligent NPCs to amuse survivors, it seems like. Without the perk Ruin, which they are removing, all generators can be repaired in a matter of 5 minutes, while the size and design of the map make the Killer powerless to stop it, unless you play one of the top killers. Sometimes you will sweat your balls and make great plays, but get cucked either by insane genspeed or impossible to negate loops where survivors have godmode. And devs do nothing to address these widely recognized issues, instead shifting the game's balance to survivor more and more. They made some promising changes in the past, like removing instaheals, which led me to believe that the game will get better and better, but as of the most recent Public Test Build I've been proven wrong. Seriously, just pass on this game if you plan on maining killer. It will suck out your money and all the joy of life in return for little satisfaction. That being said, if you prefer playing survivor, you will probably have fun, aside from when devs ruin the game with countless bugs after every update and then go on a break.","timestamp_created":1579273598,"timestamp_updated":1579273598,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547348320484161377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61981531","author":{"steamid":"76561198873497168","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":6462,"last_played":1659605977},"language":"russian","review":"Баланса 0 , но я рекомендую))))","timestamp_created":1579273512,"timestamp_updated":1583948937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61981208","author":{"steamid":"76561198007367852","num_games_owned":738,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1044,"last_played":1604186292},"language":"greek","review":"simple the best ....","timestamp_created":1579273069,"timestamp_updated":1579273069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61981056","author":{"steamid":"76561198951588795","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1630229521},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok güzel oyun, konusu çok güzel fakat oyuna para yatıran çok güçlü oluyor.

Dead by Daylight goes through several rough patches, constantly unbalanced due to a tiny number of exploits/poor game designs which, instead of fixing, the devs try to \"balance\".\n\nThat's not to say it isn't fun - it can be loads of fun at times, especially with friends or when playing with more honorable randoms who would rather have fun than abuse game mechanics ((rare anywhere but lowest tiers)). However, the more you play, the more encounters you'll have with this game's toxic community and the more glaring the balance issues will become, so the most efficient way to actually enjoy the game is in short bursts with large gaps between.\n\nHence why I lean more towards not recommending this game. This is largely due to the fact that the devs keep trying to manage symptoms instead of fixing the root of the problems and that the game is only fun when you don't play it as much as you do play.\n\n\n\nBonus round: some problems in the game which have been in since launch, and some incredibly simple ways to fix them!\n\nLooping (toxic survivor behaviour):\nLooping owes its success to taking the shortest route possible around a \"loop\" because survivors are more agile and maneuverable than killers. This means to loop successfully, you have to hug objects such as walls or obstacles.\nEASY FIX:\nImplement a core mechanic for survivors where maintaining contact with an object or wall will trigger a 50-50 chance to \"stumble\" every 1.5-2 seconds, which forces you to stop sprinting for a short period of time (0.5-1 seconds) or even go so far as to reduce you to 75% of your walk speed for that time. To avoid survivors 'tapping' objects, accrued 'contact' time will persist for 1-1.5 seconds, meaning touching an object for 0.8 seconds, breaking contact for 0.5 seconds, then returning for 0.9 seconds will net you a total of 1.7 seconds of 'contact' time.\nCongratulations, survivors' ability to loop has been irrecoverably crippled.\n\nHook Camping (toxic killer behaviour):\nCamping hooks is not game-breaking, as skilled players can punish this behavior by finishing all the generators before the hooked survivor dies - however, this will still result in the hooked player spending the whole game being camped, ruining the experience for them. One survivor doesn't get to play the game, the killer doesn't actually do anything meaningful, and the other survivors get a free game - i.e., nobody's having fun, which is pretty poor for a game - something made for the sake of entertainment.\nEASY FIX:\nThe Entity is known to intervene when survivors are being ****heads (read: blocking windows, blocking generators, blocking exit gates, killing survivors during endgame), so why not killers too? Spending too long near a hooked survivor while not in a chase will result in the Entity grabbing the killer and holding them in place, preventing them from moving or attacking for 20-30 seconds.\nCongratulations, whether or not this unsporting behavior is punished no longer relies on the skills or numbers of the remaining survivors.\n\nGen Rushing (toxic survivor behaviour):\nGen rushing usually hinges on skills & items which speed up the rate of repair. In solitary, these skills and items are fairly innocuous, but when all four survivors have maximized their repairing abilities... well, all generators can be popped in less than three minutes.\nEASY FIX:\nGenerator overheat. Each successfully-repaired generator will add 40 stacks of overheat which decay at a rate of one stack per second. Hitting 100 stacks of overheat will fry the power grid, causing all generators to spark and be irreparable until survivors find and flip one of five breaker switches scattered around the map, their position telegraphed by a flashing red light. The killer sees the auras of all breaker switches when the power grid fries. For each dead survivor, the amount of stacks required to fry the grid increases by 30.\nCongratulations, survivors can no longer bum rush killers, and even get a fun little extra objective if they're careless.\n\nTunneling (toxic killer behavior):\nTunneling is when a killer relentlessly and purposefully chases the same survivor over and over again in order to progress their hooks and get them out of the game as soon as possible.  A tunneling killer will have 'tunnel' vision; ignoring all other survivors and objectives just to make the game as miserable as possible for this one poor sod.\nEASY FIX:\nClemency. The flip-side to 'Bloodlust' - a mechanic which makes killers move faster the longer they continuously chase a single survivor (a botched attempt at 'fixing' looping wouldn't you know). Clemency will start at its maximum stack when a survivor is unhooked and decay when they're not being chased. Clemency stacks will not decay while being chased by a killer nor while the survivor is downed. The more stacks of Clemency a survivor has, the more full the 'wriggle bar' will be when they're next picked up by the killer, with maximum stacks equating to 90-100% progress. --All stacks of Clemency will be removed when another survivor is hit by the killer regardless of other conditions--\nCongratulations, survivors who are being tunneled now have a chance to actually play and enjoy the game.\n\nI could go on, but this review is long enough already.\nHire me bEHAVIOUR, so I can fix your ****ing game for you.","timestamp_created":1579261786,"timestamp_updated":1635597205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557284832000732422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61973973","author":{"steamid":"76561198442045423","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":66781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17781,"last_played":1652947730},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlarınızla oynayın eğer survivor oynayacak iseniz.

Was hat sich also geändert? Kurzum: Nix. Alles ist, wie es war, wenn überhaupt ist es noch schlimmer geworden. Kurz zusammengefasst lässt sich sagen, dass Solo-Survivor so ziemlich das Letzte ist, was Neulinge spielen sollten. Es ist schlicht zum Kotzen. Das Ausmaß, in dem DBD Spieler sich toxisch verhalten, spottet jeder Beschreibung. Und zwar sowohl was Survivor als auch was Killer anbetrifft. \n\nTut euch bitte, bitte einen Gefallen: Fangt gar nicht erst mit DBD an, lasst es bleiben. Es gibt so viele Spiele, die Spaß machen und Einsatz und Mühe belohnen, dieses ist keines davon. Es besteht nur aus einem Modus, beherbergt mit die widerwärtigste Community, die sich denken lässt und wird nur am Leben gehalten durch endloses Grinding und ständig neue Bezahlinhalte.\n\nFalls ihr denn gar nicht anders könnt und unbedingt diese erbärmliche Frustmaschine von einem Spiel spielen müsst, dann sucht euch um Himmels Willen ein paar Freunde und spielt als Team mit Sprachchat. In diesem, und nur in diesem Modus macht das Spiel durchaus Spaß. Solo-Survivor und Killer könnt ihr abhaken. Beides grenzt an Masochismus, und ich rate jedem, der es hören resp. lesen will, dringend davon ab. So. Ende. Peace!\n\n\n****\n\nHallo, ich wende mich AUSDRÜCKLICH an jene, die jetzt noch mit dem Gedanken spielen, 2020 in [b]Dead by Daylight[/b] einzusteigen. Alle Anderen können jetzt aufhören, diesen Text zu lesen. Und falls nicht, ihr wurdet gewarnt. Eine Review sollte meiner Ansicht nach vor allem Interessierten einen Eindruck vermitteln, und nicht nur bloße Meinungsäußerung sein. Also, kurz und bündig: \n\nKauft das Spiel nicht, jetzt nicht mehr, auch nicht im Sale!\n\n\n\n[b]Ok, und nun ganz ausführlich, bringt tüchtig Aufmerksamkeitsspanne mit:[/b]\n\nSolltet Ihr jetzt noch, nachdem das Spiel seit vier Jahren auf dem Markt ist, neu einsteigen? Klare Antwort: Nein! Tut euch das nicht an, es sei denn, ihr steht auf jede Menge Frustration, Ärger und Demütigung und habt außerdem unbegrenzt Zeit, all diese wundervollen Dinge zu genießen. Zur Klarstellung, das Spiel ist hochgradig suchterzeugend, es macht, wenn es denn funktioniert, jede Menge Spaß, und die Entwickler betreuen das Spiel nach wie vor mit Updates, Patches und DLC.\n\n[b]ABER:[/b]\n\nWenn ihr jetzt noch neu dazukommt, wird eure erste Erfahrung mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit folgendermaßen aussehen:\n\n[b]1. Spiel als Killer[/b]\n\nKönnt ihr getrost vergessen. Das Matchmaking ist komplett im Eimer. Eure ersten Spiele werden vermutlich in Etwa so ablaufen: Ihr startet als ein beliebiger Killer und wartet erstmal ewig auf eine Lobby. Wenn ihr endlich eine Gruppe Überlebender zum Spielen angeboten bekommt, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit sehr hoch, dass ihr es mit Leuten zu tun bekommt, die das Spiel schon seit hunderten, wenn nicht tausenden von Stunden spielen (ja, im Ernst!). Sie haben machtvolle Meta-Builds aus Perks aller Survivor am Start, jede Menge seltener Add-ons und alle Erfahrung der Welt. Ihr habt... nichts! Fein. Nun startet das Spiel, und ihr werdet innerhalb von wenigen Minuten komplett zerlegt. Dabei werden i.d.R. nicht nur alle vier Überlebenden entkommen, nein, sie werden euch vorher noch ausgiebig erniedrigen, verspotten und eure Unerfahrenheit bis aufs Letzte ausnutzen. Wenn ihr das durchhaltet, werdet ihr nach ein paar Spielen dann endlich mal wenigstens einen Überlebenden niederstrecken und an den Haken hängen, vermutlich gegen Ende der Runde. Nun wollt ihr endlich auch mal ein kleines Erfolgserlebnis, wenigstens dieses eine Mal zumindest einen Kill mitnehmen, schon aus dringend notwendigen Gründen der Selbst-Motivation. Gelingt euch das, werdet ihr ein paar armselige Blutpunkte dafür einheimsen, was aber noch besser ist, ihr werdet im anschließenden Aftergame-Chat angepöbelt und als Camper, Noob oder Schlimmeres beschimpft. Sozusagen als Bonus dafür, dass ihr wieder ein Spiel verloren habt. Das geht ad infinitum so weiter, denn selbst wenn ihr mal Überlebende mit einem niedrigeren, eher eurem eigenen entsprechenden Rang antrefft, so sind das oft Leute, die ihren Rank künstlich niedrig halten, um sich so unfaire Vorteile zu verschaffen. Wie das genau geht, erfährt man auf allerlei Fach-Foren. Juhu, Überraschung: Wer fair spielt, verliert! \n\nKlingt das nach Spaß für euch? Dann kauft das Spiel. Falls nicht, lasst es bleiben oder lest den nächsten Part, über das Spiel als Überlebender.\n\n[b]2. Spiel als Überlebender[/b]\n\nSolltet ihr lieber die anspruchsvolle Aufgabe des Überlebenden angehen wollen, wird folgendes passieren: Ihr werdet deutlich schneller Lobbies finden und schneller starten. Auch wenn ihr mit unverhältnismäßig stärkeren Mitspielern/Killern zusammengewürfelt werdet, werdet ihr nach einer gewissen Eingewöhnungszeit rasch Fortschritte machen, zum Einen, weil es diverse Möglichkeiten gibt, auch in einem aussichtslosen Spiel Punkte zu ergattern, und zum Anderen dadurch, dass stärkere, erfahrenere Überlebende euch quasi mit durchschleifen. Insofern ist die Erfahrung als Neueinsteiger auf der Überlebenden-Seite klar angenehmer. Das bedeutet aber nicht, dass ihr nicht dennoch zahllose Spiele verlieren werdet, weil euer Quartett einem Killer gegenübersteht, der seit ca. 1000 Stunden DbD spielt, und gegen dessen Erfahrung ihr in jeder Minute der Runde absolut chancenlos bleibt. Und es ändert auch nichts an der Tatsache, dass ihr, solltet ihr irgendwann auch mal die andere Seite kennen lernen und als Killer spielen wollen (was ja eigentlich empfehlenswert, wenn nicht gar unabdingbar ist, sofern man wirklich gut in diesem Spiel werden möchte), auf dasselbe Problem stoßen werdet, dass im ersten Abschnitt bereits beschrieben wurde.\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\n\nWem würde ich empfehlen, 2020 noch mit Dead by Daylight anzufangen? Nun, in erster Linie Gelegenheitsspielern mit einem Grusel-Survival-Fable, die für ein paar Stunden Spaß (und Pein) genießen möchten, aber keine Ambitionen haben, sich ernsthaft langfristig mit dem Spiel zu beschäftigen. Dann natürlich all den romantischen Masochisten da draußen, die einfach gerne Leiden und kein Problem damit haben, von diesem an sich bemerkenswert guten, aber leider vollkommen unfairen Zeitvertreib schnell und sinnlos süchtig zu werden. Oh, und sollte es sich für euch nach jeder Menge Spaß anhören, toxisch und hämisch als Survivor zu spielen, ob nun mit \"Randoms\" oder gar einem \"Chat-Team\" aus ähnlich veranlagten Gestalten, und dabei systembedingt hoffnungslos unterlegene Killer zu t-baggen, zu nerven und bei jeder Gelegenheit zu erniedrigen, sobald ihr \"gut genug\" dafür seid ([i]gut? Ha! Wären diese Figuren gut in dem Spiel, müssten sie nicht nach 600 Stunden immer noch mit grünen Rängen herumeiern, ob nun absichtlich oder nicht, Anm. d. Red.[/i]), dann ist das Spiel für euch wohl auch eine Überlegung wert. Nur bitte lauft mir dann nicht online über den Weg, ich verzichte dankend.\n\nAllen Anderen kann ich nur dringend davon abraten, jetzt noch einzusteigen. Selbst wenn ihr all die beschriebenen Unzulänglichkeiten überwinden könnt, braut sich am Horizont bereits ein massiver Fallout zusammen, der das Spiel und seine Community gerade im Bezug auf mittlere und erst recht auf höhere Ränge nachhaltig beschädigen könnte. Stichwort \"Ruin-Gate\". Macht das Spiel Spaß? Ohne Zweifel, in etwa einem Drittel bis Viertel der Spiele für Survivor-Einsteiger, und in vielleicht einem von zehn Spielen als Baby-Killer.

Eu o vi mais de perto e tive uma explosão cerebral, igual quando eu carburava um narga com meus amigos pelados na minha casa. Me aproximei mais deste belo homem e perguntei o seu nome, ele me disse que o seu nome era Amaury, fiquei boquiaberto com esse nome tão lindo. E depois disso ele me pegou no colo e me levou para a sua cabana luxuosa, fiquei maravilhado com aquela cabaninha. O Amaury me apresentou 2 amigos muito especiais para ele, que estavam naquela cabana e eram um gordo e um autista.. ( vulgo o nome são Matheus e Vinicius ).\nQuando voltei para casa contei para o meu amigo ( vulgo Lucas ) sobre o ocorrido e depois de 1 semana o apresentei aos outros. Quando voltei naquela cabana todos estavam reunidos e comentando sobre a época de 64... Quando entrei na conversa falei sobre uma coisa que aconteceu comigo naquela época e eles ficaram impressionados. Comentei sobre vários homens fortes e altos terem me jogado contra a parede várias vezes, até eu não aguentar mais. (Embora eu queria mais) \nMas deixando isso de lado, fui criando um laço de amizade com essas pessoas, que até hoje converso com essas pessoas, embora queria conversar mesmo só com o belo homem Amaury e o meu amigo Lucas Gabriela.
