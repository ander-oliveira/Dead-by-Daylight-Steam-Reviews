Их - пидров. С ужасом понимаешь, что в реальных ситуациях эти люди поведут себя так же, как и в игре. Они будут целовать тебе пятки, когда поймаешь их последними, считая, что это такая изощренная хитрость. В то время как незадолго до того этот самый пидр всю игру просидел в шкафу, ожидая того самого момента, когда его команда будет перебита (это ведь очень умно - дождаться светлого момента, желая смерти каждому в своей команде, дабы прыгнуть в люк). Убийца! Будь благоразумен! Не вешай на крюк предпоследнего, пока оба последних не лягут - обломи пидра, не дай ему уйти.\nИгра за выживальщика: все время не хватает рук. Вот, отвлек маньяка, даже по хребтине отхватил, маньяк гонится за тобой. Кто воспользуется ситуацией и снимет повешенного? Никто. Пидры чинят генераторы, которые им не пригодятся. Удалось снять повешенного в одиночку? Рано радуешься, теперь повиси вместо него: с крюка ты очень хорошо будешь видеть, как пидры чинят генераторы, ковыряются в ящиках и пытаются извлечь всяческую пользу из твоего бедственного положения. А ты висишь один-одинешенек. Маньяк-то уже понял, что команда пидрская - и не охраняет тебя. Удача! Удалось соскочить с крюка. Два пидра убегают в ворота, один - в люк. Теперь ты сдохнешь на крюке мгновенно. Но - о, чудо! У тебя, принесенного в жертву, больше очков, чем у сбежавших пидров. Чем же они занимались? Они сидели в шкафах. Выживальщик! Знай: многообразие пидров стремится к бесконечности. Есть даже подсадные пидры, работающие на пару с маньяком. Но об этом ты узнаешь только на крюке.\nИгра за убийцу. Убийца, помни, если тебе попалась дружная команда, в которой нет ни одного пидра - тебе крупно не повезло. Ты проиграл так или иначе. Если даже все погибнут, ты будешь чувствовать себя обосранным героической командой. Да и очков у тебя окажется негусто. Потому не висни всем телом на тушке повешенного - это выглядит жалко. Ведь в плохой команде к повешенному и за сто метров не подойдут. Обожаю то самое удивление пидра, чинящего генератор, которого тащат на второй крюк: \"Как??? Ведь все так хорошо было, товарищ висел на крюке, у меня было время!\" Не прокатило, пидр.\nПо поводу баланса: если бы все выживальщики, вне зависимости от ранга и уровня, соблюдали три простых принципа, убийца бы никогда не смог победить. Эти принципы таковы:\n1. Будь осторожен, не попадайся.\n2. Если кто-то попался - бросай все и галопом беги его выручать.\n3. Действуй, будь полезен.\nК сожалению, пидры из всех этих правил редко соблюдают даже первое. Потому что считают себя очень умными. Кстати, любимый персонаж пидров - очкарик.

Otherwise you might be put off by the quantity of toxic people. Devs continue to patch bugs and add new content. For killer you can put in hundreds of hours into an individual one and still have new tech to learn and master. Some perks and maps are really strong for survivor or killer so they can get frustrating, but so long as you get put in a lobby of equally matched players (Which happens half of the time) you'll have some fun. The learning curve for both sides is steep so it's highly recommended to watch some guides before starting, and it's always better to play with friends you can communicate to.","timestamp_created":1471532920,"timestamp_updated":1651625111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24993790","author":{"steamid":"76561198040006428","num_games_owned":492,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":24896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15007,"last_played":1587887730},"language":"french","review":"Bien, parlons de ce jeu qui fait couler tant d'encre, de larmes, et de sang...\n\nD'abord ce qui fâche, car oui, il y a des bugs, comme dans un peu près n'importe quel jeu, qui tendent à être mineur à mes yeux et dont certains ont disparu.\n\nLe décor qui \"accroche\" parfois un peu quand on est survivant, on s'en sort très facilement, et au pire, on prend un coup de machette si par malchance le tueur arrive. Ca reste vraiment épisodique.\nMême chose si le tueur à une connection en mousse, c'est vrai qu'on lag pas mal dans ces cas là, mais sur les centaines de parties que j'ai jouées, ça doit être survenu moins de 10 fois...\nEt quand ça arrive, le tueur est si minable que les survivants s'en tirent avec un maximum de points, je l'ai vécu à chaque fois. \n\nLe temps pour trouver une partie, ou plutôt la mécanique pour en rejoindre une, n'est pas optimisée.\nSi un lobby ne s'ouvre pas de suite, il faut souvent repousser sur le bouton \"rejoindre\". C'est gonflant, clairement, mais c'est pas la fin du monde non plus, et je suppose que ça s'arrangera avec un patch.\n\nPour le multi avec des amis, j'en ai pas fait, mais je veux bien croire les gens qui se plaignent pour trouver une partie. Donc pas d'avis, juste wait and see comme on dit.\n\n\nVient maintenant ce que j'aime dans ce jeu. L'adrénaline!! \nQu'on soit survivant ou tueur, on la ressent bien, surtout les premières parties, où on découvre le jeu, les maps et notre capacité à gérer le stress...\nC'est comme dans la vie, c'est moche et ça tâche, mais parfois, on a une belle surprise. Ici c'est la même. \nVous ferez des partie d'anthologie, où tout vous réussira, avec des équipiers malins qui vous aident, vous soignent, font diversion, bref, le pied! D'autres, ça sera le contraire, ça sera des burnes, qui vous laisseront crever, camperont à rien foutre pendant que vous faites le sale boulot...\n\nEt vous aussi, vous ferez pareil, car vous êtes humains. Vous allez essayer, réussir, rater, ou vous faire dégommer après 20 seconde de jeu, cueilli comme une fleur par le tueur. \nOu parfois sauver votre équipe en étant un héros...\nCa dépendra, aucune partie n'est pareille, il faut s'adapter à chaque fois.\n\nBref, il y a de quoi faire, et si effectivement il y a un matchmaking assez bizarre, il ne sert pas à grand chose au fond. Surtout voir qui a la plus grosse, mais ça on connait, et débloquer une tenue de prestige. \nJ'ai vu des tueurs avec des perks de fou faire de la merde et la même pour des survivants. Les compétences, surtout certaines, aident beaucoup, mais on peut s'en passer et avoir des résultats sans. \nMaintenant, un bon joueur en reste un, tous jeux confondu. Il faut accepter de se faire rouler dessus par meilleur que soit, car ça arrive, peu importe le jeu.\n\nIl faut essayer et vous faire votre idée, je pense que ça vaut le coup.\n\n\nPlusieurs moi plus tard, le jeu a gagné en maturité, ce qui n'est pas le cas de la communauté, mais ça c'est un autre débat. Les dev font le boulot et les améliorations sont là. J'en entend déjà crier aux cheats, au nerf un tel ou un tel, mais bon, c'est chaque fois la même chose.\n\nLe jeu n'est pas parfait, mais il me procure toujours ce petit frisson et cet afflux d'adrénaline qui me plait, c'est là le principal.\n\nLe jeu s'étoffe, toujours aussi sympa.","timestamp_created":1471532082,"timestamp_updated":1511548731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480874329805374146","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtbSJz9YCfv+rXw=="}
