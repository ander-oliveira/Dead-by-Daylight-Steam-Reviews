Throughout the years, Dead by Daylight has been expanded and improved. However, for the last few years the game has been progressively but slowly getting worse and worse. \nThe first update that I remember that began this trend was Update 2.0.0. This was the update that added the in-game store, which in itself was not bad but this also included the addition of micro-transactions. These micro-transactions, or auric cells, are used for cosmetics only. When they were first added this was not completely terrible as there were not many cosmetics. The problem was the fact that in order to get some of the rarer cosmetics you would need to spend an incredibly large amount of money to purchase them. For example a 'very rare' outfit would cost about 1085 auric cells. This doesn't sound terrible until you realize that 1000 auric cells are the equivalent to $10 USD. That is 10 dollars and 85 cents for ONE outfit. Now, to be fair when you spend ten dollars on auric cells it gives you an extra 100 auric cells, which allows you to afford this cosmetic, but still, over 10 dollars is way to much for just one damn outfit. Today the prices have remained the same, with new cosmetics being added somewhat regularly now. This is a big problem as it means in order to get all of the cosmetics you would have to spend hundreds of dollars in order to get them. It is possible to get SOME of the cosmetics with Iridecent Shards, which you gain from playing the game, but this can take almost 50 hours or so just to get one of the very rare cosmetics. More recently they have added 'legendary' skins, which most of them require auric cells for you to get them, and they cost just over 1500 auric cells EACH. that is fucking FIFTEEN DOLLARS for ONE SKIN. There is no excuse to price a single skin for this price. If selling skins for 10 dollars was ridiculous, then selling one skin for 15 dollars is downright insane. All in all, the in game store has been a cash cow for BHVR, and they will only continue to exploit it. \nMoving on, they have now began to water down the events in the game. Back in 2017 and 2018, the players got to enjoy awesome events like the Winter Solstice event, the Halloween themed events, the yearly anniversary events and the Lunar New year events. These have all been watered down in some form. The Winter Solstice events are basically non existent nowadays. Back in 2017 and 18, the hooks, chests, and a few other this were given christmas lights for a wintery theme. They have not done since 2019 I believe. I know they did not do it last year (2020), We would also get a few cosmetics items for free, they were only for killer which made their eyes glow a frosty blue. It may not seem like much but it was really nice to have. They have completely dropped all of this. Sure, we still have access to the frosty eyes and the ugly sweaters (which you had to pay for or unlock with iri shards, basically meaning you did not get the christmas themed sweaters for free during a christmas themed event), but we no longer get anything added to the game during December. All we get now are bloodhunts (which are basically double bloodpoints for a week or so). This also happened to those other events except for the anniversary event last year. Now, what about that anniversary event, was it so good that it warranted the neutering of are other events? HELL NO. What we got during last years anniversary was just some crowns we had to find mid-match and we could equip it as a cosmetic item. That was basically it, sure the quotes from the devs during the loading screens were pretty cute, but come the fuck on! The first year event we got challenges that we had to complete, which when we completed all 5 challenges as a community, we were not only given a sneak peak at the new map but we got the next DLC for free, which was the last free DLC that this game has gotten (This was 2017, almost four years now). From what is leaked, the 5th year anniversary, coming very soon, is pretty much just a copy paste from the last damn event. Now, maybe we will get those challenges like the first anniversary, which would make this event one of the best for the game, but if we don't then it will go down as the most laziest. Atleast with the watered down Christmas, Halloween, etc.  events they were changed from what they were before. They actually had to change some of the code for these. This is just a fucking copy and paste.\nIn order to not make this any more longer than it has to be I am going to make this last part brief, although it is the most recent fuck up from the devs and probably the biggest. The last three chapters have been a complete disaster in some way. The \"Binding of Kin\" chapter was released unfinished (the devs even admitted to this) and not to mention the bugs that were added to the game, which were completely unrelated to the newly added content. After a few patches, finally things were back to how they were, and it turned out that the Twins, the newly added killer(s) was actually pretty damn fun to play and were also pretty strong. The survivor I can't really say as I never cared enough to play her, as I have all the perks unlocked on my meg, and since each survivor plays almost exactly the same there is no real reason to play a different survivor. I don't use her perks so I can't comment on those, but the Killer's perks were terrible. Coup De Grace was the only decent one and it is so situational you are pretty much better bringing almost anything else. The \"All Kill\" chapter had a pretty stable launch, but the problem with that was the fact that the killer was fucking shit. He was terrible during the PTB (Player Test Build) and despite the criticism he got, BHVR did almost nothing to his power, so he released as the worst killer in the game. Now after a few patches he is still pretty bad but is no longer the worst killer. The last chapter, the \"Resident Evil\" Chapter has got to be the most disappointing releases for this game. The killer is overall pretty average and the two survivors were also pretty mediocre perk wise. What made this release so bad as the others was the fact that the game is almost as buggy as it was under the \"Binding of Kin\" update. Not as bad, but it is still pretty buggy at times. The new map was removed within an hour of going live due to people having crash issues on it. A FUCKING HOUR! This wasn't even a problem in the PTB, so wtf did they do to fuck this up.\nOk, so now that I have written this fucking essay of a review, I am going to leave with this. Do not buy this game. If you already own it, then DO NOT give the devs any more of your money. After all of the shit that they have done to this game, they do not deserve another penny until they start listening to the community. Until then, I personally will not buy another DLC from them. Yesterday and today I have been apart of a boycott of this game, where players refused to play the game in hopes of having BHVR make a change in all of the bullshit they have put this game in. And although I will be returning tomorrow, I hope that this boycott and this review lets the devs know that this is not the end of this resistance. I have been with them for so long, been loyal to them for so long, and I am not going to allow them to betray me any more. BHVR, fix your damn game. As a consumer, I expect quality, not perfections (you guys are only human) but I still expect effort to be put into what I buy. Thank you for you time reading this, whether you are just some random onlooker, or from BHVR. \nPlease feel free to add a comment if you want me to go into even more detail or if you want something explained a little more. Or even if you disagree, I am 100% willing to hear any and all complaints about my review.","timestamp_created":1624816153,"timestamp_updated":1624816268,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":98,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.644005417823791504","comment_count":16,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94522033","author":{"steamid":"76561199183727330","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":21432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2099,"last_played":1642546025},"language":"english","review":"666","timestamp_created":1624816062,"timestamp_updated":1624816062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94522004","author":{"steamid":"76561198274420411","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":19516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1847,"last_played":1650222863},"language":"russian","review":"амормаитмгыримгнымрынурущнфцгфркгрсмнштиргыр7г2г7к92нк2нап86цыр79мты9гиш","timestamp_created":1624816038,"timestamp_updated":1624816038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94521939","author":{"steamid":"76561198440085155","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":5078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3689,"last_played":1644436387},"language":"polish","review":"Ta gra jest super","timestamp_created":1624815981,"timestamp_updated":1624815981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94521908","author":{"steamid":"76561199039257251","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2316,"last_played":1639228750},"language":"spanish","review":"Lol 2, compañeros inútiles","timestamp_created":1624815954,"timestamp_updated":1624815954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94521833","author":{"steamid":"76561199069650119","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":76,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1660337373},"language":"german","review":"ja ist geil","timestamp_created":1624815901,"timestamp_updated":1624815901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94521730","author":{"steamid":"76561199070217370","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17611,"last_played":1650929596},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, recomendado :3","timestamp_created":1624815806,"timestamp_updated":1624815806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94521656","author":{"steamid":"76561199182060683","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":135598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2352,"playtime_at_review":3065,"last_played":1660589091},"language":"english","review":"14 Jun 2022 : Now is over 2000 hours and still facing so many bug problems.
