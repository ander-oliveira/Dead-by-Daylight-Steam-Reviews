When I'm survivor, the killer's hit will travel farther than my dad did getting the milk. The killers swings will cross light-years to connect to my player model. And oh boy is it even worse on killer. i have hit survivors through walls, pallets, and lockers. I have stopped running perks on killer to make the game fair. My ping never exceeds 35, so this is not a network issue nor is there packet loss. Killer has never been easier to play and the opposite for survivor. Survivor has become a task. I would rather fight a silver back gorilla with my fingers in chinese finger traps, and a 40 lb weight carrier around my torso in ankle shackles than play survivor. Sometimes it's a skill issue, this can happen from time to time and I'm fine with it.  But Most of the time its my team-mates not doing gens. So I do what any reasonable man would do and play with friends. This just leads to annoying face camping killers. And with the games poor ranking system, you lose \"MMR\" if you don't escape. You could do gens, loop the killer, get unhooks, and even save the game for nothing if you don't escape. There are only so many purple flashlights I can lose before my sanity takes a toll. This must be a recent thing but the game has never been in a terrible state and I feel like the devs don't care? I love this game dearly but after 6 years you would think the game would be polished. Also, what about cross-progression? I thought it would have released by now but as of 7/29/22 (29/7/22) it is still non-existent\n\nSo basically play this game if you hate yourself.","timestamp_created":1659069640,"timestamp_updated":1659069936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.676913142204284668","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119682634","author":{"steamid":"76561198116672240","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9348,"last_played":1659069292},"language":"english","review":"Fun for about two games once a week.","timestamp_created":1659069470,"timestamp_updated":1659069470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501160264015197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119682443","author":{"steamid":"76561198237161102","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1016,"playtime_at_review":21377,"last_played":1660585294},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego divertido y con gran variedad de obsesiones para elegir. \nEn general un buen juego a veces un poco de cortes pero nada grave.","timestamp_created":1659069204,"timestamp_updated":1659069204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119682416","author":{"steamid":"76561198310577460","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3060,"playtime_at_review":6804,"last_played":1660532265},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es como el lol no me gusta jugarlo pero como soy masoquista lo juego y sufro mucho, nerf killers plis la concha de tu madre legion\n","timestamp_created":1659069166,"timestamp_updated":1659069166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119682415","author":{"steamid":"76561198876294538","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":214,"playtime_at_review":2345,"last_played":1660300797},"language":"english","review":"Nice game but i hate camper","timestamp_created":1659069166,"timestamp_updated":1659069166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119682129","author":{"steamid":"76561198149531793","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":555,"playtime_at_review":9055,"last_played":1660097607},"language":"latam","review":"una mierda mal hecha","timestamp_created":1659068659,"timestamp_updated":1659068659,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119682107","author":{"steamid":"76561199172929023","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":39,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1660172483},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1659068622,"timestamp_updated":1659068622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119681985","author":{"steamid":"76561198090767823","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":45849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45849,"last_played":1659067919},"language":"spanish","review":"Con la ultima actualizacion se termino de morir el juego todo por hacerle casos a los killers, jugar de survi es ser masoquista porque es injugable ya.

Und die Entwickler sind wirklich sehr eifrig dabei das Spiel zu verbessern. Aber ich muss auch sagen, seit dem ich dieses Spiel spiele haben die Entwickler immer nur was für die Killer gemacht was den Spielfluss betrifft und die Survivor ständig generft... Aber man ist ein braver Survivor und passt sich den neuen Schwierigkeiten an, während man den Killern immer mehr das Denken abnimmt. Leider muss ich mich nach dem letzten Update (meine Geldbörse möge es mir verzeihen) wohl von diesem Spiel verabschieden. Die Killer sind jetzt Gott gleich und als normaler Survivor ohne SWF (Survive with friends) bist du verloren (80% der Survivor sind bestimmt nicht SWF). Die Entwickler wollen wohl nur noch den Leuten Freude machen, die SWF spielen und den Killern es so einfach wie möglich machen. Mir hat man mit dem letzten Update meine Spielfreude kaputt gemacht. Inständig hoffe ich, dass sich die Schöpfer dieses tollen Spiels noch besinnen. Denke so geht es vielen Survivor....Könnte jetzt noch soviel mehr schreiben, was ich an diesem Spiel mal mochte, aber mein Frustlevel in der aktuellen Situation ist soviel höher.
