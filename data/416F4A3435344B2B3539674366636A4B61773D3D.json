[b]Here are my thoughts for Dead by Daylight.[/b]\n\nNever before have I experienced a game that was so bugged, flawed and badly designed;\nbut yet so thrilling, captivating and mentally challenging at the same time.\n\nSome technical decisions are beyond my sense of logic, \none of them being the choice of letting the game servers run on the killer's machine, \nwhich doesnt just by itself make cheating possible, but also insanely\ndamages the online experience due to lags, disconnects, \nand general dependency to the killer's network stability.\nThis wouldn't display any kind of problem, if this game had a non-ranked game mode,\nbut guess what? \nIt serves exactly one game mode, which tries to be competetive while not matching a single criteria of a modern competetive pvp game.\n\nBut to be honest - I can live with that. \nAs long as you're able to deal with varying amounts of frustration,\nfor example as a result of dropping 2 ranks due to someone else's bugged lobby,\nyou'll be fine. It does not destroy the game itself.\n\nWhat does though, is the sheer existence of bots.\nI'm not talking about a technical protection that should be implemented,\nI'm talking about the sole POSSIBILITY of a rational, non-moving, ability-spamming and perma-hitting killer bot being used.\nIn a PvP Game. A Competetive One.\nRunning a bot makes SENSE and works for BOTH sides, everyone gains bloodpoints by just abusing this game's score mechanic.\nMost bots even go to rank 1, which is the highest ladder rank, after just ONE DAY of running a mouse-clicking macro.\nThis is what the devs should really care about, in my opinion. To try to fix this irrational and pointless mechanic.\nEven if it would require to redesign the entire game in some way, the result would be a lot more satisfying for everyone.\nNo, I don't have a proper idea on how to fix it, at least not in the current state of the game.\n\nEnough rant, now for the positive stuff.\nWhat I like most about this game is the insane amount of mind-gaming, predicting and outsmarting from both sides.\nEven though this game has a binary decision system (as in \"A or B\" instead of \"A-Z\"), atleast in most cases, \nthere's still so much strategic potential to utilize and tactical bandwidth to avail.\n\nAnother REALLY awesome thing is, that the killer, that guy that should slaughter those innocent survivors,\ncan just go out of his way to be a nice guy instead, and help them, whenever he wants.\nThere's also almost no way of communicating, especially not from killer to survivor, \nso a lot of dialogue is just made by simple actions, \nforming a (rather inconsistent) language that is being understood by most players past 30 hours.\n\nThe game needs quite a bunch of dedication to REALLY get into it.\nEven after 40 hours, I wasn't too sure if this game was even worth buying, let alone putting that much time into it.\nBut past that initial horror-feeling, that most players experience, and after getting the twist of juking, predicting,\nand basic (counter-) team play, the game starts to make sense, turns into a really awesome and unique world,\nwhich motivates its players to become better and to start progressing.\nAnd all that stands on the foundation of a special and (mostly) nice community, which, at least from my experience,\ngives the player some kind of familiar athmosphere and is able to reward him with a lot of new people to meet and play with.\n\nAfter my current playtime of 110 hours, my conclusion is that Dead by Daylight most certainly is the best terrible game which I could get my hands on in the past few years.\nBuying this game comes with a lot of risk - but if you got what it takes, it is definitely worth the price.\nI rate [b]3 to 5[/b] out of [b]7 generators[/b], depending on facecamp itensity.","timestamp_created":1481030844,"timestamp_updated":1501524298,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28218750","author":{"steamid":"76561198103110306","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1567105186},"language":"turkish","review":"EFSANEE","timestamp_created":1481029227,"timestamp_updated":1481029227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28218732","author":{"steamid":"76561198260665437","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1725,"last_played":1622055294},"language":"thai","review":"ดีๆๆ ฝึกประสาทสำผัส","timestamp_created":1481029091,"timestamp_updated":1481029091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28218306","author":{"steamid":"76561198040871727","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":15291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3041,"last_played":1645956861},"language":"thai","review":"แก้บัคก่อนไหม","timestamp_created":1481026852,"timestamp_updated":1481026852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504999995231628418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28218149","author":{"steamid":"76561198052804588","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1482472804},"language":"schinese","review":"玩一局我要进入房间失败10多次，谢谢你们给我这么艹蛋的游戏体验","timestamp_created":1481025991,"timestamp_updated":1481025991,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476116091012954712","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28218070","author":{"steamid":"76561198221258432","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5654,"last_played":1546856883},"language":"russian","review":"На старте игра было отличной,но когда они начяли \"балансировать\" игру чтобы маньяки были по сильней они уничтожили игру к Х*ЯМ СОБАЧИМ.

Yesterday I had a DC during a game. Stuff like that happens, I didn't really think about any big consequences. After I started the game again, EVERYTHING was reset. Not just my rank was reset from rank 1 to rank 15. The level of ALL characters was reset to level 1. I literally would have to start over again. 111 hours of playtime wasted because of a simple disconnect. I looked it up in the steam forum trying to fix the issue. Apparently there isn't a fix. \"It's a bug\" they told me! Of the million bugs this game has, this one is by far the worst. Killers get stuck in pallets (uploaded a screenshot of that incidence), invisible objects survivors sometimes run into, bugged items which have to be dropped and picked up again to be able to get used, random game crashes, bugged lobbys etc. The devs are doing nothing about it... They only release new content which leads to new bugs. I was extremely frustrated. I found a way to solve the problem: I replaced my savegame with a savegame of a friend. Yes, that's possible. That means you don't have to play a single hour to get all perks and all characters to lvl 50. I consider that as cheating, but hey! The synchronization with the Steam cloud seems to work differently in this game! The Devs have to do something about it, which they don't.\nUPDATE: Three days ago my whole progress was reset to 0 AGAIN. I had a prestige 3 lvl 50 nurse and a prestige 2 lvl 50 Bill. I am going to request a refund for this game now, because I literally wasted over 500 hours of my life. I just disconnected from a lobby and everything was gone. It's not a new bug btw. It happens a lot, but the Devs don't care. All they do is realeasing new content and creating more and more bugs.

There is a barrier that causes both teams to barely understand one another and thus there is a broken sense of any entertainment that can be made. Most of the time you'll be doing a certain strategy to spite/win, but ultimately it makes one side of the players have less fun. I think you'll find yourself losing interest fast as I did as you play more matches. \n\nReview: Dead by Daylight is a survival 'horror' game that pits 4 survivors into a challenge where they must repair generators to power a pair of gates to escape a Killer. There are various tools, perks, and items that can be found and collected that will aid both sides in this small game of survival.\n\nMy previous review was far too bias in the favor of survivors, never giving a chance to try Killers out. As of now, Dead by Daylight sits at a rough patch that needs work done. Survivors can be highly skilled and have an advantage over the Killers, and unfortunately certain Killers are worse than what is provided (Ex: Freddy Krueger, Doctor, Wraith and sometimes Trapper). The chases between a Survivor and Killer can be best summarized as 'lets run in a circle for about 10 minutes or less'. On paper it sounds good for the kind of game that pits time as a third party opponent, but only leaves the Killer player in a state of frustration when certain mechanics are looked at. A Killer player that isn't skilled will either not catch anyone with the loops or just catch one. That's only part of the problem in terms of balance. Survivors have a situational problem with 'facecampers' as some Killers really prefer to catch a survivor on a sacrificial hook and stand around for days upon days. This leads into the other problem that plagues many games - toxicity. Survivors tend to have the most with crouching constantly (Tea-Bagging) and later complaining about a playstyle. However, certain strategies done on the Killer side can make Survivors lose interest incredibly fast. As someone that has gone to Killer mains more recently, I can say that facecamping sucks, but toxicity makes people leave the game far more often than anything else. If you do encounter this and decide to play the game, it's best if you just ignore it and move on. If you don't want to deal with toxic communities, then avoid this game like the plague as there has been little effort to fix certain mechanics that have caused many players to leave with no interest to return. \n\nOverall, Dead by Daylight will cause a love-hate relationship.

For me at least the worst thing about the game is the community it appears to entice. It's got more trolls in this game than in a child's toy store. I've had so much abuse playing this game and I don't understand who find this kind of behaviour acceptable. If you suffer from any kind of anxiety disorder or depression then this community is enough to make you have an episode - no joke. You will get hate mail, death threats, etc. I highly advise you disable chat for this reason. I consider myself to be a mature player, I'm 31 y/o but most people who play are considerably younger hence it's immaturity the game gets. As a result I have been forced to disable comments on my profile and I hide post-game chat. I even have comments disabled for this review because I know it will be players who already play the game reading this review but then if they were given the chance to reply they would not say anything appropriate. This is how bad the community is and I just don't enjoy being apart of it.  \n\nDLC's - The developers will bring out a DLC which will have 3 new perks for the survivor and 3 new perks for the killer. You buy the DLC for the content and to get the new perks. The developers will either nerf the killer making him/her complete rubbish a few weeks after and 9/10 they will nerf the best survivor perk that people actually want to use. There is an obvious pattern with this repeatedly happening on the survivors side, Freddy being the exception. I believe every DLC that has been released has seen the survivor perks been changed/nerfed. The killer perks hardly ever change. Killers are without question getting the better advantage. The developers are false advertising I feel to make consumers buy the content and then weeks later they change it which personally irritates me to high heaven.\n\nThe Ash DLC being the latest one to date. Ash brings in a decent perk called Mettle of Man - now being nerfed for the next patch because it's considered too strong. Let me tell you when you have a killer continuously tunnelling you in-game you want strong perks like this. The Ash DLC will be the last DLC I purchase personally because the developers need to understand that this is not acceptable to people who pay. The only time I will now own future DLC content is if I somehow win it from streams I watch or buy it with in-game currency. I will no longer use hard earned cash for it. \n\nThere are strong perks for both survivor and killer in game. You can usually predict what perk builds people run because it's usually the same (RUIN, BBQ, NOED, Self Care, DS, Iron Will, Urban Evasion, Balanced Landing) etc... if the developers change any perks they always alter the 'good ones'. The developers need to stay away from the good perks and consider working on the 30 other perks that nobody ever uses because they are complete garbage. It makes no sense to me why they wouldn't do this. \n\nBUGS - There's always bugs in the game. I can tolerate this. I don't know a game that doesn't have a bug to be honest. I have had several friends reportedly getting banned for 'exploiting bugs' when actually they haven't 'exploited' them at all. You should not be allowed to ban your players who support your game for 'exploiting' bugs when YOU are the ones introducing them into the game. They should in fact fix their bugs and then players won't be able to somehow 'exploit' them. This is just something that doesn't make sense to me, again. If they valued their player base at all they should consider this for future purposes. \n\nI'm one of the few that don't have a problem with people disconnecting from a match either - to be honest it happens so often it's actually normal now. I do know the developers will also ban players for disconnecting from matches. Again, I don't agree with this. Players should be able to disconnect from a match if they wish. I know first-hand that some matches can be complete cancer and it's frustrating to stay in the match. If the developers just had a system in place like a DC = 1 kill. It wouldn't affect the killer. It won't be affecting other survivors now because of the end game collapse. You still have the option to escape and the hatch is readily available even if a single gen isn't done. Players don't always DC in game because of how the match is going either. It can be for several reasons. I've had games where the ping looks great in the lobby before the match begins but for whatever reason when the match starts the map has been lagging and it's been unplayable. Why should players potentially be punished for this if they choose to DC? I've also had games, more so lately where I can't do a single skill check on any gens (bug). For whatever reason it just never registered. I wanted to DC but I was concerned about being banned so I didn't. I'm not overly concerned about the banning system because there is a simple way around this if you don't want to be in the match. Find the killer, get hooked and kill yourself first time. You can't be banned for that. There's never going to be a way in which the developers would know if you killed yourself on hook or genuinely killed. There's no 'you must struggle' rule.\n\nOverall - I like the game. I will continue to play the game too. I have certainly got my monies worth from it with the amount of hours I've put into the game. I just don't recommend it for obvious reasons which I mentioned earlier.","timestamp_created":1480978674,"timestamp_updated":1559430321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579288065433502197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28210939","author":{"steamid":"76561198144801383","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":80329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":406,"playtime_at_review":61208,"last_played":1659671289},"language":"english","review":"Why do I torture myself by playing this fucking game.","timestamp_created":1480978481,"timestamp_updated":1635547775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28210855","author":{"steamid":"76561198128830879","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":168865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41396,"last_played":1614899818},"language":"russian","review":"Проведя более 700 часов в Dead by Daylight, могу сказать что игра стоит своих денег.

Dead by Daylight a perfect example of a great idea executed poorly. The idea of having iconic killers like Myers, Leatherface, Freddy and even Pyramid Head from SH isn't seen anywhere else.\n\nThe game's visuals are barely average by today's standards. There have been a few texture updates as of late but so far nothing has changed much. The survivor models are some of the ugliest I've ever seen in any video game. The game goes for this semi-realistic approach but the models are honestly so cartoonish you would think the devs were joking.\n\nThere are also microtransactions, which is honestly not even a surprise anymore since most games have them nowadays. I guess I could commend the devs by not locking the original killers behind a paywall. You can still buy them, but the game gives you the option to grind for currency to get the new characters.\n\nThe community has to be one of the more hostile ones out there. From extremely toxic individuals to well known figures making awful comments on sensitive topics.\n\n\nConversations usually go like this:\n\nKiller: GG guys\n\nSurvivor: F*ck off you tunneling f*g\n\n\nHonestly I feel like this game could be MILES better than what it currently is.

I have to hold back if I'm winning too hard rather than just winning, or I get a free comeback when I don't deserve it. This is fine for a baby who doesn't understand the concept of competition, but I feel like we should give people more credit.\n\n- When you play as killer and understand how to play video games at a basic level, you work up from rank 20 ruining the day of countless people who don't. Like, I'm just smashing people's heads in for way too long, it's not fun for them or for me. Once you get to rank 5, 75% of your games will be against people who solo-queued and kind of understand how to play, and 25% of your games will be against people who all queue together and are on voice together & give you a big lesson on how to play. The game needs to be balanced separately for these two groups rather than lumping everyone together. I can play a bad killer with no perks and still \"win\" based off the developers version of win, until I have no chance and get nobody! The variance of skill is too high. I want to play against the high skilled players all the time so I can get better.\n\n- I think some of the killers are very unique, but a few (new kpop guy) are tired tropes that I've played in every other game already. There could be so much more - kpop guy could use his knife backstory in such a more interesting way rather than just being huntress but fast knives and a useless ultimate ability that is just faster knives.\n\nOverall, I think the game is unique, fun, and has a good monetization setup. The music and sounds are fantastic. The art is fantastic. The killers are spooky. Where the game lacks is in balance, the philosophy of how the game plays out, and the killer's abilities. If these things were fixed, I think DBD would break into the mainstream the same as CoD or League or any other huge game. As it stands, it feels like it's being balanced by an uninvolved wagie who plays 30 minutes every week or two and then tries to even things out. It's good enough for 100-300 hours, it's fun, but it's not a great game, even though the potential is annoyingly staring us in the face.","timestamp_created":1480964131,"timestamp_updated":1617928370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28207541","author":{"steamid":"76561198024123145","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":271574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":900,"playtime_at_review":189652,"last_played":1660606163},"language":"german","review":"Trash!

We have a 100mb connection and the problems are ridiculous. Survivors lagging out before the game starts, me or my mrs lagging out whilst connecting to the lobby, the killer lagging out within the first 10 seconds of a game. Even if no one lags out, the connection is almost always terrible. In 8 hours of playing the game I think we've had 2/3 \"perfect games\" without lag or people disconnecting.\n\nI can look beyond the \"cheap\" tactics that the community uses, I don't care if we win or lose, the atmosphere of the game is superb and being chased by the killer is intense. There's no other game that I can sit playing with my mrs in silence and then shit my pants because she suddenly screams because the killer is chasing her. \n\nThis is honestly one of the best multiplayer games I have played in the genre, if not the best, it reminds me of the old Splinter Cell Double Agent multiplayer years ago (which also suffered exactly the same issues).

друзьями.Но портит игру не баланс и не платные длс(все эти проблемы решаются прямыми руками),а просто большим колличеством багов.Бежишь прыгаешь в окно,тебе прилетает хит,ты в лучшем случае ранен.Или стоишь у доски,маньяк делает хит,ты кидаешь доски,станишь,а хит проходит.И таких подобных ситуация было у меня большое колличество.Как вчера помню,как я орал от смеха,когда маньяк за карту
