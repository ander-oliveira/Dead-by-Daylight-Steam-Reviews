The community is 90% toxic. Every update, more bugs infest this game. Hooks are everywhere and endless. They keep nerfing shit and making others more OP. There is no balance in this game. End-game is poorly executed and if you have a key and use it... the killers complain like little babies. I've been here since the game has been released, been through all the changes but now.... NOW this game is just not fun anymore. The developers dont know what they want in their own game. They listen to their communities (which can be a good thing) but they listen to ONE-SIDED players that only complain and only want to win. The killers just tunnel and camp. Survivors DC the moment anything stupid such as the map they didnt want, get hits once, sees the killer they dont like going against and ect. This game was a treasure but its thrown in lava to never be retrieved ever again. I blame certain \"Toxic\" youtubers for bringing a terrible community to this game. If you want to get this... from the bottom of my heart DONT BUY THIS GAME! The fun is all gone. What a waste of great potential! I try so hard to play this game but after today, HELL NAH!!!

I don't understand how they haven't already added this to the game, it's such a basic feature.\n\nButton mashing really needs to go, too.

  The survivors’ goal is to escape, which can be done in two ways. They can either fix some generators which will power a few gates to open, or they can find a secret hatch and escape that way. Killers are usually faster but they pass slower through obstacles. Each killer has a different mechanic (one can \"cloak\", one can put traps, one can \"teleport\", etc.) and can usually incapacitate a healthy survivor in two strikes. Then they can carry and put them in some sort of meat hooks. Survivors are not completely defenseless but they can't hurt the killer, only stun it.\n\n   Overall I really like the idea and I have a ton of fun with it. The best thing would be to treat it like a casual game and just enjoy it however you see fit. The community might tell you that you're doing it wrong and they can be pretty toxic, but it's partially understandable because you can make the game un-fun for other people. Balance and matchmaking have some pretty big issues. One of these issues is that the players can have different \"level\" upgrades at the beginning of the match. The problem is not that there are different upgrades players can use, this is a good thing, the bad thing is that you'll be matched with people that have all sorts of items/upgrades while others will not. Another issue is that the game has Peer to Peer hosting, where the killer creates the lobby which can lead to a multitude of complications. And the last problem I have with it is that it does a poor job of teaching you how it's played and the wiki is not that brilliant either.\n\n Rating: 4 + 1 = 1\n\n Recommendation: Treat it like a casual game and you can have lots of fun.\n\n*Editors' Pick*\n\nhttp://pixelloot.com","timestamp_created":1482432732,"timestamp_updated":1482432732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536967098712921143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28533351","author":{"steamid":"76561198124885936","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4836,"last_played":1625324072},"language":"russian","review":"Игра у разработчиков получилась очень достойная, как в плане исполнения так и в плане идеи.

Нововведенные маньяки, аля Майкл, эту атмосферу позволяют поддерживать даже для сторожил. \nИз плюсов хотелось бы отметить:\n+ уникальную концепцию;\n+ неплохое техническое исполнение;\n+ атмосферу;\n+ геймплей (скорее и в минус тоже);\n+ разнообразие персонажей, их уникальных особенностей (онли маньяковский плюс).\nКуда же мы без минусов:\n- баги, черт возьми, по началу их было просто тьма;\n- размывающаяся индивидуальность среди выживших (перки этому сопутствуют);\n- новые имба маньяки, особенно, в самый момент выхода DLC (да дайте же мне поныть);\nВот, наверное, и все плюсы/минусы, которые я для себя отметил.\nСмею добавить несколько строк по самим механикам и геймплею, багам:\nDbD - это когда пытаешься найти лобби за маньяка 20 минут.\nDbD - это ливающие с катки выжившие, которые тупо не хотят терять ранг (горите в аду).\nDbD - это когда 20 ранг (новичок именно) играет против обперкованного первого ранга.\nDbD - это когда маньяк не купил себе нормальный интернет, и ты перемешаешься своим выжившим по карте, как чувак из фильма \"Телепорт\".\nDbD - это когда ударяешь топором по сену на карте \"ферма\" и залетаешь на комбайн (вроде пофиксили).\nDbD - это когда Майкл палит тебя своим \"тепловизором\" через пол карты.\nDbD - это когда тебя выкидывает раз 5 подряд при поиске лобби за выжившего.\nСписок можно продолжить еще пунктов на 10-15, но мне лень.\nВ общем и целом, наиграв 50 с лишним часов, подорвав свой пукан раз 50 и сломав новую \"джениус\" мышку, могут сказать, что мне не надоело.
