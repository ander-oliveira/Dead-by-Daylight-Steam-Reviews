У неё всего 3 недостатка:\n1 Графика/требования. Оптимизация тут не к черту. В целом, графен терпимый, но стоит присмотреться... все текстуры - пиксельные, огонь отвратительный, волосы рисовал какой-то наркоман... Но при этом для Ultra/60fps/1080p нужна gtx 1066, не хуже.\n2 Баланс... Больная тема этой игры. Тут можно многое написать, но мне лень. Если кратко, то баланс здесь дерьмовый и некоторые карты нужно фиксить. \n3 Баги. Графические баги, баги с анимацией, баги лвлдизайна, баги физики, баги перков и итемов... Как минимум, в каждом втором матче вы найдете какой-нибудь баг. \n+ традиционно дерьмовое сообщество, при чем не только русское. Ещё тут есть поляки, турки... Как в Cs:go, короче.\nПлюсы описывать не буду, т. к. их тут всего 1: идея игры.\nP.S. 16.09.18. В последние дни багов стало еще больше, теперь за маньяка вообще невозможно поиграть: постоянные вылеты, дисконнекты и прочая фигня.","timestamp_created":1489229818,"timestamp_updated":1537031021,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30444225","author":{"steamid":"76561198348973407","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22131,"last_played":1491038967},"language":"schinese","review":"官方胡乱封号

I enjoyed it enough to buy it for 4 of my friends so we could all play together. The idea is unique and interesting, and the gameplay was a lot of fun. However, as time went on it was all downhill from there. After getting past the part of being a newbie and having absolutely no idea what was going on, and once I began to learn how the game worked and climbed through the ranks, the glaring balance issues became more and more obvious. And as time went on, the bugs became more and more problematic.\n\nFirst things first, the biggest reason why I'm not playing much anymore. It takes hours to find a game, there's 7,000+ people online right now but it just took me 2 hours to get into a game. A game which usually lasts less then 30 minutes (assuming it doesn't end early due to disconnects). That's absurd. I noticed this new update, and some balancing changes recently and I wanted to come back and try them out. But I don't have that kind of time to spend just waiting in a lobby.\n\nThe gameplay itself. In the early levels where nobody has perks (or at least no major ones), the game is a lot of fun. The game stops being fun when you start leveling up and getting perks. And don't get me wrong, the idea of perks is good, the actual perks they added are not. And not all the perks ruin it, just the ones that are overpowered but those ones tend to be present in every single game at higher levels. There are overpowered perks and strategies on both the survivor and killer's sides.\n\nThe biggest problem with the perks and strategies is that the developers do not seem to understand the concept of counterplay, which is absolutely essential to make anything balanced and fun. Taking the Decisive strike perk for example, one that is considered an overpowered survivor perk. When the killer catches you you get a skillcheck, it's an easy to hit skill check that if you hit it, automatically stuns the killer and allows you to escape. The killer has no way of knowing if you have this, and there's absolutely nothing they can do to stop you. It's basically just a secret \"get out of jail free\" card for when you screw up. This kind of gameplay is NOT fun for the survivors or the killer. Then the developer's idea of \"fixing\" this ability, is making it so you have to wait a few seconds before using it. What difference does that really make? It's still a get out of jail free card that has no counterplay unless you happen to be dumb enough to go down right next to a hook.\n\nOn the killer's side, there's hook camping. Once a survivor is caught and placed on a hook the killer can just stand right next to it to prevent other survivors from saving the hooked survivor. There's absolutely nothing the survivors can do if the killer does this, that player's just dead. Which also isn't fun for either side. I, so far, have seen nothing done to prevent or discourage killers from doing this. And as someone who has done game design as a hobby (Not professionally), this would be so easy to fix, there's no excuse for it still being a problem.\n\nAnd those are just two examples, there's others. When they fix the matchmaking to not take so long, fix the balancing issues, and fix the general lack of counterplay, I'll gladly give this a positive review.

And the review section as of recently reflects the same things I'm saying, it's full of people like me who really think this game has what it takes to be an amazing game, but are frustrated with the rediculously long wait times, the lack of balance, and the constant bugs/glitches/disconnects.","timestamp_created":1489190954,"timestamp_updated":1489190954,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30435892","author":{"steamid":"76561198317255265","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":839,"playtime_at_review":1685,"last_played":1660228773},"language":"english","review":"挺好玩的一款游戏，但是模式有点单一，玩来玩去几乎都是一个套路。","timestamp_created":1489190911,"timestamp_updated":1489190911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30435891","author":{"steamid":"76561198355453247","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6015,"last_played":1518568375},"language":"schinese","review":"玩这个游戏屠夫或者人不能强，要不就被封，像我这么牛的护士","timestamp_created":1489190905,"timestamp_updated":1489190905,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433355212211608887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30435890","author":{"steamid":"76561198004253876","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":298802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172285,"last_played":1588967415},"language":"russian","review":"Игра , в которой  на 20ом ранге s0сут сурвы,  а на 1ом ранге s0сет маньяк ,если только это не скилловая медсестра.\nРусское комьюнити супер toxic, чат в игре слезит глаза после каждой катки.Также они слезятся, если открыт профиль и стенка в нем.\nРекомендую?

If you try to explain your point of view about the game, you will be trolled and blasted.

The killers get the short end, while almost every asttempt at making the survivors better is addressed. I'm sure the game will be just as fun for the survivors when all the killers are gone  :)\n\nMaking the killer host the game is probably the most retarded thing i have ever seen.

How do you add new things in and stuff not related to the thing be broke, let alone the fact the TEAM does not give any fs about their fan base at all, they are good at using their dedicated players as cows, just to milk them out of their money for poorly made cosmetics, that anyone could make in a few days top.\n\nI've been giving them the benefit of a doubt that it's hard, I get that. But this game hasn't changed THAT much for the years it's been out, I've been through nearly all their updates. (Started a week after it was launched), the only things they have changed, is balancing issues which were obvious from the start, like what the hell were you guys thinking back in 2016, to have insta gen addon for toolboxes? And Self-Care being so god damn strong let alone stack with other perks back then.\n\nAnd lets talk about the community, by far the most brain-dead gaming community I have ever met, no one seems to have brains when it comes to solo queue, like for new players, that's okay. You're learning. What I mean is people with lengthy hours 50+, not knowing how to play Survivor properly, like you're playing the most easiest role in the game, and you have difficulties repairing generators let alone LOOP a killer for more than 5 seconds.\n\nIf survivors had brains, the game would be ultimately favouring the survivor, but because survivors are so damn stupid, the DBD TEAM, will always buff them to make it fair for brain-dead survivors to have a chance of escaping.\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? Honestly it's a mix, if you're on your own definitely not, unless you can handle losing 24/7 because of your team instead of yourself.\n\nBut with friends?

Warum?\nGanz einfach:\n\n1. Bugs: Dieses Spiel ist mit Bugs überladen. Statt die volle Energie darauf zu verwenden diese zu fixen, werden immer neue kostenpflichtige DLCs veröffentlicht. M.M.n. ein absolutes No-Go.\n\n2. Matchmaking Suche: Man tritt mit Freunden einer Lobby bei und startet die Suche. In 8/10 Fällen findet man dann zunächst ewig kein Spiel und wenn doch, bricht der Killer ab und man wird aus der Lobby geworfen. Statt dass man nun wieder mit seinen Freunden in eine Lobby kommt, landen alle wieder im Hauptmenü. Nervig ist da noch eine harmlose Beschreibung für diesen Vorgang.\n\n3. Ranking-System: Man kann durch gewinnen von Spielen im Rang aufsteigen. Allerdings nur, wenn man genug Punkte gesammelt hat. Ein einfaches Gewinnen reicht nicht aus. Immerhin: Man kann nicht absteigen, wenn man gewinnt. Aber damit nicht genug. Der Rang fließt scheinbar in keiner Weise in die Suche ein. Level 20 (der niedrigste Rang) Überlebende werden mit Rang 1 Killern gematcht und andersherum. Für mich erübrigt sich das Ranking-System dadurch völlig.\n\n4. P2P: Das Spiel basiert auf Peer to Peer und der Killer ist immer der Host. Sprich wenn der Killer eine schlechte Internetverbindung hat ist das Spielerlebnis gelinde gesagt grauenhaft. Klar kosten Server eine Menge Geld, aber wäre es nicht machbar gewesen, immer den Spieler mit der besten Verbindung als Host einzusetzen?\n\nWenn man alles zusammen nimmt, ist das Spielerlebnis bestenfalls mittelmäßig und es ist schnell frustrierend. Man bekommt das Gefühl der Entwickler ist mehr auf Geld, als ein spielbares Spiel aus, was ebenfalls einen bitteren Nachgeschmack hinterlässt.\n\nIch hoffe man versteh meine Beweggründe und ich konnte vielleicht bei der Entscheidung helfen, ob einem dieses Spiel 20 Euro (nur das Grundspiel) wert ist.","timestamp_created":1489169038,"timestamp_updated":1489169038,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498950034379959106","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30430423","author":{"steamid":"76561198335544612","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7617,"last_played":1555263720},"language":"german","review":"Kann seit mehr als einem Monat das Spiel nicht mehr Starten.
