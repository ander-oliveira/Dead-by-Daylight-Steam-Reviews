edit midway down **\n\n\nthe positives:\n\ni love the premise, its gritty, scary and intense. when the killer stalks you, when you hear the bell of the wraith, the increasing heartbeat when the killer is close, the hillbillys chainsaw revving. the feeling is intense and darn fun.\n\nthe feeling when you need to work together to succeed, one maybe have to lure the killer away so the others can save a hooked teammate or repair a generator. \n\ni tend to meet alot of friendly survivors, who will heal, unhook, repair generators together. i havent met those super salty players, ofcause my rank aint that high at all. but people ive played with tend to be friendly.\n\ni feel the progression is smooth, eventhough ive lost alot, i still get good points for the progression segment.\n\n\nedit 08/03/2017:\n\nmy review has shifted from a neutral to a negative\nreason is that the community is really toxic, and theres a constant survivors vs. killers war running, and its pretty ugly.\n\neven more, the level of attention devs give survivors over killers is ludicrous. \nit has turned into a survivors get alot of attention, getting counters and buffs, while killers are left with more and more tools nerfed or removed.\n\nplus as a killer, you will have to listen to some rather unpleasant remarks post game in chat, luckily you can turn this on. but you will often be called a noob or to go kill yourself, if you killed one or more. and if you didnt, you will be called the worst killer ever.\ntheres alot of salt, and badmanners. on both sides. \nso dont read this as a killers are innocent, theres some very griefing killers out there.\n\nand this has also resulted in queue times for matches to be horrendeously long, and the fact that theres still matchmaking issues doesnt help. but alot have turned away from killer. its not uncommon to wait 20min+ for a match, that ends in 5 mins, then back to waiting over 20mins again. unless, ofcause you play alone, then its instant, but many of us feels its more fun to play with a friend.\nbut even playing alone, the matchmaking can suck, like you being rank 20 and be matched up against rank 1.\n\ntheres currently a motion for a strike from killers comming on the 13th of march, to raise awareness to this problem. cause eventhough many read killers complaints as \"whiney and childish tantrums\" that they throw hissy fits over nothing. the point is not that they want to win non stop, but to have equality in the attention department.\n\ntheres still alot of bugs, after they shifted to unreal engine 4, theres been sound issues, where players couldnt hear key sounds (groans in pain from survivors, heavy breathing from killers)\nscratchmarks from survivors who sprint, doesnt show correctly and such.\n\nthe majority loves the premise of this game, but as of now the community and the way one side gets all the attention and the other gets nothing. has made this game very frustrating and fallen far from what many believed was promised.\n\nif you should decide to see for yourself, and try this game. do yourself a favour and keep away from the forums, you will be very depressed. its 95-99% negative flaming. the positive threads drown and are forgotten.\n\nas it stands now this games name \"Dead by Daylight\" is beginning to shift over to \"Farm till Daylight\" cause thats all that seems to matter, the

Ein tolles Format und Spaß sowie Suchtpotenzial. Ich habe schon über 120 Spielstunden und ich kann DBD für sich alleine stehend nur weiter empfehlen. Und nun kommt das ABER:\n\nWas ist das für eine beschissene Community da?! Camper, Cheater, Egoisten und Ragequitter so weit das Auge reicht. Es wird immer schlimmer da! Das kann doch nicht an gehen, da wird man ja wahnsinnig und verliert die lust am Game. Ich bin nur noch dabei irgendwelche Lackaffen zu melden weil keiner mehr Sozial spielt. Wenn man zu doof ist dann wird geragequittet, damit man es noch leichter als eh schon hat wird als Killer gecampt, Leute interessieren sich nur noch für sich weil der Killer ja sowieso Campt, Cheater freuen sich nen Ast haben 100 mal das gleiche Perk und auf einmal läuft die Scheiß Witch mit ner Kettensäge rum und One-hitted jeden, in der Lobby sind sie zu Doof um rdy zu drücken oder warten so lange bis sie kurz vor Spielstart abhauen und du auf einmal nur noch zu 3 oder zu 2 unterwegs bist, Perks die man sich erarbeitet hat funktionieren einfach mal kaum noch. Wozu macht man die dann lvl 3 wenn es eh nichts bringt und die entweder runter gepatcht wurden oder die Killer Op sind? Du kannst nicht mal mehr entkommen, wozu dann überhaupt solche Perks oder diese dämlichen Fluchtversuche vom Hacken. Bringt doch eh nichts mehr. Schwachsinn ist das. Diese ****** versauen das ganze Spiel und es wird nichts unternommen. Stattdessen wird es den Killern zb noch einfacher gemacht. Du bist eigendlich nur noch genervt und hast keine Lust mehr.  Mehr fällt mir zu diesem Haufen Müll auch nicht mehr ein bzw mehr möchte ich dazu nicht sagen. Einfach nur Asozial!!!\n\nWenn diese ganzen K***bratzen nicht wären dann wäre DBD einfach nur großartig, und es tut mir in der Seele weh aber wegen ''euch'' P***kindern muss ich dem Spiel ne scheiß Bewertung geben.
