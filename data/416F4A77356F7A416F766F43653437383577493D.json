When playing survivor, you can either be in 2 gameplay factors, doing skill checks on gens or wasting the killers time by looping so your teammates can complete the objective. As the killer, your experience always depends on the type of survivors your get. If they're bad, you might find killer a relaxing time. If the survivors are good, then you might define killer as \"mind-games, the game\" (same thing goes for when you're a survivor and you're playing against a good killer). Like tf2, the game has a steep learning curve (not as steep as tf2). However, like tf2 the tutorial barley teaches you how to play the game, and I feel like that sucks for newer players. It doesn't teach you about the killer abilities, it doesn't teach you how to loop, it just, a terrible way of teaching.","timestamp_created":1624679120,"timestamp_updated":1637358013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94382243","author":{"steamid":"76561198435449405","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31889,"last_played":1654327034},"language":"english","review":"im slowly losing my sanity","timestamp_created":1624678992,"timestamp_updated":1624678992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94382129","author":{"steamid":"76561199027855077","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":8321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1655594640},"language":"english","review":"amazing game","timestamp_created":1624678852,"timestamp_updated":1624678852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94382091","author":{"steamid":"76561198918525536","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1657420648},"language":"brazilian","review":"Topzera da bahia","timestamp_created":1624678811,"timestamp_updated":1624678811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94381892","author":{"steamid":"76561198417669280","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7062,"last_played":1640410052},"language":"english","review":"great game, even better with friends\n","timestamp_created":1624678557,"timestamp_updated":1624678557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94381881","author":{"steamid":"76561198329855458","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4194,"last_played":1656641359},"language":"english","review":"very nice","timestamp_created":1624678544,"timestamp_updated":1624753994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94381716","author":{"steamid":"76561198830197328","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4933,"last_played":1652300987},"language":"english","review":"It's a good challenge.","timestamp_created":1624678325,"timestamp_updated":1624678325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94381537","author":{"steamid":"76561198378787547","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1673,"last_played":1657960249},"language":"english","review":"face camping poop heads","timestamp_created":1624678075,"timestamp_updated":1624678075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94381482","author":{"steamid":"76561199003800852","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4887,"last_played":1658638774},"language":"brazilian","review":"mt bom","timestamp_created":1624678021,"timestamp_updated":1624678021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94381187","author":{"steamid":"76561198836897938","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1254,"last_played":1652394434},"language":"english","review":"I enjoy murdering my friends.
