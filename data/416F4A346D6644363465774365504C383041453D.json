This is an important aspect especially for a horribly unbalanced asymmetric game, and it is also where Dead By Daylight fails. The majority of perks, especially for killers, are just unviable and you have very limited chance of beating anyone without using incredibly cheesy tactics because the other players definitely are using these tactics. \n\nPlayers exploit poorly thought out and implemented mechanics constantly to deny the game any chance to evoke emotions associated with horror games. You either win and feel proud that you beat the other player(s), or you lose and feel sad and or mad because the other team will take the piss. There is no tension or fear that you'll be found by the killer, there is no joy to spotting a survivor who you'll then spend the next several minutes chasing. \n\nSome mechanics are simply broken and don't seem like they will ever be fixed. Sabotaging was a mechanic that allowed you to stop the killer from sacrificing people, which was incredibly unbalanced so it was nerfed and sabotaging was no longer permanent, but then sabotaging became absolutely useless, and instead of removing it from the game or further altering it it is buried under new perks and characters.\n\nLastly, the playerbase. Online multiplayer games usually harbour a toxic community, and Dead by Daylight is no exception to the rule. The game is filled with constant mockery of lesser skilled players and trash talking about people who play for 'the other side'.\n\nI would not recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1566803415,"timestamp_updated":1566803415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517453551292419434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54809061","author":{"steamid":"76561198108033482","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":14793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9409,"last_played":1653364904},"language":"english","review":"“I think we did a pretty good job”.     \n\nThe game has some funny glitches and this quotes tops it off.

Hra je něco na styl zabíjení a přežití. Hrajete 4 přeživší proti 1 Killerovi. Máte na výběr z různých přeživších a Killerů. Úkol za přeživšího je opravit 5 generátorů, otevřít bránu a utéct. Je ještě alternativa pro hráče s klíčem na poklop nebo poslední hráč má šanci utéct poklopem. Killer ho však může zavřít. Moje plusy jsou že se mi líbí množství perků které si můžete vybrat jak na Killera tak na přeživšího. Pak jsou různé předměty jako je lékárnička, toolbox na opravování generátorů a můžete si k tomu přidat i doplňky zvané addony které třeba zrychlí více opravu, léčení atd... Každý Killer má jinou schopnost. Moje mínusy: musíte za Killery platit některé a 5 jich je zadarmo a nebo si některé koupit za 9000 shardů ve hře ale některé musíte opravdu za peníze, to platí i u přeživších. Když vyhledáváte match za Killera trvá to 100 let. Freddyho Kruegra dream snares jsou totálně k ničemu (jediný užitek z nich je ten že to píská když do nich někdo stoupne a dělá to vtipný zvuk...) Pouze fakové palety jsou k něčemu u něj. A co mě fakt nasralo u téhle hry je to že aby vydali update na opravy bugů tak radši vydají nové skiny, Killery nebo přeživší.

Multiple killers can be seen as overpowered, making them used in almost every game. The concept is nice. Fix five generators and keep your friends alive, or if you're the killer, kill everyone before they finish all the generators and power up the exit gates. But, the developers do a poor job of fixing certain issues, making the user more likely to become angry and frustrated. That being said, there are also positive aspects, like when a survivor group is matched up against a killer than is about equal to their skill level and isn't running double pink add-ons. You can enjoy the game solo or with some friends. This game is not noob-friendly, and will be very difficult to understand in your first game or two. It usually takes past the two hour refund period until you finally learn how the game works.\n\nThe game does not have any sort of \"casual\" matchmaking, it only has ranked matchmaking. There are 20 ranks, 20 being the worst, and 1 being the best. Every four ranks you will hit an interval and your icon will change color. As you rank up, the game doesn't become more competitive, it becomes annoying. Killers will be seen using strageties that can be seen as toxic or unfair to the survivors, such as using the killer \"The Cannibal\" and camping a hook that a survivor is on. You can argue that you can just leave the survivor on the hook and go finish generators, which is ideally what you should do. The problem is for the survivor that is on the hook. They no longer get to play the game because the killer is not giving the survivor a chance to escape, and the game will punish that survivor while the killer remains unscathed. There is also an issue where if you are a survivor and are being chased by the killer, you can run around for 4 generators and get what should have been 16k bloodpoints, (the game caps it at 8k per category. Max: 32k total) get hooked and die because the killer camped you, but because of that, every other survivor escapes. \"Wow! You won them the game! Looks like you'll be getting a pip (token to rank up) because of your efforts. Let's check...Wait, you de-pipped? What!?\" The game will not give you a pip because you didn't help with generators or contribute to keeping other survivors alive. Or so, that's what the game says. Every other survivor will walk away with 20k+ bloodpoints while you get a solid 9k because you weren't \"a team player.\" This issue alone makes the game very frustrating. For this reason, I do not recommend this game.

I want to like it. Hell, I've got almost 100 hours in. I DID enjoy it. But I just can't any more. The community is highly toxic - expect someone to do something rude or toxic in every match.\n\nHow is this possible, you ask?\n\nThe game employs a ranking system. The bottom rank is rank 20. New player. The top rank is 1. Makes sense, right? A game with a ranking system, then, should be expected to have players of similar skill levels and abilities playing against each other. Good players play against other good players. Experienced players should be higher ranks.\n\nExcept it's incredibly easy to circumvent the system. It's a known problem of high-ranking players de-ranking on purpose to troll or abuse newer players. \n\nIt's even easier to just group up with your high-ranking friend and play against players who are similar in rank to the lowest rank person, not the highest rank. This would be like having an NFL team recruiting a high school kid, and then playing against high schools because the least experienced person on their team is in high school.\n\nOverall, I want to recommend the game. I do. I really enjoyed it. But after all the chat abuse, stupid tea-bagging (and other behaviors in game meant to belittle you,) and people who shouldn't be playing against new players, I'm done. I'm not playing anymore, and I regret spending money on this game. \n\nIf you like to be made to feel stupid and helpless by people who are far superior to you in ability and game knowledge, play Dead by Daylight. \n\nIf you prefer to actually enjoy a competitive game, I suggest you look elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1566689612,"timestamp_updated":1566689612,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":298,"votes_funny":69,"weighted_vote_score":"0.766707122325897217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54788219","author":{"steamid":"76561198828256705","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":103880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":132,"playtime_at_review":18363,"last_played":1660593329},"language":"brazilian","review":"Perfeito.","timestamp_created":1566684007,"timestamp_updated":1566684007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54788178","author":{"steamid":"76561198136512363","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1566677329},"language":"english","review":"Seems boring :)","timestamp_created":1566683828,"timestamp_updated":1566683828,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54787482","author":{"steamid":"76561198406727976","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2908,"last_played":1656378983},"language":"english","review":"IT IS AMAZING.

Por no hablar de que las mecánicas de ciertos asesinos incitan al campeo y al tuneleo constante, y siendo un juego su finalidad es entretener, pero es difícil si te encuentras con toda clase de cosas que evita que puedas jugar con normalidad, porque que te maten no es el problema, ni que no se consigan puntos por haber jugado mal, el problema es que constantemente dan beneficios a los asesinos, pero no fomentan que jueguen limpio, y eso lleva a que pases por la partida sin haber podido hacer nada, perder rango y conseguir una miseria de puntos. Que no quieren que se vacile a los asesinos o que quieren evitar el \"gen-rush\", pues que introduzcan nuevas mecánicas (Ejemplo: Activar más generadores o tener otros objetivos con mecánicas diferentes que alarguen el juego). Es frustrante jugar partida tras partida con asesinos así, independientemente de si se está en rango 20 o en el 7, te lo encuentras casi todos los días, en casi cualquier partida. \n\n¿De que sirve reportar a jugadores que hacen trampas o juegan sucio impidiendo jugar al resto? De absolutamente nada, pueden seguir haciendolo, salvo si sale en Youtube o Twich, que con el material visual sí prestan atención, pero los mensajes diarios de personas que quieren divertirse y no les dejan... NADA.\n\nLuego, los BUGS y fallos varios, son tantos que no se podrían enumerar todos, pero como ejemplo: Que si el sistema tiene fallos cada dos por tres y no puntuas rituales o te desaparecen, que el sistema de rankeo es de chiste, unas veces da unos puntos u otros (haces mala partida y pipeas, o haces buena y bajas pepita en el ranking), que si los supervivientes están a merced del asesino y su conexión, de hecho pueden activar LAG simplemente abriendo navegador con unas cuantas páginas en el buscador, probocando que no se pueda lupear o saltar ventanas con seguridad o que tu personaje no se teletransporte a otro lado más próximo al asesino... QUE TIENE 3 AÑOS O MÁS FUERA DE EARLY ACCESS Y NO TIENE SERVIDORES PROPIOS. En fin...

If you care about your rank then play a game where you need skills.\n","timestamp_created":1566671570,"timestamp_updated":1566671570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54785632","author":{"steamid":"76561198356909101","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":41838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19008,"last_played":1659049849},"language":"japanese","review":"少ない人数で協力して戦うゲームなのに、プレイヤーの切断にデメリットが少ない。\nキラー側は一人で戦わなければならないのにサバイバー側と違ってミスが許されない調整内容になってる。\nVCPTとの対戦はキラー側が情報共有できる仲間がいないため、非常に不利でバランスが悪い。\nプレイヤー人口が少ないため、スキルレートが実装されてもマッチングするプレイヤーの実力差が大きく、拮抗した勝負が味わえない。\n試合開始時のロードが異様に長い等のバグが多くあり、製品版とは言えない状態。","timestamp_created":1566671041,"timestamp_updated":1635261124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462863296270370483","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54785596","author":{"steamid":"76561198096710440","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":301142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1915,"playtime_at_review":141233,"last_played":1660549677},"language":"tchinese","review":"所以說你把這遊戲變成只要修機的遊戲 隊友甚麼都不會幹很好玩嗎 救人不會 溜鬼不會 有些連QTE都不會按點著修這樣子有趣嗎 然後那個伺服器在亞洲區根本跟狗屎一樣人類先中刀然後才翻版他沒事???","timestamp_created":1566670899,"timestamp_updated":1633398208,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504711687564849854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54785504","author":{"steamid":"76561198261569770","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1605698473},"language":"russian","review":"Игра в целом хороша, купила что бы бегать за маньяка, а мне тупо не находят пати, какого фига спрашивается, уже и регион меняли, разрабы, ау, исправляйте","timestamp_created":1566670473,"timestamp_updated":1566670473,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54784873","author":{"steamid":"76561198440113209","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":31962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8277,"last_played":1659028063},"language":"tchinese","review":"开心 这游戏终于跟怪奇物语合作了 期待！","timestamp_created":1566667682,"timestamp_updated":1566667682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54784822","author":{"steamid":"76561198043966898","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":41253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36524,"last_played":1656921813},"language":"english","review":"I like pain and suffering.","timestamp_created":1566667419,"timestamp_updated":1566667419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512820541858673096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54784621","author":{"steamid":"76561198871497973","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1656339844},"language":"finnish","review":"5/5","timestamp_created":1566666493,"timestamp_updated":1566666493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54784590","author":{"steamid":"76561198295322917","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":389992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":953,"playtime_at_review":214248,"last_played":1660468550},"language":"english","review":"Bug by Daylight is nearlier for this game.

Probably still my favourite game, however, i have three problems that needed to be addresses or else ill find myself playing less and less each time. problem one, when a survivor is leaping from something they cannot directly run straight afterwards and this is and inconvenience when trying to evade the killer because i found that the killer is still able to take a jab at you. problem two, the killers freddy kruger and the pig are way too over powered which often leads to the killers becoming toxic and creating an unfair game experience that isnt fun. problem three is again killers becoming toxic and camping the hook to get a kill there needs to be a sortting system so that the good fair players are grouped with each other. the game is extremely fun and enjoyable game if you end up in a lobby with players who dont exploit or troll.

Not only can you play with classic horror film characters, there are also original, very well designed, killers and survivors.\nThis is a game that will make your heart race and your adrenaline pump. One of the most interesting aspects is that, due to the scoring and ranking system, winning becomes a more relative thing. Quite frequently you will see killers who did not kill/sacrifice everyone or survivors who did not escape scoring more points and ranking faster than people who seemed to accomplish all the goals in the trial. That is because they had a larger participation in the match, making the experience more intense and interesting. This whole system pushes players to do more, and not use boring camping or sit-still-and-wait tactics. Of course you will find people doing this, but hey, each one is responsible for their own fun. Proactivity is highly reward in Dead by Daylight, objectively with points, and subjectively with a more intense experience.\nYou are sure to find people complaining that the game is unbalanced, that either survivors or killers are overpowered and so on. Trust me, that is just their lack of maturity to deal with the frustration of being outplayed. This is, above all, a mindgame... game. Predicting your opponent and tricking them into thinking you will do something are key to winning, especially at higher ranks. Few games provided me with the satisfaction DbD did when my tactics worked out, either when I was attempting to make the killer waste his time or break a survivor's loop - because I know I am not exploiting a flaw in a bot, but outsmarting another person (and that feels gooood).\nIf evidence of the game's potential is what you seek, the fact that a relatively old game is still played by a lot a people, still launches new content and is covered by many streamers, should provide you with some.","timestamp_created":1566661455,"timestamp_updated":1566661455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54783240","author":{"steamid":"76561198847649624","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1647186015},"language":"koreana","review":"뉴비들이라면 절대 사지마세요 뉴비를 위한 배려가 하나도 없습니다\n튜토리얼부터 매우 불친절하고 돈이 아깝네요\n돈 다시내놔 시발련들아","timestamp_created":1566661227,"timestamp_updated":1566661227,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54783239","author":{"steamid":"76561198130759559","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":9032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7373,"last_played":1582121769},"language":"koreana","review":"다 괜찮은데 정말 퍽 없는 뉴비는 퍽없는 살인마랑 만나게 해줘야 할듯","timestamp_created":1566661223,"timestamp_updated":1577454156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.442557007074356079","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54783221","author":{"steamid":"76561198856007131","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4030,"last_played":1625426883},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра!","timestamp_created":1566661149,"timestamp_updated":1566661149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54783118","author":{"steamid":"76561198795532917","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1577508193},"language":"koreana","review":"뭔가 개 같으면서도 스릴넘처 재미있는깸","timestamp_created":1566660705,"timestamp_updated":1566660705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54782843","author":{"steamid":"76561198951089486","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1492,"last_played":1627941439},"language":"english","review":"Is good innit.","timestamp_created":1566659545,"timestamp_updated":1566659545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54782388","author":{"steamid":"76561198152985912","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":21373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15850,"last_played":1653728139},"language":"italian","review":"This was a good game years ago now it takes up to 20/30 minutes to find a lobby.
