It's apparent to me that the developers, trust and safety team, community monitors, and all that are contributing to this game, care about the game's development and those who are passionate about the game, the players. As someone who has purchased this game at its release date here on, Steam. Someone who continues to be a heavy advocate for oncoming news about the game, nothing objectively disappoints, regarding the updates. The atmosphere and cinematic pleasure is outstanding for every map. The movement is fluent and enjoyable on both sides. The animations get better and improve in complexity. The perk system is unique and consistent. This game has made a lot of warm memories for me to cherish. I've met long time friends through this game. \n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]  The game has a HUGE hit-box issue, ever since the game has been released. This issue effects both sides, the Survivors, and the Killers. The believed reason for this is, the game seems to be using basic hit-boxes instead of animated hit-boxes for vaulting pallets and windows. For those who don't understand the difference, I'll explain. \"Basic hit-box\", will play the animation where the avatar is located, so your hit-box will be on the window or pallet until the animation is done. While an, \"Animated Hit-box\", will move the hit-box as the avatar moves. Why haven't they switched over to animated hit-boxes? I'll never know, maybe it's more of a complicated transfer then I realize. Back in 2017, there was an exploit where your save file would be deleted. This could sometimes be caused if you played Dead By Daylight when Steam would do their weekly server resets. Thankfully, this does not occur anymore. \n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts?:[/h1]   I've had my fair share of aggression regarding this game, I will not lie. So much so that I've developed a love/hate relationship with this game. But the developers have their heart in the right place with this game and what they've made and are continuing to make is truly beautiful. That means a lot to me as a constant consumer of video games and virtual entertainment. A constant redundant phrase, but it's true. Video games are by no-means perfect in every category. This game is, by all means, no exception. But there are some talented individuals trying their best to encompass us in this virtual world they've created. That goes for most ambitious video game creators. If you can make me come back to your game year, after year. You're doing something right.

antes que nada hola ahora si voy a dar mi reseña.\n\npuntos a favor del juego:\ntiene lugares para lopear desde lugares infinitos hasta lugares donde no se puede lopear dependiendo el mapa xD.\ntiene una buena cantidad de killers y survis. tambien tiene mapas,accesorios, habilidades tanto de ambos bandos de killer y survi etc\ntiene partidas con amigos tanto privadas como publicas\ntiene eventos cada cierto tiempo.\ntiene pase+desafios que te hacen viciar mas al juego y te dan puntos etc\ny te da horas de diversion para rato pagando o sin pagar los dlc etc.\n\npuntos negativos:\ntiene bugs y cada vez que arreglan 1 vienen 10 nuevos bugs\ntiene una comunidad 50 y 50 tanto buena como nefasta por los killers tuneleros,camperos,slugeros etc. que arruinan bastante la experiencia del juego.\nmi recomendacion para jugar mejor y divertirte es hacerlo con amigos por que siempre tocan randoms trolean,toxiquean,se van y te dejan tirado. por ultimo a veces los survis o killers putean mucho en el canal de texto cuando termina la partida mi recomendacion es ignorar a los killer y survis o sino desactivar el canal de texto y tendras mejor experiencia seria jugar y irte y no comerte insultos etc.\n\nespero que les haya servido mi reseña muchas gracias por leer.

always seem to fall back to this game when I'm bored and feel like playing something.  I enjoy the game, and I've been playing for about three years now.  I don't really like the direction BHVR is going with rift passes and how they handle PTB feedback, but I still find myself playing regardless.\n\nSince the release of the Twins killer, there have been quite a few bugs introduced into the game that have negatively impacted my gameplay.  The 4.5 Mid-chapter update in which the HUD was reworked also brought just as many new bugs into the mix.  The game is still enjoyable, but these last two updates definitely went in the wrong direction.  Multiplayer connectivity (latency) issues have increased significantly, and I experience issues nearly every match where the killer hits me from MUCH further away than before the 4.5 patch.\n\nI probably would not recommend this game if you play solo, but with a group of up to four friends, you can have a good bit of fun.  Also, you should be aware that the learning curve is a bit steep (~10-20 hours before you're proficient) and matchmaking continues to pit rank #1-4 killers against #16-20 survivors and vice versa.","timestamp_created":1606358967,"timestamp_updated":1613933649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80086648","author":{"steamid":"76561198077831189","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":95732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1080,"playtime_at_review":42239,"last_played":1660523561},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego entretenido y con una dinamica original que a veces se torna divertido y otras veces frustrante y desesperante dependiendo de cantidad de toxicidad que traigas contigo ese día , amen. u.u","timestamp_created":1606358876,"timestamp_updated":1637811969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80086255","author":{"steamid":"76561197998958976","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":8482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7019,"last_played":1640931352},"language":"english","review":"Even after all this time, the devs still work hard on this game.

honestly a fine game with its fair share of flaws. I think it's really hard to get into when you're brand new to the game since you have to unlock the perk slots needed to actually make a solid perk build for a character. I personally think the game's easy to grasp yet hard to master. People with 500+ hours in this game always have something new to learn, especially with each DLC they release every so often.\n\nThere's 7 generators on the map at the start of the match. 4 survivors work together to try getting 5 of them done, opening one of the 2 exit gates, and escaping. The killer's job is to essentially do everything in their power to keep you and your teammates from doing just that; Surviving.\n\nOf course the game has its flaws, (The insane hitboxes, multiple smurfs, toxic community, \"Meta\" builds, Awful killer auto aim, a large number of perks having little to no real use in a match, etc.) but nothing's more euphoric than outsmarting a skilled killer or full queue Survive With Friends.\n\nFor 20 bucks, it really is quite a nice game. The devs have currently been working toward making the game better with each patch and update. It also goes on sale often, so you might be able to snag it for like 15-8 bucks? \n\nIf you're gonna get it, harass and bully your friends into getting it too. Playing survivor with 3 other buddies is leagues more fun than soloing in my opinion.\n\nOh yeah, the Ash Vs Evil Dead DLC is dope as hell.","timestamp_created":1606355897,"timestamp_updated":1613425747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512437820434570313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80072124","author":{"steamid":"76561198412619426","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":59940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23894,"last_played":1658657630},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1606355865,"timestamp_updated":1606355865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492788463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80072105","author":{"steamid":"76561199078386225","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":136,"playtime_at_review":6658,"last_played":1660452114},"language":"english","review":"I've never loved a game more.
