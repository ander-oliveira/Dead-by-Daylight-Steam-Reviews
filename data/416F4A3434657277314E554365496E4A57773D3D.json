If they fix the matchmaking and add in-game communication between survivors, I will change my review.\n\nEdit to add: weeks later and my negative recommendation still stands.  The matchmaking is horrible (it takes several minutes just to find a game), it does not match you with people like your rank (nothing quite like being a low-level survivor matched with a top-ranked killer, and vice-versa), you cannot play with your friends (the game simply does not allow it to work), there are several game-breaking issues (such as ring-around-the-rosies created by chokepoints), and the latency on servers is caused by the poor P2P choice.  To cherry on top is that anyone who voices these legitimate complaints to the community are met with verbal abuse about how they should just \"git gud.\"\n\nFinal edit: they fixed the matchmatching, ended the problem of people leaving all the time by hiding levels and ranks from other players, and solved a lot of the match dropping.

You hop into a match as a survivor and you are instantly getting a look at you're surroundings, you're looking for crates and generators but most importantly, you're  looking for the killer. He could be around any corner you turn or stalking you from the shadows, you have no idea. You always have a little voice at the back or you're head telling you to look behind you, hid behind that bush or run away. Playing with others can be difficult, and some killers camp your soon to be dead body when they hang you on the hook, but it just adds to the tension that the game pushes for. Overall, I'd recommend this game, it has really caught my attention and I've played it almost non stop since I got it. The only thing I wish was available was playing a match with friends, not in the private lobby but on a public match.
