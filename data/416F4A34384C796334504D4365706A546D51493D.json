But I can't in good conscience recommend a game in as poorly maintained a state as this one is.  \n\nBoth before and after the recently introduced MMR system, upon reaching rank 8 as killer, you WILL be matched with exclusively ranks 1-3 survivors with at the very least 1000 hours in the game (usually more, even double or triple that).  I have never seen a purple rank survivor at killer rank 8 or higher in my life.  \n\nI've gone at least 30 games in a row, alternating between getting four kills with ease at rank 9, ranking up, getting 0 kills at rank 8 and having every generator completed in ~5 minutes, then ranking back down to rank 9.  \n\nThe final straw was going against a full rank 1 SWF party (still at killer rank 8, mind you).  After completing that match, I collected myself and decided upon the following:  I would play one more match, and if the same thing happened, I was done.  After all the good and bad times this game had given me, I would finally uninstall.\n\nI queue up, and load, and load... and load.  And load some more.  \n\n10 minutes pass and I'm hit with an error message and am disconnected, unable to reconnect.  The servers are down.\n\nBHVR is a cruel mistress, for she'll always promise you a solution and dangle it right in front of your face, only to reveal it changes absolutely nothing.  Don't simp for Mathieu Cote.  Don't suffer like I did.  Just walk away.\n\nEDIT:  Came back after matchmaking was \"fixed\".  It's even worse now, happens from Rank 12 instead of Rank 8.

GOODBYE BHVR YOU HAVE FAILED AGAIN\n\n\nDon't buy if you are doing it for killer, latest updates have made killer nearly unplayable.  Survivors have every way including game programming to make sure they don't get hooked.  I get things need balance but the one thing that is a big deal for killer that has not changed is gen rush speeds, with everything else it's just no fun casual killer fun.  All you will find are meta perk T bagging groups of survivors with group communication most times.  I want my time back....\n\n\nRE DLC was supposed to be an awesome fun time....yeah now Capcom should charge BHVR 3 times for this garbage.  Still game breaking bugs, matchmaking is in the tanks now, I like killer over solo survivor.  Biggest problem is the HUGE wait for a game to either get a toxic SWF or high ranked 4k hours in survivor.  Did I mention the map i paid for is still not able to be used... oh but it was working fine in the PTB....wtf BHVR get your other hand out of your pants and WORK.\n\nAfter some time after my last review my current disappointment in DBD is VERY HIGH as a killer main that is, with this next patch and boon totems it is VERY obvious BHVR  care only for the survivor stream crews.  I've tried to come back only to find killer way behind and getting screwed out of hits with auto aim or infinite chance survivor builds now a days, give it time soon survivors will wonder why there is such a long que time....lol\n\nIt is just so bad right now for solo and more to for killer, don't buy this game if you think you can pull off killer\n\nUpdate,\nGuess what? again DLC people bought has broken lol plus when I tried to log in day 1 of the witch dlc it was down.  I mean just don't bother if you THINK KILLER would be cool to play, survivors get escapes given to them by bad game design and exploits.
