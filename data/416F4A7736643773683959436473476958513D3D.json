Toxic community. it doesnt take long to piss off some survivers as a killer. you just need to win a game and the end chat will just be bombed with insults(can be from bouth sides).\nthird problem.

Meine Review wurde während dieser Zeit oft von positiv auf negativ und zurück geändert und fällt letzten Ende sehr gemischt aus. \n\nDas Spiel ist immer noch recht unbalanced. Als Gruppe von 4 Personen wird man oft vom Killer aus der Lobby geworfen, weil Survivor als richtiges Team die Oberhand über den Killer haben. Anders herum ist die Sterberate als solo survivor ohne Freunde unglaublich hoch, weil das Spiel über die Zeit an die Gruppen angepasst wurden musste.\n\nDa es keine Server gibt, ist man, was die Verbindung angeht, praktisch in der Hand der Killer, welche die Lobby öffnen und somit die Survivor zum laggen bringen können. Das Matchmaking ist eigentlich ein Witz, weil jeder Noob Rang 1 werden kann und es auch überhaupt keine Belohnung dafür gibt, im Rang aufzusteigen.\n\nDas Positive an diesem Spiel? Wenn man über ein paar ärgerliche Vorkommnisse in den Matches hinwegsehen kann, macht das Spiel tatsächllich auch viel Spaß.\nFür Anfänger ist es aber leider teilweise sehr frustrierend und recht komplex, sowohl als Survivor und besonders als Killer. Hier kommt auch wieder das Matchmaking und die Art des Rangresets zur Sprache. Ich empfehle hier, einfach mit Freunden zusammen zu spielen.","timestamp_created":1469207184,"timestamp_updated":1539115230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494820713996887207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24462530","author":{"steamid":"76561198167446766","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":22984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3192,"last_played":1654616842},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกครับ เพลินมาก คนเดียวเล่นสยอง แต่ถ้ามาเป็นแก๊งค์นี่ขำได้ทุกวิ 55555","timestamp_created":1469206139,"timestamp_updated":1474673633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24462497","author":{"steamid":"76561198235871576","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1688,"last_played":1475065554},"language":"russian","review":"заебись игра играю каждый день","timestamp_created":1469206003,"timestamp_updated":1469206003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24462376","author":{"steamid":"76561198164560337","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":58774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1276,"last_played":1655183538},"language":"english","review":"no sbmm, no problem","timestamp_created":1469205594,"timestamp_updated":1630017288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24462059","author":{"steamid":"76561198146776222","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1540818219},"language":"english","review":"fun game","timestamp_created":1469204394,"timestamp_updated":1469204394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24461928","author":{"steamid":"76561198016898181","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1654954970},"language":"koreana","review":"개져아!!

He was starving for days but would just not fall (similar to what the twin towers did until George Bush SMASHED that m-f'n like button on that detonation device). They sent a 9 foot cute guy with a chainsaw to collect taxes, in which I responded, \"Dear sirs, I have paid the 10% sales tax on you wonderful game, yet you ask for more taxes,\" to which they responded with \"We'll patch that out.\" Sadly, they patched out 4.6% of the sales tax, so I am still left to pay the 5.4% tax (which fluctuates between 5.2%-5.8% depending on my skill check). \n\nNow with my dead dog, I was finally able to metaphorically see that I should play \"Dead by Daylight: death is not an escape\" by Death by Daynight Gamers Creators (little known fact, this is actually Greek for free DLC). Now when I learned this game had free DLC, I knew that it would be a horrific experience trying to put my credit card information without the government finding out what my creidt card number was (I had to memorize it since I put duct tape over the number) when I realized that it wasn't like how Netflix was for free, but it was actually free. Excited, I had to email my best friend Spencer Pennychode. Now, that's not his real name (I don't know his real name) but you can sure bet he's got a wide chode ;). Anyways, I sent him a Yahoo email (Google leaks information to the FBI, like my credit card information and how many children are currently in my basement (I don't even know how many are there anymore, actually)) containing only two words: \"two words\".\n\nSpencer was absolutely disgusted by my desire to play this game. It turns out he actually played Dad by Daycare, too, and did not enjoy it at all and said, \"After 5 planets you have seen it all, just other colors and shapes. The main goal is to farm ressources, very innovative......If i want mindlesss farming i am gonna play some asia grinder\" (a big thank you to Godofwar1971-- I mean, a big thank you to Spencer Pennychode for his wide weewee). \n\nI was in shock. Spencer was in shock. Spencer's cock was in shock. Spencer's cock was in my asshole, but save that for another time as we have to move on in this story before I am executed by Dog by Asshole's developers. To further my original point, early access is a must for this game. As a major supporter of women's rights (only the ones who agree to bounce on my dingo) and children's rights (see previous paranthesis), I believe this game needs to be pushed to early access, maybe as early as preschool. Children of today need to learn what it's like to plant wheat, go to church (part of the new free DLC), and fix up cars. This game is also a great example of being able to wear whatever you want, as the wrongfully named \"Killers\" are dressed in fashionable, yet unique, apparel that the regular American (or Saudi Arabian, if you're not privileged enough (daily privilege check)) would never wear on the streets.

Die Leute denken immer, dass wenn man ein Spiel auf dem PC installiert man automatisch den Skill mit installiert. Dem ist aber nicht so und das zeigt DbD mal wieder. \nDas Konzept ist super und ich finde bisher auch die Umsetzung. Man muss halt erst einmal lernen wie das Spiel und das Spielen so funktioniert.\nMeine ersten Partien als Überlebender dauerten zum Teil nur wenige Sekunden und auch heute nach 20 std Spielzeit kann es mit viel Pech sein, dass man direkt stirbt. Aber so ist halt das Game. Die meisten Runde laufen  nach etwas Eingewöhnungs und Übungszeit deutlich erfolgreicher. Das hängt zum Großteil an der eigenen Spielweise aber auch einwenig auch an den Mitspielern ( sowohl Team als auch Killer). Zb. hatte ich eine Runde wo nach einer Minute alle anderen tot waren. Da machste dann nicht viel.\nAuch als Killer muss man das Spiel erst lernen, wie sovieles im Leben. Was von vielen kritisiert wird ist zum Beispiel, das viele Killer Campen wenn man erstmal am Haken ist. Campen bringt garnichts. Traut euch im Team oder auch alleine die Leute vom Haken zu holen. Als Killer hat man wenig Chancen wenn mehrere Überlebende zusammen arbeiten. Am Anfang campt wohl jeder Killer und wundert sich dann warum er 2 -3 Überlebende opfert und trotzdem kein Rank up bekommt. Wer campt macht meistens nicht genung Punkt. Deshalb hänge ich die Leute auf und gehe weiter auf die Jagd. Seitdem bekomme ich auch Rank ups da ich durch mehrfaches hängen, auch der gleichen Person, immer wieder Punkte bekomme. Als Killer dreht sich alles um Movement, wenn ihr gut beobachtet und antizipieren könnt, was die Überlebenden als nächstes machen, habt ihr gute Chance. Wichtig ist nicht aus der Ruhe bringen lassen. Ihr seid der Killer. Wenn Ihr verfolgt tretet die Bretter kaputt und wenn jem Katz und Maus Spiele anfängt zieht euch zurück und jagd wen anderes, sonst verschenkt ihr nur Zeit.\nAls  jetzt das \"Überlebe mit einem Freund\" rauskam, war ich erst mal skeptisch ob das von der balance her geht. Ich habe ein paar Runden mit einem Freund gegen den Killer gespielt und muss sagen wir hatten keinen Vorteil und sind im gleichen Verhältniss entkommen wie wir überlebt haben.\n\nMit der Aussicht auf neu Charaktere auf beiden Seiten denke ich werde ich noch einige Zeit freude an Dead by Daylight haben.\n\nAbsolute Kaufempfehlung wenn man sich drauf einlässt und bereit ist zu lernen und am Anfang Lehrgeld zu zahlen.","timestamp_created":1469173865,"timestamp_updated":1469173865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507389187812805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24455378","author":{"steamid":"76561198122046393","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1565345244},"language":"russian","review":"дохера багов","timestamp_created":1469173732,"timestamp_updated":1469173732,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24455363","author":{"steamid":"76561198087234149","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1574876740},"language":"english","review":"im happy because the killer in this world still have a good heart...they even help lone helpless survivor that was abandoned(disconnected) by his/her friend.....although i got chainsawed but i know deep in the killer's heart he was trying to help me...but the other survivors..pls show some teamwork..dont just give up...ur making this game boring =.='\n\n#kindheartedkiller","timestamp_created":1469173666,"timestamp_updated":1469173666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513687610626220703","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24455038","author":{"steamid":"76561197986723497","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1572296213},"language":"english","review":"Not bad!very nice!","timestamp_created":1469171727,"timestamp_updated":1469171727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489864856004714966","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24454841","author":{"steamid":"76561198027338767","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":202739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1341,"playtime_at_review":79714,"last_played":1660570856},"language":"english","review":"Dev's dont care about the balance of the game or the community other than buy my skins.","timestamp_created":1469170336,"timestamp_updated":1643422109,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24454758","author":{"steamid":"76561198315885374","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1358,"last_played":1625061929},"language":"schinese","review":"bug太多了修正bug估计会好一些","timestamp_created":1469169717,"timestamp_updated":1469169717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24454685","author":{"steamid":"76561197972566636","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6251,"last_played":1480184836},"language":"english","review":"Ridiculous amount of bugs, some game breaking (hillbilly addon for example).

I will warn you there are a few things killers and survivors love to do a lot. CAMPING (Killers) & WINDOW HOPPERS (Survivors). If you rage and hate being camped and never escaping death make sure you play as the killer. If you hate window hoppers more then play as the survivor. The game is great and the concept is amazing. It isn't what I expected because when I watched it on youtube it seemed that it would be even more fun. But it is addicting and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want to be scared. Personally this game does not scare me but if you are younger than 12 I would say don't play it. If you are younger than a mature age which may be young adult do not play this game because it is not appropriate for everyone. My favorite killers (Listed by order) are the: Wraith, Trapper, and Hillbilly. I also want to include I bought this game one day ago and I have played it for two hours already almost three. I love how their is no drugs, sex, language, etc. in the game. There is only gore and violence which is good for a horror game. Making a multiplayer horror game is a great idea because it really adds to the layer of mystery because you don't know what the killer's character is or who the people you are playing with happen to be. I would recommend trying to get some friends to play so that you can fix the camping problem. I rate this game 8/10 because of its concept and the multiplayer involved. I do not like 2/10 of it because of the camping but if I play as the killer it is much easier to play. Also the windows hoppers are really annoying. I usually just ignore them and go for the other survivors because while I chase the window hoppers people are getting generators!\n\nHave fun,\n-MrJasty\n\nP.S.\nThis game takes many days of practice before you can master killing and surviving. I would recommend practicing surviving first. It is harder to survive because there are more buttons you have to use than the killer. Also I would recommend getting a steam controller because it is much easier to play with a controller than a keyboard.","timestamp_created":1469142342,"timestamp_updated":1469142658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473176777362823486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24450070","author":{"steamid":"76561198268169278","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1601341256},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego es la gran mamada pero el problema inicia cuando los desarrolladores hacen que el host sea el asesinoo y valen verga algunos por tener mala conexcion o qporque usan programas para que nos de lag me tocan con el mismo assesino una y otra ves el trampero y el hijo de puta tiene mala conexicon mejor arreglen eso...
