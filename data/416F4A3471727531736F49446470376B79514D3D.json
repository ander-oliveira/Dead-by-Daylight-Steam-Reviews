I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki \"Yagoo\" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really

The absolutely HORRENDOUS wait times to be paired with people, and there's literally no way to predict when you have two minutes to wait or even twenty. I usually keep Netflix or YouTube open in case the wait is too long so I'm not bored. The regular cheating is also a problem, so if someone is slowing down your frame-rate and graphics by just being near them (especially if you're the killer)-- they are most likely cheating.

It's obvious the graphics, gameplay movement, music and all are good enough, so what I'll discuss is the current state of the game in 2022, nearing 2023.\n\nIt's bad. This game used to be amazing, rewarding, and exciting. But in order to get more and more money they made changes to get newer players while ruining the game for intermediate or veteran players. Perks that used to be exciting and rewarding to unlock or worth getting characters for are now worthless and that money not well spent. Matchmaking before used to give similar skill leveled players for your team and the enemy team alike; now that isn't remotely true. The current \"Skill Based Matchmaking System\" is broken. Pairing survivors who have just installed the game against veteran killers of a thousand hours, and likewise pairing new/rusty/inexperienced killers against SWF (Basically a survivor team on comms) players with hundreds of hours who will juke you so hard you never try killer again. Last but not least, killers are camping harder than ever with 80% of my matches being dead on first hook while the killer camps.\n\nThe dev's are too stubborn to admit that their changes to the perks and matchmaking system failed, and that hubris is costing them many of the games veteran players and real fan base.\n\nI'm sad to say this is no longer a game I can recommend to anyone till serious structural and balancing changes are made.\n\nTLDR: Don't buy this game full price, on sale or even free. It just isn't fun anymore due to the horrible mistakes by devs the last year or 2.","timestamp_created":1659554118,"timestamp_updated":1659554118,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516778528690338135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120008796","author":{"steamid":"76561199064521771","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5736,"playtime_at_review":10154,"last_played":1660600084},"language":"schinese","review":"怪奇物语什么时候返厂！","timestamp_created":1659553906,"timestamp_updated":1659553906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120008750","author":{"steamid":"76561198941701331","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":9985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9985,"last_played":1643056688},"language":"spanish","review":"This game is amazing","timestamp_created":1659553854,"timestamp_updated":1659553854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120008714","author":{"steamid":"76561199097238403","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1675,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1659993603},"language":"english","review":"it's really fun to play with friends and imo the repetition makes it preeetty addictive!
