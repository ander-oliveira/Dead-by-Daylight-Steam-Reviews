You get to connect with other players within the game, and still have that small AKA large dose of horror with each trial. You get to level up your favorite characters, and killers if that's more your style, we get to choose to play as either killer or survivor, and there are a varitey of both sides to choose from. Not to mention the created maps within the game are all beautiful and well thought out. In my mind, this game is 99% perfect, however, one thing I know we cannot get rid of that can sometimes ruin one player experience is rude and cruel players. You play the game to enjoy the experience, not play a game and have one or more players say rude things in the end chat... try not to focus on the negative of your trial - remember it is just a game, and everyone has their own way of playing it. Just be kind and respectful of the other players and I'm sure you'll have the best experience out there.\nI love the game for what it is, and I'm always ready to welcome the new DLC'S that the DEVS create and give us. If any of you people out there reading this review, just know that if you like to think on your feet and get scared every now and again, know that Dead By Daylight could possibly be the game for you.

Players can choose between playing as one of the game's killers, or as one of the survivors. Each unique character has their own personality and abilities. Gameplay can be difficult for both sides, the killer and survivors, as they have tools to end or prolong the chase respectively. As frustrating as the game can be, I love it. It's been my favorite game for a long time now. It has its issues, bugs, broken mechanics, maybe even repetitive at times. But it's got a great dev team, who listens. It's honestly really fun. And the characters are well-written and thought out. So thank you BHVR, for one of the games I can truly say I love. After 1000, I still feel how I do when the game launched in 2016.

Deathgarden - уже мёртвое тому доказательство. Играть за убийцу одно удовольствие - это просто, это весело, даже если ты попадаешь на \"жеских\" выживших  у тебя припасен вагон и маленькая тележка абуз-механик, которые живут в этой игре с самого создания, за которые тебя никто и никак не накажет.\nНапример:\n1) Ты несёшь выжившего на крюк, но тебя всячески задерживают другие игроки? Брось его на пол! Он не может убежать, не может сам полностью выхиляться, даже если ты заиграешься с другими и его подлечат, он всё равно ляжет с 1 удара и всё начнётся заново.\n2) Ты вешаешь игроков на крюк, но их всё время снимают? Не отходи далеко от крюка, отгоняй игроков, но всегда будь близко, что бы в любой удобный момент вынести снятого с 1 удара, и повешать его обратно, с последующими штрафами. Не говоря о том, что ты запросто можешь повалить спасающего и... просто бросить его рядом, теперь у тебя 2 жертвы которых теперь практически нереально спасти.\n3) Раздражает, что последний выживший убегает через люк? Когда выживших останется 2, повали одного и иди за вторым, теперь при любых раскладах ты в +. Найдёт люк? Не сможет открыть пока жив поваленный. Спасёт поваленного? Ты будешь знать где их искать и в люк они уже не попадают. Дождётся смерти поваленного и сбежит через люк? Жаль, но у тебя всё равно \"фраг\" с поваленного.\nИтог: Отвратительный баланс. За убийц тяжело играть потому что, трудно найти игру. За выживших тяжело играть, потому что, вы и ваша команда можете выкладываться на все 100, но убьют вас скорее всего, слишком легко и не напрягаясь.","timestamp_created":1575334513,"timestamp_updated":1575334513,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59082388","author":{"steamid":"76561198150946124","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":58443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45106,"last_played":1659339675},"language":"english","review":"Great!\nI

fun to play alone, but awesome to play with friends.\n\nThe different playable characters are what really makes the game fun. \nMany survivors and killers are licensed, so you can play as some of your favorites from the classic horror films including Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween.\nThere are also characters from newer shows and movies, such as Saw and Resident Evil.\nThe original game characters are very nice and have interesting back stories.\n\nIf you enjoy asymmetric (4v1) games, then definitely try out Dead by

genuinely find this game fun for both single player and with friends. the game has a lot of different way to play from what perk you build to what items you take (survivor only). the game requires a time investment to get used to all the different interactions between perks and items and how each perk itself can create synergies to help make your whole builder greater than the sum of its parts. the two parts which heavily differ are the survivor and killers sides. survivor get to bring in items such as a medkit to self heal or speed up their healing or a flashlight to blind the killer or even be used to rescue another survivor from the killers grasp. killers on the other hand get their own unique power such as the ability to blink from one location to another while another can throw hatchets to injure survivors from afar. survivor and killers also get to amplify their abilities and powers with addons which can drastically change how they work and increase their effectiveness. over all the game has something for everyone from licensed killers and survivors such as Michael Myers and Laurie strode to their own creations like the spirit and Adam Francis which all bring their own unique game play and perks to change up how you play the game.","timestamp_created":1575332657,"timestamp_updated":1575332657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49pbJ5O4Cd4yw4QE="}
