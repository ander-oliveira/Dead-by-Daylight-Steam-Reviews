There's a heavy focus on a lot of money-grabbing schemes in the development right now and not a lot going on with fixing actual gameplay related issues. Really odd to see a game that's not F2P and still wants you to spend money on content long after release... but I suppose that's modern gaming for you. With that said, most of the content that influences gameplay directly is attainable through in-game currency that can be earned as you play.\n\nOverall this is a game that I enjoy a lot. It's not perfectly balanced, not every match is going to be a great experience, and it can be a very frustrating experience if you're the kind of person who gets annoyed a lot by difficult/unfair experiences in games.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that builds on horror and creepy atmosphere then this isn't necessarily great for that in most cases. It's a matter of suspense, thrill, and mindgames in situations where split-second decisions mean life or death for survivors, or satisfaction vs disappointment as a killer.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun multiplayer game then this is kind of a gem in my eyes.

Or a Killer, who is trying to sacrifice the 4 survivors for the god it worships called the entity, using a variety of tools and abilities spread amoung different killers.\n\nthere are 5 different survivors to choose from, and 4 different killers. the survivors all function pretty much the same, each one has a crouch, run, and wiggle / escape move. the killers each have a unique ability that changes how survivors should act each game ranging from a chainsaw sprint, to being able to turn invisible. killers and survivors can be upgraded to unlock perks, addons and offerings via points you earn every game you finish. you can level up to 50 with each survivor / killer and ascend (prestige. basically) to unlock a cosmetic item for that character.\n\nPlaying with friends is really fun but you dont earn any experiance doing private games. online games can be really tough, because starting out, everyone is pretty much max level rocking 4 perks. im a rank 17, level 18 killer getting matched with rank 1 - rank 6 survivors. currently I am on a 5 game losing streak.\n\nIf you are looking for a good lan game to play with your friends.

Since 2016 this game has improved a lot and now I can find lobbies at anytime and the servers are great. I am not a hardcore player but I play on and off. So far even though there are a few bugs here and there, the devs do their best to fix the game. It has been an amazing 6 years with lots of content. I have this game on my ps4 and switch as well and play it all the time. The cross play is amazing as well.\n\nThis game what can you I say is a hate it or love it game you can hate it all you want. But the game is one of a kind if you don't get your fix here where else will you get it from? I find that some days you have great games, then there are those days you play against SWF teams and are very toxic or the killer is having a bad day and they camp you non stop. Game does get frustrating at times hence why I recommend taking a break from it every now and then.\n\nI will be playing this game a lot more some people have played 10000hrs plus I have not quite got there yet even though I had this game from day one. I just get busy with other games and then I come back to this, it will always be my main game.\n\nSo all in all I would recommend this game to anyone, it is fun sometimes toxic but mostly fun play with your friends or play by yourself. This game needs a lot of time and dedication to get good. You need to level up your characters to build them up and share perks.","timestamp_created":1473162226,"timestamp_updated":1590847815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25378482","author":{"steamid":"76561198013273589","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2383,"last_played":1490896662},"language":"german","review":"Für mich persönlich ist es ein gelungenes Spiel zum Zeitvertreib, wenn auch ausbaufähig.
