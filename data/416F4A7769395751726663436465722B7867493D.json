I'm not even talking about the \"dedicated servers\" or \"hit-boxes\" that everyone so often complains about. Right now, issues like 4 survivors spawning right next to each other on a 2 sided map. In addition to this, currently I also see that the killer spawns very close to the survivors. In the past the community would complain that \"survivors were broken\" and it was \"unfair to the killer.\" At this point in time, killers seem to have an edge. We as a community do NOT want to see one side stronger than the other, we want to see BALANCE. Furthermore, I've seen so many hook camping killers and not enough has been done to punish the killer in this aspect. Another issues that I've come across is not being able to find any games certain times during the 24 hour day. I can sit there for 30 minutes or even longer and I will not be able to find a lobby. On the flip side, we have received amazing content, I myself believe that it is overlooked due to the fact that there are many issues with this game. \"Strangers things\" was such a phenomenal inclusion into the game and it has left the community hungry for more. We could possibly expect our favourite characters/killers in this game in the future.","timestamp_created":1612183410,"timestamp_updated":1612183410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85756025","author":{"steamid":"76561198029111360","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1831,"last_played":1655751169},"language":"german","review":"+ Game machanic is really nice, asymmetric playstyle brings a fresh taste to it.\n+ Teamwork as a survivor really makes fun. Also escaping a chase. \n+ As Killer, the fun part is to screw with the survivors and drive them to a point where they make mistakes.\n\n- Mostly bad balancing, few killers left who play the game\n- Toxic survivors\n\n\nConclusion: Its fun, When you got a nice squad of survivors (friends for an example) and you can coordinate your actions.\nAs killer, the few times you aren't annoyed to death and have fun playing.. make it better. \n\nI'd recommend the purchase and go the hard way as killer, to understand the difficultly being one. Its like working in retail with a bunch of Karens. Then you cherish the game, and appreciate the opposing side.\n\nSounds strange? Well. its always 4v1 you do the math, and don't be scared

I've seen so many changes come in and out that honestly hopping back into it on PC hasn't been much of a stretch and the beauty of it all is that the core of the game stays so familiar even if the changes don't.\n\nForget Friday The 13th. Depth. Alien vs. Predator. Or if you want to trudge up some truly repressed memories, Evolve. This is the apex of 4v1 games as we've come to know them and as a player with over 400+ hrs between PC and consoles I still find myself terrified or thrilled depending on which side of the coin I'm on, whether running, screaming and hiding in plain sight like a 200IQ coward as a survivor or double pipping on a merciless 4k as The Huntress with hatchet snipes as a killer.\n\nEnough of the good. Some of my biggest gripes lie with how others approach the game, not necessarily the game itself. It's sucks to take 10 minutes to find a match, find one and then the killer facecamps you on the hook till you die and you're back out again in the biggest waste of time ever.

Yes.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. But...\n\nThe game has so many little issues that keep it from being great. I think that the core gameplay loop itself is very interesting and actually a lot of fun. The game pits a single killer against four survivors, the latter needing to repair generators and escape the trial, and the killer needing to stop the survivors and sacrifice them. However to start off, the game is riddled with bugs and glitches that range from being hilarious to being hands-down infuriating to encounter. There's been more than a couple times that I had been robbed of my life as a survivor or robbed of a hit as a killer because of a glitch or inconsistent hitboxes. \n\nDead by Daylight is rife with toxic players and balancing issues. When it comes to the toxic community, I do not entirely place the blame on the devs, because that is something mostly out of their control. However, the game is built in a way that allows players to act like assholes and ruin the days of others, because of core issues that remain to be fixed or addressed. There is little to no penalty for killers camping, and some items are completely unfair or simply unfun to play against. This sort of ties into balance as well - the presence of these unfair perks or items can often foster toxic or unsportsman-like behavior. If powerful items exist, people will equip them and there is nothing that can be done about it if changes are not made.\n\nSpeaking about balance in a broader fashion, the game is not balanced. Both survivors and killers have what are known as \"nuclear options\". Either side can have item or perk \"nuclear options\" that have little to no counterplay and vastly overshadow other items. It's like if in a war, two armies are shooting at each other with arrows and then somebody suddenly decides to bring out a nuke and drop it on the opposing side. Balance does not come from both sides having access to nuclear options - all choices for both sides must be reasonable. There are only 4 killers that are viable in high ranks and only a dozen or so perks that are reliably powerful (for both killers and survivors). This means that the meta can be often stale, with survivors bringing the same 4 perks every game and people playing as the same 4 killers over and over again. The devs need to definitely step their game up and tweak the \"nuclear\" options while making everything else that isn't \"meta\" better. There is almost no reason not to stick to the same perks and/or characters every game, and literally everything else that isn't part of the meta looks like dog water in comparison.\n\nThings to note: \n-Performance is decent, but some of the revamped maps cause a bit of lag.\n-This game costs 20 dollars but it is monetized like a free-to-play game. The grind is real, and many of the good perks and killers are locked behind a paywall. However, there is a weekly rotation of perks for killer and survivor that you can buy from without spending real money, which is nice. The catch is, since there are so many perks available in the game and only a couple that are meta, it's difficult to rely on this.\n-Some aspects of the game is based on RNG and luck, which isn't always a bad thing. Every map spawns a tiny bit differently every time you play, which makes things interesting, but it can also be annoying when your killer totem spawns in front of the survivors and you lose one of your abilities in 15 seconds as a result. Don't even get me started on how there are maps that are garbage for the killer, and maps that are completely the opposite. There's also one killer who is almost completely reliant on luck (the Trapper), and that's a bit of a balancing issue as well.\n-Matchmaking is monkey food omfg\n-It's way funner with friends. You can complain together instead of complaining to yourself!\n-Movement feels good and the sound design is great. \n-There's characters from your favorite horror franchises, such as Michael Myers and Freddy Kreuger.\n-The game still gets updated frequently, with new chapters coming out every 3-4 months. In these chapters usually come one killer and one survivor, each with three unique perks. New maps, map revamps, and balance changes are present each chapter as well.\n-Feel free to correct me about anything in this review! My opinion is simply my opinion, and I could change my mind in the future about what I said!\n\nConclusion: The game has issues, but it's really fun (stressful though). I have a love/hate relationship with Dead by Daylight, and if you're into that kind of shit, definitely get this game ;-)\n\n7.5/10[/strike]","timestamp_created":1612134349,"timestamp_updated":1612475341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524445772171020508","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85723933","author":{"steamid":"76561198142799373","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":1727,"last_played":1660403260},"language":"english","review":"Its fun but holy hell the player base can be toxic, on both sides!

The one thing I don't like is that you MUST use discord to talk to others so you effectively can't communicate with randos other than hand gestures or chat after the game.","timestamp_created":1612129512,"timestamp_updated":1612129512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85720706","author":{"steamid":"76561199072175855","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4809,"last_played":1656374034},"language":"english","review":"good game yessir","timestamp_created":1612129501,"timestamp_updated":1612129501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85720593","author":{"steamid":"76561198976039375","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4612,"last_played":1657076962},"language":"english","review":"killer fun survivor boring","timestamp_created":1612129363,"timestamp_updated":1612129363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85720592","author":{"steamid":"76561198271591010","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":68733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":993,"playtime_at_review":67740,"last_played":1660603567},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1612129362,"timestamp_updated":1660311198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85719917","author":{"steamid":"76561199093403515","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3033,"last_played":1642058409},"language":"russian","review":"Найс","timestamp_created":1612128509,"timestamp_updated":1612128509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85719764","author":{"steamid":"76561198944138819","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":141,"playtime_at_review":2574,"last_played":1660174749},"language":"german","review":"Geile","timestamp_created":1612128336,"timestamp_updated":1612128336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85719605","author":{"steamid":"76561198253450586","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":40481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":5346,"last_played":1660331721},"language":"english","review":"Game good, community is 50% nice 50% toxic, too many campers and tunnelers, but game is good","timestamp_created":1612128127,"timestamp_updated":1612128127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4887218177318573","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85719567","author":{"steamid":"76561199116783786","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":45832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3050,"playtime_at_review":6157,"last_played":1660595868},"language":"polish","review":"można się fajnie wkurwićl","timestamp_created":1612128084,"timestamp_updated":1612128084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85718693","author":{"steamid":"76561198404418519","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":78318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62140,"last_played":1657728409},"language":"german","review":"Der neue Lobby Simulator 2021!","timestamp_created":1612127054,"timestamp_updated":1612127054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":70,"votes_funny":77,"weighted_vote_score":"0.803414344787597656","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9WQrfcCder+xgI="}
