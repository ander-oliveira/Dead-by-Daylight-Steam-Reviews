They just don’t get as popular I guess (the game modes were also pretty unplayable and boring). It has a great base game loop, killer kills survivors, while the latter have to repair generators to power exit gates, open exit gates and eventually leave to win. It has some interesting lore about the entity abducting people to their realm to feed on their fear. It has all the components to make a good game but it just messes everything up with lackluster execution, too few game mechanics, broken perks and economy systems that will never get fixed, all set within a long line of half-assed cash grab seven buck DLC that just enforces  BHVR’s subpar game design. Still: It’s the best game of its kind out there and since F13 and Last Year are a total bust it probably will be the best of its kind forever, so it has that going for it.\n\nYou can read the most good and bad of that in different reviews, I just wanna point out some flaws that make the game especially frustrating for me once I put some hundred hours in. This isn’t a complete review by itself, you’ll have to read others or play the game to understand the half of what I’m complaining about here.\n\n[b]F’ing Pallets, how do they werk:[/b] On the survivor side you will get frustrated with pallets and their erratic behavior (no pun intended). Sometimes you’ll hop through a pallet to the other side to the killer ready to be fed on, sometimes you won’t. It all has rules though: If you are walking towards a pallet you’ll hop through before throwing it down no matter what. That’s fine, except when you were waiting next to a pallet, walk up to it when the killer approaches and you press space to throw it down in front of him to create space between you and her. Forward momentum will catapult you through. To stay where you are and simply throw the pallet down you’ll have to stop to reset momentum, then press space. It’s not intuitive, it’s not fun, but it has rules (it was worse before, this is a relatively recent change).\n\n[b]Pallet looping:[/b] On the killer side you probably have to suffer through the most annoying thing that ever was: Pallet looping. Survivors can and will loop you around a pallet location and adjacent walls till you’re dizzy and then drop the pallet on your face once they won’t be able to run another lap without you hitting them. That’s just players using a game mechanic to its absolute best, can’t blame them, really. It kind of makes games extremely boring for both killers and survivors because there is no clever juking involved, no skill, no fun. Just repetitive laps around a wall. Devs [i]fix[/i] this by giving the killer a small speed buff every 15 seconds of ongoing chase until you lose your target or you hit it. Which isn’t really a fix, it just makes sure that you’ll get a hit in after a while.\n\n[b]Totem Placement:[/b] Like, how? I mean, you have a great mechanic at your hands but you mess it up so badly that people despise it even though it could make the game work so much better. The fix would be simple: Don’t put totems next to a generator, don’t put them next to a hook, don’t put them in direct line of sight to survivor spawns. But I know, I ask too much.\n\n[b]Windows/Ledges:[/b] So they reworked things to jump over so there will be a final nail in the coffin for infinite loops (which don’t exist anymore so you’ll have to call them “very long loops” or something, whatever). If you don’t run perpendicular towards a window you’ll not get the benefit of vaulting over it fast but you’ll instead go into this painstakingly slow crawl across the ledge which is what a survivor does naturally when being chased by a chick with an axe. Solves stuff for killers, it’s not fun for the other party.\n\n[b]Camping Hooks:[/b] I don’t know which fresh kind of hell this idea came from but somehow this is a mechanic that never got improved upon. You can kill your way up to pretty much rank 1 if you just hook a survivor and facecamp it so they won’t get saved by their buddies. Pretty boring mechanic, at least for one side, right? Devs thought they can make some clever perks to encourage [i]not camping[/i], e.g. BBQ ‘n Chilli (who makes a barbecue and serves chili with it anyway?). Turns out that perk encourages face campers to stay at their target if they don’t see the full set of remaining survivors lit up once they hooked someone because they know there is someone ready to unhook as soon as they leave. Another example of half-assed game design.\n\n[b]Killer and Survivor Design[/b]\nWhile I’ll always to salute their arts team, the killer mechanic design is so hit and miss that I can’t even. If I look at The Hag (my personal favorite but also a good example) I see a weird and interesting backstory with a character that has great creepy design and abilities that fit her backstory. She brings jump scares, she brings new mechanics with her that change the whole game (introduced totems) and she is fun to play AND fun to play against. She’s the whole package. Let’s compare that to The Clown. Backstory: Sociopath, kills animals, kills a guy, gets found out, runs away, joins circus, kills drunk guests there (who gets drunk visiting a circus?), embraces his inner clown or some shit till one escapes, then he runs away again. End of story. Much wow, such creative. Gameplay is not much better: I can throw bottles that create a gas cloud which slows survivors down. Not fun to play against, not a strong killer. He introduces nothing to the game that wasn’t there already, his perks are mediocre (block vaulting locations, revert generator progression, make healing slow) and the low point of 2018 killer design. While the art is always on point (except maybe Legion, it’s just a dude with a mask) the translation of backstory into game mechanics is just missing. The high point of the 2018 killers probably was the spirit which turned out to be pretty bad as a killer but interesting otherwise. Also, it feels like they just made one ability and then reused it for the next killer Legion: The Spirit can only see scratch marks but not the people she’s chasing and Legion can only see the people, not the scratch marks.

No le quito sus aciertos al juego, ni  quiero demetirar el trabajo de los creadores, al contrario, tengo 500 horas jugadas y ha sido divertido. El punto importantísimo es, que más allá, de que obviamente, es un juego, sin perder de vista eso, cada día hay más jugadores que hacen uso de los llamados hacks o cheats, trampas, lo cuál ha sido verdaderamente decepcionante y en mi opinión personal han puesto en declive la diversión en el juego, esos hacks se venden por montones en internet, no hace falta buscar mucho, y lamentablemente los desarrolladores del juego, ni STeam, han puesto un alto al abuso de estas trampas, en un juego que es muy simple, no entiendo la necesidad de los pésimos juegadores de usar trampas en un juego, digamos tan básico, si son jugadores honestos, entenderán que es frustrante perder el tiempo en un juego en línea, en el cual sabes que el que tiene el rol de asesino esta cheteado y que hagas lo que hagas no tendrás oportunidad, además de lo que yo considero, este grave problema, al menos para los juegadores honestos que queremos divertirnos, a últimas fechas y actualizaciones, los desarrolladores han dado el 90% de ventaja a aquellos que juegan como asesinos y han dejado a los supervivientes con un escaso 10% de posibilidades, si no es que menos, de conseguir una partida exitosa, han llenado a los asesinos de \"Perks\" (ventajas) que prácticamente dejan nulo al los jugadores que juegan de supervivientes, que son el 90%, me refiero 4 jugadores cobhtra 1 solo que tiene absolutamente todas las ventajas. En mi caso personal, si me enoja el que este lleno de hackers y cheteros, es molesto no poder jugar sin toparte, cada dìa màs, con esos jugadores de cuarta categoría, que no pueden jugar un juego tan siemple como este sin hacer trampa, son sucios. Obviamente, hay trampas para los supervivientes, pero... en verdad es divertido jugar una partida con 4 desconocidos, usando trampas? La verdadera diversión del juego se ha reducido, a mi parecer, a las partidas privadas, sólo con amigos, en las que sabes que la partida será, al menos lo más pareja posible, dejando de lado las ventajas que los desarrolladores o creadores del juego le han dado a los asesinos, que no son pocas, y están seriamente desequilibradas en cuanto a las habilidades que tienen los 4 supervivientes que deben buscar salir con vida. Es triste, porque es un buen juego, es divertido, si se juega honestamente, o quizás peco de demasiada honestidad? No losé, no uso trampas, ni hacks en ningún juego, si gano es por habilidad, y si pierdo justamente, no me amargo, y en realidad no entiendo la GRAN satisfacción que causa en ganas con trampas, mis intentos por enviar estos comentarios a los desarrolladores han sido en vano, pues no pelan, que pena, y es así que llegué a la conclusión de calificar este juego como AMPLIAMENTE NEGATIVO, lamento decir que espero que a causa de ello, las ventas bajen en algún momento, para que hagan algo, pues los juegos son son gratis y jugar con hackeros, y más este tipo de juegos, es un asco total. Si eres honesto, no te recomiendo el juego a menos que sólo uses partida privada y te diviertas con tus amigos en un grupo cerrado, es todo!

The ranking system is not working, toxicity is at an all-time high, the meta is stale and slowly robbing this game of any fun. Its frustrating and hopeless honestly. Don't buy this game, spend your money on games with a better community, more caring devs and better balancing, this game is just a tragedy at this point.\n\nA friend of mine and I recently started a spreadsheet, writing down the killers we get and so far it proves my point. Its 50/50, on the one hand there are the competetive tryhard killer, who only play blight and use meta-perks and addons, on the other hand its russian bubbas who facecamp you at 5 gens. If the community isn't going to fix this problem, then the developers have to. Make the game more divers, make perks more viable and make items more reasonable. Its the only way this game will survive.\n\nP.S: The developers put not effort what so ever into this game, because they are brainless monkeys who don't care about this pile of crap some would call a videogame. It's not that hard looking at the statistics and changing the numbers on certain perks to make this game more diverse and interesting, but for BHVR that seems like too much work. Honestly, do something with the money this game generates and hire talented and creative people or maybe devs that work at all.\n\nAnd now: a nearly 30GB update that changes one map and changes a few numbers on two killers. I mean, what the fuck? Healing progression is regressing two times as fast as it takes to heal a survivor, furthermore encouraging the use of too strong med-kits. Way to go to make the gama more healthy, good job!\n\nThis game is being developed by the most untalented, lazy and downright idiotic developers I have ever seen. The only language they seem to understand is \"money\", because they are not reacting to their community unless a problem is so bad its affecting sales. This game needs some serious competition, maybe then the devs will be encouraged to actually work on this sad excuse of a game.\n\nIn all honesty, screw you, bhvr.\n\nPS: rubberbanding is fun btw\n\nPPS: killer literally plays itself after the patch. you are LUCKY if you get one or two gens done, no suspenseful matches anymore, this game has never been more unbalanced","timestamp_created":1546741454,"timestamp_updated":1660140437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48135746","author":{"steamid":"76561198123430957","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":21606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3232,"last_played":1658362354},"language":"english","review":"Fun","timestamp_created":1546737674,"timestamp_updated":1546737674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516483545303344727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48135707","author":{"steamid":"76561198818258498","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3467,"last_played":1632081445},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo bem legal, recomendo 100%","timestamp_created":1546737498,"timestamp_updated":1546737498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48135656","author":{"steamid":"76561198361870119","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":112019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":176,"playtime_at_review":17214,"last_played":1659947822},"language":"english","review":"alright alright, so i dont even know where to start off with this game. this game has so many isssues with it but thats what makes it fun, one of the biggest problems tho with this game is that new people are VERY MUCH not welcome, doesnt matter if you play killer or survior, you will be taken advantage of. another problem with this game is inconsistency, there is so much bulls*** that happens on both sides it gets frustrating to the point were you want to punch a hole in the wall but you just have to live with it, though this game receives updates that fix alot of thing they also create lots of issues with them and when these updates come out everyone almost has to alter there playstyle quite frequently. i can say though after you can get used to this the game is quite fun. killer and survivor are both fun to play once you learn the base of the game, the game experience is way better with friends because there is a major lack of communication with surviviors that gives this feel of fear which makes sence on the devs part. overall this game is fun but you have to learn the foundation before you can actually play the game.","timestamp_created":1546737256,"timestamp_updated":1546737256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48135411","author":{"steamid":"76561198880929783","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1590708461},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo é muito bom mas tenho q baixar o directx 11 mas isso não é um problema para man mas o jogo é divertido e vale muito a pena e vou tentar arrumar este problema","timestamp_created":1546736243,"timestamp_updated":1546736243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48135296","author":{"steamid":"76561198234406848","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":25540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":589,"playtime_at_review":5476,"last_played":1660539292},"language":"latam","review":"juegazo !!!!

Especially Hillbilly does. Moreover after 2 years of playing this game, they didn't improve their ranking system. Basically you will find more noobs the higher you rank up.
