It's so much fun and the gameplay gets your adrenaline pumping... but most of the fun it could be offering Is being taken away from us (more on that later).\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\nAs the killer, as you're stalking your prey and looking out for the survivors knowing they're not able to defend themselves is like childs play. After finally spotting your prey and chasing them, as the survivor helplessly tries to get away from you makes you feel like a REAL psychopath. After catching your prey, you can either grab your prey over your shoulder and take the survivor to your dungeon and hang him up on a meathook or leave him suffering there on the ground and use him as bait. Taunt and scare your prey if you're playing as the hillybilly by revving up your chainsaw to help your prey get rid of constipation. Spook your enemies to the death whilst playing as the wraith by uncloaking yourself and gong your bell.\nLay traps near objectives as the trapper, so you can wait in the bushes for them to step on them and then either waiting for others to help the helpless pray you've just caught or just hang him on a meathook, it's your choice. After either killing all of your prey or letting some of them escape, you're rewarded with points to upgrade your \"power\" and investing points into your skilltree gives you the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nAs a survivor, you're trying to work on the objectives at the same time as you're trying to keep one eye open for the killer. Getting spotted by the killer and being chased through the scary and atmospheric environments is just nothing but scary! Helping your friends out of trouble whilst risking your own life at the same time makes you feel like a hero and scavenging for anything to help you survive is breathtaking. Whilst completed the required objectives to get the go-ahead and open up the gates to escape the horrors and running out of the playground of the killer feels rewarding! Investing points you've gained throughout your adventures of either misfortune or success to your skilltree makes you feel accomplished.\n\n[h1] The Problems [/h1]\nToo bad you can't get the satisfaction this game offers to you of the last points that I mentioned, from neither, from the killer's perspective or the survivor's, because you can only play this game with friends in a \"private game\" which doesn't offer you any \"experience\" points or the chance to progress your characters which is the only reason I dislike this game.\n\nThe developers must include a party option to this game, so you can make a lobby for your friends to queue up for a ranked game AS SURVIVORS, not one being the killer and the rest as survivors, that'd be cheating. If the devs consider queing up with your friends IN THE SAME TEAM \"cheating\", they've got to be joking. The only logical reason this wasn't implemented to the game must've been because they could inform their friends where the killer is via 3-party program. There are no any other ways to communicate with other survivors in the game, they need to add a proximity voice chat, so ANYONE can hear your voice if they're in your proximity, the killer included. Great alternative for this would a voiceline wheel, with restrictions, e.g not being able to use voiceline wheel when stuck in a meathook. Having the killer also hear these voicelines, if he's close enough to the survivors making this option very fair.\n\n[h1] The Conclusion [/h1]\nThe only reason keeping me from recommending this game for you & your friends, is the reason stated above. If they decide to update the game and allow us to queue up with friends as survivors into a same game where you could make progress with your character, then I would recommend this game for you. Missing on an important game mechanic of improving your character, being taken away from and punishing you for playing the game with your friends is absurd and VERY BAD game design. I only recommend this game to you if you're planning on playing alone with randoms. To get the most out of the game IF played with friends, is to wait for the devs to release the party queue.\n\n</rant>","timestamp_created":1465971604,"timestamp_updated":1466075804,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":410,"votes_funny":18,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695921063423156738","comment_count":78,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23564997","author":{"steamid":"76561198160623424","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1377,"last_played":1625078512},"language":"english","review":"no reason , just love it","timestamp_created":1465971524,"timestamp_updated":1465971524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486486494541168213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23564975","author":{"steamid":"76561197967670857","num_games_owned":541,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1471765304},"language":"english","review":"Only played 2 games for me to realize how EPIC this game is!

Yeah, you bet your ass similar exploitative tactics are happening here. Made the mistake of buying one of the DLCs because I liked the killer concept.

However, you should know that you're in for bugfest and DLCfest 2017 if you decide to buy it; frankly, I'd recommend against purchasing now to disincentivize this kind of developer/publisher behavior; also for the bug BS that I had expected to be patched out soon after the game FIRST published, lol!

At launch, however, that potential is unrealized. The matchmaking and lobby system are an absolute disaster. I have a bit over 2 hours in this game, and in that time I have spent about and hour and 15 minutes looking for matches and about 45 minutes actually playing the game. In over 2 hours of time I have managed just 2 games. That is absurd any way you look at it.\n\nThe problem boils down to this: \n\n-Games are hosted client-side by the Killer, who opens a lobby and waits for four Surviors to fill it.  The server ends as soon as the game ends. You then have to go through the MMing all over again to find a new game. \n\n-Playing the Killer is way more appealing than playing the Survivors, and you need FOUR times as many Survivors as you do Killers in matchmaking for equalilbrium. The numbers are obviously no where near that, thus resulting in extremely long queue times. tl:dr too many people want to play Killer.\n\n-There is no party system in place, so you have to time when you enter the queue and hope you end up with friends. This results in a Killers lobby being filled with 4 Survivors (after a several minutes wait), only to have 2 of them immediately back out when they realize they aren't with their friends. The remaining 2 survivors stick around for a bit, but when nobody else shows up after a few minutes they invetibly leave as well, leaving the Killer to start the process all over.\n\nI think the game needs to move to a dedicated server system, where players stick around after matches and the Killer rotates. I know I would be a lot more willing to queue as a Survivor if I knew eventually I would be able to play as a Killer without having to go through MMing again.\n\nAs it stands, if you want to play as a Killer, good freaking luck.","timestamp_created":1465966057,"timestamp_updated":1465966057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23564196","author":{"steamid":"76561198169308677","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":32648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1348,"playtime_at_review":2018,"last_played":1660180679},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1465966043,"timestamp_updated":1505623855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23564184","author":{"steamid":"76561197970567854","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1465966795},"language":"english","review":"This is still early Access\n\ncant rebind keys , cant change mouse sensitivity , cant indepth tweak graphic settings , cant change fov","timestamp_created":1465965969,"timestamp_updated":1465966008,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516918301582336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23564179","author":{"steamid":"76561198081532434","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1375,"last_played":1648519097},"language":"english","review":"Get all of the generators, then the killer teleports to me. \nRing a ding ding motha fucka.\nI get hooked, he chills right in front of me, teammates do absolutely nothing. \nI die.

The mechanics feel very fleshed out and, to me at least, playing as a helpless survivor was fun, too.  I'll just get to the \"TL;DR Buy\" recommendation now because the biggest issue with this game is a lack of players.\n\nI was curious how well the \"start generator, exit level\" mechanic would work.  The catch with the generators is that at random intervals you will need to time a button press or else the generator will make a loud noise and alert the hunter to your position.  So while you're basically just sitting there listening for the hunter indicator to go off, you're also paranoid about when the prompt will pop up and be able to react to it.  I'm not too big a fan of the quick time events, but they work well enough.\n\nI was also worried that it would be a bad balance between hunter and the hunted, but I think it works fairly well.  Checking closets for victims takes a good 5 or so seconds, so if you're chasing someone and you stop to check a closet, they may end up losing you (which is easy to do) or if you decide to follow the way you think they went, they can slip out of the closet you decided not to check ... or from behind some rocks you didn't even notice.  As a \"victim\", with the maps being randomized to a extent (of course, it's so dark that you couldn't really tell anyway) it's all about thinking on your feet.  Even though you can't fight\n\nThere's still a couple of things that need to be worked on for this to be a solid recommendation.  One thing would be steamworks integration so I can invite people to a public match.  Another would DEFINITELY be a re-evaluation of the item system - you apparently lose items you unlock through the skill tree if you die (which, as a victim, is likely), and without a more outlined way to get them back again, it just seems like a waste of skill points and, ultimately, a waste of a skill system.  The biggest problem the game has right now is a lack of playerbase, and waiting for a full server can be a serious waiting game (and disappointment when you FINALLY have a full match and then someone leaves)\n\nOverall, though, there is a lot to like here.  The mechanics are simple enough, though some of the more specific nuances of the mechanics (like the above mentioned generator QTE or how your skill-tree items can be simply gone because you died) are not explained.  Still, for $20 ($17.99 right now), it's a pretty good game.  There's already room for expansions, like more characters and hunters, different clothing options and so on which I think could be cool - but again, being a Starbreeze published game, I'm scared they may push it down the same path to DLC Hell.  However, as long as they can control themselves, I think the devs have made something really nice here - and proof that multiplayer CAN actually be a scary experience.\n\nTL;DR Buy the game so we can have more players","timestamp_created":1465962825,"timestamp_updated":1465962825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23563663","author":{"steamid":"76561198049701098","num_games_owned":3670,"num_reviews":832,"playtime_forever":50449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48393,"last_played":1658602257},"language":"english","review":"This is now my sixth, and final, revision of my Dead by Daylight review.\n\nAs a day one player, screw you Behaviour.\n\nI bought your cosmetics.
