Up and at 'em, back to the hook with you.\"\n\n\"Now Meg, how many times have I told you not to climb around on the windows? I said there were bear traps but did you listen? Think about it while you're in time out.\"\n\nOnce I started getting good enough to beat the window-cheesers and unhookers the salt went away, now I just feel this paternal, \"I told you so\" disappointment. It's a weird feeling I've never seen in a game before. When I catch you trying some bullshit you should've known wouldn't work I just shake my head and carry you off to time out.\n\nThis all happens because you keep staying at Uncle Wraith's house. He lets you do anything you want.

Как кнопки забиты, так и будут. Использую Key Remapper\n- Графика слабая, про ходу U3, не настраивается доп опциями\n- Тебя будут убивать первым по началу тк ты не умеешь играть\n- Исключительно кооператив с живыми людьми, нет локальной игры, чтоб потренироваться с ботами\n- После 5 часов игры страх уходит что был в начале\n- Инди составляющая так и прёт из всех щелей. Не доделанная (анимация, графика и тд)\n- Нельзя убить маньяка и дать ему пинка (по началу уж точно)\n- Маньячилла бегает быстрее тебя, так что от него удрать можно только в 15% случая (спрятавшись, если повезёт), а если ранен, то убежать шансов - 5-10%.. или меньше. Я пару раз смог... :)\n\nИх плюсов\n- Первые часа 2-3 ты будешь обсираться от страха и стресса, тк играть-то ты не умеешь! А это то, ради чего в неё играю! И это главный и единственный плюс - атмосфера страха и безисходности! :))\n\nНи разу не играл за маньяка, тк за выжившими и так оч весело убегать от него!\nМаньяка можно в лицо осветить фонариком, он затупливает чутка, можно взять карту (заработать) которая показывает не долго где какие фонари врубить\n\nКаждый из 4х персонажей прокачивается отдельно. Пока не очень понял то дерево навыков (и можно брать ништяки что открыл, только разок, потом испаряются), тк всё на инглише. Смог убежать - 5000 баллов, плюс зарабатываешь включая прожекторы. На эту \"бабосы\" уже и прокачиваешься.\n\nНе смотря на минусы, которые ты обходишь и привыкаешь со временем, они уже не так критичны и не бросаются в глаза так сильно (ну кроме ходьбы маньяка, он пипец как криво анимирован, прямо таки Майкл Джексон с лунной походной, только вперёд? а не назад :). Игра просто мастхев для тех кто хочет пощекотать нервы, поймать тазик адреналина, сердце поныкать в пятки и отлично устрашиться!\n\nАтмосфера - 15 из 10\nРеализация остального 6 из 10 (жёсткое инди)\n\nКрайне рекомендую попугаться!\n\nPS Сперва на ночь я зассал играть, по сему играл на след день, днём :)))))))))))) Та же фигня была когда ещё Left4Dead вышел - боялся зомби и играть в неё.

There have been games that i de-ranked even though i killed 3 out of 4 survivors and had all 5 engines intact. \n\nThis game punishes you for being good, if you kill the survivors fast enough you might not get all the bloodpoints needed for a rank up. That goes for the survivors as well, if your team is really good chances are that you will get a low amount of bloodpoints and thereby de-rank. \n\nI will probably continue play this game, but i really cant recommend it in its current state.

After 50 hours of gameplay with this fun little gem, I would have to highly recommend this to anyone that is interested in horror and/or multiplayer oriented games. Firstly, let me say I knew nothing about this game until the day it came out, in which I looked at one gameplay video (thank you Steam Queue) and immediately bought the game. Dead by Daylight is a 4v1, meaning it has asymmetrical multiplayer. Four players work together as Survivors, while the lone player plays as a homicidal killer. The four survivors must work together in repairing generators, finding items, distracting and hiding from the killer, saving each other, and ultimately escaping the level. Whereas the killer has only one objective in mind: Hook the survivors to sacrifice them to the godly being only known as The Entity. With machete, hooked axe, or hammer in hand, they meticulously hunt down the survivors and strike them with painful weapons to bring them to a crawl. The game is a constant rush for both the killer and the survivor, and after 50 hours I still shake in my boots when trying to escape from a relentless killer.\n\nPros:\n- Asymmetrical Multiplayer\n- Very unique premise, only other game that is like it is Friday the 13th, which is not out yet\n- Four unique survivors each with unique perks associated with said character\n- Three unique killers, each with their own perks and special weapons specifically meant to kill survivors\n- Unique leveling system that is procedurally generated, giving access to wide varieties of weapons, add-ons that augment the effects of said items, perks, and offerings a.k.a burn cards to slightly change how a match will be played out\n- Levels are somewhat procedurally generated, being made randomly from tiles in a tileset.\n- Prestige system for those who love to just keep going\n- Always heart pumping for both sides of the field\n- No two matches are the same\n- Support from devs via livestreams and active updates, first update came out less than a week after release\n- Will be supported with free and paid DLC\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat buggy at times, my experience has only really seen massive framerate drop to the point where it is nearly unplayable, but it usually fixes itself. There are discussions about odd bugs in this game\n- May be repetitive for some\n- Late game progression is lackluster, prestige only gives different clothing that has blood, may not be worth it for some\n- Currently there are tactics in the game that are frustrating for both sides, but this is an issue with any competitive game, cheap tactics will be found\n- No party mode with friends CURRENTLY, it is being added soon\n- Community has a noteworthy disconnecting issue, although this does not inherently make the game worse, since it is multiplayer based, this greatly affects one's experience with the game\n\nOverall, I would have to say that Dead by Daylight is a great title for anyone looking to pick up something very unique. To me, it is endless hours of fun and excitement, and I have been a gamer for nearly 20 years. For only $20 dollars, this game is extremely worthwhile for its price.

But right now, waaaay too many problems. The game is was a blast at first, but here are some of the many issues I've run into:\n-de-ranked due to disconnecters in the game despite having sufficient points to rank. not sure how this happens\n-killer cant hope to rank up when people disconnect and will derank at the conclusion of a match due to not enough points being available because of lack of survivors\n-as killer, I killed two people and then randomly tons of other players randomly spawn. The game crashed after I had gone through killing a couple dozen, unmoving people in a single match in a game meant only for 4. Happened three times in a row. I did not get anything for playing the match\n-window hopper glitch where a survivor hops a window around a corner, but due to me being close I get stuck on the corner of the building. was forced to disconnect\n-played two games where three survivors surrounded me in crouch as I was carrying someone and game wouldnt let me drop who I was carrying or hit the ones around me. Was funny at first, but people are starting to figure it out and it happened a bunch\n-got stuck inside a pushed down pallet as survivor\n-ran into a couple of level 3 survivors who were rank 1.

So that this review can be as helpful as possible.\n\nOverall Score : 8/10 - Fun experience as both survivor and killer, but does have some flaws.\nLooks of game : 8/10 - It doesn't have the best graphics, but it really doesnt need to (will go into this more later)\nPlaying as Survivor : 9/10 - easy to learn how to control, easy objectives, overall fun.\nPlaying as Killer : 9/10 - this is my favorite, it is a little harder to figure out, but once you do, so much fun\nOther Players currently: anywhere from a 5/10 - 10/10 ; this one is hard, because you can have 5 matches in a row with people that don't disconnect, don't hop windows, etc. or it can happen every match you play in one day.\n\nI will now try to break this down the best I can, Also this review is the game state of patch 1.0.1, any changes in the game will not be reflected in my review.\n\nStarting with my least high score : Other Players\nAs of patch 1.0.1 there sadly is a large amount of players that are taking advantage of some design flaws in the infrastructure of the game. \nHere is a list so you know what to expect:\n1 - If you are playing a game and don't like what is happening, you can alt f4 out or disconnect your internet, this causes you to leave the game and not lose any addons, perks, and your rank. (Rank is number one reason people leave a match)\n\n2 - because of problem #1 it ruins the game for not just killers but survivors a like, If you are playing killers your chances of ranking up has diminished and same with survivors - so to fix this players have been quiting lobbies as soon as a low rank is seen, causing grief for the players that actually earned their rank.\n\n3 - window hopping: I personally have no problem with this, but it is discussed in the forums as a problem area for some.\n\n4- one problem that players have also caused is the killers camping, once again it does not bother me, but others see it as a problem.\n\nThat is all of the problems that I have read about or encountered on my own. Sadly it is not the game's fault but because of people being people, the Devs will have to work on this, and it sounds like they are.\n\nPlaying as the Killer: \nFun, exciting. Imagine that your playing hide and seek and your the seeker, that is what I think the killer feels like, I have no complaints I like all three killers, some more than others but thats me. My favorite is the Hillbilly. \n\nPlaying as survivor : I like it, i'm not good at it. I always get caught, but that is part of the game. It still has its rewarding moments when you escape with the killer right behind you.\n\nlooks of the game:\nIt is not the most beautiful game to look at, but it is a horror game that is suppose to be creepy, I think that its dull looks make it more creepy so it works out, plus it gives gamers with smaller PCs the chance to play.\n\nSo overall I like the game, I feel anybody that likes to get scared or be the scarer will like this game. It has a few bugs, but what games doesn't, if you want a bug free game, then wait. Hopefully issues will be fixed and players will become genuine gamers that want to make the game better too.\n\nSo I hope this review helped you out, and cut right to the point.\n\nJimmy Nerdtron\n\n","timestamp_created":1466785115,"timestamp_updated":1466785115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23760394","author":{"steamid":"76561198097496498","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":124223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3213,"playtime_at_review":754,"last_played":1660593344},"language":"english","review":"Perfect game to harass yourself with.","timestamp_created":1466784075,"timestamp_updated":1622646611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483084291219711304","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23760352","author":{"steamid":"76561198056818010","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":179402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1701,"playtime_at_review":5382,"last_played":1660583795},"language":"english","review":"2018 Update!\n\nThe game now has fully functioning Survive with Friends which is primarily why it's now a thumbs up!!
