Ein weiterer GROßER Punkt ist das Verhalten der Killer-SPieler. Campen sei laut Entwicklern erlaubt, aber das Juken gar nicht! Somit haben sich die Entwickler dieses Spiels eine Falle in den Weg gestellt. Spieler, die Überlebende spielen, beklagen sich permanent bezüglich des Campens der Killer-Spieler. Ein Lichtblick sehen die Überlebenden gar nicht, da sich die Entwickler dagegen sträuben, irgendetwas gegen das Campen zu unternehmen. Kaum war das Spiel im Herbst 2016 als Hype anzusehen, ist der drastische Abstieg im Frühjahr 2017 zu bemerken. Das Game ist in den Augen vieler Spieler eher schlecht als recht geworden.\nStatt dem Eingehen auf ALLE (d.h. Überlebende UND Killer) Spieler der Community, wird hier nur in eine Richtung gesteuert, in die der Killer-Spieler. Die DLCs, die immer wieder rausgebracht werden, machen das Spiel nicht zu einem Spielvergnügen, sondern zu einer Maschinerie der Geldmacherei.\n\nZu den Entwicklern: Ihr könnt euer Game in euren verfickten A***** stecken. Eure Ingame-Regeln sind der größte Rotz, das Game ist KACKE und macht KEINEN SPAß!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMain Fazit: Lasst die Finger von diesem Game und kauft euch für das Geld lieber Spiele wie H1Z1, Resident Evil 7, etc. Dort ist das Geld auch sicher angelegt!\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeit langem wieder DBD angespielt und ich weiß wieder warum ich dieses Drecksspiel damals aufgehört hatte.

Second, the game still feels like it's in BETA with tons of bugs and game ruining flaws. There has been no information or updates from the developer about plans to fix this.\n\n1. Finding a match - for an online game in 2016, this feels like Battle.net 1.0 which is 20 years old. You will likely find yourself clicking the mouse button many more times to join a game than during the actual game itself. Can the developer not afford to use their own dedicated servers? Having the killer's PC act as a host is bad on so many levels.\n2. Spawn locations - the game is programmed to have the killer spawn next to survivor(s), which is no fun.\n3. Matchmaking - the algorithm is terrible. The killer can see who is in the lobby but the survivors can't see who they're facing? I've been in many matches with a rank 1 killer, and 4 rank 15-20 survivors. Keep it all anonymous or all transparent.\n4. LAG - The game really needs dedicated servers for various regions so it's an even playing field. I could purposely throttle my bandwidth, play as a killer, and I'll win every time. If you're in a laggy game, it's impossible to do any kind of micro control.\n5. Maps - The killer does not need to see where the generators are... they are in similar spots everytime, and being able to see where the hooks are is enough\n6. Camping Hooks - Is this the game the developers want? The risk/reward for helping your teammates isn't worth it with no penalty for killer's camping you. A killer can easily PIP while camping hooks. As a survivor you get the same points for sabotaging a hook than risking your life to save a teammates.\n7. The flashlight - is useless. The game could use more item variety.\n8. Skill checks - you WILL make noise when stopping a skill check due to you hearing the killer coming in your area. This happens maybe 50% of the time. You stop the repair/sabotage only to find out there was a skill check happening 0.5 seconds later. This should not happen! You do not even hear the auditory alert by the time you let go of the mouse button. You should be able to stop an action without a penalty like this. You absolutely cannot prevent this from happening.\n9. Bugs - For weeks I've noticed bugs where you can get stuck in the map and can't move, or the killer can pick you up but also gets stuck.\n10. Hatch locations - need to be easier to find, some maps they are very easy, while others are very random and nearly impossible to find in time. If the match gets to this point, why make it harder on the survivor?\n\nFinal thoughts - It's a fun game when it works right, but in my experience the amount of time you have to put in to get that experience is quite a lot. Be prepared for a lot of frustration and hours.","timestamp_created":1469492379,"timestamp_updated":1469492379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24528107","author":{"steamid":"76561198313243427","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":68,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1660186192},"language":"english","review":"Loved this game.\nNever seen anything like it.\nYou can be the killer or the survivor. and everyone you play with is real!","timestamp_created":1469491972,"timestamp_updated":1469491972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24528023","author":{"steamid":"76561198206802888","num_games_owned":615,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":6671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5284,"last_played":1627993678},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏性不错~题材有趣~ 希望早日出中文版本~希望早日修改bug~","timestamp_created":1469491612,"timestamp_updated":1469491612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24527883","author":{"steamid":"76561198043464644","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1568990647},"language":"schinese","review":"Dead by Daylight\n是一款不错的游戏，四名求生者和一个屠夫\n不足是bug太多了，还有匹配的问题，四个20级的求生者匹配到1级的屠夫\n（游戏中20级是最低的，1级最高）\n有时候会卡在loading的画面，每次与基友组队的时候要不停地按ready。\n另外！\n快加入中文啊！\nWe need Chinese please !","timestamp_created":1469490783,"timestamp_updated":1469490783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24527663","author":{"steamid":"76561198312019971","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":739,"last_played":1654849518},"language":"schinese","review":"真的很不错，太棒了","timestamp_created":1469489705,"timestamp_updated":1469489705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24527642","author":{"steamid":"76561198080690140","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1780,"last_played":1599710956},"language":"english","review":"From the recent patch the game has gotten better but the killer seems kinda op, but I'm only a killer so I shouldn't be complaining","timestamp_created":1469489607,"timestamp_updated":1469750942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24527535","author":{"steamid":"76561198215938589","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1613064128},"language":"czech","review":"Hra je zabugovaná, špatně se hledá lobby (vůbec jí to nechce najít).

[b]Lobbysuche/-system:[/b] Als einzelner Überlebender hat man weniger Probleme, aber sobald man 2 oder mehr Personen ist, wirds enorm nervig nach einer/m Lobby/Killer zu suchen. Zum einen bricht die Suche nach einem fehlgeschlagenen Verbindungsversuch einfach ab, woraufhin sich alle wieder auf Ready schalten müssen und es fällt kaum auf wenn es abbricht. Die Zeit zwischen Rdy und Abbruch variert zufällig zwischen 3 Sek bis 30 Sek. Wird ein Killer gefunden, passiert es oft, dass mindestens ein Mitglied der Party nicht in der Spiellobby landet und der ganze spass nochmal von Vorne losgeht.\n\n2. [b]Gameplay:[/b] 4 Überlebende vs 1 Killer so weit so gut. Von Weitem betrachtet spielt sichs ausgeglichen... doch halt! schauen wir uns das doch etwas genauer an! Zum einen gibts sogenannte Jukespots an denen man den killer endlos an der Nase rumführen kann auf fast jeder Map (sofern mans schafft da hin zu kommen mit dem killer hinter einem) und er kann einen da nur kriegen wenn man sich sehr dumm anstellt. Andererseits gibt es die eine Map auf der man den Killer nicht mehr abschütteln kann weil es kaum bis keine Paletten, überspringbare Mauern oder Schränke gibt.\n\n3. [b]Bugs und Glitches:[/b] Hängenbleiben an glatten Mauern, Hängenbleiben an 5 cm Rissen im Boden, ewiges durch den Boden fallen, aufgehängt werden doch es sieht aus stünde man unter dem Haken und man kann nicht befreit werden, uvm\n\n4. [b]Übersimpifizierte Steuerung:[/b] Basissteuerung ist klar: WASD + Shift + Ctrl + Maus. Das [u]Problem[/u]? Alle Aktionen und Interaktionen liegen auf der linken Maustaste (ML). Was so schlimm daran ist? Nun wenn man Jemanden aufhängt und 1-2 Fallen vor ihn legt, kann man in der Eile nicht sicher sein welche Aktion man ausführt, weil alle Aktionen (Retten, Falle sabotieren, Falle entschärfen) auf ML liegen.\n\n\n[b]Vorläufiges Fazit[/b]\n\nIch will dieses Spiel wirklich mögen, weil es ein vielversprechendes Konzept ist, das richtig ausgeführt viele Stunden Spass bringt. Momentan ist es zu unfertig um auf lange Sicht spass daran zu haben und sich nicht zu nerven weil man 15 minuten suchen muss bis die Party es mit in die Lobby schafft, um dann rausgekickt zu werden, weil dem killer der Rank oder das Prestige von einem Survivor nicht passt. Manche Perks des Killers müssten auch hart generft oder ganz entfernt werden, weil sie den Killer zum Aufgehängte campen animieren. Während Survivors einige total unnütze Perks haben.\nSeit dem Release läufts auch extrem langsam mit Bugfixes und neuen Features, wobei mir die Fixes eindeutig wichtger sind.\n\nDeswegen von mir vorerst [b]keine Empfehlung[/b].\n\nSchaut euch das Gameplay auf YT und Twitch gut an bevor ihrs kauft, und sollte es euch nicht passen refunded es lieber und wartet ab ob sie aktiv daran

Playing solo was already painful enough with all these trash randoms doing nothing but urban evading, but now it's just ridiculously unfun. Looks like now the \"balance\" is to spoonfeed any noob killer with 4k every game. Having over 4k hours and playing both sides I know how easy killer is if you have at least some brain, that's why playing killer was always less interesting for me since it's just boring. If you still can't win as a killer, it's simply a case of git-gudness.\n\nIn the beginning of the game there were infinites, jungle gyms, sprint burst and selfcare perks had barely any cooldown, sabotaged hooks didn't respawn, windows didn't get blocked, gens were done half faster and couldn't be broken, there was pretty much no aura reading perks (\"we use bbq only for points\" haHAA) and guess what? Good killers still managed to kill everyone! And what do we have now?\n\nKillers constantly cry on forums and ever since we have this new community manager who is trash at killer as well, survivors keep getting everything gutted. Self care and sprint burst got nerfed already several times, bnp and insta heal are completely destroyed, changes (read nerfs) to flashlights, toolboxes, pallettes, exhaustion etc...the long list continues. Sure they buffed some useless perks but we all know noone is going to use them anyway (if they want to survive and get decent points and not just memeing around, that is).\n\nNow, killers complain about pallet-looping and, oh god, \"gen rush\". I'll remind you once again, the gen repair time was already extended twice, there was no gen kicking or Hex:Ruin or Pop before, and, by the way, it's a surv main objective, especially since so many killers prefer camping as such a valid and nice strategy, lul. As for pallet-looping, again, back in the early game, noone was looping, why? Was the maps' design different? No, there was simply no need to, survivors could survive without it. Right now survivors are forced to pallet-loop (and by the way most of them don't even enjoy it since it's just boring), because it's the only thing to either buy time for your teammates or just save yourself. And I haven't even spoken about camping and tunnelling since it's \"legit strategies\", right, sooo much fun for both sides.\n\nAlso instead of fixing the core of the game, broken hitboxes, awful matchmaking and tons of other bugs devs prefer to introduce new horrible animations, which negatively affect survivor's movement, and horrible mobile-like UI, cluttering all the screen - pretty much the things noone asked for that were made just for the sake of updating something.\n\nSo, umm, yeah, sad to see the pretty-good-job-so-far-devs continuing destroying their own game.","timestamp_created":1469459521,"timestamp_updated":1612902705,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555504441261291504","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24519718","author":{"steamid":"76561198139811039","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1527204247},"language":"german","review":"Hallächen meine Freunde\nNach den 2 Videos gibts die Ausführliche Review.\n\nFür alle die wissen möchten warum das Spiel auch Lobby Simulator genannt wird: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DSzHABJaAY&feature=youtu.be\n\nFür alle die gerne Gameplay sehen möchten: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlrhZibRcJY&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nDead by Daylight ist ein Spiel, welches sich im groben am Spiel Evolved richtet.\nEs gibt insgesamt 5 Spieler. \n4 müssen versuchen zu entkommen, das tun Sie indem Sie generatoren aktivieren und dann durch eines der Exits fliehen.\nSollte ein Spieler letzer überlebender sein, kann er durch eine Luke im Boden entkommen, welche sich dann öffnet.\n\nDer Jäger muss natürlich versuchen, die 4 Opfer zu fangen.

Dann muss ein anderer Spieler einschreiten um das Opfer zu retten, ansonsten war es das und man stirbt.\nLeider campen die Jäger deutlich zu oft sodass es unmöglich ist andere Spieler zu befreien.\n\nGenerell ist das Spiel durch seine Auslegung, Punkte zu machen, aktuell kaum spielbar.\nJäger Campen einzelne Opfer egal ob Sie dadurch verlieren oder gewinnen und andere Spieler machen nur Generatoren ohne Teamplay oder Hilfe.\n\nAuch das es nicht Möglich ist zu kommunizieren ist ein großes Problem\nGenerell empfehle ich aktuell nur mit Freunden und festen Regeln zu spielen.

warning. Expect spelling mistakes)\n\nNow for starter. This game have pros and cons, like every other game out there.\n\nDead by Daylight is a horror survival game, but the differents with this game compared to most horror survivals. Is the fact that the killer is another player. You can of course play killer yourself (That's my favorite thing to do in this game. If I am not playing with my friends) The game have perks for both survivors and killers, which can change the game just with the perks alone. But there is also different killers which have different special abilities.\n\nAs the survivor. You will be with aditional three other survivors. You'll have to search, hide, run and repair generators. Whell you try to repair the generators, the killer is trying to find you and kill you. You cannot fight the killer, you can only run and hide. There is different opsitcals on the map that you can use. In order to win as the survivor, you will have to repair 5 generators and then open the escape doors, then you can run and you \"won\". There is also a safety for if the other survivors die or escape. There will be a hatch which will open and you will no longer have to repair the generators. You can just run out of that.\n(There are different survivors to play with different perks. But perks can become \"teachable\" which allows all the other survivors you have to unlock them)\n\nAs the killer. You will have to choice how you want to hunt the four survivors. By at the very start you will choice what killer you want to play as. The killers basic ability is pretty much the same on all killers, just a simple attack that will hurt a survivor. (In most situations. They will require two hits to get downed. But there is things that can change that so that you only will need one)\nBut every killer have an uniq ability they can use to help them hunt the survivors. All killers special ability are powerfull if used right. So it's importen to use a killer that matches your play style. The killer is honestly the hardest thing to play in this game, it sounds weird but you also have to remember that its a 1v4. The survivors can use teamwork to outplay or outsmart you. But master the killer and you will become unstopable. But as the killer, it's really just about outsmarting the survivors. Since they have to cordinate there moves a lot more then you. You can use that for your advanges. But remember that hatch thing I mentioned? Well as the killer if you find that first. You can close it, but it have cost. You will power the remaning generators. So if you choice to close the hatch, there will be two gates to keep an eye out for now. But they require to be opened by the survivor and that takes some time.\n\nNow for pros and cons\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nPros: \n\n- The game is replayable, with all the different was you will be forced to play. Depeding on what perks the killer/survivors use. As well as what kind of killer you face as the survivor. \n\n- The game is a lot of fun with friends, if you are 5 guys together. You can play a mode called (Kill your friends) where one of you will be the killer and the rest survivor. (This will not progress anything or affected rank in anyway. You wont even get xp. XP is called blood points)\n\n- Blood points (The xp in the game) is used for everything in the game. If you get blood points as a killer. You can choice to use that on the killer you just used or you can use it on a different killer. But you are not just locked to that, you can use the blood points on your survivors too. The same goes the other way around. \n\n- A lot of things to unlock. So you will pretty much always have something to progress towards.\n\n- A ranked system so that you can face killers/survivors around the same \"skill level\" as yourself. The rank system does not require a \"win\" to progress. You just have to do enough to do it. Both as killer and survivor. This is a very good thing for the game, cause you might like to be a hero and help your team. But the heroes almost always dies. So this way you can be support and still progress your rank.\n\n- All though this game is not really scary as the survivor (Imo). The game can still be heart racing, specially when you see the killer. The game rewards people who can think straight under presure and are able to think fast too. \n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nCons:\n\n- Some perks or offerings (Basicly a consumable powerup you can use as killer and survivor. Those pretty much the same as perks. Just different assists you get and they are more powerfull in some ways.) are extremly broken. Which can make the game really unfair (mostly as survivor. But it goes the other way around too). It's not a huge problem, since all perks have a counter and you can still win agaisnt them, if you play your cards right. \n\n- The community is extremely toxic (Some even claim its worse the League of legends, but I don't play that game so I can't tell if its true or not). Just the other day I tried a fellow survivor pointer out my position to the killer and people get really angry. But whell you are in game there is no chat what so ever. (Which is why survivor is more fun with friends)\n\n- As mentioned above. There is no chat in the game, no voice chat or text chat. There is a text chat in the lobby before a game and after a game. This makes it really hard to work together with random survivors.\n\n- The rank system have a reset  (I don't know how long it take between each) Which then downgrade everyone's rank a little bit. Which does that if you don't play the game often. You can be as good as a ranked 1 killer. But always been stuck in rank 20. Then you wont have much of a challeges in the game.\n\n- The game can bit a little bit Pay to win, cause some perks are really strong. But require dlc's to get.","timestamp_created":1469448945,"timestamp_updated":1560204823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24517317","author":{"steamid":"76561198116518050","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2262,"last_played":1638907925},"language":"german","review":"Gutes Spiel!
