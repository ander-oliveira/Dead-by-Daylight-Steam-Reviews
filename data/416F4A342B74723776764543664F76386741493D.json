And they do have Bill from Left for Dead as one of the survivors! The killers look terrifying. \n\nMany dead things and blood around to give it that horror atmosphere. So cool in loading screen survivors huddled around camp fire then when playing killer you are in the woods looking at them around the campfire. \n\nWhen you get hit by the killer to injured state blood dripping out looks freaky. And nothing better than when seeing the killer wipe his bloody weapon after a hit. \n\nSound effects are really good, building up all around you for that immersion. Absolutely terrifying when you suddenly hear the killer’s heartbeat when he gets close. And as it gets louder your own heartbeat does too, beating out of your chest! When you then get chased by the killer the heartbeat is replaced by a thriller chase music unique to the killer, which is brilliant and terrifying. When you are a killer and the music changes to a chase theme it’s thrilling.\n\nSome killers have unique sounds like humming or music and roars, all absolutely terrifying. \n\nWhen you are working on fixing the generators and turning a screw here and tweaking a wire there, making all this noise and then suddenly a skill check comes and if you missed it because you were already pis*ing yourself and then the bang comes and now you are fuc*ed! All terrifying. \n\nObject collision needs some work in the game. Healing each other looks really bad. Hanging with the hook in the body doesn't look realistic.  \n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nIt’s great that you can choose to either be the survivor or killer and can start your own lobby to play with friends.  4 main areas that you can get points in for the killers and survivors seems to work well to balance out play. However, maybe there could be other better ways to organise this. Maybe if one survivor escapes, then all survivors get some points for that. Or if you had points for survivors subtract points from killer type thing that might help stop killer camping, which is an issue.    \n\nInteresting perks, that are just powerful enough to make it difficult to decide which 4 to choose, but also diverse enough to choose what best fits your playstyle. However, there are clear top tier perks to use. The Bloodpoints system to get perks and add ons seems to work well, and I really like how after you upgrade the perks enough you can teach them to other characters. Really appreciate also being able to purchase perks in store with in-game currency, different ones each week, even if you have not bought that character.\n\nWell done to developers on the different maps and the randomized tiles so one can’t memorise locations so easily. \n\nSurvivor\n\nThe survivor fantasy is done very well and it really feels like you are playing out somebody trying to escape death in a b-horror film. There is constant tension, dread, terror. And when you are hiding behind the generator and twisting the knobs and pulling the wires and screwing the bolts and then you hear and then see the killer stalking its prey - should you run, should you stay where you are. God help me! And then the skill check pops up and it all cleverly just does enough to keep you on edge. \n\nBeing carried by the killer is terrifying. Being on the hook is terrifying. Entity spider claw thing monster is strange but all adds to the mysterious, terrifying atmosphere. There is nothing more terrifying than when you finally fix all the generators and you are at the exit door charging it up to open and you are so close to escaping and then you hear the dreaded heartbeat and then see the killer running towards you with his bloody weapon and rage. \n\nVery fun to play with mates and helping each other off the meat hooks and healing each other and popping gens together and escaping to live another day. Love also the little touches that you can send each other messages before you start or after the game you can say good game or call the killer a camping bastard. Overall a very good co-op experience.  \n\nThe three times hooked or the too long on hook and then you die is a good design. I’m not a fan of the killer being able to kill sometimes the survivor right away.  \n\nPlaying in the third person as a survivor and having the advantage of better situational awareness and getting to see the psychopath killer from different angles works well. \n\nThe torch use is a hit or miss and seems to need some tweaking.  \n\nThrowing in the randomly spawned hatch as a last attempt getaway adds another level of terrifying fun.  \n\nKiller\n\nVery interesting decision to give different perspectives to killers and survivors. The first person, narrower field of view works well for the killer who is obsessed with their prey. \n\nWhen I finally played the killer and picked up my first survivor and then really struggled to get them to the hook because they were wiggling all over the place, it really hit home how well the developers have done with the different perspectives and how awesome asymmetrical games can be.\n\nWhen you play the killer the emotion switches from being terrified to more of a panic, especially when you hear the generators pop off completed. Because the killer cannot die, the failure is to let the survivors escape. My first time playing the killer I didn’t get one person on the hook and all survivors escaped. I was so embarrassed. I’m a killer and I can’t even kill anybody :-( \n\nReally great the diversity of killers in the game, recognizable ones as Ghostface and Freddy and Jason etc. \n\nThe scratch marks the survivors leave is an interesting design. But I find that if you take top tier survivors against top tier killers, the killer usually wins. So maybe those scratch marks help a bit too much. Overall I find the survivors to be too vulnerable and once a good killer sees you it’s very difficult to escape, pallets and loops only really delaying the inevitable.

Каждый убийца имеет свои особенные навыки,  + дополнительные плюшки. Поэтому к каждому персонажу приходится привыкать. \nМногие говорят, что маньяков делают слишком имбовее: они быстрее передвигаются, их нельзя атаковать и так далее. Однако готов сказать, что многое зависит:\n1, От скилла  самого убийцы \n2. От скилла выживших \n3. От, непосредственно, самих билдов умений как убийцы, так и выживших.\nТаким образом, сложно что-то говорить о балансе, так как многое зависит от конкретного игрока и выбранных им умений.\nИ под итог я бы хотел сделать единственно замечание - это слишком громкие крики, когда убийцы вешает выжившего на крюк - прям уши режет.

started playing this game like for 2,5 years like on 2017,and i can say it was really funny and i had fun with the game.After 8 months i took the break with dbd because i sold my old PC so i couldn´t play any type of game like this.On the year 2019 i buyed a new gaming Pc and first step was DBD (dead by daylight) i joined this game everything was changed and it was a litlle bit weird.I saw there where new killers new DLC´s for the game i bought all of the DLC´s to see how they look like..There where  cool and fun but the bad thing beginns from here:I joined the first match that day and i sawed survivors are changed and the players sadly too.I can´t even explain that moment and my situation..I was suprised and sad,i will tell now why:In the year 2016,2017,i would recommend it to ALL players and gamers it was the best game of my life,but...in the year of 2018 and till now there are toooooo many toxic players like type of:teabagger´s flashlight spammers, tunnelers,campers and things like that...When someone is rank 20 or lower like i was with the killer rank 11 and in every freaking game i would get an toxic survivor who is flashlight spamming and teabagging on me,let´s say that better they were ruining my enyojment of the game i was angry because how can you feel good when someone who buys this game for like 10 or more dollars,does he needs to be ruined of toxic behaivor cause of idiots who are ruining the enyojment of other players.Btw sorry if my english is a little bit bad but i appologize.But in this year now 2020 i would not recommend this game, i am not even gonna talk about glitches and bugs in this game and too much VPN peoples and the worst thing is that developers are doing nothing about that.. If i am a developer of this game i would probably ban all the players who are being:TOXIC,Camping,flashlight spamming teabagging and other stuff.I just don´t want someone to ruin his day becuase of some toxic bastards in this year of the games like all games are maded for fun not for toxic bastards....I want to say one more thing about stupid players in this game:When i am playing with the killer i am not a tunneler camper toxic player or smth like that i am a normal player in this game i killed everybody and played how the rule is..But there are still idiots who are saying noob uninstall you can´t play because you killed them all.They hate when you have noed or stuff like that.BRO NOED IS PART OF THE STUPID GAME IT´S A PERK AND IT´S MADED FOR PLAYING SO I WOULD SAY TO ALL TOXIC BASTARDS IF YOU TEABAGG AND WANT TO BE TOXIC DON´T PLAY IT BECAUSE YOUR SOUL IS NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE!","timestamp_created":1586963386,"timestamp_updated":1586963386,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552845537662506104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67371568","author":{"steamid":"76561199039430035","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":137959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41570,"last_played":1634738749},"language":"swedish","review":"This game should be removed from Steam platform due to bad management, cheating and bugs.","timestamp_created":1586962816,"timestamp_updated":1609007121,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67370835","author":{"steamid":"76561198799625098","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1605873231},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1586962043,"timestamp_updated":1586962043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67370661","author":{"steamid":"76561199017499436","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":154934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135485,"last_played":1658326829},"language":"english","review":"So I have played DBD since 2018 when it first released on console, I have roughly 5k hours on the game spread out between PC, PS4 & even switch XD, so I will be completely honest and say that I absolutely love this game, It has it's moments of bugs and glitches but the game overall is a really fun growing game, if you are a horror fan then this game will definitely be for you. I will say that the DBD community not only has its toxic parts but you do find some very wholesome players and make genuine friendships along the way, I would not recommend this game to anyone who can be easily enraged as you will play with/against players who are more skilled than you at times as well as some players who just play toxic to piss you off.\n\nregarding matchmaking is extremely complicated to explain as it changes, however at the time of this review the matchmaking is based on your skill in the game which is separated from the in game ranking system. SBMM is very complicated to explain but it will require you to have some patience while your sbmm grows. the in game ranking system allows you to start from the worst rank to eventually keep playing to get to the best rank (Iri 1) each 13th of the month the games ranking system resets and you get awarded bloodpoints for both survivor and killer no matter your rank (the bp amount depends on your rank on surv and killer)\n\nThe game is constantly updated, new chapter releases every 3 months or so, with now a rift which includes a game pass for free cosmetics and charms, along with a purchasable premium pass for a lot more cosmetics, charms, auric cells etc. I have been streaming and playing this game for many years and I hopefully will continue to do so, I hope this review helps.","timestamp_created":1586961861,"timestamp_updated":1643775167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67370498","author":{"steamid":"76561198356459971","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3653,"last_played":1645608876},"language":"schinese","review":"永远的螺旋吃刀","timestamp_created":1586961699,"timestamp_updated":1586961699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67370390","author":{"steamid":"76561198325318260","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5503,"last_played":1639223538},"language":"schinese","review":"如果我理解生活我就喊人你知道什么继承人","timestamp_created":1586961599,"timestamp_updated":1586961599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67370199","author":{"steamid":"76561198375018677","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1584,"last_played":1626181129},"language":"russian","review":"помирает
