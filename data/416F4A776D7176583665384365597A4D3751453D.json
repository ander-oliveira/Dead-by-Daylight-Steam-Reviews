The asymmetrical (1v4) style of gameplay is very interesting and has only been utilized by a handful of games. The objectives of the game seem unique to any other game and that is part of the reason I have put so much time into this game. The other part is the large number of killers and customization to your load-out (as Killer or Survivor) that allow a wide variety of different styles of gameplay.\n\nNow, this review states that I do not recommend the game to others. This is why; The game has a lackluster-at-best team that has oversight on the balancing and general health of the game. They have no concept of \"fair\" gameplay and general game progression. As an example, a generator takes 80 seconds for 1 out of 4 Survivors to repair. A Killer can only chase one survivor at a time. With that said, a decent survivor can easily run a Killer for 80 seconds while the other three Survivors finish three separate generators. Beyond that, the team has time and time again reduced the power level of each Killer that has been re-worked or released over the past year. Nurse, Doctor, Oni, Spirit, Legion...Legion.... Legion... \n\nI am a Killer main, but I have also played Survivor for enough time to realize that playing a Survivor is boring if you're not being chased. Beyond that, the chase can still be boring if the Killer is sub-par. \n\nTo anyone that has read through all of this, I applaud you and hope for the best.\n\nPros:\n--Unique gameplay\n--Highly customizable loadout.\n--Frequent updates\n\nCons:\n--Too many bugs\n--Poor gameplay balancing\n--Boring Survivor gameplay\n--Consistent \"reworks\"","timestamp_created":1579824081,"timestamp_updated":1579824081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62299060","author":{"steamid":"76561198055090752","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":172707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1010,"playtime_at_review":62653,"last_played":1660604812},"language":"english","review":"Literally the shittiest game ever.

This system was originally meant to (rightfully) punish rage quitters but due to poor server maintenence it has resulted in innocent players being banned for no fault of their own.\n\nSadly my refund period has ended, but unless I see serious improvement SOON, I will be issuing a chargeback with my credit card company for being sold a \"fault/defective product\", which is a legitimate reason for a chargeback.\n\nI hope this helps people know not to buy this game until the devs fix it properly instead of being lazy and just trying to milk players for money by releasing more and more DLC while ignoring game-breaking bugs and server problems\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nMy thoughts as someone with 1000+ hours in the game..\n\nDBD is a really fun game when you first start playing and learning how everything works, such as perks, killer abilities, strategies, looping, etc.,\n\nBut once you have all of that figured out the fun diminishes rapidly.\n\nIt becomes less about skill and more about luck. If you have bad teammates, chances are you are going to lose. If you have a poor sport on your team who gets mad about being caught first and disconnects, chances are you are going to lose. If you are in a game against an OP Killer like the Nurse, chances are you are going to lose.\n\nIs it a fair game? No way! The game is heavily unbalanced in favor of the Killer. Escaping from the map isn't just a WIN. It's a HUGE Win. For the Survivors getting 2 Pips is all that is needed to win - whether you die or not.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nSure!

The killer experience is very different from the survivor experience, and you should know that I'm biased toward killer because I play killer the most, but I still play enough survivor to give a solid review. Allow me to begin with the Killer experience.\n\nAs a killer, you have to hook all survivors until they die permanently. This means hitting them twice to down them, which is not as easy as it sounds as sometimes a survivor is so skilled at using the environment to run you around in circles that even landing one hit is next to impossible. Certain killer abilities help you catching survivors, such as the Hillbilly who can use his chainsaw to down a survivor in a single hit. Nurse is the strongest killer by far with the ability to teleport- but expect to spend a lot of time getting dunked on while you practice blinking, it's not as simple as it sounds. Depending on the rank you are at, Killer goes from a casual taking out the trash to running in circles while your \"prey\" repeatedly points at you and spams crouch. A quick tip for newbie killers- break the damn pallet when survivors drop it- it might take time, but it will take considerably less time than running around while the survivor uses the pallet to avoid you easily. There are a lot of helpful guides to get better at killer (and survivor), so I recommend looking into the playstyle you are most interested in. Last note before I talk about survivors- Get Leatherface if you are interested in playing killer. Personally, I think Leatherface's playstyle is kind of boring, (albeit easy and effective) but his perks- specifically BBQ and Chili, are more than worth the price tag. You can grind him out if you want, but he's very cheap and worth picking up.\n\nNow for the Survivors- Your goal is to repair five generators (There are seven on the map, so don't worry about the killer guarding gens unless you leave the last three close together). After repairing the generators, you open the exit gates and escape! It's worth noting that while skilled survivors can easily win, it's not easy to play survivor early on. Bad teammates and inexperienced killers that think facecamping is a good strat (it works, but it gives very few bloodpoints and is generally boring and allows the remaining survivors to rush generators) tend to plague the lower ranks. Find some friends and group up, communication and collaboration can turn a bad game into a close but winning game. Quick tip on survivor- the only way to communicate with allies while you are not in comms with them is to \"wiggle\" on the hook. This means tapping left click, which will make your survivor \"wiggle\" as they try to escape from the hook.

But there are so many frustrating things about this game that if you're buying it on sale you need to know.\nThe devs care more about the survivor experience than the killers, without a doubt. if you read the patch notes that came out with the ruin 'update' you'll see what I mean. They describe every aspect of change from the survivors side, even the changes to a *killer's* ability and play-style was spoken about from the survivors, not the killer's, experience. Every change was justified by the impact it would have on how survivors experience the game. \nThey also attempt to balance the game around the newer players, the low to mid ranks. which means survivors of high rank, especially friends playing together which is an entirely different issue but is essentially un-fixable, will run circles around you even if you are trying your absolute hardest. Even a *win* in that situation was likely so stressful and such an ordeal it wasn't even fun, just a chore. as for the survivors themselves, expect t-bagging at every loop, at the exit gates when they almost  inevitably escape, body blocking, constant flashlight clicking to bait you into doing what they want and the always colourful end game chat where more often than not you're either verbally abused for something you did that made the game not fun for them, or mocked because they all got away and there wasn't a damn thing you could do to stop them.\nIf you do still want this game, you're best bet to get the most is to play both sides and try not to get the very vocal toxic aspects of the community ruin your time, if you can buy it with mates and play together do so, it makes the survivor games a lot more fun, even though it is part of the problem of why killer games can be frustrating to the point of madness, but there's nothing you can do about it besides try not to turn into the legitimately awful survivor mains that the devs are constantly pandering to.\n\nTL:DR the game itself is fun and can be a challenge, but the choices of the dev team in every update are targeted exclusively to new players and the toxic survivors of the community, unless you have friends to chill with and make the experience more fun, once you get to the higher ranks it wont be worth what you spent even on sale","timestamp_created":1579800890,"timestamp_updated":1579800890,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539989292621612549","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62284555","author":{"steamid":"76561198298880301","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":75531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":206,"playtime_at_review":38903,"last_played":1660595244},"language":"russian","review":"gl hf.
