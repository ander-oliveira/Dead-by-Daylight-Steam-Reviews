The game really has a lot of replay value, you will always be on your toes and will see something new or interesting each match. You will laugh, cry and scream. This game brings just about every emotion you can expect while also having a conflicting aspect to it. \n\nI don't play many games for hundreds of hours that don't bore me by then. This game is unique in it's own right and the experience is unique as well. This isn't just a shoot em up, adventurer, or platformer. This is a competitive horror game done right. \n\nSome of the downsides I can say is that you will experience bugs fairly often. Most of these are nothing game breaking, but the devs tend to take a while to address these issues. If it's game breaking, they will do their best to fix it as soon as possible. Dead By Daylight is a game that feeds on new content as well. This is not necessarily a downside (considering it's replay value) but new content is expected, regularly from the devs. It can take them a while (couple of months) to release new content that will make people keep coming back.\n\nAll in all, if you can look past the bugs and lack of timely content, - you WILL enjoy this game. There is a layer of insane, endless fun under the technical issues of this game and once you can see that, bugs and other issues will become almost insignificant. It is just too much fun and too much of a great idea to not recommend this game, regardless of some issues.","timestamp_created":1491200449,"timestamp_updated":1491200449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462339937686920166","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30916629","author":{"steamid":"76561198321471026","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":184852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64232,"last_played":1655517916},"language":"schinese","review":"辣鸡游戏 ，迟早要玩","timestamp_created":1491199009,"timestamp_updated":1491199009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53947371244430542","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30916241","author":{"steamid":"76561198122191108","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3444,"last_played":1552759950},"language":"english","review":"Recommended to give more players","timestamp_created":1491196928,"timestamp_updated":1491196928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30916180","author":{"steamid":"76561198321897271","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":72588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31953,"last_played":1599488972},"language":"schinese","review":"不错","timestamp_created":1491196542,"timestamp_updated":1491196542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30915046","author":{"steamid":"76561197978107521","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":44212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5665,"last_played":1651034382},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic concept and gameplay, but unfortunately suffers from proper developer prioritization.\n\nWhile overlooking the obvious \"no-no\" of having Peer2Peer hosting in an asymmetrical multiplayer game, blatant exploits are ever present on top of bugs that should've been fixed weeks ago when they were discovered. However, hopes are high that the next upcoming patch will resolve many issues, in about 2 days after this review is published.\n\nAs for balancing, it should be well known that it is notoriously difficult to balance both sides in an asymmetrical multiplayer game, especially one that integrates killed off teammates as part of gameplay, as well as fresh content being constantly added. In addition, the ranking system makes balance even more difficult. The developers must decide whether to balance the game around the general low ranking population or the high ranking population, where a difference in playstyle is strongly evident.\n\nThe grind system is heavily dependent on your tastes. Personally, I particularly enjoy progressing through various levels to upgrade my character with perks and unlock items that can be of great use during gameplay.\n\nReplayability is quite strong, as there can be very many combinations of loadouts, including perks and items, as well as various killers that you might encounter or can play as. There are quite a few maps, each as a set of a particular theme, like a junkyard or an insane asylumn. Random level generation is applied to survivor objectives, item chests, and killer hook locations (Which is where the killer hangs survivors after finding and catching them.)\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is worth your time. Bugs and exploits may annoy you as well as cheap tactics one side may use, but try switching over to the other side if you feel frustrated. Being able to swap roles is personally my favorite aspect of the game, whether to outsmart the killer, or to slaughter an entire group of survivors.","timestamp_created":1491189894,"timestamp_updated":1491189894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30914482","author":{"steamid":"76561198240133680","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":177642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158661,"last_played":1651930557},"language":"thai","review":"Idk what to say its just great maybe?","timestamp_created":1491187074,"timestamp_updated":1571059934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30914184","author":{"steamid":"76561197973318639","num_games_owned":1348,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":215250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1348,"playtime_at_review":88699,"last_played":1660156449},"language":"english","review":"Horrible developers and buggy game.

Но спустя уже 3 года игры в эту игру (тавтология мое все) я хочу сказать лишь одно. Мне становится в ней дико скучно. Очень. Очень. Очень скучно. Да, я мейнсурв и вижу все только с одной стороны. Но знаете что? Мне уже все равно. На манах я не хочу катать, на сурвах в соло по-прежнему невозможно катать. Только друзья и только они спасают зис гейминг. И мой вам совет, если вы такой же мейнсурв как и я, - никогда не катайте на 1 рангах. Вам станет невыносимо скучно из-за одной и той же тактики манов. И да, сурвы из-за этого тоже действуют по такой же одинаковой контртактике. И это обидно. Игра правда хорошая, но коммьюнити уже сидит в печенках. Причем с любой стороны - все одинаковые. Скучно.\n\n//\n\nЯ люблю эту игру не смотря ни на что. Dead by Daylight стала для меня сокровенным местом, где я могу повеселиться с друзьями.\nПоэтому, конечно, я ее рекомендую.\n\nПлюсы:\n\nа) Игра с друзьями, конечно же\nб) Игра за обе стороны баррикад (маньяк и выживший, никаких ботов, только реальные люди и их логика)\nв) Сам геймплей (пусть и однообразен, но может затянуть, ведь каждая катка может оказаться по своему интересной)\n\nМинусы:\n\nа) баги, естественно, и без них никак.\nб) желчное коммьюнити - да-да, именно так, не надейтесь, что вас тут встретят с горячей чашечкой чая и пряниками, учитесь терпеть оскорбления и прочие прелести людской натуры.\nв) туннелинг, фейскемп, кемперство - это три кита, без которых маны жить не могут на этом белом свете. Причем чем ближе к 1 рангу, тем чаще такое встречается.\n\nЛагерь моих друзей делится на 2 категории: считающие, что маны слабые и что маны сильные.\n\nЯ не считаю манов ни сильными, ни слабыми. Сама я мейнсурв и могу судить лишь по играм своих друзей (ибо за мана мне лично играть скучно). Я скажу так, если ман не 20ка (причем речь не о ранге, а в умении играть в эту игру), то он унесет с собой хотя бы двух сурвов. Но у нас же 99% коммьюнити играет одинаково на манах, поэтому и подход ко всем почти один и тот же (почти из-за разных способностей самих манов, а не людей, катающих на них), то и сильные сурвы рвут в клочья таких мэниаков. А маны все понять не могут, что пора бы уже сменить свою тактику игры. Учитывая, что манов бафают постоянно, а сурвов урезают. Но сурвы почему-то все равно рвут в клочья. Интересно почему?)\n\nЛично знаю маньяка, который мог разложить сильных игроков на раз-два и сделать минус 4, заметьте, без ЛЮБОЙ уязвимости (ноед и прочие штучки), без аддонов, без кемперства, туннелинга и фейскемпа. Все дело в умении играть, а не пытаться затоксичить (какое модное слово) сурвов.\n\nИ да, не скажу, что сурвы тоже лапушки в этом плане. Когда я играла на манах (да, я пыталась осилить эту скуку, все-таки на манах получаешь больше очков, чем на сурвах при правильной игре), передо мной тоже приседали, щелкали фонариком - все равно было. Учитывая, что потом такие недотоксики умирали обычно первыми (или ливали). \n\nЯ могла бы еще вечность рассказывать об этой прекрасной игре, но это может продлится на... 2000 часов :)\n\nВ общем, концепция игры хорошая (чем она и зацепила меня), не скажу, что реализация плохая, но дорабатывать игру стоит, причем много и основательно.\n\nНа сим откланиваюсь, а игре я по-прежнему поставлю 8,3/10","timestamp_created":1491163010,"timestamp_updated":1585587810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532908737659454346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30908282","author":{"steamid":"76561198125114419","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":24261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8231,"last_played":1658705789},"language":"english","review":"Great and fun to play, but expect 40 minutes in lobby if you are planning to survive with friends.","timestamp_created":1491159780,"timestamp_updated":1491159780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30906937","author":{"steamid":"76561198259862775","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":94,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1596680706},"language":"german","review":"Wie zum Kuckuck soll ich eine reviwer schreiben und das Spiel weiter empfehlen wenn das noch nicht mal startet.

Katil kovaladığı kişiyi hipotenüs çizerek zaten yakalayabiliyor. Bir de üstüne üstlük extra hız vermek onları çok güçlü yapıyor.\n2) Survivor geliştirmeleri katillere kıyasla beş para etmez.(katilin özellikleri öldürmeye yönelikken, survivor'un özellikleri kaçmaya yönelikten ziyade saklanmaya yönelik. )\n3) 'Camper' lik (kampçı : Astığı kişinin başında kamp kuran) yapan çok oyuncu var. Bu camper'liğe yapımcılar tarafından bir çare bulunmalı.\n4) Oyuna yeni başlamış bir katil, 50 level 1 Ranklı(Yani deneyimi oyncu) bir survivor'ı rahatlıkla öldürebiliyor. Survivor'un geliştirilmesi lazım.\nörneğin: o kadar geliştirme yapıyoruz tamir ve sabotaj hızı %5-10 artıyor. vb. gereksiz perkler var. oysaki %25-75 arası olsa gayet güzel olur. Oyun çok hızlı biten diyenlere cevabım: katil 3-5dk'da herkesi yere serebiliyorken bence survivor'ın hızlı olması gerek.\n5) Camper' lik olayı oyuna çekilmez bir hale getiriyor. Bu oyuncuların oyun bilinciyle alakalı.

Survive with friends mode is ALWAYS broken, making it so that you will all need to simultaneously queue up in \"Join A Lobby\" and HOPE and PRAY that all of you join the same team.. this can take upwards to about 5 hours.. (not joking, I seriously wish I was)\n\nOnce in a lobby you can not see the profile of other players, therefore you have NO idea what anyone's rank or level is. This would be fine if the match making system was fair and even. a Survivor rank 20 person should NOT be queuing up with a rank 13 killer (Prestige 3) that has 3 level 3 perks...??? seems legit..\n\nNext prepare to wait at yet another loading screen after waiting soo long to get into a lobby :) loading is ALWAYS FUN!\n\nWhen you get in a game there is a VERY GOOD chance that the killer (the host of the server and game BTW) might disconnect from the game. When this happens the survivors escape YAY!!! BUT HOLD ONN NOW!! not before losing any items, or offerings you loaded onto your character beforehand in lobby.. GROOOOOVY!\n\nBUT I think MY MOST FAVORITE PART OF THIS GAME are selfish survivors, survivors who are friends (and only help each other) and the camping KILLERS! :) Now, when I say camping I mean legit camping, just stands there and looks at the survivor on the hook and waits for someone to come and try to save them. I get the whole \"well, if that's the case just focus on generators and forget that player\" but that SUCKS and how would you feel it were you? you would want your team to leave you behind or not try to help?? (didn't think so). There should honestly be a radius or something that a killer cant go into while a suvivor is hooked or something, I don't know.\n\nThis game needs A LOT of work..\n\nAll in all going to uninstall and wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE. I am going to wait for Friday the 13th and Last Year. If this studio was smart, they would try to perfect their craft BEFORE those games hit the market but their lack of support and patching shows they dont care.. I mean HONESTLY how do you release so many DLC for a game that isn't completely finished?

It all rounds up upon the idea of game where one stands against a few but with a twist - the one guy is a predator, stalker, maimer - the killer, spawn of entity? Slave of entity? Loving bystander? What is entity? Who knows. Developers are giving a small clues now and then but the story backgrounds are still mostly mysterious. Basically survivors struggle to repair generators so they can open exit gates and leave the trial unharmed as a killer is trying to sacrifice them to the said entity. I might say I really do enjoy the game far more than I did when the game came out.\nFor that and more I decided to completely re-done the review since the game changed a lot.\n\n++ Originality of the game idea\n+ Graphic\n+ Artwork\n+ General gameplay\n+ Good range of maps to play on\n+ Nice character pool to choose from\n+ Plentiful player base\n+ Devs and community managers are responsive to community.
