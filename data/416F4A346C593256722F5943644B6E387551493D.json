Devs leave glaring issues in game on purpose, and call them \"features\". You'll find mediocre entertainment occasionally, but that's only if you're drunk, or high.\n\nBefore you wonder how a person with 1k hours, and 'red ranks', can call the game \"bad\", let me explain.\n\nI've played this game for a while, simply because it was a game with quick matches, and long queue times (when playing survivor), and allowed me to do work between rounds. After playing this game for *this* long, there are a lot of things I had to learn to look past MANY OF THE GLARING ISSUES in order to find something resembling \"entertainment\".\n\nThis game is one of the most easily exploitable games I have ever played: Due to poor design (and frankly, the apathy of the developers), many players are able to completely undermine the regular 'intended' gameplay. What does this mean? It means that entire rounds of this game are subject to the whim of four other individuals. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if ranks, or reporting worked in segmenting certain populations of the playerbase (the drunks, trolls, high players, etc), but it doesn't No matter who you are, you're getting thrown into whatever group of people this game wants you to be with. Whoever runs the community on DBD clearly doesn't look at report messages, or follow up on toxic player reports.\n\nAs a survivor, you'll have your playing experience ruined about 20-30% of the time (THATS 1 in 5 GAMES), due poor server maintainance (player rubberbanding), other survivors griefing/ letting you die, or a killer who will face-camp you.\n\nAs a killer, you'll have your playing experience ruined by people running what are called \"Survive with Friends\", which tilts the odds in favor of the survivors essentially being in a voice call, and all coordinating to ruin your day. This is another regular thing, and there is no option to turn it off, or exclude yourself from Survive With Friends queues\n\nThere's certain issues the developers cannot solve (the voice chats outside of Dead by Daylight with Survive with Friends, for one), but many other problems can be solved ('hook camping' within 15m can not reduce hook time)  -- however, they either don't care, or don't think these are issues, which THEY THEMSELVES have admitted on on video that hook camping is a \"feature\".\n\nOne of the other things you'll find is that there is only 1 meta. In games like these, you'll usually see many characters, strategies, and ways of playing. The developers do not think it is worth their time to change any of the currently existing perks or abilities at all for some odd reason. Normally in games like this, you'd want to be changing the perks every 'season' to keep things fresh... they don't.\n\nAnd even worse -- instead of fixing issues, they ADD PERKS/NEW CHARACTERS in order to 'bandaid' an issue. Example: 'Tired of getting killed THE EXACT SECOND you get pulled off the hook? Here is an ability that will allow you to not get picked up by the killer for 1 minute after getting downed!' (Only works if your team actually picks you up!)\n\nThis is seriously a backwards way of thinking about fixing problems.\n\nAgain, the developers DO NOT care to change this game. I've been playing for more than a year now, and nothing has changed to fix these problems.\n\nPlease buy a different game.\n\nEND OF REVIEW.\n\n---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- \n\nEDIT:\n\n**** *** \n\nGoing to leave this here just to explain to everyone the reasoning behind this review, this comment below actually gives a lot to reply to that could be expected in the future, hence why i'm taking the time to reply in full detail.\n\n*** *** *** *** \n\n\n\"The survivors are the ones trying to escape, the killers are the ones trying to make sure that the survivors don't escape by DEFENDING the thing that would allow them to do so. It's perfectly normal.\" -Twosoup\n\n\nAren't generators the focus of what you're defending? Not hooked survivors? If the game is about defending hooks, why do they even make chasing a thing? Why would chasing even exist, where is the reward structure for chasing? Why would generators exist? Chasing, and getting new survivors to a hook is at the core of the game, not \"defending\" a single survivor you hooked (MAYBE you could say that end game collapse that this makes sense, considering generators are complete, but otherwise, what???), it's only accidental that you might get any kills from it (High altruism players being punished by trying to unhook).\n\nYou even later go on as much to say \"-- more long chases where you feel like you're evading the killer's every movement as a survivor, and no more feeling of urgency to protect all that you have as a killer.\" What long chases? There's no long chases in a hook camping match, The CHASE is a huge core of what makes this game, not defending a hooked survivor.\n\n\"The only way to fix this is to change the core gameplay to make the game end after a certain amount of time,\" -Twosoup\n\nThis 'only way to fix' thing seems like you're just finding a way to either defend your own position by weakening what was said above, or worse, avoid the actual solution written above and find the worst way to go about 'fixing' it to belittle what is being said above. You can easily fix this by making hook time not reduce while the killer is within 5-15 meters of a hooked survivor. This WOULD in fact be the some volatile change to this game in a while (Since the devs dont change the meta, or anything for that matter anyway, lol), but only for hook campers.\n\n''treating people who leave you to die when you're impossible to save or people who play with their friends as your main problem with this game truly shows how little you actually understand (or cared enough to understand) about the dynamic of this game before writing this review.'' -Twosoup\n\nThat is my problem, this game DOESN'T have any dynamic gameplay. Idk how you can call a game like this dynamic when the meta is legitimately the same 3 or 4 perks, which are only meta because if you DON'T have them, you're going to be fucked over. \n\nThree of the most used perks in the game by survivors, and their main reasons for existing:\n\nBorrowed time: Stop hook camping\nDecisive strike: Stop hook camping\nUnbreakable: Pair with DS to stop hook camping better\n\nYou know what a market bubble is? This is sort of like a \"perk bubble\", it exists to deal with a problem that exists within the game, and the problem is so prevalent, that nearly all survivors will have one of these perks, and 99% of games will have at least 2 or 3 of them existing simultaneously to attempt to deal with the problem. The problem is SO bad in fact, that killers will adapt their playstyle to work around some of these perks, because they know these perks exist on so much of the survivor playerbase.\n\nI get it, this game isn't meant to be played to this serious of a level, it's really a game meant for people who are high, or drunk, it doesn't need to be this deep. But I think if the devs actually care, they could have an interesting meta, changing perks in subtle ways each 'season' to let people experiment with perks they never tried before, and get that dynamic gameplay that this game could actually have.","timestamp_created":1607933430,"timestamp_updated":1610442707,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":78,"votes_funny":15,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60589754581451416","comment_count":19,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82329828","author":{"steamid":"76561198288427723","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":34104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":656,"playtime_at_review":20284,"last_played":1660510133},"language":"czech","review":"This game made me depresd 2 times, wanted to kill my self more then ever, hitboxes are shit, everyone is toxic, it feels like the whole world is againts you.\n\n                                       10/10 deffinetly recomended from me","timestamp_created":1607933409,"timestamp_updated":1607933409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82328983","author":{"steamid":"76561199011455944","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1644495041},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1607932310,"timestamp_updated":1607932310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82328634","author":{"steamid":"76561198417349187","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":164103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":184,"playtime_at_review":5267,"last_played":1660591668},"language":"english","review":"Victor op","timestamp_created":1607931811,"timestamp_updated":1607931811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486824005842208862","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82327707","author":{"steamid":"76561199106608850","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1605,"last_played":1656723516},"language":"english","review":"Great co-op game, really fun with friends!","timestamp_created":1607930544,"timestamp_updated":1607930544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82327565","author":{"steamid":"76561198004157472","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":19921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1648842333},"language":"english","review":"Best survival horror game since PaRappa The Rapper","timestamp_created":1607930348,"timestamp_updated":1607930348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82327299","author":{"steamid":"76561198020403573","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":44019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2268,"playtime_at_review":1967,"last_played":1660488115},"language":"english","review":"Great fun -

E é aí que somos fisgados pela propaganda enganosa do game.\n\n[h1]Matchmaking[/h1]\nLogo nas partidas iniciais, você irá experimentar uma sequência ABSURDA de derrotas, o que não é nenhuma surpresa considerando que é o seu começo em um novo multiplayer. Mas após algumas partidas você começa a se perguntar: \"por que é que estou jogando contra pessoas 20 níveis acima do meu?\"\n\nEste é um dos maiores problemas do jogo: [b]o pior sistema de matchmaking que há.[/b]\nNão acredita em mim? Abra o YouTube e procure vídeos com \"dbd matchmaking\" ou \"dead by daylight matchmaking\" e veja por si próprio.... jogadores com 5000 horas de jogo sendo colocados contra jogadores com menos de 10 horas... o que nos leva ao próximo problema deste jogo.\n\n[h1]Comunidade [b]extremamente[/b] tóxica[/h1]\nDificilmente você irá jogar algo online onde não haja qualquer tipo de toxicidade em alguns jogadores. Isso também é esperado, uma vez que não dá pra controlar o comportamento de quem está do outro lado.\nO problema aqui é que o jogo em si INCENTIVA esta toxicidade dos jogadores. Devido ao desbalanceamento entre Killers vs. Survivors (incluindo aqui o Matchmaking quebrado), muitas vezes os jogadores são obrigados a recorrerem á praticas consideradas \"anti jogo\" pra tentar compensar as falhas do jogo. Isso vai desde Killers \"campando\" jogadores pra tentar garantir pelo menos 1 pontinho na partida, até Survivors que abusam do famigerado \"teabagging\" quando vêem que estão jogando melhor que o killer.\n\n[h1]Bugs pra todos os lados[/h1]\nOs dois pontos acimas são até que comuns em todos os jogos online (apesar de serem dominantes em Dead by Daylight), então provavelmente isso não será o suficiente pra te espantar do jogo. Mas mesmo que você insista em treinar, se esforçar pra jogar cada vez melhor, os desenvolvedores ainda tem mais um tapa pra dar na sua cara. A cada bug que é corrigido, 5 novos são criados. A começar da otimização do jogo que é péssima (sua GPU vai sofrer pra jogar um game com limite de 60 FPS, não importa qual a capacidade dela), muitos bugs realmente afetam a jogabilidade. Mais uma vez eu poderia citar vários deles, mas o YouTube continua aí. É só procurar \"dead by daylight bugs\" e se perguntar como um jogo desse sequer foi lançado.\n\n[h1]Resumo[/h1]\nNão gaste seu tempo com esse jogo. É puro stress, e você ainda paga por isso.","timestamp_created":1607928453,"timestamp_updated":1607928476,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51798558235168457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82325688","author":{"steamid":"76561198256120721","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3311,"last_played":1655857573},"language":"spanish","review":"asheeeeeeeeee\n","timestamp_created":1607927555,"timestamp_updated":1607927555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82324431","author":{"steamid":"76561197987042019","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":22391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1601,"last_played":1631590211},"language":"english","review":"Over 50k players on Steam today, that's not counting the crossplay and other PC stores that play with you.
