You won't know why you were hit from a mile away and then missed when your window vault was in the killer's swing. The Huntress is unplayable due to her ranged attack relying on careful observation of movement that the server itself can't keep track of.\n\nThere is now a £7.50 battle pass you cannot complete without daily play.\n\nYou can also earn lore. The writing is just \"Character has a problem\" for five paragraphs in a row without a story, replace problem with addiction, being away with the faeries, or a bad father for all current lore.\n\nOriginal review, still appropriate:[/i]\nAlways unbalanced, no matchmaking, grind, pay to access meta content, terrible community, very good graphics, many bugs and addictive. There's too much to describe in one review; please read a lot of the critical ones before purchasing.\n\nPlayed a lot and had fun, and had a lot of not fun. Described as a salt mine by its internet communities and [b]you'll be described in various expletives, slurs and degrading remarks by its playerbase at the end of each match no matter what you do.[/b] There is a report system but no-one knows if it's connected to anything.\n\nTo win you must learn many special rules, muscle memory, that most content isn't viable and that some meta content is DLC.\n\nMatchmaking is based on a broken ranking system. There are good and bad players at every rank. [b]Losing to better players isn't fun, beating terrible players isn't fun. Teabags, showboating and the end of match chat ruin fun matches.[/b]\n\nTo unlock a build, let alone a meta one, requires RNG grinding for no purpose. [b]Do not edit your files to skip the grind, you will be banned.[/b]\n\nUpdates are usually large. There's normally a DLC, don't buy on day one because if it's strong it'll be nerfed into the ground. Bugfixes are included but bugs are introduced. If any of these new bugs are real exploits [b]you will be banned for usage whilst the developer takes months to fix them.[/b]\n\nBringing criticism to the official developer community will result in officials telling you you're bad at the game. Most game statistics or developer-player communication appears to be at the developer's discretion, especially in explaining why your DLC you paid for was nerfed.

Le mappe son fatte molto bene e garantiscono un'ottima esperienza di gioco. Ha solo un difetto che vorrei evidenziare, e vale solo per chi acquista il DLC Stranger Things. La mappa del laboratorio di hawkins è sbagliata. Rivolgo questo appello da parte mia e dei miei amici che giocano con me: Vi prego, modificatela. Giocare da survivor è di una difficoltà immane, quasi ogni generatore ha 2/3 corvi vicini, il che ti rende individuabile molto facilmente, scappare dal killer è quasi impossibile perchè non ci sono vie di fuga, i corridoi sono pieni di porte chiuse e vicoli ciechi, senza contare il piano di sopra che presenta una finestra e un buco per scappare, il resto sono 6 stanze minuscole chiuse, non dando la corretta interazione fra killer e survivor, dato che il primo ne esce sempre vincitore. Rendetela più giocabile e interattiva per favore. Per il resto, il gioco è stupendo e non presenta pecche.","timestamp_created":1568755645,"timestamp_updated":1568755645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55160457","author":{"steamid":"76561198325471972","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2031,"last_played":1637948931},"language":"russian","review":"люблю сосать .....","timestamp_created":1568754273,"timestamp_updated":1568754273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524454116821289063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55160361","author":{"steamid":"76561198282705614","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":14750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":153,"playtime_at_review":9225,"last_played":1660479251},"language":"brazilian","review":"honestamente eu amo esse jogo porém esta ficando cada vez mais caro jogar ele,a ultima dlc(stranger things) custa 24 reais,isso mesmo 24 REAIS é quase o preço do jogo,então se vc esta pensando em comprar lembre-se que tera que comprar as dlcs ou ficara enjoado rapidinho,eu diria para vc não comprar\nadendo, se voce é novo não compre porque o matchmaking é tão fudido que vc vai cair com pessoal de rank 1","timestamp_created":1568753653,"timestamp_updated":1643345479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55160111","author":{"steamid":"76561198842520227","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":22006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12789,"last_played":1656597458},"language":"russian","review":"топ игра что бы расслабиться)","timestamp_created":1568752267,"timestamp_updated":1636563625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496042221784591675","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55160049","author":{"steamid":"76561198168133169","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":24048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18783,"last_played":1649211988},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mt bom o game mano, namoral joga com o amigo, 2 cagão, indo joga isso altos sustos, e gritaria, choro a vontade, e msm se aprende a joga se diverte do msm jeito, n importa se é de killer ou de surv, sabendo jogar ou n, da pra se divertir, sendo dhr jogar solo, e melhor ainda com amigos.","timestamp_created":1568751965,"timestamp_updated":1584143715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55159775","author":{"steamid":"76561198104532322","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":16549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1924,"last_played":1647707164},"language":"english","review":"Good game. \nMy only complaint is when people rage and disconnect before the games over.

Revived the horror love that was buried inside me with a great and fun mechanics. \nIt's a hard game to master, but an easy game to begin with. You can really know nothing and suck at most of it, and still survive or sacrifice a survivor.\n\nThe graphics are good, illumination is fair even running on low end machines, and doesn't ruin the game that much (as most of the games does) in a competitive way. The house-made characters are unique and very interesting, as well as the killers. They are much interesting and well done as the licensed ones, so you can tell the effort and love the studio puts on every character is the same for free and paid content.\n\nThe sounds of the game are great. Horror games really depends on how the sounds will do their job, and on DBD the job is done. It really makes you feel tense and anxious (although we know that isn't good for health..you can manage that).\n\nThe gameplay is easy for beginners. It's quite simple and just requires you to understand the basics of First person and Third person games. Yet, once you understand the basics, the game presents you to a room of N possibilities, which makes you feel interested to know more of the details and git gud at everything you do.\nThe matchmaking isn't the best, so you can play with people much more experienced than you and get rekt, but in general works fine.\n\nThe number of combinations of gameplay you can do with a character is really what made me get addicted to this game. You can literally do whatever build you want and plan strategies that can be countered or not by adversaries, and since the RNG for the map buildings exists, every game will not be the same ever.\n\nI really do recommend this game if you like the horror theme and stealth/hide and seek/coop mechanics.","timestamp_created":1568739376,"timestamp_updated":1568739376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55157186","author":{"steamid":"76561198802636265","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":57075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55411,"last_played":1640006709},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best horror games on steam it is very fun to get chased by the killer and escape by the skin of your teeth and also a fun experience to chase survivors as killers.

I THINK OF DEAD BY DAYLIGHT?\nDead by daylight has to be the best asymmetric horror game made to date, with great lore of the game which is getting bigger and bigger all the time, with the release of the archives\nwhich has also improved the game much adding story and so much cosmetics.\nI also love that every non licensed character is free to get with iridescent shards and also perks can be unlocked in the shrine so that people don't have to use real money.\nDead by daylight is getting better and better the creators really doing so much to this game big things and little things.  \nI also love that there is a grind to this game with ranks, devotion and prestige. \nThe game has come a long way since 2016 adding archives, killers, survivors, dedicated servers and much more.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE GRAPHICS?\nSo the games graphics aren't best in the world but with the recent update to the engine the game does look slightly better. \nThe most recent update to the game they reworked the lerrys map and that map looks so much better also the new chapter 15 coming soon the new map looks so good \nso graphics are improving much much more.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY?\nWell the community of dead by daylight are interesting bunch, you got most of your survivor mains that just complain about everything to do with killers then the other half don't,\nyou got most of your killer mains that that complain about survivors and the others don't, so basically the game is really unbalanced for both sides.\nFrom my time of playing this game as killer and survivor the community can be a really toxic place, but at times it can be nice so there are nice people out there.\nAlso the devs really like to get involved with the community giving out codes, doing raffles and more.\n\nPROS TO DEAD BY DAYLIGHT?\nIts fun\nLots of content \nrequires some skill \nlicensed content\nvariety of different play styles\nevents\nCool customization\naddicting game\n\nCONS OF DEAD BY DAYLIGHT?\nslightly toxic community\nRanking system is bad\nBalance of the game\nMeta never changes much\nnot really that scary\nhigh ping\nsome old bugs still around\n\nSHOULD I NOT GET THIS GAME BECAUSE OF BAD REVIEWS?\nNo you should really give this game a chance play for a lot of hours and you will get addicted trust me, most of the negative reviews are people with not a lot of game experience, crying survivors mains and crying killer mains. due to game being unbalanced\n\nMY GAME

以阴森棚屋为例，大房和白房位置固定，那么你就可以报点时以大房为12点，白房为6点，码头为5点，小二层为9点，“屠夫现在在7点追我，7点四个一的板和z字板我放了，你们先修，不要修成三连。”“夹哥在4点LT板子下放了个夹，你们等会儿去排一下。”“恶咒在8点地图边角的一颗树后面。””地窖在一点草丛里。“”大门在3点和7点。“同样适用的图有奥蒙德，断骨牛舍。 [/spoiler]为什么有些人认为李奶奶夹哥啥的强，因为这些真的是一些对单排特化的屠夫，到了车队红段局，准确的报点加排陷阱会把你大量前期准备工作毁掉，你本应该打断修机时间拿去布置陷阱以期待后期翻盘，结果被准确的报点，或者魂牵给你毁掉，或者人类有很强的大局观，血祭品懂得去消擦刀，人类知道用替人挂一次方法去慢慢磨屠夫的时间，或者人均打击钢筋老人头怀表，乃至一个会高精度报点的人，甚至哈登红齿轮速修队，都可能让这局对局烈度高，而这些zzz也不去了解，毕竟唯一了解的方式是击杀率，逃生率。\n\n8.最近听说大猪和白妹不播了，挺好的，靠一个游戏吃饭的主播吃不饱饭，那就让其他人为爱发电发现屠夫新的技巧以及人类的新无敌点吧，古人有句话，君子不利于危墙之下。如果你是一个好学校的学生，我建议你别玩这游戏了，不值得，如果你是个街溜子，我更不推荐你玩着游戏了，至少csgo啥的游戏，你练了，有收获，有名气，能恰饭。这游戏你练了，zzz看评价和击杀率，我们这个屠夫真的是太厉害啦，给你削了，2kh白花，气不气","timestamp_created":1568727872,"timestamp_updated":1657191156,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55154108","author":{"steamid":"76561198991296196","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":71000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1644077276},"language":"russian","review":"RIP
