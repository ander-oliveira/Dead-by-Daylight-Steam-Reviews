Hell yes, 8.5/10!\n\nPros:\n- Very effective if you're looking for a rush of adrenaline\n- Great freedom in choosing between playing as a survivor or killer\n- Very addictive once you get the hang of it\n- Includes ranked and unranked modes to play with up to 4-5 friends\n- Not very grindy at the moment\n- Tons of mechanics and gameplay elements keeping you on your toes\n- Free and paid DLCs regularly released\n- Lots of meta shifts keeping the game fresh and encouraging the creation of new strats\n\nCons:\n- MAJOR CON: the game has some intensive computer requirements, so unless you feel like your pc can put up with it you are at risk of playing at ~5 FPS\n- Quite buggy, but generally not in any too game-breaking way (expect to need to restart the game and getting kicked out of queues on occasion)\n- The game is constantly in a state of balance changes\n- The community can sometimes be quite toxic\n- Relatively easy to exploit bugs and tricks to your favour\n- Can be quite repetitive at the moment since it seems to lack special game modes\n- Steep learning curve, but it's possible to climb ranks with a decent understanding of the game\n- (minor con) Few character appearance customisation options","timestamp_created":1502355176,"timestamp_updated":1502355176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34141404","author":{"steamid":"76561198277089351","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1469084432},"language":"russian","review":"скучно и однообразно , лучше купить и пограть в \"Пятницу 13 \"","timestamp_created":1502352530,"timestamp_updated":1502352530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475079536437988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34141273","author":{"steamid":"76561198403027418","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":16123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4178,"last_played":1641647639},"language":"schinese","review":"垃圾卡得一逼","timestamp_created":1502351910,"timestamp_updated":1502351910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34140921","author":{"steamid":"76561198374788418","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":42777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":34482,"last_played":1659872982},"language":"english","review":"he is stupid","timestamp_created":1502350254,"timestamp_updated":1545551035,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34140808","author":{"steamid":"76561198300528838","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":35638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28767,"last_played":1631120066},"language":"english","review":"played it a bit. its ok","timestamp_created":1502349668,"timestamp_updated":1618348110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34140552","author":{"steamid":"76561197962163768","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":990,"playtime_at_review":1756,"last_played":1660597878},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun with freinds and to play by yourself if your bored though, everything about this game is amazing.

I haven't spent this much time on a multiplayer-only game since Science and Industry.\n\nSurvivor and Killer are both a lot of fun to play, although I did prefer Survivor.  Survivor XP rates could be higher, it seems like Killers have it easier getting Bloodpoints each match (having played both).  XP rates in general could be a lot higher, the game is almost a Korean MMO with how slow the vanilla leveling rate is.  There was recently a Triple Bloodpoint event (3x XP) and that even felt too slow.\n\nMaps being free to play even if you don't own the pack as long as the host (Killer) owns the map is nice, but the are still overpriced.\n\nI feel like the game would have more teamwork from the Survivors end if you got more XP if more Survivors escaped.  As it is if someone's hooked and the exits are up, even if it's an easy save, most people will just head to the exit.  If you got more XP for having more people saved, people would be more likely to take the extra 15 seconds to get someone else out because it benefits them.\n\nIt doesn't seem to be optimized well, as at max settings it utilizes far more resources than it should, given how it looks and how small the tech is for the game (no AI to process, only five people total and the maps are medium-sized).\n\nI love how the menu music is the same theme throughout, but each section uses different instrumentation.  Main menu is piano, Survivor screen is acoustic, Killer screen is distorted guitar.  The music doesn't stop when you change between these sections, this is what's really cool, it just flows into the new instrument for the section you're on, continuing at the same part.  It adds to the atmosphere very well, it's a simple technique but it's really effective.  Despite being a multiplayer-only game that has essentially no story except for what you find in the instructions and some quotes when leveling up/tooltips, it's a very immersive survival horror environment.\n\nEntering the Killer's basement is always tense.  It's exciting to hear the terror radar go off (an increasing heartbeat), hide, and evade the Killer's vision by constantly positioning yourself correctly behind a tree so he doesn't spot you, then he runs off and you make a safe escape.  Or, working on a generator that's almost finished, the terror radar goes off, an ally baits the boss in another direction, and you finish starting the generator.  A favorite of mine is the escape hatches.  I still haven't figured out how to open one with a key (haven't got the right key yet), but at certain points in the game, there's a hatch in the ground that opens and if you find it, you immediately escape.  In one of my first games, I was the last Survivor alive, I didn't know how to play yet so I was just running around not sure what to do.  The Killer started chasing me, I didn't want to die so I kept running, I accidentally came across a hatch and exited through it.  I had no idea they existed in the game and that escape was so well timed, it's moments like these that keep Dead by Daylight so compelling even though it's \"the same thing\" over and over.  There are all these random mini-stories that happen throughout the game through the interactions of players.\n\nA lot of people think the Huntress is overpowered, but I like dealing with her more than the Doctor or Michael.  The game feels really balanced.  Beginner Killers have an easier time getting rewarded than beginner Survivors, but as long as you get matched with at least one other Survivor that knows about body blocking/what chicken winging on the hook means/not to insta-unhook, the Killer is going to have to work for the kills.\n\nThe most frustrating thing about the game is when you join as a Survivor, get found and hooked by the Killer within about 15 seconds, and die because no one comes to help you.  You end up spending about 5 minutes finding a lobby/waiting for match to start/loading into match to die in two minutes and get 5k bloodpoints because of how RNG was with the placement and/or the other Survivors totally abandoned you that early.\n\nAnother frustration is the item system.  There are a few offerings that can be used that hugely tilt the game in either sides favor.

On the upside, the launcher has fewer errors than before. \n*The changes to the ranking system better rewards players based on gameplay over point accumulation. As a result, intentional disconnects and griefing occur less often than before. \n*Fortunately or unfortunately, deranking is a much more difficult process. Players who wish to deflate their rank to better match their more casual friends will have a more troublesome time. \n*Survivors' potential to infinitely abuse obstacles is now limited to encourage more variety during evasion.\n*The killer's most detrimental perks are now objectives to the map. Although, it does get tiring when you have to look for the \"ruin\" hexed totem to cleanse during each game.\n*Killers can actually antagonize survivors by sabotaging generator progress.\n*The perk balancing feels better because now every powerful perk has a counter perk or strategy. \n*Low level survivors and killers can contend better with high level killers and survivors. That said, the disparity between seasoned players and new players still exists and can be even more overwhelming.\n______________________________________________________\nTl;Dr If you like the idea and have the patience for single player, play it. However, you should know Dead by Daylight requires a considerable time investment to become familiar with the roles of killer and survivor, and it requires even more time to acquire the skills to play them to their fullest. Overcoming constant technical issues is a feature by now. \n\nPros\n+A-rate asymmetrical gameplay (killers feel bloodthisty and powerful, survivors feel helpless and depend on each other)\n+Balanced to rank up killers and survivors based on actions, contributions, and proficiency not by which side completes their objective\n+Killers and survivors are \"balanced\" (Killers claim survivors are unbalanced, survivors claim killers are unbalanced)\n+Variety of characters with unique traits and gameplay styles\n+Developers actively communicate and interract with the community\n\nCons\n-Game-breaking patches (frustrating to solve, may delete progress)\n-Inconsistent matchmaking experience (finding a lobby can take 2 minutes to 2 hours, lobbies may disconnect when high ranked players, groups, or certain characters join)\n-Skill tree progression and ranking suffer when players disconnect mid-game (progress slows, and players derank)\n-DLC characters in a game where each character can drastically affect the game (though skills from DLC characters are accessible without DLC)\n-New killers often destabilize the game more than new survivors, since a killer begins with abilities while survivors have to unlock a skill(s) to address the new killer's strengths\n-Ranking system encourages players to disconnect to retain rank and thus grief other players\n\n\nDead by Daylight is a brilliant example of asymmetrical gameplay done right. However, it is not for the faint of heart or the easily bittered. Regularly, players face the launcher, EasyAntiCheat, or drivers breaking or missing. The peer-to-peer matchmaking makes matches irregular and liable to intentional and unintentional disconnects. To further cause bitterness, patches have been known to delete progress, add characters that destabilize the game too quickly, and wildly change the dynamic between killers and survivors. If you have the patience for a game constantly in development, then this may be for you. If you have a group of friends that want to play this for kicks, go ahead. But Dead by Daylight is not a nice casual game to pick up, it will require some effort to come to overcome broken menus and matches that scarely reward the time investment.","timestamp_created":1502252589,"timestamp_updated":1532589827,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48888888955116272","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34117520","author":{"steamid":"76561198093801967","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":43115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18089,"last_played":1628362326},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, if you have the patience to learn how it works and improve your gameplay. \n\nConstantly updated and the devs have come a long way in communication and game balancing, new characters are being added fairly regularly, and each one brings new life to the game, even if you've played for hundreds of hours.

However there are serious downfalls to the game. Major one that is ruining the game and litteraly making matchmaking take insanely longer is the SWF feature which allows you to team up with your friends before joining a match. Most killers will leave the lobby when seeing everyone join as a team and if your the killer why wouldnt you? It is to unfair mainly because high rank 5+ will have one rank 15 or lower in there team and be matched up with a new killer who is also rank 15. And going against player who have all 4 perks while you do not and in teamspeak is not fun. This is ruining the game for both parties and the forums show this. I would avoid this game untill a solution is found.","timestamp_created":1502243241,"timestamp_updated":1502243241,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34115875","author":{"steamid":"76561198335164850","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":12632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11763,"last_played":1616849141},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1502243146,"timestamp_updated":1579838363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50354611873626709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34115416","author":{"steamid":"76561198107342963","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":14331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":57,"playtime_at_review":5099,"last_played":1659497597},"language":"english","review":"this game was a good and naver a bad","timestamp_created":1502240775,"timestamp_updated":1502240775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34115358","author":{"steamid":"76561198169726459","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":700,"last_played":1654558214},"language":"english","review":"Can you play it online?
