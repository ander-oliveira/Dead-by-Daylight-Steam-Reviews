Not only that, lots of killer perks received a good amount of buffs as of the meta survivor perks were changed to what now feels like a one sided game. I really wouldn't recommend buying it until these issues are resolved or unless you want to constantly be annoyed at players who think they're better even though it's only cause the killers were buffed. The game used to be great until the update dropped, doesn't really feel the same anymore. I know the near 90 hours I have may make you think I'm just mad at some guy who was just playing the game, but I used to play this game a LOT on console not too long ago and have only recently started playing on PC so I have a pretty good idea.

a long time Playstation player who joined in 2018 and has to be sitting on like 2.5k hours at this point (Console experience is awful btw). Let me be clear, I LOVE(d) this game. It's practically the only one I play(ed).\nLet me start by saying his game has massive potential due to current licenses and the clear desire other license holders have with getting their crossover implemented; It's effectively the Super Smash Bros of horror. If your favorite horror intellectual property is not in this game, I bet it will be eventually, the running track record makes you want to invest time and money because of the timeless relevancy of many IPs and standing invitations for many to join the game. DBD has good representation of cultures, so most people can find at least 1 character to vibe with and customize. The game is barebones in design *but* has a lot of nuance and skill the further down the rabbit hole you go, which allows for many skill levels and types of players to pick up the game and invest. This is great when after some time you can execute the skills you've acquired through countless trials and hours..\n\n..Except now here's the start of the bad.\n\n- Fun factorization.\nThis game is a lot like League, or Valorant -- games that you often times find yourself not having fun in, and actively hating, but your investment keeps you playing.\nBoring chases will be present half the time you queue, the only real fun thing to do in DBD. You will find your experience boring and un-interactive physically and mentally when one of the many popular OP or even \"anti-loop mechanic\" killers are in play and you're better off running in a straight line than actually looping around a pallet/vault and playing the game, hence the joke of the \" just W key\" being a thing. Your best decision to buy time sometimes is to literally avoid gameplay structures and run in a straight line. I'm not joking. Blatant bad game design here is often due to the pressure to constantly add new killers every few months (unique gameplay/mechanics are required for them) -- quantity over quality is the sentiment often echoed. What if you still have fun against these killers you say? Well hows about a dose of \"\"\"strategy\"\"\" enacted by many killers. There is legitimate morality discussions often tied with this game about being responsible for other peoples fun, because this game rewards toxicity from the power role so greatly. You can be camped by certain killers after your first down, and you will not be able to do much but sit on a hook or on the floor as the killer spites you, until the game throws you a bone and you bleed out after a few minutes. Phenomenal that this is allowed to still happen after the games been around for 6 years. You will be able to do nothing as a player but sit there if you're being camped, and often the killer can win the game by doing this after the recent update do to many questionable dev decisions. Enjoy getting little to no points for this awful experience too, making you have to slog through 5x more matches than pre-patch because they  removed point farming perks. Sound fun? How about the killer player only going for you in order to get you out of the match as fast as possible so that they can snowball with 1 less player and then they play normally while you spectate your friends? I'm not joking, try playing this game with friends if you're not good or are inexperienced and they are, you will be killed first and spectate the rest of the match because killers will often pick on the weak link. Running all your survivor perk slots with anti-tunnel perks is what many people do so they can actually play the game, especially if they play solo, since there is for some reason STILL no in game communication allowed besides a 'point' and 'come here' gesture.\n\n- Balancing. \nThe balancing team quite literally needs to be fired and replaced by people who *actually* play the game. There is such a disconnect with these devs and the playerbase that it's utterly baffling. Certain things have been broken for years without any changes, and they always feel awful to play against. Addons, items, perks, strategies, even blatant killer design. The recent patch mildly addressed many issues they've always band-aid fixed by just flat out buffing killers ability to catch in chase, which yeah it helped the 'just W Key bro', but it made the experience for most players somehow even worse because now most chase perks are bad and now seldom do most players buy enough time for team mates to do anything. Most people in this game are honestly not good, and it is a team based game, so to win your team mates have to pull some weight. With the nerfing of practically all good survivor chase perks, people literally get dropped in 5 seconds now, and then kill themselves or DC. Certain killers break fundamental mechanics or are in leagues of themselves and can crush a whole basic Q'd lobby in less than 5 minutes, leaving it up the the killer player how bad they want to see others feel bad and lose.\n\n- Map Design.\nPlay the game enough to learn them and you'll realize many are awful with either too many loops to where you're immortal, indoor maps that completely ruin a killer from playing decently bc their power is barely applicable, or to where there is nothing to use against the killer and you die to artificial difficulty outside your control because its nothing but deadzones. . Regardless, have fun getting hooked in one and living during the current meta where tunneling is the incentive. Also RPD exists and thats a crime.\n\n- Hacking\nSelf explanatory. They're often seen on DBD, and never directly dealt with because the in game report button is there for show and to make you feel better for \"\"\"reporting\"\"\" the POS after one of the many god awful feeling matches, and does not actually do anything. Amazing. Ask a DBD player what the report button does, I'm serious. It's for show.\n\n- Patch 6.1.0.\nCurrently due to this dumpster fire, there is 10-15 minute killer q's so killers are leaving. Why? Because many survivors left the game/queues. The experience for the 80% and 4/5 player majority feels absolutely awful most of the time so there is a very low survivor count and they left or changed roles so they could have fun again. Great looks BHVR, prioritize your statistics instead of the fun factor. The game was balanced initially around 2 kills, 2 escapes. Kill half the lobby on average, half the lobby escapes. Sound fair? Not to them, that was the prior statistics they adhered to for years and they've doubled down on now making kill rates soar, and soaring they are with all the changes. Why? For egos? The game was fine before. Enjoy queuing with 75% certainty you're gonna straight lose due to killer buffs, perk nerfs, or having broken matchmaking kick in and being paired with people who throw or are outside your skill bracket. Still okay with that? There is gaping flaws with game design and incentivization of \"feels bad\" strategies, and their response has always been band-aid fixes, and they effectively removed most of them in this patch, making survivor feel dreadful to play 9/10 matches you queue up for, especially if you're solo. Camping, tunneling, slugging, anything that makes you feel like your time should be spent on another game is amplified with this patch. Lots of tech and nuance was lost with the perk changes too, watering the game down fundamentally. Most people seem to hide now instead of seeking the thrill of chases.\n\n\nThere is so much salt to take with the minuscule amount of steak they provide here that it's so not even worth it to the overwhelming majority of players taking a peak or are curious. Give it a try on a free weekend if you're still interested, but do not throw these people money until they get their act together and make the game *feel* good to play, instead of looking good to investors.","timestamp_created":1659237793,"timestamp_updated":1659237793,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506507575511932373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119799169","author":{"steamid":"76561198251401788","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1089,"playtime_at_review":30779,"last_played":1660536300},"language":"brazilian","review":"Depende bastante, mas não posso dizer que não me diverti em grande parte das horas que passei nesse jogo.\nAlias, jogar com amigos fica bem mais legal, a gameplay é interessante mas muito estressante e tu ta pagando por 25% do jogo, tuas opções para conseguir o 100% são:  ou tu paga pelo resto ou faz o grind pelo resto da tua vida pra desbloquear tudo.\nO segredo por mais incrivel que pareça é cagar pro resultado final da parida e jogar para se divertir (claro que não estou falando pra trolar mas tu entendeu), isso é desenvolvido com o tempo e vai fazer tu ficar bem mais sussa e aproveitar o jogo ao máximo.\nP.S.

Lots of people who play this game are lovely, and I can appreciate that there are lots of jerks on the internet. The problem is, that the game design for DBD caters to jerks when it doesn't have to. The game developers specifically allow toxic behaviour from people who are able to hold others captive in these games as their victims. If you DC in protest, DBD punishes you. Report them? DBD won't do a single thing. Block them? There's always more because the game rewards this behaviour. The creators could absolutely make minor game changes that make the game dynamics healthier, but they refuse to, because at the end of the day they know that they have a certain percentage of their audience who are trolly edgelords who ENJOY hurting people and they want to keep that income. I meet enough jerks at work and in my own life, and I play video games to unwind. MAYBE, I don't want to be trapped in games with scumbags who are tormenting me for fun. And pay you for the pleasure. The lore is amazing, the loyalty to oldschool horror is wonderful. There is so much good about this game, but BHVR's management makes it unplayable. I will never buy another game from them.

Perk unlocking makes game difficult for beginners.  Killer perks at lower ranks completely shade T3 survivor perks, the balance is currently way off.  New killers are completely busted for weeks on end before a nerf comes and then you hardly see that character again.  Solo queue survivor is by far the worst experience I have had in an online game.  It is almost impossible to escape without a group full of friends, which I suppose BHVR wants, so hooray for them I guess.  Disconnects, suicides, trolling, feeding, body blocking & sand bagging runs rampant in solo queue, and it isn't fun at all. Hit validation is busted.  Killer ping dictates where you are in the game, not where you actually think you are, which is absurd.  I still love this game, but I am 100% comfortable recommending to anyone thinking of joining this community, wait a few months and check back.  Unless you really enjoy playing killer, then you can have fun with your 15 minute queue times for your mostly 6 to 8 minute games.
