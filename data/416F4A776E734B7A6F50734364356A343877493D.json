If the devs stopped being even a little lazy and/or incompetent, this game would be gas.\n\nEarly to mid levels when you're still learning how everything works, this game is a lot of fun, but after you reach a certain threshold of skill at the game, everything is just a slots machine from map layout, to tile spawns, to hitboxes, to hit detection on those hitboxes; It's literally random assuming one or more of those things isn't broken from aforementioned incompetent and lazy devs.\n\nPerks fall into 3 categories:\n-So bad they're unuseable\n-Interesting but not good enough to be used in the meta\n-Meta\n\nThe first category is what it is, since not everything can be a winner, but the second and third are what really ruin everything for seasoned players. As a baseline, a perk should not be so powerful that a killer needs to play around it when you do not even have it; Dead Hard, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, etc. all do this and are the most shocking displays of terrible game design I think I have ever seen. Even after nerfing almost all of them to some degree, they're still an abomination upon the game, that are unfortunately ultimately justified, because BHVR refuses to take steps towards balancing the game where those aren't needed to ensure you even get to play.\n\nIn any given match you play, there is literally no downside for facecamping or tunneling a player out of the game in which they actually just get almost 0 playtime, and because of how standard player altruism works and how the game rewards you for losing with a multitude of perks and killer powers, there's nothing stopping killers from just ruining the game for people. And with this community of players you will 100% have a large portion of your games ruined.\n\nAs someone who mains both sides pretty evenly and has over 1000+ hours in this game, you're all fucking toxic. Survivors are toxic AND Killers are toxic. The best I can say for either side is that Survivors tend to be toxic as a higher average, but the Killers who are toxic are literally the scum of this game. And this game breeds toxicity with how it's structured. It's asymmetrical by design, which leads to a really intriguing gameplay loop, but it also then requires extra time and management to make sure sides don't just have these things that they can hold over and hurt the other side with.\n\nMost of the killers in this garbage also need to be entirely reworked. I'd say \"removed\" since I'm malding and I know that they can never be properly fixed given how they've fucked up literally every other killer at some point. And why even have a PTB where players can join in early and test and give you feedback for free if you don't even use the feedback they give? I joined around when Blight was released, and admittedly he was a pretty good chapter (although Hex: Undying is a fucking stupid perk), but Twins was a fucking atrocious release, Trickster was an atrocious release, Nemesis's zombies are unfun to play against, and even Cenobyte who I think is a cool and fun killer was pretty bad on release too.\n\nInsta-down killers are incredibly cringe, with the only silver lining being that they're usually not great overall. If the counterplay for a killer is \"just be near something\" or \"just don't let him look at you\", you've got bad game design.\n\nI mentioned survivor perks earlier, but killers have more of the same bullshit with Ruin, Undying, Tinkerer, Corrupt Intervention, Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia. I have some combination of all 6 of those perks on literally every killer I play, because you literally have to against even remotely competent teams or you just get run through instantly. Ruin is especially bad in this regard, since it devolves back down to luck with where it's placed and how fast it gets cleansed. I've had countless games where it gets destroyed along with Undying in less than 30 seconds, and I've had countless other games where it stays up the entire match and there's literally nothing the survivors can do.\n\nThere are way too many fucking pallets on every map in the game, and way too many of those pallets are entirely safe (being that the survivor just gets away for free and you have to break the pallet to continue the chase). Especially with how most of the maps are poorly designed, a single dropped pallet can continue a chase by half a minute if the survivor just does nothing but run in straight line, which is another issue in it's entirety. Getting hit once by a killer and then running in a straight line away nets you 22 seconds of time, which is abso-fucking-lutely ridiculous. Most maps allow you to do this with how over the top large they are, and the ones that are small and cramped usually have more pallets to compensate (I counted 26 pallets broken in one match of The Game). Even if you're not looping around the pallets to try and conserve them as much as possible, I've lost games from people doing nothing but running directly from pallet to pallet and dropping them immediately, since every killer needs to snowball to win and losing four generators to one chase removes your ability to snowball unless survivors 3-gen themselves.\n\nEven with this behemoth of a post I've written I still haven't listed all of the problems with this game. The bloodweb taking too long and being too expensive to go through and punishing you for getting more perks, add-ons and offerings (especially map offerings) all but deciding the game before it's even played, and a whole bevy of other issues that have yet to be, and most likely will never be addressed.\n\nThis game is a game that doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a party game that fails at being a party game because it has too much skill expression, and it fails at being a competitive game because it has too many random variables to make any victories really mean anything.

The designs of some killers and survivors are neat. But the more you play the game? The less you get to actually get to play. Get good at survivor? Well then end up with Bubbas, Spirits, Nurses, etc. Who just take you down then camp / tunnel you to death. Devs reward them saying its a Strat, even though NO one enjoys it. And it just makes a 20 minute match of \"guess I will hang here till I die.\" Get better at killer? Almost every god damn match is 4 man SWFs who just shit talk you then body block you. Like legitmately. Unless you play Bubba and play like an asshole, you wont get to enjoy the game. The Devs know these issues and they will never really fix it. Plus the SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) has been making everything worse as a killer, slightly better for survivors. Wanna enjoy this game? Only play in 2-4 man survivor partiest. If I'm going to be 100% honest though, don't install it. Don't start it. You will get addicted to it. You will hate it. You will be miserable. Hell most of the time half the maps aren't working, half the perks bug out badly, and people 24/7 play like assholes. League Of Legends is toxic? This game is worse. And The Devs just let it happen. I've run into many hackers and you cant even report them IN THE GAME. They will buy the game on Microsoft store so you can't report their steam (because they dont have it). You try to report their in game profile and instead it pops up with a black screen with pedophile stuff. \n\nIf you are a masochist or sadist, go play something like League Of Legends. It does its job better, the game actually is working most of the time, and it's free.
