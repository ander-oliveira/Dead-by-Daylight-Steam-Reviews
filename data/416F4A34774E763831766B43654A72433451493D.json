it really wouldnt be if the DLC perks weren't nearly more creative and interesting to use than any of the base game perks.\n\nBBQ and chili is a great perk a shame it costs 5-7$ to even grind to get\n\nDecisive Strike no matter what meta is still a great perk oop sounds like you're paying at least 5$ to unlock laurie then\n\nI get that you want the players to grind toward something but I'm usually never going into a game without thinking \"ok i need to now put my bloodpoints into this character in order to finally get that perk\"\n\nThis is why losing in the game matters, its not because of toxicity, its not because of BM, its not because of taunting\n\nITS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE YOU GET LESS BLOODPOINTS MAKING YOUR GRIND TO FINALLY BE CREATIVE WITH PERK BUILDS TO BE EVEN LONGER\n\nWhen you're grinding to try to get to finally use the \"funner\" more \"creative\" perks you're disdaining the wait to finally be able to have those on a character you want to use them with\n\nFriday the 13th as much hate as it gets lets you at least voice chat with other players and even the killer himself\n\nthis game when you solo as a survivor you have to hope people dont just unhook you in front of a killer without Borrowed Time or you're just going to die as soon as you dare to not loop the killer for 20 mins\n\nAlso Buff Trapper","timestamp_created":1622146469,"timestamp_updated":1622146469,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92692217","author":{"steamid":"76561198314058074","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3381,"last_played":1657019227},"language":"polish","review":"I love when they scream.\n","timestamp_created":1622146380,"timestamp_updated":1622146380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92691765","author":{"steamid":"76561198276338430","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":22400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":7447,"last_played":1660163356},"language":"english","review":"After playing Dead by Daylight for hours, I can easily say that it's a very entertaining and enjoyable game. Although there were times where I wanted to just quit because of losing so many matches and because of the killer being so overpowered, I still kept coming back for more. This is by far the best online game I got in 2021 and I don't regret spending money on it especially since it has most of my favorite killers re-imagined from my favorite horror flicks; Michael Myers, Pyramid Head, Freddy Krueger... and make no mistake, they are here to BUTCHER YOU. I played both as the killer and the survivor and my only complaint is that the game gives more advantages to the killer especially with some perks that are impossible for the survivors to overcome no matter how good they are at this game which makes the whole situation slightly unfair. To make it short, if you like to play survival horror games with your friends and have a lot of laughs, Dead by Daylight is a must have to add to your library. It's addicting, fun and challenging and that's enough reasons to try it.","timestamp_created":1622145764,"timestamp_updated":1623006014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556843340396881104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92691733","author":{"steamid":"76561198340733919","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":33759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1411,"playtime_at_review":9685,"last_played":1660511066},"language":"english","review":"I like this game, but why are the twitch streamers almost always toxic?
