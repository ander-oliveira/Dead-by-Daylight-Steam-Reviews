jugando alrededor de 60 horas y esas horas las obtuve jugando en 2 semanas, es juego muy divertido muy enganchante ya que cada partida siempre va a ser diferente y eso te a llevar a querer seguir jugando y jugando otra partida y eso provocara que le metas un vicio al juego.\n\nAl principio se te va a dificultar sobrevivir contra los asesinos siendo superviviente ya que eres nuevo,pero conforme vallas jugando vas a ir agarrando practica en como saber esquivar al asesino y saber en que dirección debes de correr para que el asesino no te de un golpe y te deje tirado, conforme vallas jugando vas a ir conociendo todos los mapas y vas a ir viendo las estructuras en las cuales sepas que puedes darle vuelta tras vuelta al asesino(en algún momento te va a alcanzar debido a bloodlust que hace que caminen mas rápido los asesinos). si eres nuevo no te desanimes conforme juegues vas a ir aprendiendo a jugar, también aprenderás a pensar como asesino tratando de anticiparte a sus movimientos que el puede llegar a hacer para así evitar que te lleves un golpe.\n\nSi juegas como asesino lo principal que debes de hacer es vigilar los generadores ya que son el objetivo de los supervivientes, si los vigilas vas a ir encontrando los supervivientes ya que en alguno estarán reparando, como asesino tienes que poner mucha atención al sonido de todo el audio es tu mejor aliado como asesino para así encontrar a los supervivientes, en un comienzo se te dificultara golpear a los supervivientes ya que te van a empezar a dar giros y giros pero poco a poco tu te empezaras a anticipar a lo que van a hacer ellos y aprenderás a pensar como superviviente.\n\nTanto como asesino o superviviente los tienes que ir subiendo de niveles, cada superviviente y asesino tienen habilidades unicas(a las habilidades se les conoce como perks) cuando llegues al nivel 40 de cada asesino o superviviente de va a permitir enseñarle las habilidades únicas de ese superviviente a cualquier otro superviviente al igual que en asesino, cuando llegas al nivel 50 puedes reiniciar ese asesino o superviviente y lo haces prestigio solo hay 3 niveles de prestigio.\n\nEl juego en si tiene muchos DLC´s, te sugiero que los compres cuando esten en oferta ya que el precio que normalmente tiene es muy elevado.\n\n!!QUE ESPERAS COMPRALO Y MATA A ESOS SUPERVIVIENTES!!\n\n\nBueno vuelvo a escribir aqui para actualizar

find that this game is a battle for morality now a days. After the last major patch which made a massive change to a majority of the maps, I have found myself dreading playing survivor, but I have no other choice because I want to play with my friends. It is infinitely easier to play killer and get points, but twice as hard to rank up. It is a dreadful slog to gain points as survivor and half of the time you don't get to play the full match, but yet still I've died almost 10 games in a row and pipped on every single one of them. Playing survivor could not feel more dissatisfying because every time I've been hit or been or hooked I cannot bring myself to think that it was my fault. In most chases I see one option for escape, either a pallet or window, and end up still getting hit through it anyway. I know that I lack the skill. I know it's my fault. But I can't learn a damn thing when I die in under 60 seconds! Yes, this has happened multiple times before. It occurred in the game I played before writing this in fact, which spawned the reason I'm writing this. I spawned in. Got shot by deathslinger. Found the one pallet that happened to spawn in the corner of the map I was in. Got shot through it and left to die. My friends got to play the rest of the match without me while I sat and watched in misery of my lack of understanding and skill. I don't remember paying over 20 dollars to watch others play the game. If there was something for survivors to do after death, I would not be writing this review negatively. It is the sole reason I hate playing survivor. The killer will always get to play the full game. The survivor won't. And survivor is 4 out of the 5 players in a match. So one player will always be satisfied (in most cases) and the other 4 won't be. In reference to the comment that started this post, this game has almost become a battle for whoever is the better person. The killer could kill me in under 60 seconds or let me go and play more of the match. But it is literally the objective of the game for the killer to kill me and by doing so, their job gets a lot easier. So why would they? Then in that last game I mentioned, another survivor told me I was utterly useless because I died so quickly... Yeah. What was I supposed to do. Rely on the ever elusive 4% chance to get off the hook by myself? NO. Because no killer respects that, no matter how much of a rarity or a meme it is. So yeah, I don't quite recommend the game in its current state. The game is not new player friendly because of its terrible ranking system. People who are at rank 1 can force themselves down the ladder back to where new players should be playing. So you get a mish mash of new players and experienced players trashing them and bullying them along the way. It is the most infuriating learning curve I've ever had to experience and it's not because of the game. It's because of the community. Oh and if you rank as a 15, you apparently get rank 4 and below because they queued with their low rank friends to abuse the system, but we don't mention that. \n\nHowever! (and yes there is a however) IF, they were to fix these ranking issues with players skill gaps (which they are doing as of me making this post) AND they were to make it so that survivors can actually experience the rest of the match in some way (look at white noise 2 for some ideas cause I think it would be a great addition), then other than that this game is great! It can be scary at times, plays fairly well when you're actually playing against people at your skill level, and is down right addicting. I might be complaining a lot in this review, but there is a reason I have a thousand plus hours. The game isn't bad. The experience is. Even playing as killer can be the most frustrating thing on the planet because some survivors know the game better than you. The reason is because the game in itself does not feel fair and rely's on the players to \"play fair\". What do I mean? Well take the earlier rant for example. I had gotten downed in under 30 seconds roughly (yes I actually managed to keep track because it was that quick) and the killer hooked me. I DID almost get saved, but the killer was keeping a very close eye on me. He wasn't \"playing fair\" even though there is no rule or boundary preventing him from doing this. I didn't get to play the game because of another players actions and choices, NOT because of the game. \n\nSo in summary, just wait till the developers come out with an update to fix this gap in player skill level. I doubt they'll ever put in a system for survivors to do anything after death other than watch, but I can hope. They'll probably never read this review either to be honest. But the community and play styles of other players is the main reason this game suffers. Certain strategies like camping or slugging or tunneling don't feel fair to the survivor, but they are usable strategies that rarely punish the killer. I got a 4k insidious camping as Bubba at red ranks to test my theory, if you want proof. On my first try as well! But the game isn't bad in any respect. I love the 4v1 struggle between ordinary people and some juiced up killer from another dimension. The game holds it well. But damn if I don't want to uninstall the game every time I go down from something like tunneling or camping. It's not fun. Looping has been fixed to a degree. Might still need some work. But now it's time we move on to the survivors. They are four fifths of the game. But overall, buy this game if you're interested. Give it a try, I don't actually want to discourage you from giving this game a good run. Just be aware that there are some problems and people who will make you want to scream. Just try to spread some positivity around the community to help beat this issue. Anyway, to any of you who do decide to purchase this game, I'll see you in the fog. ;)","timestamp_created":1588883401,"timestamp_updated":1588883401,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544063270092010498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68752912","author":{"steamid":"76561198041494845","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1660176559},"language":"english","review":"Fun game at first but then you start to see that the game is very VERY inconsistent with its balancing.

You'll have to change the settings in the config files, once done you'll then find that you are BENT OVER by randomly being disconnected from games due to you fucking with their game files...this is a
