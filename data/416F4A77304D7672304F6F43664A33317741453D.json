(Man stelle sich das schreckliche Szenario vor, der letzte Überlebende könne eventuell durch die Bodenluke entkommen. Nein, da zieht man das Match lieber im Extremfall um bis zu 10-15 Minuten unnötig in die Länge, um auf Nummer sicher zu gehen.)\nDabei spielt es auch keine Rolle mehr, wie gut oder schlecht man selbst spielt.

You're constantly on the clock feeling pressured to be as efficient as possible for marginal gains. Meanwhile survivors can be total meme lords and be carried by second chance perks. The meta is always 2-3 slowdown perks on a killer because survivors can complete their objectives too quickly due to poor game balancing from a combination of low lethality on killers, too many interconnected strong tiles, too large of maps, and too many second chance perks on survivors. The way to win consistently is to play sleazy and ignore 1-2 survivors while you tunnel the other 2 until they die, reducing the pressure on you to a manageable level.\n\nSurvivor Breakdown:\nPlaying solo survivor is not fun either because many people are either not great at survivor or throw a tantrum and kill themselves after the killer hooks them 1/3 times. Or you play against either a new killer, or a pissed off killer who camps your hook until you die. High level meta is always 1 exhaustion perk, 2 non-exhaustion second chance perks, and 1 perk of your choice. The play is to waste the killer's time as much as possible by using strong tiles, positions, and your second chance perks.\n\nHow the company treats its playerbase:\nYou pay for the game. Then there are also MTAs for cosmetics and killers like it is a F2P game.\nThere is a chat filter. There is no option to turn it off because you're a baby that needs coddled.\nThere is a pre-game video. There used to be a launch option to skip it, but it no longer works. It used to be removable or replaceable, but then it was added to the anti-cheat validation cache because it is SUPER IMPORTANT that you have to either watch it or click to skip it every time you launch the game. I created a ticket about it and was told \"don't mess with game files\".\n\nTLDR:\nIf you live in a slum and need to bully people for a power trip buy the game and play survivor.\nIf you are a masochist and love a constant feeling of pressure squeezing the life essence out of your soul, play killer.\nIf neither of those things interest you, don't buy the game.\n\nClosing statements:\nWhile I do not recommend this game, it is currently unique enough to be fun to play, especially with friends, so if you have those, unlike me, you might have fun playing it. I do think that once a competitor with a better vision of balance makes a clone that hits a high enough mass of players appears, I will be switching to that game instead.","timestamp_created":1557600963,"timestamp_updated":1617461701,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50595837","author":{"steamid":"76561198308199612","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1180,"last_played":1621811856},"language":"english","review":"Really nice game.

where to start with my love/hate relationship for this game. I like Dead by Daylight but at the same time I have a list of problems with the game. First I'll start with the positives and then I'll get into some of the things that really irk me.\n\nFirst off the premise of the game is one I can get behind. The idea of needing to work together as a survivor to escape this looming peril is excellent. The idea of helplessness really can give you a sense of dread and terror which is great in this kind of game. When everything works like it should the game shines and you get moments that are memorable. I will suggest playing with friends as it does make the game much easier and a lot more enjoyable.\n\nNow for some negative. This game will frustrate you in ways you didn't think possible. When you are new you will be thrown into games with people who have deranked and are playing killers (or survivors) with perks that will make you feel cheated. To this day I get upset but normally there is a legit reason why I was found. This is a very small problem in the grand scheme of things but one thing to keep in mind. The biggest flaw with the game (and I've seen others mention it) is teammates and the point system. You will run into games where people are worse than useless. They will hinder the game and make it even more challenging for you trying to actually succeed. They will try to farm points and will do things like pull a survivor off a hook in front of a killer just to get a few extra points resulting in the unhooked survivor to get hit immediately and go down again. As the person who was unhooked and taken down again this destroys the game. You are left with being hooked three times quickly and realizing you just wasted 7 or 8 minutes of your time. Finally the developers are very slow to fix anything but seem to push out DLC's and microtransaction cosmetics fairly frequently. Bugs in the game can go a while without being fixed and other issues such as a toxic community goes pretty much unpunished.\n\nNow after typing all this bad stuff how can I recommend this game. Cause honestly it is fun. I forget that sometimes and sometimes I need to take a break from it but when you pull off that perfect escape after saving a friend from being hooked it really does feel good. I would recommend waiting for a sale but if you've got a buddy or two you can play with the games worth picking up.\n\n*Side Note* I will say right now as of 5/11/2019 the end game collapse changes the end of the game a great deal.

~100 hours, then it's the thrill and adrenaline of hiding and running away from killer, which will then turn into just gameplay, I guess (I'm still on the thrill and adrenaline part)\n- Game is totally not for everyone, someone will write a bad review in 100 hours of playtime, someone will go on for thousands of hours.\n- PayDay2's like sh**load of DLCs, that are not neccesary, but you will want to buy them eventually.\n- Developers still supporting the game\n- No story, forget it. It's only here to have a little excuse about why the hell is there Michael Myers or Ash from evil dead running around\n- Pretty cool sound design with killer themes really pumping you up \n- Toxic community (wait did I already say that).\n- Really cool killer's abilities, diverse and almost all unique, but the thing I want you to pay attention to, is that they are all USEFUL.
