by Daylight is a pretty good children's game, where the little tikes play Survivor, and the parent/babysitter/preschool teacher/daycare supervisor plays the Big Scary Monster. At the end of the day, the monster loses, and the children all get away and cheer happily in celebration! All the children have to do is hold the M1 button on a machine, and periodically have to perform a \"skill check\" which is stopping a rotating marker on an area as big as 25% of a big white circle (akin to similar tests in other games, like fitting the triangle object into the triangle hole, for example). Every now and then, if they see the Big Scary Monster coming for them, that child then only needs to hold Shift W in the opposite direction of the Killer, and smash Spacebar on any and every interactable they come across. This teaches children some basic fundamental survival instincts useful in the real world.\n\nMy only complaint with Dead by Daylight is that, for some reason, grown adults have flooded into the game, and they behave very poorly to the parents & daycare supervisors that play the Big Scary Monster for the children. For some reason, these grown adults that play as the child's role, \"Survivor,\" get heightened amusement for performing these basic preschool-level tasks in overabundance, and then seem to be often criticizing the game's curricular as being \"easy,\" perhaps suggesting that children can't possibly find playing Survivor challenging or mentally engaging in any way?\n\nIn either case, Dead by Daylight was promising for our young children, but I'm not sure that I can recommend this game when your child will most likely be playing alongside a grown adult that shouldn't be there. Until that gets fixed, I have to give DBD a 4/10 at best.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.","timestamp_created":1652786621,"timestamp_updated":1652786621,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577672481536865234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115586893","author":{"steamid":"76561198408415048","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":76826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1537,"playtime_at_review":60057,"last_played":1660541810},"language":"schinese","review":"怎么说呢，好玩是好玩，就是有点高血压！","timestamp_created":1652784308,"timestamp_updated":1652784308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115586771","author":{"steamid":"76561198858002642","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":95065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3548,"playtime_at_review":70718,"last_played":1660445682},"language":"english","review":"Its really fun once you get the hang of it, new stuff comes out pretty quickly, and the community can be nice sometimes, but it can get boring after a long time.","timestamp_created":1652784015,"timestamp_updated":1652784015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115586550","author":{"steamid":"76561199239491009","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":592,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1660225982},"language":"koreana","review":"님들 에임 좋으시면 무조권 총구 ㄱㄱ 감ㄷ도가 높으신 걸 좋아하시는 분은 톱구 ㄱㄱ\n","timestamp_created":1652783549,"timestamp_updated":1652783549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115586135","author":{"steamid":"76561198346089700","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2882,"last_played":1658897793},"language":"english","review":"great game but may cause addiction and mental illness so worth it though","timestamp_created":1652782692,"timestamp_updated":1652782692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115585103","author":{"steamid":"76561198291672335","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2108,"last_played":1658551289},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom !","timestamp_created":1652780157,"timestamp_updated":1652780157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115584509","author":{"steamid":"76561198447602487","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":272492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6359,"playtime_at_review":240395,"last_played":1660601695},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un muy buen juego asimétrico 4v1, altamente recomendado a toda la comunidad. 4 supervivientes tratando de reparar motores sin ser capturados para escapar y 1 killer tratando de matarlos. Una experiencia única de comienzo a fin. Se encuentra divertido cuando vas aprendiendo las mecánicas del juego hasta llegar a un nivel cuasi-competitivo donde conoces cada pixel del mapa y sabes pararte bien. No es apto para la gente que no sabe adaptarse y ser creativa, es apto para la gente que sabe tomar buenas decisiones y vive con sus malas decisiones sin llorar, aprendiendo de ellas para mejorar, que pude hacer para evitar cierta situación. Es prueba y error. Encontraras diferentes niveles de habilidad por parte de los jugadores y llorones de ambos bandos. Encontraras mucha gente aprendiendo a jugar que al perder, estará llorando tanto de survi como killer; que me rushean, que me campean, que me tunelean. Te invito a disfrutar del juego sin reglas imaginarias disfrutando y aprendiendo a contrarrestar cada estrategia por parte del bando contrario. Es más divertido jugarlo con amigos pero tambien puedes ir en solo Q. Si el juego te gusto y quieres seguir aprendiendo de el, ir mejorando, te recomiendo sumarte a una comunidad que no sea toxica para disfrutarlo más o juntarte con alguien que tenga experiencia y sepa jugar bien, que si le preguntas sepa guiarte por el camino del ente de manera correcta.

However, over the past couple months, the game had been littered with killer-bots that teleport across the map and instantly kill survivors. ( this has receded in frequency for me anyway). Then there are killers, Amanda \"The pig\" in particular, that start with the iridescent add-on to spawn survivors with reverse bear-traps and then block a jigsaw box. Thus actively body-blocking and soft-locking any actual gameplay while simultaneously rewarding the pig for being afk with instant, unpreventable deaths. Some people defend this with \"b-b-but it's a valid strategy, leave the killer alone\" no, pseudo-moral grandstand-ers, it's not. it's quite literally a  stated reason to report somebody for trolling/unsportsmanlike conduct in the post-game review screen.  Enabling this behavior just undermines the game. They need to fix this, as i am seeing this \"strategy\" more often\n\nThat being said, I have thousands of hours into the game since its release. Again, it's fun when it is played as intended: dodging the killers, implementation of boons and other mechanics. It's a fun source of mind games and strategy when playing either killer or survivor. I like the homage to various horror movie/game villains/heroes (as well as the original characters), i like the portrayal of plot or back story with the archives, i enjoy the challenges in the rift... overall a solid game that is unfortunately marred at times by trolls/bots.","timestamp_created":1652762327,"timestamp_updated":1652762327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115577038","author":{"steamid":"76561199063962273","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1707,"playtime_at_review":9393,"last_played":1660539016},"language":"schinese","review":"⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⠀⣼⣿⣿⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⡟⢰⣿⣿⣿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⠿⢿⣦⣀⠀⠘⠛⠛⠃⠸⠿⠟⣫⣴⣶⣾⡆⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠸⣿⡀⠀⠉⢿⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠿⠿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣦⠀⠀⠹⣿⣶⡾⠛⠛⢷⣦⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣧⠀⠀⠈⠉⣀⡀⠀⠀⠙⢿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⡿⠟⠋⠀⠀⢠⣾⠟⠃⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣶⡿⠛⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⢀⣠⣾⠿⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣧⣀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠈⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⡿⠋⠙⠛⠛⠛⠛⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣾⡿⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⠿⠋","timestamp_created":1652760197,"timestamp_updated":1652760197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694518864154815674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115576958","author":{"steamid":"76561198953574941","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2337,"last_played":1659324647},"language":"thai","review":"สนุก ติดงอมแงม","timestamp_created":1652760014,"timestamp_updated":1652760014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115576204","author":{"steamid":"76561199087829818","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":584,"last_played":1658470700},"language":"english","review":"very gg\n","timestamp_created":1652758265,"timestamp_updated":1652758265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115576048","author":{"steamid":"76561198044752316","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":70680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57012,"last_played":1658238743},"language":"japanese","review":"10試合中2試合は神ゲー、8試合はストレスフルなクソゲーです。","timestamp_created":1652757883,"timestamp_updated":1652757883,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115575892","author":{"steamid":"76561199088221853","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":923,"last_played":1657351625},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bonito","timestamp_created":1652757565,"timestamp_updated":1652757565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115575767","author":{"steamid":"76561199286066328","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":375,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1660535134},"language":"schinese","review":"fweasgvasdvxc XC","timestamp_created":1652757297,"timestamp_updated":1652757297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115574056","author":{"steamid":"76561198345456456","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":20889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":358,"playtime_at_review":16239,"last_played":1660549915},"language":"english","review":"Despite everything wrong with the game i.e the people that play it, unbalanced maps and perks.

However, what BHVR have managed to do here is make a PvP game that requires relatively little mechanical skill, has a very high skill ceiling and is still barrels of fun to play casually/with friends. DBD is by far the most widely owned game within my group of friends and the total number of hours we have all spent in this game collectively is huge. BHVR truly struck gold when they first came up with the design for this game and ran with it.\n\nI'll start with the good stuff. As a new player, you can really get engrossed in the atmosphere of this game. It has all the aspects of classic horror games with all the tense sounds, dark eerie maps and jumpscares to no end. If you like all that stuff you will definitely enjoy that part of the game, especially since it's all PvP fueled too. Doing your first generator and hearing the killer's terror radius getting louder and louder, closer and closer, as you frantically look around trying to see where they are coming from - that will put even the hardiest horror player on edge. However, where the game really starts to shine is when players start to git gud.\n\n'Looping' is the term used for when a survivor tries to (instead of hiding) outrun the killer and make their chase last as long as possible. This concept alone sounds basic but, believe me, there is [b]so[/b] much to learn to master this part of the game. Now I did not play DBD on release (I got the game 4 years after release in the peak of the 2020 pandemic) but I do know that it took BHVR quite a few years to perfect and balance this part of the game before I started playing. What has become of looping today though is nothing short of brilliant. Being able to use your knowledge of the game to outsmart the opposing player in a one vs one situation is one of the most satisfying feelings that I've ever had playing any game. And DBD is a breeding ground for these moments, time and time again. This is genuinely what I believe to be the main reason people love this game. That feeling of mind-gaming your opponent, outthinking them, predicting their movements before they make them themselves and coming out on top. There's honestly nothing better.\n\nThere are so many simple design decisions that come together to make DBD what it is today and a lot of these things I feel are taken for granted/generally overlooked when considering how great of a game DBD is. For example, the 'Red light' the killer emits in front of them to show the survivors the direction they are looking. This in itself is a simple concept and a fundamental part of the game that survivors will pick up quickly, but that design decision is more important than new players may realise. It instantly solves one of the underlying problems that might immediately come from designing this type of game: human reaction times. This simple red light allows survivors to get that extra fraction of a second to react to the killer coming round a corner when they might not necessarily see them coming. Without the red light, survivors would have a lot less time to react to the moves the killer was making. That extra fraction of a second can let the survivor perform an action that will (in a lot of situations) let them get to some form of safety. This, in turn, leads onto the killer counterpart to the red light: 'moonwalking'. This is the term used to describe a killer walking backwards around a corner to hide their red light from the survivor. This is one of the more powerful mind-games that springs from the basic design of this game and is one of the small but effective ways that increases DBD's skill cap.\n\nI won't go into too much more detail because this review is already very long, but I will just list the other small things in this game that make it amazing in my eyes.\n[list]\n[*]The design of (non-god) pallets - to respect or not respect.\n[*]The design of windows - infinite resource but can only be used 3 times per chase, losing chase by walking to not let windows block.\n[*]The Shack - strong tile but can lead to some of the most satisfying killer mind-games.\n[*]Tiles - the design of randomly generated maps and tiles as a whole is awesome.\n[*]Lockers - so many more uses than it first appears.\n[*]Flashlight saves - unique skilful technique that leads to more counters and outplays.\nSpeeds of survivors and killers - how perfectly these line up to fit in with the maps and tiles creating so many close moments in chase.\n[*]Killer lunge - can lead to extremely close moments and mind-games.\nSpinning/360s - the power of making the killer miss a hit and the cooldown times are perfect.\n[*]Techs - CJ/Dumb/FOV/Item/Corner/Window/Locker/Tree; so so many techniques to learn in this game and many more that don't have names.\n[*]Dead Hard - a controversial topic, but can lead to so many clutch moments.\n[*]Hook stages/Kobe-ing/Slugging/Dropping/Sabotaging/Body-blocking - so many interactions within all of these, so many decisions to be made on both sides.\n[*]Hatch/Exit Gates/Endgame Timer/Blood Warden - all lead to so many complex interactions and tense moments.\n[*]Blast Mine/Mettle of Man/No Mither/Slippery Meat/Head-on/Flip Flop/Breakout/Quick & Quiet/For The People/Repressed Alliance/Deception/Autodidact/Diversion/Power Struggle - all fun, unique and different survivor perks; lead to so many complex interactions and outplays.\n[*]Spirit Fury/Rancor/Devour Hope/Dark Devotion/Plaything/Mad Grit/Nemesis/Blood Warden/Save The Best For Last/I'm All Ears - fewer killer ones but still fun, different unique perks that bring extra gameplay and thinking for both sides.\n[*]Win conditions - you get to decide your own win condition, no one else; sometimes it's not just about the kills/escapes it's about the hooks and being altruistic. Your entire team can die as survivors but you can still have fun and it feel like a win.\n[/list]\nThere are probably so many more things to this game that I can't think of at the top of my head.\n\nI will admit that this game has many downfalls in terms of balancing, cost of progression and its fair share of players who are out there to ruin people's fun. But what it does provide is a purely unique experience that (from what I've found) no other game comes close to reproducing.\n\n[h1]Dead By Daylight:

They don't really want to have to consider how you're playing and adjust, but rather want you to act like a bot that is totally predictable while also being a human that they can make fun of. \nIf you wish to play a game that doesn't require the implementation and action/reaction of another human player, then play something a little more elementary lol.\nOtherwise this is a fun game.","timestamp_created":1652706742,"timestamp_updated":1652706828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115546006","author":{"steamid":"76561198881701535","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3492,"last_played":1658176180},"language":"german","review":"Es macht so viel Spaß mit Freunden","timestamp_created":1652706224,"timestamp_updated":1652706224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115545728","author":{"steamid":"76561198060984885","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":30364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2901,"playtime_at_review":5490,"last_played":1660561395},"language":"english","review":"pog","timestamp_created":1652705697,"timestamp_updated":1652705697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115544817","author":{"steamid":"76561198850503545","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":52237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4928,"playtime_at_review":37177,"last_played":1660577860},"language":"schinese","review":"真的服莫名其妙就玩不了人bug一大堆不修搁那乱封号是吧","timestamp_created":1652703986,"timestamp_updated":1652703986,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115544764","author":{"steamid":"76561199054445106","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":666,"playtime_at_review":3843,"last_played":1660567943},"language":"japanese","review":"とにかく放置キラーが多くてまともにゲームができない\n煽りサバイバーが多くてキラーやる気にならない","timestamp_created":1652703840,"timestamp_updated":1652703840,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530791759490966797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115544479","author":{"steamid":"76561199059518871","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2220,"playtime_at_review":1235,"last_played":1660572834},"language":"schinese","review":"爽","timestamp_created":1652703220,"timestamp_updated":1652703220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115544191","author":{"steamid":"76561198309990170","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1656007519},"language":"english","review":"w","timestamp_created":1652702649,"timestamp_updated":1652702649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115544172","author":{"steamid":"76561199093693417","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18267,"last_played":1654647844},"language":"english","review":"Not a bad game, it has its fair share of bugs... though, every single update the devs always without fail, introduce a map breaking bug.
