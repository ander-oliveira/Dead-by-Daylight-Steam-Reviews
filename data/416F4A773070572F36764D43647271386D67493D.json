Las persecuciones siempre van a estar a favor del asesino ya que no podemos calcular a que distancia nos pueden golpear porque aunque estando 5 metros delante de él siempre te va a pegar de forma muy falsa, sumando a que las hitbox las modificaron para peor. Los pallet ya están de adorno, porque aunque le tiremos y stunemos al asesino igual nos va a golpear y encima se va a teletrasportar mágicamente en donde estamos, quedando muy regalados. Si había bugs, ahora hay el DOBLE, paredes invisibles que te hacen inaccesible pasar por dentro de las estructuras tanto de survivor como killer, estructuras sin colisiones que le hacen muy fácil al asesino golpearte. Con estas nuevas animaciones da la sensación que el survivor no se mueve de forma fluida, como si fuera mucho mas lento, imposible hacer un 360 decentemente, porque cambiar algo que estaba jugablemente bien y que nadie pidió?. En cuanto al nuevo hud, lo odio completamente, es muy confuso y distrae mucho, no te aporta la misma información concisa que te daba el antiguo , parece que estuviera pensado para teléfonos (móviles). No estoy de acuerdo en no poder ganarte tus pepitas a base de realizar acciones en la partida sin que te escapes, ahora no tiene sentido jugar de survivor. En fin... los reworks de los mapas estan muy buenos, como lo es el rework del payaso que era necesario, pero centrarse en lo estético, agregar skins tras skins sin pulir la jugabilidad, los incontables bugs y la fluidez me parece desagradable por parte de los devs arrogantes e ineptos que pisotean a su comunidad la cuál nunca escucha y siempre da la espalda.

Pros and Cons:\n\nBeing Unbalanced: It seems the community is absolutely addicted to thinking that either the Killer or the Survivor role has some edge to it. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of perks, offerings and items which can really screw a match over suddenly when you least expect it. Decisive Strike, Keys, Moris, Aura abilities, etc. If you follow the discussions on the Steam page, there will always be a demand for buffs and nerfs and all sorts of crazy stuff. However, in the end, barring a hacker being in your game? Just try your best, experiment around and find what works for you. DbD is a mind game where, no matter your role, you have to try to out-think your opponent. Don't get yourself down if you can't win a few matches, everything is a learning curve and an opportunity to get better. However, just be ready for that moment when you think you've got it and then, boom, NOED appears or something. Real gut punch that one.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the rather random matchmaking, which seems to be at least a modicum better than it was last year. Basically, I remember being a rank seventeen having to play with rank fives and fours which was a real trial by fire and could be quite irritating. But, hey, I survived. It also seems that there is more balance to that system. Don't get me wrong, I still see real middle finger matches where a low rank ends up somewhere they shouldn't be and I bet it really messes with their day. I do see that the high ranks /sometimes/ work to try and help the low ones if they aren't just blathering around like a dumb dumb. Hopefully, this will get even better soon.\n\nNow, a big pro in this games favor is the content. I love the notable horror icons, even if it sometimes feels they are coasting on the release of horror nostalgia to cover for not fixing different issues with both player roles. The new content tends to liven up the game some, give new challenges and a bit of a breath of fresh air. Even if I think we all wish there were some new things. What things? I don't know. I just feel the game needs something more, that is my opinion.\n\nHitboxes and Desync. Okay, so apparently this game operates on crap servers? I don't know, that is what I hear and it can be annoying as hell for both roles. The devs have been working on hitboxes (not so much the Desync mind you) and it feels like the progress is at a snail's pace. That is the major issue with DbD currently is the fact that you'll be swinging as a killer and missing for no reason, yet then a survivor vaults a window and they're hit when the killer is obviously out of range. Maybe they'll fix it? Doesn't make the game bad, just annoying sometimes.\n\nNow, a note on the community: It can be super toxic. Don't get me wrong, do I think this game ranks high on the spectrum of toxic gaming? Well, yes. For some reason, DbD attracts some of the worst people you'll meet. There are also cool people though and the game itself is one that is still unbalanced, with some issues I noted up there ^, and that can lead towards frustrations and annoyances. Honestly? I'd suggest just not talking in chat unless you want to compliment someone on their awesome plays or something. Isn't much point in chatting now anyways, as they introduced cross play console players (which, if you don't want to wait a millenia for a match, mark that box and say you'll do it) they can't chat anyways so most of the time you're standing there all like \"where did everybody go?\". \n\nSo, overall? Dead by Daylight is a game that has gotten popular for a reason. It can be a trial, and somedays people are just mean for the hell of it. But, it can be challenging and rewarding. Good sportsmanship and working with teammates can win the day for you. It can be fun taking chances, even if they don't pan out. I've made a few friends while playing it and I stink as killer, though maybe I'll get better someday? Who knows. It is worth the price at a discount, because there are some characters trapped behind paywalls with abilities the higher rank players say are absolutely necessary. Think The Sims, but with lots of death and drama. Oh wait, that is the Sims. Also, don't play Leatherface. Don't do it. if you do it, don't camp. It is too basic and expected.
