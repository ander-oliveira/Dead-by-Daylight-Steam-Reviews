мне значит эту замечательную игру, но подарку я радовался не долго. Буквально через 50 часов игры я понял что против меня кидает маньяка 900 часов, который в добавок ко всему стоит кемперит(не отходит от выжившего, не давая его спасти), дак еще и мне господь вручает 5-10 часов тиммейтов, которые снимают с крюка ради 1500 очков, забив на генераторы и на прочие цели. Ну да ладно, подумал я, вместе же чинить быстрее!!! Нет не быстрее если ты отправился в могилу, так как процесс снятия происходил прямо на глазах маньяка, который в ту же секунду долбил тебя еще раз и вешал снова на крюк и в этот раз уже не спастись. Еще в игре можно убежать от маньяка при помощи досок. Так называемых брикетов. Но сделать это крайне проблематично из-за того что через минуту после начала игры этих брикетов уже нет. Твой горячо любимый тиммейт который угробил тебе катку, снимая с крюка, с самого начала игры бегал и опрокидывал эти брикеты на ворон. Подарив мне эту игру за 500 российских рублей, человек обрек меня на покупку нового стола, за место того, который я сломал, новое кресло, вместо обугленной кучи, и новую мышку.\n\nТаково моё впечатление об этой игре. Пожалуй выведу плюсы и минусы:\n\nПлюсы:\n\n+Шикарная атмосфера и геймплей(если всеже попались нормальные люди, а не корзина овощей и фруктов)\n\n+Что-то новое в жанре \"обделайся вместе с друзьями\", хотя и быстро пропадает.\n\n+Удача(Если ты удачлив то для тебя это плюс т.к. многое в этой игре зависит именно от удачи)\n\n+Довольно простое управление, без замудренностей, так что можешь пригласить в игру свою бабулю\n\nМинусы:\n\n-В твоей игре чаще всего будут четыре долбоёба, ты и твои тиммейты. Ты, потому что начал игру с рандомами.\n\n-Маньяк скорее всего обидится на то что ты выпилил ему все крюки и заставит тебя подыхать прямо на глазах у друзей.\n\n-Такой овощной тарелки нету даже в cs:go и dota 2\n\n-Удача(как я уже писал по жизни я лох, так что вот тебе 50 скилчеков и мы выдадим тебе самые ебаные перки)\n\n-Система матчмейкинга, когда тебе с твоим 10 рангом, дают 20 ранги в команду и 1 ранг убийцы.\n\n----- Если маньяк не кемпер, то он обязательно качает несколько теробайт порнухи и из-за этого лагают все, и функция телепорта появляется не только у медсестры, но и у обычного выжившего.\n\nЕсли вы играли в cs:go или dota 2, то по ощущениям это как игра на сильверах или на 500ммр.\n\nВ принципе поорать можно купить, если вы не раздражительный человек то игра доставит вам удовольствие, если же наоборот, то сразу запаситесь мышками, клавиатурами и прочей мелкой техникой, которая лежит рядом с вами.\n\n7 из 10 баллов. Минус кемперы, минус лагеры и минус дауны в команде, которым выжить в реальном мире, попросту нет шансов.","timestamp_created":1487516614,"timestamp_updated":1487516696,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30036911","author":{"steamid":"76561198096398719","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2727,"last_played":1606805482},"language":"schinese","review":"真的是一堆BUG 不想说了","timestamp_created":1487516352,"timestamp_updated":1487516352,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30036653","author":{"steamid":"76561198294261567","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1581774471},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1487515733,"timestamp_updated":1487515733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30036491","author":{"steamid":"76561198104278639","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":165517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4507,"playtime_at_review":61996,"last_played":1660566759},"language":"japanese","review":"すぐ切断するユーザー多数でゲームにならないことがほとんどのクソゲー化しているゲームです！\nそれが許せる方のみプレー出来るかもしれませんが、楽しくは出来ないでしょうｗ\nオススメ出来るかと問われれば、出来ません！(*´ω｀*)","timestamp_created":1487515311,"timestamp_updated":1559459639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30036419","author":{"steamid":"76561198329425049","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":75269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13522,"last_played":1658672178},"language":"french","review":"Trop cool à acheter","timestamp_created":1487515100,"timestamp_updated":1487515100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30036372","author":{"steamid":"76561198010037523","num_games_owned":674,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":94087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2661,"playtime_at_review":61532,"last_played":1660574670},"language":"english","review":"Okay, I originally gave this game a negative review.

You are given the free choice to either survive with a team of up to four other players to escape the killers of the fog, or to become one of the savage psychopaths themselves to ensure that your targets, the survivors, are sacrificed on meat hooks to a mysterious Entity. While the gameplay is absolutely top-notch, there are still the downsides which I will get to later.\n\nBut for now, what else can I say? You're given a choice of up to seven survivors and six killers prior to February 19th, 2017, and who knows if there are more instalments to come? As well as the cat-and-mouse gameplay, you're introduced to the journal of the missing Benedict Baker, an unknown survivor who has survived in the fog for a long time now, resting at the sullen camp fires burning brightly in the darkness. Who are these survivors? What are the motivations of all of the killers? They can all be found in his journal as he comes across them, which you can find in the official Dead by Daylight website.\n\nNow that the point of the game and the story behind it has been revealed, what about the gameplay in particular?\n\nWell, first off, the game has gone through many different updates, as well as several Blood Hunts that give double Bloodpoints (the currency of the game), new outfits for survivors and killers alike, including those made specifically for certain YouTubers, Twitch streamers and the fantastic people who participated in different events, like PAX for example, and proved themselves worthy of their own exclusive customisable items. These allow you to customize your characters to give yourself your own personal surviving/killing experience. As well as this, the game has been constantly balanced out to give survivors the upper hand against the killer and vice versa, with several Perks, Items and Offerings made to turn the tide of every trial. While a good touch, however, there comes a downside, like a negative backlash to the members of the community who use certain Perks.\n\nFor example, most killers in a game will tend to complain about a survivor using the perk Decisive Strike, which is made to be a one-use Perk to get out of the Killer's hold when picked up, or Sprint-Burst, which is used to allow a survivor to move faster for a small period of time. In fact, survivors will complain about a killer using a perk like No One Escapes Death, which when fully upgraded, allows them to instantly put a survivor into dying state in one successful hit.\n\nWhat is meant to be a community game is actually made to feel a lot more fun when playing with friends, and here's the reason why-\n\n~A lot of the time killers and survivors are extremely disrespectful. Killers will do whatever they can to ensure survivors die, and while that isn't necessarily the bad thing, actively gunning down a survivor and face camping them on a hook very much ruins the experience and atmosphere for that survivor, which isn't at all fair on them. Survivors will T-Bag a killer to perhaps rub it in that they didn't do well at catching them in the trial, then proceed to spam \"GG EZ\" in the game chat.\n~Due to these kinds of players more commonly being prestige survivors or killers, some killers may \"dodge\" a lobby when they see any survivor with blood on their clothing (As blood on clothes confirms that they are a prestige for that survivor) or even a certain survivor with a set item, for example, the survivor Jake Park equipped with a Toolbox could be taken as a Saboteur, and the killer will disconnect from the lobby and send EVERYONE back to the menu to look for another game.\n~While you may get these poor sports who will hook camp, dodge lobbies, T-Bag, etc. You will also encounter Bots- Killers who are programmed to stand in one spot and attack so survivors can farm Bloodpoints; They are more common in Blood Hunts, and while they can be reported, you're sort of forced to farm points a little bit so you don't lose any Pips in that game.\n~Survive With Friends allows friends to get together in one big party and survive against avid killers looking to hook them and their dogs. But even with these friends in a lobby, you are still forced to do absolutely nothing for minutes on end as the game struggles to find an appropriate killer that won't cause latency issues.\n~Kill Your Friends in general is just... FUN. At this point the only reason to play in public matches is to get achievements, unlock perks and Prestige all of your survivors. But after you've done that, what else can you really do?\n\nBut I will definitely suggest giving this game a go. Experiment with all of the perks, see which ones you enjoy more, challenge yourself in public matches, get together with friends and go in for a chilling gaming experience.","timestamp_created":1487511888,"timestamp_updated":1487511888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591312646865844727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30034881","author":{"steamid":"76561198204036915","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":80372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39908,"last_played":1627162630},"language":"russian","review":"ИГРА КАЙФ","timestamp_created":1487511205,"timestamp_updated":1487511205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503722071647644043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30034729","author":{"steamid":"76561198367480678","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2523,"last_played":1656757095},"language":"schinese","review":"爽","timestamp_created":1487510838,"timestamp_updated":1487510838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30034654","author":{"steamid":"76561198007820722","num_games_owned":822,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":111181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":297,"playtime_at_review":18607,"last_played":1660510203},"language":"english","review":"If you like a wild rollercoaster ride, this game is for you.  I've logged over 350 hours and have had the game since launch.  Never have I been on the edge of my seat while trying to get that last generator running.  My heart literally is pounding in my chest.   What started out as a fantastic game concept quickly turned into a mess with updates, broken lobby, glitches, etc.  I have stuck with the game and hoped the developers would improve the experience.  It seems, with a recently deployed patch, matchmaking has greatly improved.  While i was getting the pulsing screen of death prior, I've been able to recently get into a lobby without issue.  Hope the devs continue to listen to the community and work to build this to perfection.  I love this game and, with a little patience, you will too.","timestamp_created":1487510622,"timestamp_updated":1487510622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30034497","author":{"steamid":"76561198168417658","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1446,"last_played":1607528734},"language":"english","review":"Great
