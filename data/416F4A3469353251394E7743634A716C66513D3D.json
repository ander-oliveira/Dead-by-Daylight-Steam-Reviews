The PC version is buggy and I always had problems finding a lobby. Once in the game the lag always depends on the killer's connection (the killer creates the lobby, therefore hosts the game). I stopped playing after a while because of the community, nonetheless the game is extremely fun. I have now purchased the PS4 version and there's no chat (aside from your pre-made party if you have a headset) that other players can be salty. At the end of each game you can give props or report players for different reasons. I like that about it. I haven't played the PC version for a while and I have no idea if it's the same as the PS4.\n\nAnyways, if you're looking for a fun game that gives you some scare jumps (but just in the beginning), I recommend this one. Is fun to play alone and with friends.","timestamp_created":1498589248,"timestamp_updated":1498589248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32875952","author":{"steamid":"76561198055305081","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":762,"last_played":1534767625},"language":"russian","review":"Игра

Хорошо это или плохо - не знаю. С одной стороны, приятно, что нет каких-либо сложных вещей и не надо скрупулёзно изучать игру и читать гайды. С другой, от этого игра многим и надоедает. Мне нравится DBD потому что это легко, страшно и красиво. \n\nПеред каждой игрой ты можешь выбрать кем играть: либо выжившим, либо маньяком. От твоего выбора меняются и цели в игре. За выжившего ты должен выжить, за маньяка, соответственно, предотвратить побег выживших. И вроде бы стандартная история для многих хорроров, но DBD затягивает. Чтобы убежать надо завести 5 генераторов (меньше, если ваша команда из 4 пупсиков-заключённых распалась и вылетел один или несколько выживших). Короче, 5 генераторов завели, ищем ворота, открываем и убегаем. Можно найти люк (который рандомно генерируется на карте) и сбежать через него. Скучно, однообразно, да. Но это однообразие закрывают плюсы самой игры:\n\n- Графика. Давайте не спорить, графика приятная на глаз, приятные пейзажи и приятная картинка на месте игры, будь то болото, свалка или психбольница. \n- Разнообразие персонажей. Можете играть рыжеволосой тёлкой, можете играть узкоглазой няшечкой, можете попробовать себя в образе тёмнокожей женщины или поиграть дедом. У каждого персонажа есть достаточно вещей чтобы не чувствовать себя копией другого игрока, который играет этим же персонажем. Удобно и красиво. Еще хочу добавить, что одежду можно получить бесплатно, а можно и купить дополнительный контент. Но я ставлю акцент на то, что получить что-нибудь новое можно и бесплатно . \n- Дополнительные штуки. Ты можешь не только заводить генераторы, но и резать крюки, искать по карте редкие предметы (чтобы в дальнейшем было легче выживать), ломать тотемы. За каждое дополнительное действие тебе будут давать и очки крови (валюта в игре). На очки крови будешь прокачивать персонажа. Совмещаем интересное с полезным.\n- Перки. Как я и говорила раньше, у DBD скучный сюжет. Но вот перки - это изюминка. Перки, они же способности - одна из самых важных и интересных частей в игре. В игре их уйма, некоторые полезные, некоторые нет. Некоторые помогают выживать, некоторые найти предметы покруче, некоторые могут помочь другим игроком. И в зависимости от этих перков ты сможешь выбрать свою тактику игры. Хочешь быть саппортом-доктором? Пожалуйста. Хочешь бОльшую часть времени убегать от маньяка и тянуть время для других игроков? Окей. \n- Донат. Точнее его отстутствие для комфортной игры. Чтобы быть прокаченным игроком не надо вкладывать реал. Перки, которые можно достать из покупных персонажей можно получить и в самой игре, достаточно просто купить их в самой игре за внутриигровую валюту (которую можно получить, к радости, только играя)\nМинусы:\n- Баги. Игра не идеальна, порой баги действительно раздражают. Ты можешь застрять в текстурах, можешь просто зависнуть или выбежать за пределы карты. Радует одно, лично у меня они не так часто появляются. Но если вы решили не брать игру только из-за рассказов о том, что в игре очень много прям ужасно♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ужас ужас боже мой безумное количество багов, то вы ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :)\n- Ээ тиммейты?... Порой такие отбитые попадаются, не могу. В игре идет ранговая система. От 20 до 1. Соответственно, ты можешь быть адекватным 1 рангом, а тебе в команду могут попасться 20 ранг-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ы-неадекваты.

I Am Incredibly Addicted To Dead By Daylight, Except There Are A Few Problems.\nThis Game Is Incredibly Glitchy For I Myself Have Gotten Stuck In Trees From Standing Up In Places Causing My Player To Collide With It And I Have Seen This Happen To Someone Else Also.\nOf Couse That is just one of the many broken things about this game. You can get on top of high places where the killer can not reach you, And There Is a chance they will be pulled off for them to get stuck inside the hook, of which the killer cannot hit them to get them free, and I myself have seen this happen twice.\n\nThis Is an awesome great game of frightening and anticipating scenarios, but is incredibly glitchy and broken. I myself believe this game is still worth playing apart from my pc running at a lousy 60 - 30 Fps, and can be a slow rage enducing game if played at this fps. But somehow I pull through it And still (Usually) Have a great time.\n\nThis is what I originally thought about the game. But after these updates and the developers doing nothing about fixing bugs and basic optimisation for the game I have decided that even though I may still enjoy this game, I personally can't recommend it to others in its current state. Perks can be either completely broken and overpowered or completely useless. I'm always questioning myself on how developers of CIV 6 manage to come out with a new broken/meta character and read his descriptions without realising that it's overpowered and beyond. Animations have always been broken and the fact that the killer is what determines whether something is a hit or miss allows for you to be killed inside a closet when he has poor connection. Rainbow Six Siege may prioritise the player with better connection, at least this is fair. The hit boxes are way of either way, regardless of local connection.\n\nJudging on the current community of players either being completely toxic and meta spamming \"ez game\", when they are using broken killers with broken perks is just tiring and frustrating. For instance, the spirit who while in chase decides to teleport directly to me hooked as I am taken off. This process repeats for every player, killing everyone.\n\nWith the introduction of console players barely anyone knows what they're doing and even the pc players can be brain dead and get the killer on you or unhook you without borrowed time. It is impossible for me to rank up when I constantly get into matches with rank 5 survivors who still don't know how to play the game along with a killer who can one hit you into oblivion.\n\nJudging by the new update that may be coming out, this game may become somewhat more balanced and accessible to

is an updated review.\n\nMy review for Dead by Daylight has bounced back and forth between Recommended and Not Recommended several times over the years. Ultimately, my playtime in this game is a testament to its replayability. That is not to say it isn't without issues, because that's definitely not true.\n\nI started playing Dead by Daylight around a year after it first released. Since then the game's development has had a lot of ups and downs. Some of the negative experiences I've had with it include progress loss, hackers, disabled content, and the automatic temporary ban system. Most of these are self-explanatory, but to elaborate on the latter, a while ago this game introduced a system that automatically bans players who disconnect from matches. These bans are temporary and stack depending on how many times a player consecutively disconnects. In theory this is a fair punishment, however in my experience the system does not distinguish between intentional and unintentional disconnects and I've gotten banned for things like Steam crashing or my Internet connection hiccuping. Due to the frustration that comes with being punished for circumstances that are objectively beyond my control, the game's automatic temporary ban system has been among my worst experiences with this game.\n\nDespite its flaws, Dead by Daylight still has a lot going for it as evidenced by the fact that I keep coming back for more despite my intermittent negative experiences with the game. The implementation of crossplay has definitely been among my best experiences with it as most of my friends are console rather than PC gamers, so it's been great to play with them in a game I actually enjoy (most crossplay titles currently on the market don't interest me). Dead by Daylight should also be acknowledged for its persistent developer support. Updates, fixes, and new content are relatively frequent which helps keeps the playerbase alive. In particular, their recent Halloween event and Hour of the Witch DLC--which added the awesome new boon totem mechanic--really helped reinvigorate my interest in the game.\n\nOverall, while Dead by Daylight is certainly not flawless, it still succeeds in many ways and as a result is standing the test of time as a juggernaut in the horror genre.","timestamp_created":1498556064,"timestamp_updated":1636687285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32848395","author":{"steamid":"76561198380134534","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":98,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1498555536},"language":"schinese","review":"就很烦，开开心心的买了游戏，花了大半天安装，结果进入游戏，多人游戏一直闪退，就连单人模式都是玩不了，心灰意冷","timestamp_created":1498556057,"timestamp_updated":1498556057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450931668281555176","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32847979","author":{"steamid":"76561198248868546","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12850,"last_played":1647355099},"language":"thai","review":"Good Game!!
