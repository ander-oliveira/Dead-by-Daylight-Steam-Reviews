aqui minhas sinceras criticas,\nNo inicio, o jogo é difícil e complicado de aprender, não é nem um pouco convidativo para um jogador iniciante, visto o péssimo sistema de MMR que o ele possui. Este é um jogo no qual você aprende a gostar...\n [b]pois bem... [/b] \nPelo menos era o que eu pensava nas minhas primeiras 100horas, a partir disso o jogo começou a ficar cada vez menos divertido, tudo é muito desbalanceado, tanto para o killer quanto para o survivor, \n [b]Quando joga de survivor [/b], percebe-se como os killers são extremamente \"try hard\" pois fazem uso apenas dos perks que estão no \"meta\", e fazem de tudo para conseguir uma kill. Alguns não satisfeitos em te matar, até buscam te humilhar para se divertir...\n\n [b]Já quando se joga de killer [/b], percebe-se como os survivors usam e abusam de cada exploit na mecânica do jogo, cada pequeno bug é usado, tornando partidas extremamente estressantes, é muito comum a maioria das partidas serem de um assassino com 20 horas de jogo caindo contra sobreviventes de 1000 horas....\n\nnão existe 4fun, não existe equlíbrio, tudo é muito intenso como se fosse uma ranqueada, se você é um assassino estreante, vai precisar desembolsar seu cartão de crédito para comprar novos assassinos e obter seus perks que estão no \"meta\" para aí sim talvez conseguir fazer alguma coisa, pois os sobreviventes de rank alto (você inevitavelmente vai cair só com eles) não te deixam jogar, pelo contrario, vão para cima de você...\n\n [u]HACKERS - TÓPICO IMPORTANTE [/u]\nsim, o jogo possui hackers, você pode procurar no youtube que acha diversos, assassinos vendo através de paredes sem perk para isso, surv correndo mais rápido e atravessando os assassinos... e assim vai... Desde que a Epic deu o jogo de graça para todos, isso começou a ficar mais gritante, pessoas não tem medo de banimento e o anti-cheat do jogo é passivo.\n\n [b]Não recomendo[/b], você que é curioso e vê seu streamer preferido fazendo gameplay, não caia nessa, [b]não se deixe enganar por personagens licenciados dos seus filmes preferidos[/b] pois tudo não passa de uma \"maquiagem\" da verdadeira natureza do conteúdo...  O jogo não vale seu investimento. A desenvolvedora caga para torna-lo melhor e a comunidade fica cada vez mais toxica, alguns chegam a tentar conversar com você \"fora do jogo\" para te xingar e descontar a raiva e frustração da partida...","timestamp_created":1647204206,"timestamp_updated":1647205168,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":46,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.734266400337219238","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112135603","author":{"steamid":"76561198024726325","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":126846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1533,"playtime_at_review":97619,"last_played":1660510812},"language":"english","review":"I've got a lot of hours invested in this game.

Overall I would recommend this game. If you have 2 or 3 friends to play online with, then I whole heartedly recommend it.\n\n===GOOD===\n+The BEST asymmetric game I've ever played with a dev team that truly seems to try their best to keep it balanced\n+High replayability value. The maps are mostly proceduraly generated (with some obvious constants every time). The skill trees and sheer volume of perk combinations can keep things interesting. I will recommend buying a couple DLCs to add that replay value (but only do it on sale.)\n+The gameplay is fun and really carries a horror vibe in the match about 70% of the time (that remaining 30% is one of the drawbacks.)\n\n==BAD===\n-The match making will make or break the game. Getting matched with large skill gaps really kills the experience. Being a mid/low tier killer against high ranked survivors is nothing shy of 10+ minutes of being bullied. And being a mid/low tier survivor against a high tier killer is less survival horror & more the first scene of a slasher film where you know you will die.\n-The skill tree is randomly generated at each level. The more perks you have unlocked the less likely you are to get a specific one in the skill tree. This leads to a big grind need to get one thing. (but hey, if you're having fun you won't notice this too much.)\n-Randos. If you play as a survivor online without at least 1 friend you will want to rip your hair out. There is no team chat, so you have no way to tell your \"allies\" anything or coordinate any plan. Sometimes you'll even get into matches where one survivor is actively trying to sabotage the rest\n\n===MIXED===\n+/-Sometimes killers just vibe. No killing, just vibes.

I do wish though you could get refunds on dlc's or auric cell packs, since you might end up buying a character you don't like and never use. Another thing I think they could change is some of the maps. I'll say there is a majority of maps fair to both survivors and killers, but some are just an easy win for either. One of the indoor maps, I believe the one based off dying light is almost impossible for the survivor. As long as the killer holds down the middle, there's no way to get to the other side of the map. Trying to make a run for it is the same as committing suicide, and there's not nearly enough generators to do, or at least less. \n\nMoving onto the things I enjoy, the developers do a great job of balancing the characters. Even if there are characters like Wraith and Meg Thomas, that still an insanely little amount. I don't even really see Wraiths anymore, but i do see a plethora of Megs. But even then, that does not by any means mean that they are good in game. I have came across people in my lobbies dumber than a squirrel. But basically what I'm saying is your never gonna load into a lobby, see that one character, and just leave. There's no meta system in the game. Also there is a variety of killers with there unique abilities, so your not restricted to a small amount of options, and the same goes for survivors\n\nSo basically I'm saying you should 100% get this game and play it with all your friends, because that is an experience you can't beat","timestamp_created":1647182190,"timestamp_updated":1647182190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112113528","author":{"steamid":"76561199074999936","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":45,"playtime_at_review":1514,"last_played":1660314480},"language":"english","review":"its fun","timestamp_created":1647181771,"timestamp_updated":1647181771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112113451","author":{"steamid":"76561198050852360","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":540,"last_played":1655421854},"language":"german","review":"Good!","timestamp_created":1647181694,"timestamp_updated":1647181694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503169596195220947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112113124","author":{"steamid":"76561198119983850","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":70645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2119,"playtime_at_review":59380,"last_played":1660494762},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어 재밌어 재미없어재밌어 재미","timestamp_created":1647181360,"timestamp_updated":1647181360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuJ3qwf8CdN7WqwM="}
