There is rage quitting culture where anyone who feels slightly displeased will simply disconnect from the game. They will be rewarded for it by losing rank and playing with easier opponents. This is especially true at the beginning of a new ranking season where people just want to keep playing versus easiers opponents. They just keep on intentionally disconnecting. Players keep on calling each other names and getting mad. Nothing significant is being done to prevent this toxicity. There is an in-game reporting feature for bad behaviors but those reports are mostly ignored.\n\nThe ranking system is mostly meaningless. It does not show or track your skills or your experience with the game. It mainly shows and track how long you played it. Anyone can reach the top rank simply by playing enough games. This means that the matchmaking system is also mostly broken where people of highly different skills and experience are constantly matched together.\n\nThis game uses peer-to-peer networking with the killer being the host of the game. This brings a lot of lag issues for all the survivors playing.\n\nThis game is 50% meming, 25% trolling, 15% farming and 10%

I have 405 hours at the moment (90% of which is survivor hours). I just dont have the patience or obviously natural talent as a killer to play as one. this pisses me off no end as the most points are harvested as playing a killer. it can be a frustrating game at the best of times. example you manage to catch a survivor next thing theres a flash light in your face forcing you to drop the newly caught survivor. i personally find this demoralising and damn near give up at that point. sadly this game has become \"toxic\" as they say in the last few months. organised teams playing against the killer which is all very well and good but it destroys the fun. what can i say ! human nasty nature i guess. i recomend the game especially at 50% off its a bargain. give it a go overall rating in my opinion 8/10 great game , but sadly tainted by toxic players but then

1：云个一两个月（至少学会基础操作，边云边玩也可） 。  2：保证自己有良好的肝（不推荐改档）。 3：有朋友带着玩儿。4：不需要dlc拉满，起步一百小时可能会因为 （！完全！） 没有游戏体验失去游玩乐趣，其次新dlc并不能给你任何体验（简单来说不需要你买dlc你怀表钢筋跳楼弹射大心脏自摸咬根什么的都有，完全可行，且这些技能需要  很长时间！ 才能肝出来，肝出来的时候你已经是个小佬了。 5：愿意去练愿意去学心态要好\n就目前而言环境很差，平衡完全取决于屠夫水准，人类只要会修机会一点卡视野贴膜就能把很多会玩的屠夫打崩，即使每一个人都不能溜很长时间，但是电机进度实在是太快了，两极分化非常严重。对局里不是屠夫追到人三台机一亮，就是刚亮一台两个队友在地上躺着一个在钩子上挂着了，可以说红段以下（非车队）就是要么欺负屠夫要么被屠夫欺负。红段基本上遇到的很多都是强度上比较高的屠夫（比如护士，凛妹这种带个耳机，花上一点时间练习就能熟练击杀的屠夫，并且很难反制），当然也会有各种屠皇大佬可以在红段图鲨，但是不难看出就算是屠皇大佬（护士凛妹这种除外），一旦人类里面找不出针对的节奏点，玩弱势屠夫是几乎没有四杀机会的。所以，当人类里面有一个人拉胯，其他三个人也很难带的动甚至可能自身难保。屠夫上手难度和人类上手难度硬要说的话我会选择人类。屠夫需要做到的东西实在是太多了，而且段位越高的局容错率越低，导致技能都是在一个大范围里固定携带。屠夫需要控场控电机，追人的时候一个失误就是一圈或者一个大距离，有耿直追人导致追倒了电机都快亮完的，也有和人皇博弈套路自己的，一个死局被对手盘活是非常影响心态的，操作变形更是雪上加霜。我个人是很讨厌很讨厌守尸的，巡逻守都是，我试过拿砍刀夹子打红段，给我的感觉就是我两个板区放倒你，挂完立马找下一个，无针对，拿到四层bbq以后电机开完了，人类根本不能溜我，但是因为我不打针对所以还是来不及。人类会修机会躲，有运气就可以上红段。屠夫玩儿的再熟练，一个追人的小失误可能导致多了十几秒的追逐时间能让一台本来修不开的电机修开。人类感觉屠夫可以图鲨，是因为你自己没有你想的那么强and队友憨;屠夫感觉人类可以乱调戏他们，是因为他喵修的是真的快。我觉得杀鸡的削弱有些还是可行的，真正不合理的削弱基本没感觉到，至少大削的屠夫，电锯，我们国服依旧有很多电锯之光不是我们一般人可以赶得上的，也不是所谓路人人皇可以溜的动的。屠皇强不仅仅在于击杀，也在于控制人类修电机。\n坦白讲，人类需要削弱，不夹带私货所以不举例某些主播，  [/b]只是为了上分的装甲车是屠皇都大概率翻车的（护士凛妹这种屠夫我就是看不起，不针对玩家只针对屠夫 ，低成本训练高收益回报） 我不怕很多目前觉得人类被削弱成这样的来喷，你想想自己是不是真的强就行。人家单魂牵就能打红段你能带钢筋打击这种第二条命的技能喊不公平，削疲劳，你有没有在玩屠夫的时候一个角落biss点一个弹射盘活恨不得把人家脚剁了，削打击，有没有想过你杀人杀的快打双边针对的时候挂了A挂了B回头找A放倒都不需要一分钟的？有了打击这一分钟我尽情修机这种技能不应该削弱吗？ 又有人喊屠夫弱，确实，屠夫是真的弱（不认为凛妹护士这种算在正常屠夫里），被屠夫杀要么屠夫强要么你菜，反正需要你去练，跟技能削不削弱没关系人家又没改你机制，现在屠夫敢带几个用来击杀的技能？头铁碎板还敢带吗，电机都控不好，三块板一刀人家都三台机了。就我开始玩的版本到现在，屠夫没有真正强过的版本，觉得屠夫强是因为你的队伍里有节奏点，你的队友弱，被屠夫抓到了，你们也就难受了。虽然为屠夫说了那么多话但是我自己也是一个双边玩家，我知道面对大佬的时候只有被乱杀的份，那也是因为我不够强罢了。\n请不要随意甩锅游戏平衡性，自己菜不需要你来找共同语言。人类打的难受是你自己菜，你队友更菜，屠夫打的难受就是自己功夫不到家，真正的人皇很难一把排到四个让你下不去手。","timestamp_created":1544024304,"timestamp_updated":1619923374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47310015","author":{"steamid":"76561198354460768","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":71065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14936,"last_played":1627074985},"language":"russian","review":"супер

It has some of the most tense multiplayer I’ve ever enjoyed. Playing as the survivor has instances of the greatest teamwork with no communication. Where everyone is doing everything possible to save someone in trouble. And playing as the killer can be exceptionally fun when your moving from survivor to survivor, not caring about the generators because you can put so much pressure on them by just going on a rampaging killing spree. But those moments are so few and far between. There are so many issues within the game that the developers who put this game out 2 YEARS AGO refuse to address. all the issues in Dead by Daylight stems from the moment the killer is no longer seen as a threat. \n\nThis is due to a number of reasons, such as a looping and pallets. Obstacles and pallets are placed generously across the maps to help survivors break chases from the killers. However when the survivor seeks to be chased for points as well as annoying the killer, then there are moments when the killer will get frustrated to point where if he finally catches that target it's more likely he will face camp to remove a player from the game. I understand that the chase is part of the game, however when a survivor is intentionally prolonging the chase for as long as possible it breaks immersion heavily and ruins the game for others. The point that i'm trying to get across is that stealth is not rewarded in the game…. You get more points running around and irritating the killer as much as possible rather than getting the objectives that are the entire point of the game.\n\nSome killers are going to be able to deal with looping and pallets way better than other, and perks can remedy some of these issues, but let me make this clear. You will not have the same game experience as the youtubers and streamer who play this game religiously. I have 36 hours played as of making the review, but I am nowhere near to unlocking all the perks on a single character. Perks are crucial to the game, and it's a grind to get them. People who have sunk more time into this game are going to be able to deal with certain situations better than you will because of this. And this issue extremely noticeable when playing as the killer and you don't have higher tier perks. \n\nGoing back to the killer no longer being a threat. After the either of the exits are opened survivors are free to leave, but many times they don't, due to them waiting to see if they need to go back to help a teammate, this is fine, however when the killer meets them at the exit it can create awkward moments where the killer cant do anything but try to force them to leave while having no chance at actually being able to kill them. Why not allow the killer to close exits, and force survivors outside of the gate to leave the game, and then make it to where the door can be reopened by the remaining survivors. It gives the survivors the ability to sit at exit and wait safely while allowing the killer the ability to force safe player out of the game, while at the same time placing a bigger threat on players still trapped in the map.\n\nThe final issue that seems to be reoccurring so often to the extent that it's frustrating, are trapdoor standoffs. OHHHH MAN….. it's a joke that this is still an issue. If the last survivor and the killer meet at the trap door the game can become locked for an extended period of time The killer is no longer a threat. Both will stare are each other, if the killer swings and even downs the player, the killer loses. The Survivor wins as long as the killer doesn't interrupt the jumping animation. Neither wants to lose points during the game. If it has come to this the killer as performed well and has already killed three survivors and the last one is going to do everything in his power to win. To avoid this, I've even came to the point where I would down the second to last survivor and walked the entire map three to four times looking for the last one as well as the hatch. Of course the downed player eventually bleeds out and the game ends with a hatch escape and the dead player in end game lobby cursing up a storm saying that the killer had downed him and left, and that the last player should be banned for hiding in a locker the entire time. The developers need to make up the mind with hatches, either make the last survivor uninterruptible while jumping in the hatch, or allow the killer to close the hatch for an extended period of time. The game is not being held hostage by a player…. It's the developers not wanting to make a choice that is wasting your time.\n\nWhile Dead by Daylight is a fun game and one of the forefronts in the multiplayer horror genre, it's these issues that keep me from recommending it to others, The second immersion is broken, and the killer is no longer scary, is the same moment this game takes a nose dive in terms of quality.","timestamp_created":1543956387,"timestamp_updated":1544407346,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47297033","author":{"steamid":"76561198408369117","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1606427490},"language":"turkish","review":"gt 9600 ekran kartına sahipsenz almayın açmıyo oyunu","timestamp_created":1543954089,"timestamp_updated":1543954089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47296750","author":{"steamid":"76561198055899002","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":31719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8565,"last_played":1654333169},"language":"english","review":"I used to recommend this game as I genuinely liked and I still really want to like it, but in light of recent events I can no longer in good conscious recommend or play this game. Here is a list of pros and cons so you can decide if this game is worth buying. I'll start with the cons since, in my opinion, the cons are the most important part of the decision making process.\n\nCons:\n\nThe grind- This game has the worst, most unsatisfying grind of any game I have ever played. There are 164 perks in the game, 86 of them are survivor perks and 78 of them are killer perks. In order to unlock them you need to go through the Bloodweb, I don't know how to describe the exactly what the Bloodweb is so look it up on youtube if you want a more detailed description but here is a quick summary. You spend your bloodpoints (an in-game currency earned by playing matches) in the bloodweb in order to unlock: perks, items, offerings, etc. The bloodweb is completely RNG based and each perk has 3 tiers. You have to unlock each tier of the perk individually if you want to use the perk's full effect. That's not so bad though right? As long as bloodpoints are easy to get and the things in the bloodweb are cheap. For killer it's pretty easy getting bloodpoints, it's a bit more difficult as survivor. Regardless of whichever side you play the cost for items in the bloodweb ranges between 3000-9000 bloodpoints. I would say the average survivor earns between 15,000-20,000 bloodpoints each match, provided they play decently and don’t get screwed over by their teammates or have an grumpy killer. For killers I would say the average number of bloodpoints earned per match is around 20,000-25,000. I have played around 400 or so hours of this game and I have levelled up around 6 of the 13 or 14 killers to level 50, and levelled up maybe 4-5 of the survivors to 50. There is nothing fun about the bloodweb, you can spend weeks trying to get a perk and not even get it. It takes 1,000,000 bloodpoints, the bloodpoint cap, to level a character up to 50. Well, sure, but at least the perks you do get allow for more fun and diverse gameplay, right?\nQuick note- Dead by Daylight has a battle pass. It is extremely grindy and unfun. You can only select one challenge at a time to complete and in most cases you have to get lucky to complete them.\nThe perks: Out of the 86 survivor perks, 26 of them are actually useful, 4 of them are meta. Out of the 78 killer perks, 27 of them are useful, maybe 4 of them are meta. Most of the perks the devs release are filler perks because they want to keep releasing 3 perks for every survivor and killer. The devs are afraid of giving killers perks that will make them too punishing and powerful, which is why it usually takes between 4-5 chapters before killers ever get useful perks that can be part of the never changing meta of Dead by Daylight. So while survivors are given incredibly strong perks that provide a fun experience for the survivors such as:\nDecisive Strike: After being unhooked or unhooking yourself, Decisive Strike will become active and usable for 40/50/60 seconds. While Decisive Strike is active, when grabbed by the Killer, succeed a Skill to automatically escape the Killer's grasp and stun them for 5 seconds.\nUnbreakable: Grants the ability to fully recover from the Dying State once per Trial. Increases the Dying State Recovery speed by 25/30/35 %.\nObject of Obsession: If you are looking in the Killer's direction, your link will reveal your Auras to each other. This effect applies only if you are outside of the Killer's Terror Radius. As the Killer's Obsession, this effect applies to a maximum range of 56/64/72 metres. Otherwise, it applies to a maximum range of 44/56/64 metres.\nThe killers more often than not are given perks like:\nCoup de Grace: Each time a Generatoris completed, Coup de Grâce grows in power. Gain 1 Token per Generator. Consume 1 Token to increase the distance of your next Lunge Attack by 40/50/60 %.\nGearhead: After hitting a Survivor 2 times with your Basic Attack, Gearhead activates for 20/25/30 seconds. Each time a Survivor completes a Good Skill Check while repairing, the Generator will be revealed by a yellow Aura for as long as it is being repaired.\nAnd occasionally killers will be given something good like:\nA Nurse’s Calling: The Auras of Survivors who are healing or being healed are revealed to you when they are within a range of 20/24/28 metres.\nI am of the belief that both sides should be given strong and meta changing perks. The meta of this game never changes, except for killers because the devs will often change things on the killer side if they see that it is getting too much use. An example of this is Hex: Ruin, the perk used to be a staple in every killer’s build because of how useful it was. Since it was getting so much use the devs changed it. It’s use is now resurging with the release of the perk Hex: Undying. On the survivor’s end however, the meta has been:\nDecisive Strike, Unbreakable, an exhaustion perk, and Borrowed Time\nIt’s incredibly unhealthy for a game to only change the meta of one side while leaving the other completely untouched. Especially since the reason for the change to Hex: Ruin was that it was too strong and getting too much use. It makes it look as if the devs are giving the survivors preferential treatment.\nGreed:\nThis part will be short as much of the context for it I explain in an upcoming part. There are three in-game currencies in Dead by Daylight: Auric cells, Iridescent shards, and Bloodpoint. However, in reality there are only two: your time and your money. Iridescent shards are gained through leveling your profile up, Auric cells are purchased, and bloodpoints are gained through playing matches. The best cosmetics can only be bought by using Auric cells, and a lot of them. There is no way to get auric cells in game unless you buy the battlepass. \nThe Gameplay:\nThe gameplay starts out feeling very exciting and fun but overtime it becomes stale, boring, and frustrating. It is often joked that playing survivor is a holding m1 simulator and playing killer is a walking in a circle simulator. Survivors and Killers have 1 objective, for survivors it is to complete generators and escape, for killers it is kill the survivors. The only fun part of the game in many people’s opinion is the chase interaction between killers and survivors. However, when there is only one objective for each side it makes sense that each side would try to complete the objective as fast as they can. This often leads to shorter matches which as a killer is frustrating and stressful because you feel as if you never had much of an opportunity to play. For survivors it can be frustrating because killers who are under pressure and stressed will try to kill survivors as fast as they can to gain precious time. Nobody likes being rescued from the hook only to be immediately downed and hooked again. This is often necessary as time is something that killers often don’t have. But you can’t expect survivors not to do the only objective in the game. Can you see the problem? The other part that makes this game so frustrating is that there is no win condition for either side. The ranking system of this game is garbage. As a survivor you can do next to nothing and rank up. As a killer you can play extremely well but guess what you used a killer that doesn’t rely on basic attacks enough, so while you played well and killed all 4, you don’t rank up. The game would be a lot less frustrating if there was a clear win condition. However, the devs want this game to be frustrating.
