Although fun at times, it's an unbalanced mess and does not come anywhere NEAR what it's TRYING to set out to do. I enjoy this game from time to time, but generally, I'd say it's a hard pass for those that haven't actually played it. If you're going to play a horribly unbalanced game that cheats you out of rightful victories via unbalance, cheaters, bugs, glitches, and just all around bad design, you're better off playing Mario Party or something that's actually fun and doesn't try to hide the fact that it's unfair. Spend your money on a better game that doesn't lock out 50% (and growing) of it's content behind expensive DLC.\n\nTo name a few problems, and I DO mean a FEW:\n\n-Half of the entire game is essentially not there. Trying to find games as a killer takes a very, very long time. I've waited almost a full hour multiple times just waiting to get into a lobby. Even when you do find one, prepare to get outstandingly discouraged when you realize that you're actively discouraged from upgrading a killer, since the devs are extremely stingy with bloodpoints (which you need in order upgrade your characters, and not upgrading is basically a death sentence.). What is the point of wasting valuable currency on a character you can RARELY even play? And if you DON'T upgrade, it's almost just a given that you will lose. Putting in effort to make your killers better is not viable or worth it, and even if you did upgrade to a decent place, good luck finding a lobby.\n\n-If somebody disconnects from the game while everyone is loading in, be prepared to wait about 2+ minutes for the game to load you into the server, and then IMMEDIATELY kick you out, with essentially no compensation at all. You don't even know when someone disconnects. You'll only come to that realization once you realize 5 minutes has passed and you're STILL on the loading screen. Also, if you use an offering (items that can be used to benefit you. You can select these items before the game starts.) especially a very rare one, pray nobody disconnects while loading in, or you can kiss it goodbye. It's actually just gone.\n\n-Unbalanced catastrophe. The amount of horribly unbalanced, ridiculously overlooked and janky cockamamie that occurs in this game, is absolutely astonishing. It's really quite the testament, how little it seems the developers care about smoothing over existing problems. I don't know where to begin with how bad the balance in this game is. Even if everyone is running the tryhardiest set up they possibly can, it still is not balanced. When you get anywhere near an average skill level, EVERYONE is using the most tryhard and broken perks in the game. Always. At all times. Every single game is the exact same at that point. It gets very, very tedious, very, very repetitive, very, very boring, and very, very agitating. Not to mention the fact that there are no dedicated servers. This is a huge problem, as connection in this game, like 40% of the time, is a big problem, and causes many issues that would not have occurred otherwise. Although, there are dedicated servers in the works as of this review being written. So, hey! A round of applause for the devs, and rejoice! It only took them 3 and a half years to implement this basic, and very much needed system that even lesser companies have been using. Really shows how much they care and pay attention to the games well-being.\n\nTo some people, this could be the game they've been waiting for all their life. This could be their favorite game of all time. But generally, I don't think it's worth it. This REALLY has to be your kind of thing, and you REALLY have to be able to come to terms with the fact that you WILL be screwed over in many, many ways, and WILL be/feel cheated a LOT. I've already considered getting a refund, but the time has passed on that. If anything, I'll probably wait until a certain event is over, then I'll uninstall it and send it to the bottom of my Steam game library barrel, with the rest of the horrible shovel-ware that plagues this platform. The base game is, as of now, only 10 dollars. But, unfortunately, that is not where it stops being cheap.\n\nPass.","timestamp_created":1569506183,"timestamp_updated":1569507066,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521286666393280029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55287966","author":{"steamid":"76561198112398659","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1575985902},"language":"koreana","review":"신선한 게임 재미도 있고 여러 사람이랑 같이 할만한 게임","timestamp_created":1569505170,"timestamp_updated":1569505170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55287826","author":{"steamid":"76561198322147609","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1637444064},"language":"russian","review":"Купил игру чтоб играть с друзьями, а они не играют.

I came from an MMO and visual novel background so it was very different for me but it didn't take long to learn the basics.  Time and experience helps you improve your chances of survival.\n\n🕛 Game time / Length 🕛\n🔳 Really short (0 - 3 hours)\n🔳 Short (4 - 8 hours)\n🔳 Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]\n🔳 Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything]\n✅ Very Long (61-100 hours)\n✅ Extremely Long (101+ hours)\n[b]Comments:[/b] This is a game that is playable over and over and you never really reach an end.  You'll find yourself with 100 hours before you know it if everything is going decently well.\n\n⚙️ Gameplay ⚙️\n✅ Frustrating\n🔳 Sleepy\n🔳 Boring\n✅ Fun\n✅ Challenging\n[b]Comments:[/b] Depending on the position of the moon, this game can be extremely fun and rewarding or downright depressing or infuriating.  Either the bugs or the community can ruin it for you.  Because rank matters to a lot of the community and dictates (sometimes) who you get matched with, you can have an awful time because another survivor purposely let the killer know where you were or they dumped the killer on you.  A glitch/bug can happen and you can be out of the game within seconds which causes you to lose your rank.  There is a lot that needs improvement here, both with the game itself and the community.\n\n☠️ Difficulty ☠️\n🔳 Easy\n🔳 Average\n✅ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n✅ Hard\n🔳 Unfair\n[b]Comments:[/b] I wouldn't say it's easy to learn, but it isn't incredibly difficult either.  It just takes time to get to know the controls and learn what to listen and look out for.  I recommend watching game-play and guides to help you improve or learn what else you could incorporate to improve.\n\n📜 Story 📜\n✅ There is none\n🔳 Bad\n🔳 Alright\n✅ Good\n🔳 Fantastic\n[b]Comments:[/b] There is lore behind each survivor and killer but not really a story to follow.  The lore is wonderful and really makes you connect with the character.\n\n👀 Graphics 👀\n✅ Beautiful\n🔳 Good\n🔳 Decent\n🔳 Bad\n🔳 Awful\n[b]Comments:[/b] The locations are great, killers and gore are wonderful!  Characters are pretty good.  There is constantly new things added to spruce up your killer or survivor and customize them to make them yours.  The maps have a general layout with random spawns of the basement, pallets, windows, totems, and gens so you can't really memorize the map.  The death animations are pretty cool, especially each killer's Mori.\n\n🎵 Audio 🎵\n✅ Very good\n🔳 Good\n🔳 Not too bad\n🔳 Bad\n🔳 Don't bother to listen\n[b]Comments:[/b] This is a game you definitely want to have your headphones on for.  The music and sound effects are great, but you have to constantly keep your eyes and ears working to know how to make your next move.\n\n🐛 Bugs 🐛\n✅ Bugs ruin the game\n✅ Lots of bugs\n🔳 Few Bugs\n🔳 Nothing encountered\n[b]Comments:[/b] Bugs are everywhere.  Sometimes it is something that doesn't really matter like the hook coming out of your arm instead of your chest but sometimes characters just fly off the map or are stuck in a certain position.  I've personally vaulted through a window and ran and ended up with a speed bug that the killer didn't have a chance.\n\n💰 Price / Quality 💰\n🔳 Full price\n✅ Wait for Sale\n🔳 Don't buy\n🔳 Refund it if you can\n[b]Comments:[/b] Because the bugs and known issues are so ongoing I would recommend waiting until a sale.  I'm also under the impression that the developers would rather continue to make money by putting out more content than fixing things that have been broken for years.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] This game can be terrific and terrible depending on if bugs appear, how the community treats you, and how well you can let things simply roll off your back.  There can be some amazingly creepy moments but also some hilarious ones as well.  As long as surviving is a pleasant surprise and not an expectation, you can have a good time.  I recommend buying it on sale because it is not a fully functioning game some times.  You will certainly get your money's worth either way.

Like its only fun if you play as a killer cause literally after 2 hooks you're out of the game? kind of boring to the point where its not fun, plus the killers have like a million hooks everywhere and wiggling and repairing the generator takes way too long which is actually kind of dumb like they give you 5 generators with 4 survivors and it takes like 5 mins for one generator?. Only kind of fun when you go into a custom game with friends besides that you might as well only play as a killer, playing as a survivor is just edgy you might as well hook yourself. Unless they update gameplay for fair chance i would'nt recommend this game for anyone.","timestamp_created":1569467684,"timestamp_updated":1569467684,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421960055828094482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55282831","author":{"steamid":"76561198142246964","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2874,"last_played":1595303059},"language":"english","review":"I'm really enjoying this game if the devs keep adding in characters from horror classics I can see this being a game that I play for a very long time.","timestamp_created":1569465715,"timestamp_updated":1569465715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55282774","author":{"steamid":"76561198156683151","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3477,"last_played":1616037890},"language":"english","review":"wow, just wow. a mentally disabled, blind, quadriplegic monkey could code a more balanced game than this mess.\nthey say A for effort but it probably would have ended up better if they had given the game away years ago and let some make a wish kid balance it for them.\nMaybe if they ever actually play their own game as survivor they'd come across the myriad of broken perks, add-ons and hex's, but that would be asking far too much of a development team that's made millions.\nhopefully they keep getting their balance recommendations from the handicap killers in this game because i'd hate to see a survivor make it out alive past rank 5 that would be far too unfair.","timestamp_created":1569465031,"timestamp_updated":1608355231,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55282674","author":{"steamid":"76561198993038375","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1623419920},"language":"french","review":"Très très bon jeu :)","timestamp_created":1569464286,"timestamp_updated":1574808875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55282481","author":{"steamid":"76561198849986994","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1636799366},"language":"schinese","review":"萌新不要玩了\n","timestamp_created":1569462976,"timestamp_updated":1569462976,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515652716159820557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55282411","author":{"steamid":"76561198247103358","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":18075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":8754,"last_played":1660593310},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10 Mejor simulador de ser perseguido por un asesino.\n\n","timestamp_created":1569462437,"timestamp_updated":1569462437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55282281","author":{"steamid":"76561197968021962","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1569552065},"language":"brazilian","review":"Boas \nAcabei comprando o Dead by Daylight -

It is a good concept, but poorly executed by the devs at behavior.  The game play is pretty simple, avoid the killer while trying to repair the generators so you can try to escape the match and live to do the exact same thing again. OR methodically patrol the map looking for and doing your best to kill as many of the survivors as you can before they escape (which the devs make pretty easy).  \n\nWhile a game concept like this one should be Slightly one sided in the killers favor (seeing as it is the 1 killer vs 4 survivors), the developers keep skewing the balance almost completely to the killers side of things (killer mains gonna hate on and disagree with that statement).  When the game is so far off balance it kills any fun for the Majority of the player base.  The balance is so far off kilter, that it gets boring to even play as the killer (at least it got that way for me when I did).  There is no challenge when the game is practically handed to you on a silver platter.  Take all of that on top of the fact that a majority of the player base (on both sides) is very toxic.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one, so don't make the same mistake.  Go buy something else.\n\nIt's been quite a while since I wrote this review.  Nearly every update that Behavior has added to this game since just breaks it even further than it already was, making things easier and easier for the killer side of the game.  I not only stand by the review that I've already written, I honestly wish that I could get a full refund of every single dollar I wasted on this broken, dumpster fire of a game. Thankfully, albeit very late, I have learned my lesson and I will NEVER waste any of my time or money on another project that Behavior Interactive is involved with ever

101」:\n人類方須修復五臺發電機才能開啟大門逃生，或是通過下水道逃生（當三名隊友死亡，即開啟下水道）基於人類能藉由多排語音之下，官方對其大幅度削弱，甚至在地圖與殺手上動刀，DLC方面也是越做越差，不論人類還是殺手。\n\n人類技能人勇、打頭、懷錶從剛出時便不斷削弱，不出一週砍到底，就已經沒甚麼強勢技能了還削，然而部分殺手基體不差還增強，反正一有人可以輕鬆遛，不出一個禮拜增強兩三次，如此規模性的更動，有無重視人類玩家的感受嗎？並非所有人類玩家都是多排，單排玩家跟新手的感受呢？遊戲不就該讓大家好好享受，讓更多的人流動嗎？況且所謂的積分制毫無意義，紅段上分根本不可能（修兩臺、遛鬼遛好遛滿、救人救好救滿、不准倒？)\n\n上紅段之前的人類Rank太好爬導致一堆垃圾都能上來，只會暴走族躲整場然後又不做事，新手都知道要修機，比新手還不如就知道多垃圾了...低能的行為很張揚呢！怕別人不知道你領過手冊？？？\n\n※段位徽章制度※\n懶人包(邊救援、邊修機、邊遛鬼、不會倒地)\n這爛遊戲就是要你一個人全都做才能上分，可是被Tunnel就:D\n\n關於「殺手Killer 101」:\n殺手需阻止倖存者修復發電機並獻祭。殺手基於人類多排和發電機修復速率的關係而衍生了場場必帶毀滅的局面；或必須得利用怨靈、護士這類無法克制的殺手應對。\n\n※練角需知※\n強烈建議直接怨靈（靈界移動，悄無聲息地摸到倖存者，飛的好也是無視地形了）、護士（無視地形的屠殺）、兔女（狙擊手，夠強的話也是無視地形了），這三隻殺手只要夠熟爛，倖存者也奈何不了。\n\n※關於「守屍Camp」※：\n屬於殺手方的玩法之一，為獻祭的分支，將人類掛上鉤子後守在那，透過其餘人類前來救助，達成一換一的手段，雖然這是玩法之一，且官方也默認這種行為，但這種玩法可以直接讓人不用玩，試問你碰到這種人做何感想？ Only loser know how to camp.\n\n8米外不算守，隨便一個殺手走一下2秒到了，況且守屍分數依舊很高，我也是一個問號，官方在告訴玩家，想要血點多一點，就守屍多一點，順便補足殺手玩家不足的問題，傑出！\n\n※ Dead by daylight 3.2.0 排隊機制 ※：\n殺手所對到的多排玩家一定為高段位，手電筒（紫手電頂高配）戴好戴滿準備毒瘤，為什麼我會知道，因為我被毒瘤過，只有人渣才這樣玩，還給我止血針陪襯。\n\n然後人類單排的要死要活，然後還有R20的？紅段配白段？？？殺手有問題狂改，人類有問題放給他死？\n\n幸好短短地一個禮拜就改動了，不然真的會發瘋 :D\n\n※ Dead by daylight 3.5.0 ※ ※第五人格2.0※：\n人類變相成為大贏家，修機速率快到不可思議，即便是怨靈和護士也擋不住，一場大約6～10分鐘結束，除非帶頂高配和斬殺。醫生也在這次改變躍升T1，醫生（恐慌降靈、厄咒：毀滅、國王旗子、多彩皇后）即便如此在紅段也不見的撐得住，況且紅段厲害的很多，多排輕鬆遛、打頭、借來，不過大部分紅段都假的（一堆暴走族爆整場） \n\n※遊戲風氣※：\n殺手相對於人類，在一場中所花費的心力一定來的高，面對多排的確很難抗衡，但殺手的附加品、斬殺和各類守屍（面守、巡邏守）絕對比多排強勢，因為你可以直接讓人不用玩遊戲，部過最惡劣的是外掛，透過改檔（透視和加移速）來贏取勝利不覺得丟臉嗎？\n\n人類因為多排的關係，信息量非常之大，甚至為了自己的快樂，來嘲諷殺手，不論是利用手電筒還是動作都一樣，玩遊戲將心比心。\n\n故意掉段的多到不像話，十分惡意，然而官方還是繼續放任。\n\n總結：這種問題永遠無法解決，因為爛人就是這麼多，只能做好自己該做的。\n\n※關於「官方伺服器」※：\n官方到底在...？比以前連殺手的網路還差，場場都可以看見世外桃源（垃圾殺手直接在窗板前等人），各種次元斬和蟲洞斬層出不窮，是在變相Buff殺手？連到日本官服便已如此，可想而知，反之，我當殺手時想髒一刀都不行，十分傑出。\n\n世外桃源：次元斬、掙扎Bug、上鉤畫面黑掉、飛天和補血HitBox到底What The F*ck，修復？他媽你們敢講有修我都不敢聽了？？？\n\n最想靠北補血Bug，都幾年了，倒地不能被補起來，自帶不痛不癢還是怎樣？？？是希望人類帶自補這個破技，還是場場都醫療包和老人頭，拉起來都得靠自己？？？有時間包裝DLC沒時間平衡或修復，耖你的 :D\n\n凌晨大當機，喔不對，是每個時段都在Lag，人肉沙包？Lag按毀滅是在考驗夠不夠抖M？？？\n\n最大贏家：電鋸、兔女、佛萊迪\n\n※關於「電鋸」※:\n官方到底要平衡皮臉和電鋸了沒，一堆輸不起、惡劣玩家成天電鋸守屍自助餐，一堆五臺守、BM，我真的不知道好玩在哪，當人類看到電鋸就知道救人沒望了是？？？重點一堆人看到電鋸在守屍還要硬救，直接滅團我也是問號了。\n\n一刀斬一直是電鋸的特色，不能拔掉很合理，而且我不也希望這方面更動，但要讓這個特質不能夠變相守屍，能改成被掛逃生者之鉤子附近距離幾米不能使用電鋸，當該人被救下後便能使用，這樣就不會有看到皮臉直接宣告死亡的情形，但希望它的使用有足夠的限制以制衡它的無解。\n\n※關於「終局機制」※: \n這垃圾機制明顯就是搞人類玩家，意料之內，官方又在偏袒了，怕殺手玩家被嘲諷而設計，治標不治本，一堆殺手憑藉終局機制守屍，然後人類方一堆沒頭腦的直接開門，試問三分鐘的時間救人哪有那麼容易，況且有時還有一刀的狀況，雖然以前有所謂的拖地道局，十分浪費時間。\n\n※關於殺手「怨靈和護士Nurf」※：\n怨靈和護士被削弱剛剛好，都強幾年了，被削的點根本不影響會玩的，怨靈沒有碰撞體積跟護士孕吐連飛這種無敵能力被改，剛好平衡而已，孕吐完馬上二飛（孕吐時間超短，有時候夠髒，孕吐時間可以砍人 WTF？？？當人類玩家跟護士一樣都可以飛喔。怨靈靈界移動還可以撞到實體和聽聲音我真的 I don’t understand，先不論合不合理，根本無敵的存在。\n\n這兩隻，怨靈最好練:D\n※別把無敵角被削弱當作你們不能對付多排的藉口，輸家們 :)※\n\n※關於「拔線懲罰」※:\n拔線懲罰在哪裡，一堆人狂拔诶，看起來有跟沒有一樣 :)\n\n※關於「家機等跨平台聯動」※：\n官方擺明就是強制讓Dead by daylight的玩家增加，因為他們的爛平衡很多人不玩了:D\n家機10個有11個雷，雖然桌機玩家也沒好到哪，要爛起來也可以比家機恐怖，不過至少沒有家機暴走族暴整場誇張，每場都在一打四，至今遇到強的家機也才一次而已，爛遊戲請加油 :(\n\n※關於「平衡」※：\n發電機速率降低，人類部分附加品削弱，增強人類板區（太多地圖的板區短版之多，新出的鎖門和小屋改動很傷）\n\n總結：這就是一款爛遊戲，但很好玩 :D \n\n※抖M遊戲※ ※爛遊戲最好玩※ ※人品大考驗※ ※人格分裂※

by Daylight is actually a pretty fun game. \nIt has a simple idea of Cat vs Mouse but the Cat being a insane killer and the Mouse/Mice being Survivors trying their best to not get sacrificed to an all seeing Entity.\n\nIt runs pretty well on my 6 year old computer so I wouldn't say that it requires that good of a PC and the Graphics are aight, It's real nice to be able to change graphics in-game instead of having to restart with like many others.\n\nThere are some balancing issues with some killers like Nurse and Spirit being virtually unbeatable if they are good enough and at the same time the game being a bit survivor sided.\n\nThere are also a lot of queue time and ranking problems making it so you can wait 10 mins to get into a game with people of wildly different rank, but this doesn't happen to frequently at low ranks.\n\nOverall I'd rate DBD a

The survivors are however not as exiting, you should only get them for their perks.\n\nCurrency is handeled really well as there are three different types, currency that you can buy, shards wich you earn by leveling and bloodpoints wich you earn every match. You can only buy cosmetics and some characters with real money so it is not pay to win.\n\nEven if you don't pay any money in this game you can still gett allmost everything by playing and leveling, and if you play well it goes faster.\n\nThe creators seem engaged in the community even if it takes a while before they fix stuff.
