Sometimes I will go to a match and be unable to control my character, forcing me to have to use task manager to leave the game or by pressing esc and leaving the game. Sometimes it will even shut it self off (since the most previous update). Next, \"Lag\" when a hex starts or when Micheal Myers gets to level III in stalking, sometimes the game will stop for a half second or two during these times, causing you to get hit by the killer. I have a great gaming PC so this is some sort of bug in the game. Thirdly, camping killers are the worst. The game even has a \"perk\" for camping killers with the still for 4 seconds sealth mode. It's quite annoying and aggrevating. Other than that I'd give this game 4 stars. Just fix these bugs and find a way to stop the camping.

If the survivors are on voice comms, they have such an edge on the killer that the games become extremely one-sided. This is the single most important factor to whether a match is an actual match or a complete stomp.\n\nIn addition to this inherent flaw, the development team has time and time again proved their inability to release balanced content, as well as their slowness in balancing existing unbalanced content. Actually, they don't even intend to balance the game as the strenghts of the different killers vary wildly and will continue do so for the forseeable future. So don't expect this game to be balanced in any way.\n\nAnd not only are the designs bad, Dead by Daylight suffers from recurrent game-breaking bugs. You'd think that after 3,5 years they would have evolved the scrutiny to not release anything game breaking anymore, but somehow they do manage to release broken content and they do so time and time again: survivors being able to sprint burst on demand, multiple killers in game, survivors being able to trap the killer, survivors being able to deny the killer from killing the survivors, killer permanently losing heartbeat, the list goes on. Due to the development and release cycles these game-breaking bugs can persist for weeks on end.\n\nSo is it fun to play? Maybe. If you play survivor and aren't matched against either of the two strongest killers it can be. Or, if you are a despicable person, you can play with your friends and coordinate how to bully the killer. As the killer, be prepared for some serious queue times, dodge any survivor friends groups and queue again. Then maybe you will get a good match. Add to this the most rotten, the most bad mannered, the most toxic community you can imagine (at least in my region) and you have what Dead by Daylight is today. Is it worth a try? Maybe.

This game would appear at first that it may be suitable for a casual gamer but after less then 24 hours I can say that this game is frustrating and the community is toxic. First the game will start you off by placing you against people that have played hundreds if not thousands of hours. Then when you lose they will be sure to let you know in the hat at the end how worthless you are. If you win? Guess what? They still don’t like you. I have never had a more toxic experience in gaming and I play overwatch.\n\nBut you can be a killer! That’s the hopes right? The survivors shine flashlights in your face and stay right next to you because it’s not about the killer hunting survivors. It’s about the survivors milking your time. As a killer you would think that you are supposed to kill, right? Nope. You are supposed to hang them on hooks so their friends can release them and heal them so you can chase them in circles. \n\nSo after playing killer I thought maybe survivor will be better because they always seem to harass me. Nope. The killers know exactly what they are doing and have all the perks from hours of gameplay to hunt you down and hang you on hooks.\n\nThis game is frustration waiting to happen. \n\nEdit: BUT.... after about 30 more hours of playing I have come to love this game and I would definitely recommend it. At first I didn't think I would like this game because of the steep learning curve but if you can get past that you will discover a highly addictive game. I recommend playing survivor first because the killer community is nicer and they don't cuss you out for learning.","timestamp_created":1514189777,"timestamp_updated":1514672342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571159303188323975","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38649779","author":{"steamid":"76561198379533892","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":25164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11706,"last_played":1641976842},"language":"schinese","review":"非常的棒","timestamp_created":1514189739,"timestamp_updated":1514189739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38649704","author":{"steamid":"76561197984886985","num_games_owned":560,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":216880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7343,"playtime_at_review":13040,"last_played":1660584422},"language":"japanese","review":"かくれんぼからのおにごっこからのれべるあげ","timestamp_created":1514189512,"timestamp_updated":1514189512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38649522","author":{"steamid":"76561198020975863","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":52316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2930,"last_played":1658917386},"language":"english","review":"I absolutely despise this game..","timestamp_created":1514188981,"timestamp_updated":1628647504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38649343","author":{"steamid":"76561198452838241","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":191968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1758,"playtime_at_review":5039,"last_played":1660596348},"language":"romanian","review":"Este un joc foarte tare, il recomand\n","timestamp_created":1514188477,"timestamp_updated":1514188477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38649026","author":{"steamid":"76561198341159823","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":49123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3355,"last_played":1653827875},"language":"russian","review":"Топеч❤","timestamp_created":1514187589,"timestamp_updated":1514187589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440251588821411133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38648862","author":{"steamid":"76561198155331823","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":7642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1626030024},"language":"english","review":"This game is an unoptimized, buggy piece of shit.
