At first, you couldn't play with friends in public lobbies but they added that in. Then, after a few months of waiting to play with my friends in a public game, the matchmaking was broken beyond belief. They fixed that with an update and then next update, broke it even further. Then, due to this whole thing about 90% of the community was toxic.\n\nThe developers do streams every Thursday and I've watched quite a number of them. Out of every stream I've watched however, only one was ACTUALLY informative. There seems to be a lot of reluctance to answer questions about the real issues with the game like the previously mentioned matchmaking problems, balance issues (which have been resolved mostly) and so on. Instead, there is a large focus on new content like new maps, killers, survivors, perks etc. That is great but the game hardly functions most of the time so the content is basically useless. \n\nLooking past the issues, the gameplay is pretty fun. A simple idea that as a slasher/horror film fan, I deeply appreciate. Playing as the Killer is pretty cool, chasing down survivors and injuring them so they can be taken to a hook to die. Each killer so far, has been pretty awesome actually. The Trapper can place lethal bear traps to catch out unsuspecting survivors, the Hillbilly is a deformed man-thing reminiscent of Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre films as well as the inbred creatures from the Wrong Turn films. He carries a cattle hammer and a chainsaw which allows you to charge after survivors and incapacitate them with one hit (this sounds overpowered but It's actually fairly balanced). The Wraith can go invisible and sneak up behind survivors, uncloak and cause carnage with his axe. The Nurse can teleport (with a cooldown) and attack survivors with her bonesaw. The Shape is the iconic Michael Myers from the Halloween film series and can stalk survivors to charge a one shot ability. He is perhaps the creepiest killer personally as you can't hear him or see him until he is relatively close so there is some serious oppurtunity for scares here and there. The Hag can place down markers that, when walked by, trigger a fake killer that she can teleport to. \n\nThe survivors has numerous perks and skills that can help them escape the killers as well as unique perks such as boosts to other survivors, self-healing and sabotaging hooks.\n\nThe maps are very atmospheric and you can tell that there is a lot of influence from classic slasher films like Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot potential if it is improved and refined. The idea is fantastic and when the game functions well, it is seriously fun with friends. I would say that if you are interested in this game, either wait for a sale so you can get it cheaper or perhaps look into the Friday The 13th game that is currently in development but is said to release later on in 2017. It has a similar idea but has the Friday the 13th license so you can run away from or become Jason Vorhees.","timestamp_created":1490009244,"timestamp_updated":1490009244,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30632608","author":{"steamid":"76561197980211719","num_games_owned":390,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1657920956},"language":"spanish","review":"En resumen estamos hablando de un juegazo, si eres de los que les gusta el genero de las peliculas de terror o solo pasar un rato de tensión maxima sintiendo como el corazón te late a mil por hora, este es tu juego.

Even though right now there are a lot of bugs (yes, there are more than a handful), this game is honestly one of the most addictive games I've run across in a long while. There's a decent amount of content that gets added onto every few months, so the devs haven't completely abandoned their players (though they could use a boot to get them to fix the Survive with Friends queue).\n\nNow, as someone who's put a decent number of hours into this game, I will say that the community is very hit-or-miss. People get super salty over the little things and that leads to poor gameplay for everyone. If you cannot handle other people making mistakes, then this game is not for you. If you have the tendency to rage quit or will turn on your team (if you're a survivor), [i]this game is not for you[/i]. This game is filled to the brim with trolls and derps alike, so either you suck it up, buttercup, or you should go find a game where you can release your anger elsewhere. I've noticed that most people in this community go with the general rule of \"don't be a d*ck\" and it works really well. :)\n\nFor survivors, it is your goal to work together (<-- that's the magic word here) to get the f*ck out of the match. Each survivor has their own set of unique perks that make each one worth leveling them to make the ultimate perk build. Many builds can be created to benefit yourself or others (or a mix of both). Communication before the match is key to good team work, but most people simply go into the match planning to do their own thing. All in all, try to do your best and help your team as best you can, because that's all anyone really asks for.\n\nFor killers, you gotta be on your toes. I've just recently started playing killer and now I understand why killers do some of the things they do (except camping and slugging, 'cause it's pointless and no fun at all). Killer gameplay is fastpaced and because of each of the different killers' abilities, each one plays [i]completely[/i] different than the next. Each killer also has their own set of perks that are beneficial to other killers, so try to max them out and figure out what works best for you.\n\nTLDR:\nThe game is great even with its bugs and glitches, but that's to be expected of a game that's still moderately a work-in-progress.

Которая прекрасно может скрасить ваш досуг. Однако, существует ряд проблем которые, по моему скромному мнению, заводят игру в тупик, медленно, но верно.\n\nПодробнее о +/-\n+Интересный сеттинг - сам формат который уже давно успели избить, в фильмах и прочих художественных произведениях, в игре обрел свежее дыхание и не выглядит вычурным.\n+Затягивающий геймплей - простой и не разнообразный, но, все равно, затягивающий!\n+Веселый и увлекательный кооператив - разнообразные тактики с друзьями, троллинг маньяка или наоборот, все можно реализовать с парочкой друзей.\n\n-Нет разнообразия в классах, они формальны - когда вы только начинаете, да, классы (выжившие) имеют значения, каждый выделяется своей предрасположенностью в тех или иных вещах, помогая при грамотной командной игре привести вас к красивой и увлекательной победе, в дальнейшем, при получение перков которые способны изучить все, они теряют абсолютно всю индивидуальность. Спринт? Адреналин? Самолечение? Удар в спину? Все эти перки от разных выживших вы легко запихнете в одного.\n\n-Полное отсутствие баланса - вытекает из первого минуса, из-за модели которую избрали разработчики, мы не просто потеряли индивидуальность и возможность складывать разные сильные стороны, разных выживших, чтобы придти к победе, но и получили чудовищные имба билды, на момент написания, для выживших, это Спринт+Адреналин+Удар в спину+Самолечение, для маньяков, соответственно, свои, у них так же есть имба билды. В итоге, командная игра превращается, на 90%, в соло забеги под спринтами и тд, и тп, без особой надобности коммуницировать со своей командой.\n\n-Чудовищная неиграбельность некоторых классов маньяков - Вытекает из первых двух минусов, к сожалению, вся игра строится буквально на 2 классах, на момент написания отзыва Траппер и Деревенщина, реже, Майерс и Призрак, Медсестра попадается с частотой нахождения кейса с миллионом долларов на пороге своего дома.\n\n-Количество разнообразных багов - в данный момент, правда, их стало гораздо меньше, но все еще очень много.\n\n-Отсутствует система репортов - читы, я вашу мамку ласкал и прочие прелести \"взрослого\" комьюнити данной игры. На момент написания мнения системы репортов еще НЕ БЫЛО.\n\nВ итоге хочется сказать следующее, надеюсь, что разработчики реабилитируют 80% контента который, по выше описанным причинам, игроки не используют и в будущем мы будем видеть разнообразных маньяков, а не 1-2, и разнообразные билды с перками, а не как сейчас, 1 имба билд на выжившего, 1 имба билд на маньяка.

Even if they do get caught and hooked, nothing's stopping them from having two survivors block the hook and freeing themselves.\nPerks are another issue. Ones like saboteur, sprint burst, and self-care are game breakingly strong, while ones like deja vu, quick and quiet, and small game are completely worthless.\nKillers are no better off, with nurse, shape, and trapper being the only viable ones past the first four ranks. Hag and wraith are in bad condition; their gimmicks are downgrades compared to trapper and shape. Killer perks are just as imbalanced as survivor ones, with iron grip and no one escapes death being almost mandatory, and sloppy butcher and bloodhound having almost zero use, even in low ranks.\nSpeaking of ranks, the matchmaking/rank system is poorly done as well. Even though I've only played for around 50 hours, I've gone against people wtih both less than 5 and over 200. Not only that, but cheating is extremely easy to do; I've found at least four hacking killers in my time, all are still playing. \nRank and cheating aside, online is extremely buggy, matches can drop for no reason and you can be kicked form matchmaking at a moment's notice. Disconnects and lag are common, expect to be hit through objects and to jitter around the map at least once a day. And if you try to play with friends, be prepared to wait for an hour or more, especially if you aren't the same rank.\nIf the game isn't seriously rebalanced and redone soon, it's going to die off; it's already lost over five thousand players in the last couple months.\n\ntl;dr: Survivors have too many ways to fuck over killers, killers have no counters to some survivor strats, perks are imbalanced, and the game isn't fun past the first few hours.\nEdit: Uninstalled after a hacking survivor teleported me out of the map and pm'd me \"enjoy your 0 points :)\" Not even going to waste my time on this anymore.","timestamp_created":1489906481,"timestamp_updated":1490007306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521232545375823975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30608919","author":{"steamid":"76561198166355427","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2736,"last_played":1597399236},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую","timestamp_created":1489906456,"timestamp_updated":1489906456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30608722","author":{"steamid":"76561198219255005","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":26987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11170,"last_played":1646759781},"language":"russian","review":"Задумка хорошая,а реализация-нет.
