Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, it takes around 600 hours to unlock all of the current perks as of writing this which would be fine if the game was fun to grind over and over and over again, but it isn't.\n\nUPDATE: Currently sitting around 600 hours with a total of 5 new characters (Nemesis, Jane, Leon, Hellraiser. Mikaela) released since my original review. I currently have every character unlocked with only ~25$ spent on DLC. When Nemesis was released it was a shit show with the map being disabled and the killer's perks bordering between \"bad\" and \"not recommended\" (other than Lethal Pursuer which felt more situational) \nThat being said, the killer himself was incredibly fun to play and didn't feel like a broken mess. \nThis was followed by the Hellraiser paragraph and a lot of bug fixes which made the game feel pretty good to play on PC. (The people on console dealt with dead hard being a luck of the draw type perk) \nAfter this was yet again more bug fixes making the game feel a ton better on my PC with the Witch Hour Paragraph release. This came out with arguably some of the strongest survivor perks but overall nothing genuinely insane.\n\nTLDR: Game is receiving some of the best updates to date, it's in the best shape I've seen it in.","timestamp_created":1609314066,"timestamp_updated":1637039002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83546427","author":{"steamid":"76561199106610661","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5540,"last_played":1632570143},"language":"schinese","review":"good job so far.gif","timestamp_created":1609313770,"timestamp_updated":1609313770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950463771820068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83546412","author":{"steamid":"76561198808204853","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":28306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5443,"last_played":1650580938},"language":"brazilian","review":"Amando o jogo, atualmente acho que é o melhor do gênero, apesar que precisa melhorar a otimização para PC","timestamp_created":1609313750,"timestamp_updated":1609313750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83546334","author":{"steamid":"76561198798945494","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":4840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1633824401},"language":"english","review":"Pog pog pog pog pogu pog pog","timestamp_created":1609313671,"timestamp_updated":1609313671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83546273","author":{"steamid":"76561198954391025","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5018,"last_played":1632530552},"language":"english","review":"SCARY OHHHH SO SCARY.

This game is fun about 2/10 games. the other 8 are frustrating, because this game is nothing but cheese and exploits. There's little to no balancing at all, because the community is a bunch of people who play killer and scream nerf survivors all day. At high ranks, Killers win every match. Survivors have nothing to protect themselves with anymore, most killers' default power goes through or over pallets, windows and \"loops.\" Then killers have little attachments they can put on their power to make it stupid. Example: Judith's Tombstone on Michael Myers, grab and kill any survivor immediately after reaching power lvl 3. To reach lvl 3 you just gotta hold RMB for 30 seconds. Not hard at all. Playing as a killer is so easy and highly rewarding, while survivor play is difficult and can be cut short by simple things like camping or \"tunneling.\" On top of that, every game is ranked. There's no separation of ranked or casual, making it ideal for people who just exploit broken killer features to feel like they are good because they can stand still after holding RMB and win. Survivors only escape 1 in 12 matches at high rank, and these are the people saying survivors are OP, because \"looping\" is frustrating. Looping is just running around an obstacle in a circle, forever. If you can't counter that when every killer has a unique power that debilitates survivors (some of which don't even require any skill to utilize) then you are just bad, period. That red number means nothing. Then the game gives you perks. Survivor perks are useful and balanced, while killer perks are like 70% \"reveal the survivor.\" There's no hiding, because anytime you do anything as a survivor, the killer sees you, and that's it. And killer's complain about survivors having perks, when survivor perks are like \"heal yourself at half the normal speed\" or \"escape the killer's grasp by succeeding a difficult skill check, but only for 30 seconds after you've been hooked.\" The community is a bunch of man-babies, who put little to no effort in playing and want victory handed to them on a silver platter.","timestamp_created":1609310220,"timestamp_updated":1609310220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83543498","author":{"steamid":"76561199102384943","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":643,"playtime_at_review":3343,"last_played":1660599023},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩，快乐。","timestamp_created":1609310064,"timestamp_updated":1609310064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83543337","author":{"steamid":"76561198002689311","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1627079006},"language":"english","review":"This game has moments where it is really fun; As the killer, you get the right map with players that kinda know what their doing and there is a challenge; As the survivor, the killer is equally competent and chases you down like a horror movie monster.\nThere are also not fun moments; As the killer, the players you're put up against have coordination and start up 2-3 generators before you even see them.
