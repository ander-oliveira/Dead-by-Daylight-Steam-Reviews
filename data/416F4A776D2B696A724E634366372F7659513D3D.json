A game that gives you that sickening feeling of dread by being hunted? The satisfying feeling of locking onto your prey and tearing into them as they run in fear? Well this sure as hell isn't that game. I've played quite a lot of DBD, and I have to say I think the Developers are playing their own torture scenario on the players. Survivors are basically able to run circles around the killers, while the killers are able to do pratcically nothing about it. I've literally had 4 survivors just continue to run at me while I knock one down I chase another then they go pick up their friend and do it all again. Thinking of hooking a survivor? Well while one of them is off turning on the generators you're chasing one and then the third gets the person off the hook. I thought it was bad before, but now they nerfed the only killer that still had a chance. Literally no one wants to even play the killers anymore because it's not you taunting them, it's them hunting you. If you have 4 decent survivors you cannot win as a killer. It's a fact, I don't care who you are or how good you are, it's not going to be done. Not only that, my survivor who is level 25 has 2 ultra rare perks, while my killer who is 36 is still unlocking common perks. It's broken, heed my warning do not buy this, ever. Don't listen to the devs because they are deaf in the ears.","timestamp_created":1474697378,"timestamp_updated":1474697378,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56150442361831665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25663732","author":{"steamid":"76561198109330401","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":320312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2805,"playtime_at_review":114823,"last_played":1660590033},"language":"english","review":"MINGING","timestamp_created":1474695620,"timestamp_updated":1658559610,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46875","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25663719","author":{"steamid":"76561198053986988","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":7404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1879,"last_played":1647863777},"language":"russian","review":"Зачем

And the killers job is to kill the survivors obviously, trying to stop the survivors from activating the generators and escape, it takes 2 hits, before a survivor get into a dying state, the killer can then choose to let them bleed to dead on the ground, or the most common, pick the survivor up, find a nearby hook, and place the survivor onto it, that is the quickest way to finish them off, the survivors can unhook them, or mind their own business. I have to mention that the survivors and the killers point of view, are different, from the surviors perspective, you see the world in third person, which allows you to see more, and have a larger view over the map, the killer on the other hand, see the map through first person, which has its limits, but you do have advantages as well, like if the survivors choose to run away, they leave footprint on the map, which the killer eventually can track you down, and whenever the survivors do something out loud, when failing to activate the generators, the killer sees where it happended and by then, the survivors gave themselves away... \n\nI personally loved the game :) It's so fun being survivor, trying to make your way out of the place, it really draws you in, and can make leaving the computer hard to do so, the atmosphere is great, and i think it's all put very well together, and the music almost takes the show, like when the killer is approaching you get to hear his heartbeat, and the closer he is, the harder the heartbeat gets, the more panic creates.

The first 5 hours are very frustrating where you will die almost every match immeditely, hour 6 you learn not to run like an idiot when the killer proximity music kicks on and actually start getting some points and having fun.  Hour 10 you realize how bad of a grind the leveling system is.  Hour 11 you read it takes around 100 hours to max a character.  Hour 15 you start actually being able to escape consistently and raising your rank though youll still never get it past 18 because of the perks, hour 20 you start questioning the match making system and why they pair a bunch of non leveled characters against maxed out killers.... Hour 25 you finally accept the game for what it is... realizing that despite not really knowing if you would call it a \"good game,\" you keep wanting to play, are watching dev blogs, and excited to see what is coming. \n\nThe game seems like it should still be in early access, but being that its only around 20 bucks, its worth picking up.  Every system works so far, but it still needs fixes to match making (campfire simulator 2016), and glitches (sometimes throwing a palet will teleport you on the wrong side right in front of the killer.  But I have confidence they will fix it. \n\nYou can get incredibly frustrated with this game, and at the same time have a lot of fun, but either way you will want to pick it up.  I only play pick up groups, but if you also have friends that play it would be a no brainer.  \n\n50 bucks, I would say prob not, at 20 bucks, definitely pick it up!  You see people pumping hundreds of hours into it so you know there is something special about it, and at 100 hours, you cant deny that .20 cents / hour is good value.\n\nEdit:  \n\nThe new matchmaking system works great.

Удаляю, ибо релиз уже вышел давно, а БАГИ, СУКА, НЕ ИСПРАВИЛИ!","timestamp_created":1474662774,"timestamp_updated":1474662774,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489756524562835693","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25657184","author":{"steamid":"76561198267814113","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1179,"last_played":1483413242},"language":"spanish","review":"muy bueno la verdad","timestamp_created":1474662666,"timestamp_updated":1474662666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25657109","author":{"steamid":"76561198025737207","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":203515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":453,"playtime_at_review":19676,"last_played":1660147636},"language":"english","review":"A cat and mouse game in which survivors complain about killers being op, and killers complain about survivors being op, while the good players watches from the side, collecting salt for their popcorn.","timestamp_created":1474662407,"timestamp_updated":1474662407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480591505765914917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25657051","author":{"steamid":"76561198014933915","num_games_owned":502,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":15214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5689,"last_played":1489259263},"language":"english","review":"Really fun 1 v 4 game with suprising complexity and depth.

E magari molti più killer, 4 sono pochi, anche se per skillarli tutti ci vogliono almeno 60 ore credo.
