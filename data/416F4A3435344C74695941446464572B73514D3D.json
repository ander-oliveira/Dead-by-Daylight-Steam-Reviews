This game can be absolute hell. MMR was a complete shitshow. Playing killer is extremely stressful and solo queue survivor makes me wonder why I even play this games. Every patch brings game breaking bugs that take weeks to patch out. The balancing team has no idea what their doing and are extremely inconsistent on how they want to balance their game. One minute they're saying that the game isn't a competitive game and the next they are adding Skill Based Matchmaking. Perks and killers get nerfed for no reason and overpowered things have been out for months and the devs still haven't nerfed them. However even with all that I have had some amazing memories in this game since I bought it last year. Even with its problems I think that its an amazing game. As long as you're just looking for a casual game and don't go in thinking you are going to win every match then it is a lot of fun. I recommend playing the game with a group of friends in a SWF (survive with friends) group or in custom games as they are some of the most fun moments.

Either you have a killer that just hook camps, ruining the game for that player, or you have teammates that don't play the game as a team.  There is a long match-making progress, and a long load time, so only 25% competitive / fun games is not a good payoff.\n\nThe game can be really fun if you have 2 or 3 friends to team up with, or you have a good killer that doesn't just catch one person, then stand next to them so they cannot be rescued.  If the developers would add some sort of penalty for this behavior, the game would be much improved.","timestamp_created":1649625161,"timestamp_updated":1649625161,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573706984519958496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113657982","author":{"steamid":"76561199078853086","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":564,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1660105426},"language":"english","review":"Good Soup","timestamp_created":1649624388,"timestamp_updated":1649624388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113657243","author":{"steamid":"76561199007858643","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":131,"playtime_at_review":2501,"last_played":1660505208},"language":"brazilian","review":"esses bicho ai, mó gatas","timestamp_created":1649623305,"timestamp_updated":1649623305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113656812","author":{"steamid":"76561199026914764","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1669,"last_played":1659067349},"language":"english","review":"this shit is booty cheeks","timestamp_created":1649622689,"timestamp_updated":1654309130,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113656810","author":{"steamid":"76561198208633172","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":7716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7716,"last_played":1648518886},"language":"english","review":"Fuck this game","timestamp_created":1649622687,"timestamp_updated":1649622687,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113656585","author":{"steamid":"76561198446317892","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":1383,"last_played":1659887022},"language":"spanish","review":"La ultra entretenido ajajaja si te saca una que otra risa y te hace hasta gritar!!!!

first, thank you for always taking advice from Instagram and Twitter players.We have seen your sincerity in discussing various film copyrights.But there are problems at the same time.\nThe first thing to do in this game :\n1. Matching mechanisms. Matching time is too long and this problem is easy to persuade novice players to quit.\n2.Simple mode. Of course, traditional 1V4 is quite canonical, but this uniform game mode can be boring.","timestamp_created":1649600780,"timestamp_updated":1649600872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113637351","author":{"steamid":"76561197989494362","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":30958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22688,"last_played":1658542316},"language":"tchinese","review":"遊戲價格就是這遊戲的遊玩價值\n單人遊玩的不叫遊戲 而是訓練軟體\n這遊戲帶來的樂趣在第一次向對手浮現鄙視和憐憫的念頭時就消失了\n\n推薦小時候喜歡和朋友拿著各種物品玩弄關在籠子裡的家畜而發出純真歡笑的人","timestamp_created":1649598865,"timestamp_updated":1649598865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113636693","author":{"steamid":"76561198312719211","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":29953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29953,"last_played":1649321702},"language":"english","review":"dsfsdfsdfsfsfsd","timestamp_created":1649598011,"timestamp_updated":1649598011,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ454LtiYADddW+sQM="}
