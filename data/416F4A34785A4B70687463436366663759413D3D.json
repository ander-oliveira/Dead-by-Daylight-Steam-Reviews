You join a match, anticipation is building and everything is going to well and then you see the killer just standing slashing like an idiot. Just like that your fun is ruined. You join another and guess what? IT HAPPENS AGAIN. This is the 4th time I joined a match where a bunch of assholes are just farming the game for blood points and there is no way to hold them accountable. It ruins the entire night, I invite friends to hang out and play the game and we keep running into asswipes farming or lagging servers to get easier kills. And playing as the killer can be really frustrating when all you come across is a bunch of window spammers. You might be tempted to think up some bullshit about how window spamming is fair, but its not. I have and entire team that would all run to the same area and jump in and out of the window while they all mocked me and then got pissed after I quit the match. There are a ton of balancing problems with the game. Idk why there are so many people that thinks its ok to farm the game, for what fucking purpose? To be better or somthing? Its a total buzz kill.

Winning too fast and totally dominating the match can Rank you down. Being too good at the game can Rank you down. You need to play \"to farm\" instead of \"play to win\" most of the time. It's not a very enjoyable experience to play Ranked in this game.\n\nThe Lobby/Matchmaking System completely sucks.It matches people-up with WILDLY different Skill-levels, and Queue-Dodgers do not get time-outs that should increase with each lobby that is dodged. People are constantly queue-dodging lobbies, which makes starting an actual match and playing the game a nightmare at times.\n\nThe Disconnect/Network System does not auto-reconnecting players back to a game when they disconnected, even if they log-back-in within less than a minute. Also, disconnected player's character models disappear from the game world, instead of being left in the game to be interacted with. There is also a ton of lag in-game some times while other games are amazing with no lag. It can be wildly different between matches, and you never know what you're going to get.\n\nThe Anti-Cheat/Exploit Systems ARE NOT WORKING and there are obvious cheaters/exploiters in the game. People with Prestige and Level 50, with 4 Ultra Rare Perks, but only have 5 hours of game time played is an impossibility.\n\nThe Server System is non-existent. This game should have been a Client-Server architecture, but instead they went with P2P and saving Player Data on the Client. This is a HORRIBLE idea, which is just asking for cheating/exploiting/lag-switching. The game should have had dedicated servers, where our Player Data lives at, and where matches take place on. Dedicated servers would have made the game experience WAY BETTER. What a huge missed opportunity.\n\nThe Company itself (Behaviour Interactive) has been super bad with their Community Managers, when it comes to communicating and addressing issues with the community and competitive players on the Steam forums.\n\nAgain, the game itself is good and has potential, but the systems that surround the game are really beyond freaking horrible and too frustrating to make for an enjoyable experience at the moment.","timestamp_created":1473451865,"timestamp_updated":1473451865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536423861980438232","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25431265","author":{"steamid":"76561198272682303","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":28116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27713,"last_played":1640247162},"language":"english","review":"I hate this game so much, there's a whole lot wrong with it.

Für ein Spiel, welches ich nicht annähernd auf dem Radar hatte, hat es mich stark positiv überrascht.\nDie Tatsache, ein Katz-Maus-Spiel in einer surrealen Welt mit einem Killer und 4 Überlebenden stattfinden zu lassen, bewährt sich auch nach langer Spielzeit noch als abwechselnd. Findet man erst einmal Gefallen daran, will man umso mehr experimentieren und erforschen. Auch die Hintergrundgeschichte (Lore) stimmt sich mit der Atmosphäre überein und sorgt zusätzlich für einen ganz eigenene makaberen Beigeschmack. \n\nDas Gameplay gestaltet sich als durchaus überschaubar und leicht erlernbar. Wo man am Anfang noch Probleme hat in der Ausübung bestimmter Tätigkeiten (Wie das schnelle Bewegen über Hindernisse oder das Umwerfen einer Pallette in die richtige Richtung), so sind diese doch recht schnell erlernt. Alles in allem läuft das Spiel auch auf etwas älteren Rechnern stabil (Specs s.u.).\nVor allem das Überleben/Töten in Gemeinschaft ist ein großer Anreiz. So gibt es zwar starke Probleme zu bestimmten Uhrzeiten mit einer bestimmten Gruppengröße eine Lobby zu finden, jedoch lässt sich dies mit den Downloadregionen über Steam regulieren.\n\nDie Grafik erweist sich als solide und schön anzusehen. Für heutige Verhältnisse und der Tatsache, dass es ein Indie Spiel ist, verdienen die Entwickler ein großes Lob hierfür. \n\nBugs und Glitches gibt es - natürlich - auch welche. Manche können sogar den Spielspaß ziemlich in den Keller drücken. So bekommt man unter seltenen Umständen ein falsches Blutnetz zugeteilt, mit welchem man seinen Charakter verbessern und ausbauen kann. Manchmal stürzt das Spiel ohne Fehlermeldung ab. Das einzige was einem in diesem Moment bleibt, ist ein Error Report Fenster, um den Developern zu erklären, wie es dazu kam. \nDiese \"kleinen Missgeschehnisse\" sind aber dann doch eher die Seltenheit.\n\nZusammengefasst ist Dead By Daylight ein grandioses Spiel für langanhaltende Schock- und Horrormomente. Hier kommt jeder (ab 18 Jahren...) auf seinen Spaßfaktor, sofern er sich mit solch einem Universum auseinandersetzen mag/kann. \nDas Entwicklerteam arbeitet stets an Bugfixes und ist sehr aktiv im Social Media Bereich (jede Woche ein Livestream der Devs und ein großes Steaminternes Forum). Erst vor Kurzem erschien das DLC \"The Last Breath\" mit einem neuen Killer, einer neuen Überlebenden, einer neuen Karte und etlichen Bugfixes.\nIch kann dieses Spiel getrost weiterempfehlen und es jenen ans Herz legen, die schon immer mal die Entscheidung treffen wollten, ihre Freunde am Haken elendig verenden zu lassen oder ihnen doch von jenem herunterhelfen... ;-)\n\n\n[Specs]\nGraka: GeForce GTX760\nCPU: AMD Phenom X6 1090T 3.20 GHz\nOS: Win 10 Pro 64x\nRAM: 8 GB","timestamp_created":1473450090,"timestamp_updated":1473450090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.63882678747177124","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25430495","author":{"steamid":"76561198114631095","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":60032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12598,"last_played":1655750866},"language":"spanish","review":"Hace tiempo puse una critica bastante negativa por la gestión que estaba teniendo este juego, he de decir que desde hace un tiempo ha mejorado bastante, parece que el equipo de desarrollo se esta poniendo las pilas y ofreciendo un buen producto a la comunidad, por lo tanto cambio mi critica a positiva.\n\nBuen juego, para echarte unas risas con los colegas o tu solo, van actualizando a menudo, poniendo nuevo contenido y mejoras gráficas, eso se agradece y mucho que no lo tengan olvidado.","timestamp_created":1473447748,"timestamp_updated":1606811600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25430468","author":{"steamid":"76561198145094357","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2159,"last_played":1630438631},"language":"hungarian","review":"This game is better than I expected. \nWhen you play you can feel your character emotions, along with trembling that was not to find the killer in the closet , or even run away with you in the wheat.\nThe gameplay 10/10.\nGraphics are 10/8 to because a lot of bug, but it is encouraging that the repairs are moving quickly.\nI hope in the near future there will be new clothes or new characters .\nEx .: a grim reaper , hell hound or a Dementor like monster.\nI look forward to further improvements.\nAnd the price is not high!","timestamp_created":1473447616,"timestamp_updated":1473447616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25429994","author":{"steamid":"76561198194013849","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1618055957},"language":"thai","review":"สนุกดี","timestamp_created":1473445412,"timestamp_updated":1473445412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25429977","author":{"steamid":"76561198073534839","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":19290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1740,"last_played":1649426859},"language":"english","review":"NOTE:\nFirst of all, in my almost 30 hours of Gameplay, most of the time I am playing as a Survivor.

There are different types of maps, although it WILL feel the same as you play along.\n\nThe thing that keeps me from playing this is by unlocking various skills as your chosen Survivor character levels up, called perks - which can greatly increase your chance of survival.\n\nThe only bad thing that I am greatly annoyed at this game is its awful matchmaking. It's tedious. Especially when you're in groups. And also, no in-game chat, which is understandable, since it would make it easy for survivors to reunite if ever there was an in-game chat.\n\nOverall, a mediocre multiplayer horror-survival game that has its fair share of intense moments. Much greater when you play with friends. \n\n\nSECOND PART OF REVIEW (TL;DR VERSION)\n\nPROS\n+ Enjoyable early-game\n+ Best when played with friends\n+ Has its fair share of intense moments\n+ You can unlock skills which are beneficial to your survival\n+ Ambient sounds add up to the suspense\n+ Environment is creepy-ish, adds to the suspense, but not Silent Hill level\n\n\nCONS\n- Repetitive\n- Bad matchmaking system\n- Has only ONE game mode\n- Not-so-much enjoyable when playing alone\n- Laggy host means laggy game.

Many times I've hosted a game as the killer, which my highest is Trapper 10, Wraith 10, Hillbillly 8 & Nurse 1 with a killer rank of 15, and got into lobbies with people who are well over lvl 25 and several times with Rank 1 survivors. \n\nAlso, unless you have 4 other friends to play with, you can't play a full game together. There's no fun or real challenge when it's 1vs1 or 1 vs 2. My brother & I have grouped up as survivors and constantly get the \"Cannot find game\" message. \n\nIf you're trying to play an online game, you cannot invite someone to play with you. They'll get the invite, but won't be able to join. And Survive With Friends (SWF) is broken.\n\nDespite these problems, this is still my #1 game right now.

Or if there is 5 of you, a private server is always a great way to pass a few hours laughing with your friends.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the game, there's not a huge amount of replayablitlity. Granted, there are four killers to play and all of the survivors have unique abilities if you play them long enough but honestly, you need to play a long time to unlock them. I've only hit level 8 or so on one survivor and not much really came out of it.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game to play with friends, this will do you well.
