We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way. Losers! Losers wait!\n\nGreat Game. Don't get worked up over the Killer did this, Survivor does that salt mining. In fact - Just embrace it. Play your way each time on either side and don't be afraid to throw salt out. This game is the literally leading exporter of salt in the world (move over Netherlands!) so have fun with it. Only the sweaty get mad. \n\nMight see a few bugs here and there, some come on updates but never game breaking unless you just wanna hardcore whine about it. \n\nLots of fun and neat killers and most of them are iconic horror knockoffs, some the real deal. Some survivors that come from horror genre but most I think are just created by Devs.\n\nAbout 6 years into the game and they've added enough content to really sink your teeth into for a couple of months (probably longer...just depends on you) if you were to really binge on it. The compendium and Archives are up to 6 now. Each with 4 pages with both killer and survivor goals that unlock voice over story content (not bad on the voice over too. Will make you want to complete all pages before listening to it).\n\nI tend to binge on it here and there and each time there;s always games that get my heart racing and I still get a jump scare here and there or piss myself why being chased or surprised by a killer. I LOVE playing the killer too and would side with killers in saying it is far more terrifying being a killer at rank 1 than it is being a survivor at rank 1. So stressful, lol.\n\n10/10 - Would piss myself again.","timestamp_created":1615518790,"timestamp_updated":1615861223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88276635","author":{"steamid":"76561198103501621","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":135109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":393,"playtime_at_review":83331,"last_played":1660346322},"language":"english","review":"This game teaches you how to be patient even when you are absolutely pissed off.

The leveling up system is such that you are better off using a max level to farm points, playing a low level with no perks is a joke and no fun.  Queue times are bad, as a killer you're usually up against a team thats in voice chat.  Did I say it takes too long to level up?  So spend a bunch on all the dlc and realize you're going to need hundreds, thousands of hours of play to max them.

game has potential to be \"THE BEST\" horror game out there but sadly not until the developers start listening to the people who actually play the game instead of realizing ideas which they think its good for the game that they don't understand nor play.\n\nRegardless the game can be fun IF YOU PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS but if u choose to play killer u will surely have fun in the beginning till u reach a point where u will be playing against survivors running the exact same perks every single game and u will be forced to grind and unlock perks which take about one or two hundreds of hours in order to fully unlock a single killer's full potential and still get looped till daylight or u press Alt+F4  after realizing how survivor sided the game is unless u choose to main \"The Nurse\" which is the most overpowered killer.\n\nAnd last but not least ill be lying if i say the majority of the community is nice considering in the high mmr all u get in the end game chat is salt no matter the outcome of the game.","timestamp_created":1615479796,"timestamp_updated":1646783449,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88252100","author":{"steamid":"76561199021968228","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1022,"last_played":1639176954},"language":"spanish","review":"assaas","timestamp_created":1615479358,"timestamp_updated":1615479358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88252006","author":{"steamid":"76561198796549977","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4460,"last_played":1655667541},"language":"spanish","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1615479249,"timestamp_updated":1615479249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88251674","author":{"steamid":"76561198983407442","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":38765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":18665,"last_played":1659969021},"language":"schinese","review":"“妈妈我想当上钩人”\n谁不喜欢被举高高呢嘤嘤嘤","timestamp_created":1615478833,"timestamp_updated":1615478833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88251547","author":{"steamid":"76561198122183748","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1615478381},"language":"schinese","review":"太吓人了
