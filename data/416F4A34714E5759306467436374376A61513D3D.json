I put hundreds of hours into it and had a great time. But its was very clear to me that the Devs are either incompetent or purposely deliver a half-baked product to make a quick buck. I have gave them multiple chances over the last 3 years . I have came back and played a bit only to see the same issues plaguing the game that were there when I left. So please take this from someone who put almost 3500 hour in during the first two years:\n\n\nDon't play this game. This game has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a video game. \n\n\n1. They allowed infinites to be in the game for months after launch. Then they clam that infinites take some skill. Even after almost 6 years there are still soft infinites on maps even after overhauls have been done.\n2. They have allowed game breaking bugs to be in the game for months and not done a single thing about it. The biggest offender of this was during Christmas 2016. They allowed perk stacking and Chainsaw Myers to be in the game for 2 months all because they were on Christmas break. They allowed Nurse to be bugged for 3 weeks when blinking around killer shack. Borrowed Time was bugged for a single night and hotfixed the next day.\n3. They have released broken content and patches multiple times for years now. Every time something comes out it is broken and sometimes borderline unplayable/unusable. (Keep in mind that they are charging money for these things). Killers not working right for weeks after launch or perks not doing what they have in the description.\n4. The balancing of this game is the ABSOLUTE worse I have ever seen in any video game. They refuse to change obvious things about killers or perks. They routinely release busted killers and kneecap them a few weeks later. Freddy was one of the worst killer for YEARS after he was nerfed weeks after his release. They have also opted to nerf killers that have skill expression because console players can't do them like PC players. The Nurse had a cooldown added to her kit because it was easier to do that then expand on her fatigue mechanic that she WAS balanced around. There are many killers such as Hag, Pig, Clown and Leatherface that were terrible for years after their release. Then they are finally reworked only to be kneecapped so after. Some killers are just not allowed to be good in the eyes of BHVR.\n5. The Devs would rather make a quick buck then make the community happy. The amount of overpriced cosmetics in the store is absurd. Many of those more expensive outfits you can't even customize with other pieces of clothes. A $15 cosmetic in a game where I have to spend hundreds of dollars on to get all the killer and perks is ridiculous. You are forced to spend money on chapters all because one of the perks is the best in the game and the rest of the chapter is underpowered or broken content. It's even more obvious with them trying to sell NFTs. They are trying to get casual players to buy these just because they are DbD related.\n\nThis game is nothing but a cash grab by greedy Devs who know they can use Horror icons to get people to spend money on overpriced chapters and cosmetics where most of the product doesn't work.","timestamp_created":1480211629,"timestamp_updated":1635634288,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27759912","author":{"steamid":"76561198087774982","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":14747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14565,"last_played":1650392749},"language":"german","review":"Echt gutes Horror Spiel.

Ich für meinen Teil bin fertig mit dem Game und kann auch nur jedem ans Herz legen, dieses auch zu droppen. Das Problem was Dead by Daylight hat ist kaum mehr zu fixen, da die Richtung schon lange eingeschlagen wurde. Es wurde nur für casual Spieler gebalanced und daher können erfahrenere Spieler dies ausnutzen. Second Chance Perks sind ein gutes Beispiel für dieses ,,falsche Balance\". Mit dem MMR System haben die inkompetenten Devs alles noch schlimmer gemacht, da man Killer nun kaum mehr spielen kann, außer man kann es ab, ständig zu verlieren und schikaniert zu werden von den Survivorn. SoloQ Survivor zu spielen macht auch keinen Spaß, da man nicht mal die Perks seiner Teammates einsehen kann am Anfang vom Match. So kann man auch keine noob Lobbys dodgen. Viele Spieler haben weit über 1000 Stunden und spielen immer noch wie die größten Bots die das Game neu gekauft haben. Letztendlich ist es auch die toxische Community, die Dead by Daylight ruiniert. Nach über 2000 Std. kann ich nur sagen, dass es immer schlimmer mit dem Game wird und nur noch casuals berücksichtigt werden.

Da kann schon mal was neues kommen. ;)\nABER:\nEin großer Kritikpunkt, meiner Meinung nach, ist der neue Killer \"Der Wandler\" aus dem \"The Halloween-Chapter\" Update. Der Typ ist einfach zu OP wie ich finde und macht teilweise das Spiel unspielbar, weil viele Perks einfach nicht auf den Typen reagieren wie sie einfach sollten. Die Spezialfähigkeit ist auch einfach zu übertrieben. Die müsste sich mit der Zeit einfach lamgsam wieder reduzieren.\nAnsonsten kann man das Spiel nur empfehlen.

Survivors main perks you kinda have from default characters.","timestamp_created":1480199302,"timestamp_updated":1544640203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27741229","author":{"steamid":"76561198104375334","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1543363761},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game!
