Em calls com minhas amigas a gente se diverte muito chegando a gritar no microfone de susto quanto aparece o Freddy Krueger ou o Pânico em cima da gente quando estamos fazendo gerador, extremamente viciante e tem uma rejogabilidade imensa, vários personagens, skins em que você pode desbloquear apenas jogando, possui sistema de cash mas sinceramente acho que só vale a pena no caso das DLCs se tiver de promoção. (Comprei o Legião por 8 reais e valeu muito a pena), se caso você não tem amigos pra jogar junto ainda vale a pena sendo Killer em que você caça outros players e persegue o quão retardado você é por ser bloqueado por uma barricada ÓBVIA no mapa ou ver um cara agachado jurando que tá escondido. \nMas em geral, com amigos o jogo é muito melhor, chegou a ser rotina entre meu grupo de amigas no final do dia jogar 3 partidinhas e conversar sobre o dia. \nRecomendo, acho caro o preço padrão, mas vale a pena se você gostar de jogos tipo MOBA.","timestamp_created":1614137844,"timestamp_updated":1614137844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87327964","author":{"steamid":"76561199095546165","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":30258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":513,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1660341318},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun game to play with friends.

Ich bin Killer-Main, zocke aber auch sehr viel Survivor\n2. Die Bewertung bezieht sich nicht auf diesen Patch, denn sonst wäre der Daumen unter dem Erdkern\n3. Behavior fix this shit!\n\nAlso:\nDbD ist das Game mit dem ich nach League of Legends in meinem Leben wohl am meisten Zeit verbracht habe. Und die Communtiy ist stellenweise schlimmer als die von LoL, also wenn ihr League kennt und wegen der Community nicht abkönnt... ähm... Finger weg sonst Aua!\nDbD ist ein Spiel in dem man problemlos als, ich zitiere an dieser Stelle, \"Nazikind\" beleidigt werden kann, ohne dass der Support bei doppelter Einsendung auf Englisch auch nur mit den Achseln zuckt. Gibt auch tolle Leute dort, hab eine Ex von mir da kennengelernt (okay die war jetzt nich soo toll), aber auch meine bis heute besten Freundinnen (Tinder 2.0, glaubt mir klappt hier besser).\n\nGameplaytechnisch ist es je nach Patch ein absolut anderes Erlebnis. Mal schlägt man mit den Killern durch Survivor durch, während Survivor in ihrer Perspektive von der Huntress und dem Slinger um die Ecke getroffen werden, mal is alles ganz gut soweit, je nach Serverdedication und Hitboxverteilung halt (vorsicht an der Stelle, meistens ist tatsächlich die Dedication schuld und nicht die Hitbox). \n\nEntwicklungstechnisch über die Jahre hat sich in Dead by Daylight aber auch sehr gutes getan. Wenn ein Killer komplett OP oder UP war, wurde sich dem grundsätzlich angenommen, wenn auch in eigener Geschwindigkeit... wenn ein Item oder ein Offering broken war wurde es gener... moment Keys existieren immernoch, ich nehme das mal zurück an der Stelle. Aber Moris mussten ja sterben, danke dafür Behavior. Nostalgisch aus den alten Tagen gibt es eigentlich nur noch das Glockengeräusch des Wraiths. Den meisten restlichen Boomershit wechselt Behavior öfters als Kaffeetassen der Mitarbeiter gespühlt werden, damit ja keine starke Bindung zu gewohnten Dingen aufgebaut werden kann. Aber Dinge wandeln sich nun mal, man sollte aber vielleicht nicht Dinge ändern über die sich niemand beschwert hat *hust GUI hust*.\n\nFazit:\nSorry für den ganzen bissigen Sarkasmus, denn versteht mich nicht falsch! Dead by Daylight ist ein geniales Spiel. Die DLCs sind zum größten Teil ihren Preis absolut wert und Behavior gibt dir sogar die Möglichkeit nichtlizensierte Charaktere mit Fortschritt freizuspielen, was eigentlich selbstverständlich sein sollte aber heutzutage nun mal nicht mehr so ist. Ich habe in dieses Spiel nicht umsonst über 1000 Stunden gesteckt und spiele es immer noch mit wechselnder Stimmung dabei. Behavior macht vieles falsch, man darf aber nicht vergessen, dass sie wenigstens noch ein Entwicklerstudio sind, das nicht irgendeinem Indieentwicklerfleischwolfkonzern gehört und deshalb ist es irgendwie noch unterstützenswert. Von mir gibt es eine Kaufempfehlung für Menschen mit starken Nerven gegenüber harter Toxicness und guter Geduld gegen Entwickler.\nDanke fürs durchlesen.\n\nMan sieht, man hört, man liest, man riecht sich\nund ein herzliches *click click click click click click*\nTeebeutelt nicht ihr Bonobos!\nGGs I'm out.","timestamp_created":1614135477,"timestamp_updated":1614135477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326612","author":{"steamid":"76561198442447800","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2031,"last_played":1653420840},"language":"english","review":"Great!","timestamp_created":1614135436,"timestamp_updated":1614135436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326570","author":{"steamid":"76561198821316700","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1653876518},"language":"latam","review":"⣠⣴⣶⣿⣿⣷⣶⣄⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣾⣿⣿⡿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⡟⠁⣰⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠻⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⣿⣿⠏⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢻⣿⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣼⣿⣿⡏⠀⢠⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⡀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⡀ta bueno ⠀⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⢰⣿⣿⡿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣸⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⠁⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠻⣿⣿⣿⣷⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⢰⣿⣿⡇⠀⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⢸⣿⣿⡇⠀⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⢉⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⢸⣿⣿⣇⠀⣿⣿⣿compralo⣤⣤⣤⡀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⢻⣿⣿⣶⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣦⡀⠀⠉⠉⠻⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠛⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣤⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠹⣿⣿⣇⣀⠀⣠⣾⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣤⣤⣤⣤⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠋⠉⠛⠋⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀XD⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀","timestamp_created":1614135366,"timestamp_updated":1614135366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326419","author":{"steamid":"76561198092270187","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":49,"playtime_at_review":3901,"last_played":1659849328},"language":"english","review":"This is one of my favorite games.","timestamp_created":1614135125,"timestamp_updated":1614135125,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326403","author":{"steamid":"76561199050446789","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":60,"playtime_at_review":2409,"last_played":1659410906},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego","timestamp_created":1614135099,"timestamp_updated":1614135099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326391","author":{"steamid":"76561198325304881","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26621,"last_played":1658814391},"language":"english","review":"shit game","timestamp_created":1614135086,"timestamp_updated":1614135086,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326280","author":{"steamid":"76561198353921790","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":51364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30021,"last_played":1646742344},"language":"schinese","review":"刺激，起飞","timestamp_created":1614134889,"timestamp_updated":1614134889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87326144","author":{"steamid":"76561199135681810","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1638160616},"language":"russian","review":"Почему ошибка вылазиет ?

DS, sprint burst, flashlights, and most likely iron will, and dead hard. If you do anything wrong most survivors will open the exit gates and teabag you waiting for you to come. they will hold the game hostage just so they can rub it in your face. the game will feel very one sided. specially when you have a group of four swfs that all communicate and say what your doing and such. but i cant blame them. its a advantage. why not use it right.\n\nAs survivor at the beginning you think you can do well against most killers that are low ranks. which is fun in its own rights. when you get to higher ranks be prepared to go against mostly bubbas, nurses, hags, and myers. each one either has a really efficently gets rid of loops or and one shot all survivors. \n\neven when play either side i can say that playing as a survivor feels better than playing killer. you have alot more options to do things against the killer. you can really make a killer feel helpless and make the game not fun for them. If i had a say in all this the game needs some serious balancing. if you wanted it to feel like the killers have want to punch themselves in the face over and over again to play your game then you got it on the mark.\n\nThey say its a scary or horror game but it really isnt. its a cat and mouse game. the story is cool but the gameplay isnt for the horror title. if you like dota or league of legends you might get a real kick out of the game. it isnt for the casual gamer.","timestamp_created":1614131834,"timestamp_updated":1614131834,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87324247","author":{"steamid":"76561198315619470","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1647766201},"language":"japanese","review":"運営さんyo!!\n昔のUIの方がyo!!\n見やすかったyo!!","timestamp_created":1614131384,"timestamp_updated":1614131384,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521276593208312988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87324072","author":{"steamid":"76561199134564895","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1630097836},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1614131098,"timestamp_updated":1614131098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87323824","author":{"steamid":"76561198984451124","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26173,"last_played":1658094038},"language":"english","review":"This game is a pain in the ass sometimes but at the end you'll like it.","timestamp_created":1614130645,"timestamp_updated":1614130645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87323736","author":{"steamid":"76561197993458972","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":93432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":74,"playtime_at_review":60518,"last_played":1660442586},"language":"english","review":"DBD can be frustrating but it is a very rewarding game.

Bully squads. Gens getting done way too fast. The same meta perks always used by sweats and because the devs would rather use a band aid on a giant wound that is the game mechanics instead of actually fixing it. And a SKILL based mmr that doesn't reward player skill and actions, but only if they survived or got kills. You can literally just hide in the corner the entire game, let everyone die, and go through hatch to be rewarded more than the team player. Alternatively, as killer, you can just tunnel and camp everyone and rank up more than a killer that got 12 hooks through chases and guarding gens. Now more killers are just anti-loop, so just press w now. Boons, there's no limit to them now and are a handicap on killers. Either waste valuable time stepping on one for it to be relit or just suck it up. Not to mention, no real competition for these types of games. So the devs can ignore all of this stuff and just pump out more cosmetics and rehashed killers. If you really care about the health of this game, pick up one of its competitors so that the devs at least have to try.","timestamp_created":1614118873,"timestamp_updated":1642289763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87316856","author":{"steamid":"76561198802797077","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":964,"last_played":1643507472},"language":"english","review":"EZ Clap Survivors","timestamp_created":1614118805,"timestamp_updated":1614118805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87316763","author":{"steamid":"76561198159370829","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":43402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":7000,"last_played":1660322609},"language":"english","review":"Great with friends\n","timestamp_created":1614118675,"timestamp_updated":1614118675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87316555","author":{"steamid":"76561198091957299","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":52933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26281,"last_played":1650856270},"language":"brazilian","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1614118382,"timestamp_updated":1614118382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87316347","author":{"steamid":"76561198272476759","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":19502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1239,"last_played":1652941883},"language":"spanish","review":"muy buen juego es demasiado entretenido","timestamp_created":1614118101,"timestamp_updated":1614118101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87315714","author":{"steamid":"76561198091425325","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2254,"last_played":1614553997},"language":"english","review":"Let me get out of the way, my pc is not a powerhouse.
