Каждый в этой игре найдёт что-то по душе - помимо обычных персонажей есть всеми известные - Кожаное лицо, Фреди Крюгер, Лори Строуд. Игра не только атмосферная, но и заставит пошевелить мозгами - каждая погоня, каждая игра как шахматная партия - нужно просчитывать всё наперёд, чем-то (или кем-то) жертвовать ради победы, умело подбирать и реализовыввать способности и инвентарь. Стоит отметить, что разработчики не всегда выпускают удачные обновления - баги, резкий перевес в сторону выживших или маньяков. Однако стоит набраться терпения, ведь разработчики через какое-то время более-менее устаканивают ситуацию. Помимо различных скинов (красивых или нет - решать каждому), разработчики добавляют новых персонажей, новые книги, новые разрывы (батл пассы), а так же меняют старые карты, добавляя атмосферности и что-то новое, ну и перерабатывают способности слабых маньяков, чтобы они стали сильнее, а игра за них - интереснее и многообразнее. Подводя итог скажу, что к покупке рекомендую. На начальных этапах многое будет непонятно, но методом проб и ошибок,  гайдов на YouTube, можно стать вполне успешным игроком. За выживших советую начинать играть в команде минимум с двумя друзьями, главное чтобы была голосовая связь. За маньяка лишь могу посоветовать набраться терпения, так как с ходу минус 4 вы вряд ли сделаете, а выжившие любят издеваться над маньяком, а после чего ещё и писать гадости в чате.

game scratches a certain itch that no other game does, that is currently on the market. The general idea behind this game is fantastic and the biggest reason why I still keep playing.\n\n[b]Newcomers and the grind[/b]\nThe learning curve of DBD is manageable but you need to invest a lot of time to get at least decent at the game. Unless you have fun getting bullied every match.\nThe grind is off the charts. The game is stuffed with killers, survivors and perks you have to unlock via RNG. Furthermore, you have to get the perks for each character individually. And you need good perks, without them you play at a significant disadvantage. It really feels like the developers slow you down as hard as they can.\n\n[b]Bugs, glitches, exploits[/b]\nDBD is riddled with bugs, glitches and it gets worse with every patch. Some of them are minor inconveniences others game-breaking.\n\nJust to name a few I encountered so far:\n[list]\n[*] Locker grab bug, which glitches you in the carry animation, even though the survivor is still running around freely because the servers decided against your grab. If that happens, as a killer you can't do anything besides using M1 hits.\n\n[*] Invisible pallets, you can still interact with them, you just don't see them.\n\n[*] Animation bugs of all sorts: killer or survivor t-posing around, survivors gliding all over the place while stuck in perma crouching animation, hit animations delayed or glitched out, being stuck in animations for all eternity because someone dc'd while you tried to hook or grab them, etc\n\n[*] All sorts of exploits. For example, survivors glitching in places where it is not possible for the killer to interact with them in any way, but they can get picked up freely by other survivors or themselves.\n\n[*]Manipulating certain animations and perk powers to break the game.\n\n[*] And there is so much more\n[/list]\nThe developers should shift all focus to fixing bugs and gameplay problems, instead, they are busy pumping out new cash grabs.\n\n[b]Technical issues[/b]\nThis game is poorly optimized. It never ran amazingly and had its hickups. Be it fps drops, crashes, mouse input issues, or being stuck in the loading screen for all eternity. But it was manageable and major issues were actually very rare.\nHowever, every patch introduces more problems and they are piling up steadily. It is incredibly frustrating because some issues existed for years and there is no fix in sight. \n\n[b]Matchmaking[/b]\nMatchmaking is horrendous. Queue times are annoyingly long. Beginners draw another short stick here because they get matched with or against people that have hundreds if not thousands of hours and get absolutely demolished. \nIt feels more like a random dice roll to see which opponents or teammates you get, instead of some formula that evaluates your skill level. Don't expect to be matched fairly.\n\n[b]The community[/b]\nLast but not least, the community. Dead by Daylight houses the worst community of any multiplayer game. It is unbelievably toxic.\nRagequitting, being afk, trolling, hacking, bm-ing or spamming post-match chat or your steam profile with insults. People will go out of their way to ruin your game and insult you. If you are really lucky, you might run into friendly people. The chances are unbelievably small, but they are not zero.","timestamp_created":1613917001,"timestamp_updated":1634921474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87166542","author":{"steamid":"76561198832002585","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3389,"last_played":1630329619},"language":"schinese","review":"什么垃圾游戏，bug真的一大堆，要不要点脸，总有几局翻不了窗户，结算血点无缘无故不见，隔墙刀一大堆，赶紧死吧","timestamp_created":1613916734,"timestamp_updated":1613916734,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87166438","author":{"steamid":"76561198395319172","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4292,"last_played":1614516523},"language":"turkish","review":"dits a gud menğ","timestamp_created":1613916630,"timestamp_updated":1613916630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87166299","author":{"steamid":"76561198187683526","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7762,"last_played":1657687747},"language":"russian","review":"Фикс ждём","timestamp_created":1613916488,"timestamp_updated":1613916488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87166063","author":{"steamid":"76561198843284140","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10265,"last_played":1629358772},"language":"russian","review":"ЧИТКА","timestamp_created":1613916247,"timestamp_updated":1613916247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87165863","author":{"steamid":"76561197960447949","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":170,"playtime_at_review":2179,"last_played":1660490536},"language":"english","review":"At times the hard resets were pretty bad.
