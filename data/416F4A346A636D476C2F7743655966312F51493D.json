When I first started playing the game, I had a blast. I played with friends and while we were low ranked and casual, the game was super fun. Over time we improved and while the toxic community was a struggle at times, the core game still stayed mostly fun. Eventually I reached a point where I was too high ranked to find fun matches and decided to call it a day for a bit.\n\nI eventually came back for the RE chapter and early in I had a fairly fun time, but as SOON as I ranked out of the absolute bottom of the ladder, suddenly my game quality PLUMMETED. I was green rank and being consistently ranked with the best players in the game who would absolutely crush it every time while also being super toxic. It was an absolutely horrible experienced and I decided to take a break until I deranked back down into the fun ranks.\n\nI've returned to the game one last time, and I'm here to tell you: There is no fun ranks anymore. Even at absolute 0 bottom of the latter, the game feels it's okay to match me with rank 1 players who completely destroy any possibility of fun. I'm not sure if it's a failure of the matchmaking system or a lack of casual players anymore, but all I can tell you is this; Don't come into this game thinking you can have a fun, casual time. You won't find it.\n\nAll you'll find is a buggy mess of a game where every player on the other side wants to crush you and grief you as hard as possible.\n\nThis game was fun before, but I think Behavior doesn't understand how to keep fun in their game. I think they've let the toxicity of the community absolutely destroy the community and I don't think there's any saving this game anymore. I've uninstalled, and I won't be coming back.","timestamp_created":1632885282,"timestamp_updated":1632885282,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100134007","author":{"steamid":"76561198990691498","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15387,"last_played":1657469201},"language":"english","review":"The best assymetrical game Ive played","timestamp_created":1632885180,"timestamp_updated":1632885180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100133464","author":{"steamid":"76561197978892226","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":9642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":110,"playtime_at_review":4037,"last_played":1659871963},"language":"english","review":"It's one of those games where the concept is really good but the developer seems to misunderstand their audience in building upon it. They keep adding new content that is really fun, but as they can't be bothered to balance old content you'll just be repeatedly screwed over by bad decisions they made years ago.\n\nAt current the game is incredibly easy for survivors and incredibly frustrating as a killer. The devs have said that they're currently looking into taking more power away from the killers to stop tactics based around camping, tunneling and slugging (basically tactics killers use to get any sort of value out of survivors that are using meta perks). So DBD will likely continue to get worse and worse over time. The game also penalizes you significantly in power for being a new player and you will be forced to play against really experienced players.","timestamp_created":1632884311,"timestamp_updated":1632884468,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100133408","author":{"steamid":"76561198163173125","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":91,"playtime_at_review":2532,"last_played":1659422823},"language":"english","review":"5 man custom games are the best i recommend that over anything else but online is p good too.","timestamp_created":1632884223,"timestamp_updated":1632884223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100133192","author":{"steamid":"76561199058969281","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1635106953},"language":"english","review":"This is game is fire, get it....Now.....I said.....NOW","timestamp_created":1632883877,"timestamp_updated":1632883877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100133141","author":{"steamid":"76561198392234958","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3027,"last_played":1654630989},"language":"english","review":"This game is such an epic game to play with friends!

concept isn't bad, to simplify it's 4v1 hide and seek with some additional objectives. \nMay be fun if you play with 3-4 of your friends, otherwise give up.\n\nIf you value time, stay away from this game. The grind is insane, to unlock most meta perks you'll have to play a lot. And I really mean a lot. There are 2 perks which easen the grind a bit, 1 for survivor and 1 for killer (the killer one is behind a paywall, unless you're lucky to find the perk in shop for in-game currency)\n\nIf you are casual gamer who'd like to play from time to time, also give up. \nRecently there was implemented \"skill based mmr\" which according to devs works after some games played. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work, despite me having played some matches since it's live. \nSo either you'll be stomped, or you'll play with potatoes, rarely something in between.\n\nTutorial is very basic, there is no mode to train more advanced tactics. Actually there is no mode to even properly warm up, as games vs AI always put you against same kind of killer and you can't bring perks/items with you.\n\nI know multiplayer games are prone to attract toxicity and so on, but honestly, even LoL had more decent community, and at least reporting system actually did anything. Here if you play with cheater, unless you provide a videoproof (you'd have to record your game, harvest bunch of information about you and the reported one, get to external website and put it all together there) almost certainly no action will be taken. Most games have some sort of logs or even auto-recording matches for such issues, that's not the case here.\n\nBalance is dead, but let's be serious, how many multiplayer games are balanced?\nEven though, you shouldn't have few usefull perks and ton of perks which you won't touch at all.\nAccording to wiki, there are 185 perks, of which maybe 20-30(optimistically) are actually useful.\n\nSame goes for chosing your killer character. Why bother playing some long forgotten killers who were nerfed to the ground, when you can play 1-2 all the time that are optimal to win?\n\nDon't know if devs are actually trying to fix the balance issue to be honest. I mean since I play there were some legitimate fixes (fixing mori) which was unbalanced for surivivors, yet keys which are mentioned pretty often on the forum as they're breaking the balance for killers weren't adressed yet.\n\nNew character are being released, so one can't complain about lack of new content, but old ones are rarely \"updated\" to standard. \nOften even the newly released killers are so weak that you will rarely meet them in the game (dunno when was last time I saw Twins or Pyramidhead in-game despite them being newer than older).\n\nRather than focusing on balance improvements and game health overall, gamedevs are focused on pulling as much cash as possible from you. Who needs fixed common issues, when you can buy newly released cosmetic instead?\nDon't get me wrong here, I didn't buy anything from them apart from the game and few dlcs on sale. Cosmetics are nice, but seriously, get your priorities straight.\n\nTL:DR\nDon't buy this game, if you're really that curious, check it out on some free weekend, or on the Xbox gamepass as it's
