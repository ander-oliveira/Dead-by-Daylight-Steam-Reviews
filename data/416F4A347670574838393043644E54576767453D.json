The game itself started out with a lot of promise, but continuously adding more and increasingly complex characters only enriches the game for those willing to spend an endless amount of money unlocking all content.  The game requires a huge devotion of time and research to actually have a good time.  The game does not have a player base to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels.  Those who are familiar with the basics but still newer will find themselves either completely bored by inexperienced competitors, or destroyed with no hope of winning by players with significantly more games under their belt.  \n\nUnless you are a highly competitive player with a top tier gaming computer who is also willing to spend hundreds, possibly thousands of hours on a game to get to a place where they can get consistent enjoyment out of it - avoid this game.","timestamp_created":1502919547,"timestamp_updated":1585190284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34284445","author":{"steamid":"76561198003054410","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":42821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17581,"last_played":1656599720},"language":"russian","review":"10 ливнувших игроков из 10!!!

作弊成本低，具有全民开挂特色。制作组反作弊手段使用EasyAntiCheat，饶过你很简单呵呵，快捷键操作；然后使用CE直接修改血点或替换道具，光头火衣啥每样都能卡。线圈卡核能手电，屠夫卡人类携手，老司机过来都知道这是历史。\n\n疑问1：那制作组不管作弊开挂？不是不管，管不过来，游戏反作弊就靠EasyAntiCheat，有个屁用。那些被封的都是高调作死（比如红处没改前，把把红处直接秒人），要嘛多次被人邮件举报（比如血点刷太多，与游戏时长不符），要嘛被人视频录下邮件举报。\n\n疑问2：那既然这样，我就把可疑的都举报得行不？抱歉，不行，举报太多制作组就直接无视了。。。不是每个人都像你一样，喜欢随手举报的。举报的太多，制作组的工作量就越多，如果没视频，很难审查，更别说刷血点的人家不会直接在你面前刷，你只能怀疑。\n\n制作组有心的话，建个服务器，引入battleye反外挂程序，别说改东西了，你就算用世界著名的systemcheat团队的作弊程序搞透视，相信我2天内自动被封！\n\nBE特性简单的说就是\n(1)内核保护，常规/抽查式自动快速扫描和长期监测玩家内核数据\n(2)游戏数据内存全部由BE官方精密扫描读取调试\n(3)全球封禁，跟VAC不同的是，BE封的是机器、IP而不是号，开挂的人不可能换号就能继续潇洒\n(4)比赛服务器监测BE官方实时并且瞬时封禁数据异常的用户\n(5)订制的脚本检测系统，可作用于不同形式的脚本检测\n(6)自动升级，不解释\n\n绝地大逃杀就是用battleye，不排除此时此刻有人在搞透视自瞄作弊，放心2天内会有人封你的。\n\n\n2.制作组惩罚力度极弱。这游戏本身无服务器，屠夫本身就是主机！一场游戏下来，屠夫如果玩得不好，直接退出游戏（拔线），同理人类。一次没问题，但是如果形成特定的游戏氛围，没啥好说的，辛辛苦苦玩完一把，然后拔了，呵呵。\n\n再举个例子，对了，今天是2017年8月16号，这几天贴吧有帖子说卡疯人院地图的BUG，屠夫玩家录下视频，人类受伤了直接卡bug然后治疗再跑再溜，或者直接不走逼屠夫拔线。前几天制作组封了恶意卡bug的玩家，今天制作组发声说这是短期封禁，以后人类别不乖了。。。。\n\n\n3.这游戏平衡性饱受争议。制作组更新工作主要是修改技能的参数，一次简单的修改可以让你变屠皇也可以让你变人皇。。。\n\n\n玩人的，注意开局熟悉地图，把有板子的大区域熟记心中，每个大区域之间估算好距离，一般一个大区域至少两个板子。溜屠夫卡好视野，别丢了视野，如果没视野听声音辨位，避免被套路！！！\n溜屠夫最常见的就是绕板子，注意绕完看屠夫有没有踢板子，如果有，可以考虑跑到其他大区域，每个大区域来回一块板子。基本溜屠夫都是这套路的！！！这过程开的电机数量，呵呵过来人都懂得。如果溜太久触发杀戮，被砍倒了怎么办？不怕有毁灭打击，继续绕；如果上钩怎么办？不怕有怀表！如果屠夫贴脸怎么办？不怕疯狂修电机！人一死，剩下3个人早已跑掉了，光荣牺牲，这是极端卖友的结局。。。。\n\n\n这种溜屠夫的套路老玩家遍地都是，开黑更可怕，工具箱红齿轮紫色医疗包紫色手电（低调刷），四个怀表四个打击。现如今，做视频的，谁敢号称自己陆地屠神。。。现在杀机录视频开直播的都是玩人类或者护士。夹子屠夫？隐身屠夫？电锯屠夫？杀人鬼？李奶奶？杨永信屠夫？醒醒吧，这年头谁有胆量玩，也只有萌新屠夫才会玩。即使面对高套路的陆地屠夫，杀两个人皇算是牛逼结局。\n如果你已经买了游戏，那就专心练人或者练护士吧。玩这游戏想娱乐休闲，不可能的，除非花时间练好技术，否则玩屠夫被12嘲讽，玩人类把把上树，被老玩家细虐笑呵呵当炮灰。\n\n\n×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××\n\n\n2018年4月27号，今天我要说下官方制作组就是垃圾狗屎！无缘无故封我的号！虽然我已经基本不碰这游戏了，但是我还是得回来说一句dev is dog shit.你以为封号就可以逼人买新的号，老子花几千元打水漂也不会花钱在你这游戏上。还有，这次封号行动，说明了你们明明有能力查外挂查改存档，偏偏要等到某时刻才来行动，什么心态大家懂的。你们要赚钱可以理解，但应该把重心放在游戏体验上，而不是像R星那样靠游戏封号来赚钱。","timestamp_created":1502870371,"timestamp_updated":1524831505,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34271088","author":{"steamid":"76561198206928332","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4070,"last_played":1657633061},"language":"english","review":"lit","timestamp_created":1502867754,"timestamp_updated":1502867754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510204076766967773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34271026","author":{"steamid":"76561198313613247","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":33393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24751,"last_played":1511270097},"language":"german","review":"Sehr

Generally speaking I would recommend this game.\n\nThe gameplay is challenging on both sides, perhaps more challenging if you're playing as the killer. The atmosphere is creepy--the graphics, the sound, and the general feeling that you're being watched/you are the evil. The gameplay is fun on both sides. As a killer you have the evil fun of hunting people down--you have to be smart, set traps, ambush, or simply chase em down. As the survivor you have to be smart as well--using surrounding enviornment to hide yourself, fixing generators strategically, and cooperate or not cooperate with your teammate.\n\nI can only think of two downsides of this game. First is the connection issue. The game is P2P based. I can see the reasoning behind the P2P mode, since each gameplay requires only 5 people at most. However, P2P can be really laggy and annoying sometimes. Also, you can only host a game by being the killer, and there are way more people who wanna be survivors than killers, at least this was the situation when I played this game. As a result, a lot of times when I wanted to be a survivor I ended up not finding a game in 3-4 mins (and around 1/3 of the times I joined a game there were connection issues thanks to P2P). The second downside is the upgrade mechanics, the upgrade is something I was not really comfortable with even after around 8 hrs into the game. I don't think any intelligently designed leveling system should make a player feel this way. Many of the items are one time only use, which is kind of upsetting consider you put so many bloodpoints to get the upgrade.","timestamp_created":1502848882,"timestamp_updated":1502848882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34267734","author":{"steamid":"76561198209808353","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11265,"last_played":1635717386},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un buena juego pero le faltan muchos arreglos","timestamp_created":1502848826,"timestamp_updated":1502848826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34267560","author":{"steamid":"76561198257152366","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3996,"last_played":1639108047},"language":"spanish","review":"muy divertido","timestamp_created":1502847911,"timestamp_updated":1502847911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34267381","author":{"steamid":"76561198134922816","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1628127621},"language":"english","review":"You can say I'm \"hooked\" to this game.","timestamp_created":1502846871,"timestamp_updated":1502846871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34266705","author":{"steamid":"76561198301929607","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":13439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9554,"last_played":1645140452},"language":"english","review":"This is my old review: This is a very good game, also a very good way to throw away 44 hours in what seems to be 44 minutes.

But c'mon you have to admit its got its moments. Contrary to popular belief, the devs do listen (they just need a nudge in the right direction.) \n\nDead By Daylight is a game where survivors must work together (or not) to escape the match as mentioned in the game description above. You can play as several killers, ranging from scary original killers to movie flick slashers! (Though the only killers that are truly powerful are Nurse, Spirit, and Billy) You can play as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Amanda Young, and even Ghostface!\n\n As a survivor, it'll just be you and 3 other needledicks thrown into a mess of a playground. You'll find that surviving might be hard with survivors such as the locker dwight or the immersed claudette being your teammates. In fact you may fall victim to making a complete fool of yourself too! That's part of the learning process of course. You'll soon find as survivor that maybe its a better idea to not drop that pallet you ran through with the killer still several meters behind you. And how maybe you shouldn't save someone right in front of the killer (for real tho). \n\n As a killer, it'll be you and.. well just you. You might have trouble chasing and keeping track of people at first but with time you'll find that it becomes easy, almost too easy. Don't let this fool you, survivors at low ranks are incredibly immersed in the game and will panic 99% of the time. Its going to be easy when the survivors are actually scared of you. Later on they'll get better and use their looping technology (but I'm not going to have any more loopers introduced into the game so ask someone else).\n\nIt should be noted that the difference between low ranks and high ranks is huge. Your cheap tactics (or mindless running/chasing) won't work in high ranks. Honestly, I recommend staying in the lower ranks. The wait time isn't horrible like in high ranks and generally you'll have more fun.","timestamp_created":1502837853,"timestamp_updated":1562301898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34264848","author":{"steamid":"76561198273682902","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7114,"last_played":1653267283},"language":"spanish","review":"super bueno ,muy adicto","timestamp_created":1502834359,"timestamp_updated":1502834359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34264362","author":{"steamid":"76561198029768575","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1047,"last_played":1531573298},"language":"turkish","review":"Milyon tane bug var, hergün patch atıyor üstüne attığı patchi atmamış sayıp bir daha atıyor.

The concept is simple enough: survivors struggle to unlock the map's final exits while evading a killer powered by their unique and deveistating attacks. The killer hunts each person down and hooks them as offerings to a malevolent force only known as \"the entity.\" \n\nThe mehcanics are straight forward and thrive on player interaction. Fix generators to power the exit gates. Finish powering the gate and escape. Along the way, there are chests to loot, hooks and traps to break and plenty of people to heal, save--- or abandon. \n\nIt's those choices that make this game what it is. A team mate has been captured, they have a minute to live and you are injured. One more hit and you too may die. What do you do?\n\nThe learning curve is steep. New survivors will die moments after entering a match. New killers will never catch a soul, but I and a whole community love every minute of it. The game has an ever expanding lore, dozens of unique avatars, abilities and items you can earn and attach to your characters, all giving you control over the kind of game you want to play.\n\nNarrow victories and harrowing defeats bring out the best and worst in its players. But one thing is sure: you will not soon forget your trip into the fog.","timestamp_created":1502825791,"timestamp_updated":1502825791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34261738","author":{"steamid":"76561198316976206","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1261,"last_played":1655857948},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco veramente pieni di bug","timestamp_created":1502823125,"timestamp_updated":1502823125,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34261614","author":{"steamid":"76561198200674038","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1400,"playtime_at_review":10922,"last_played":1660595165},"language":"russian","review":"Самая клевая игра!!!!!","timestamp_created":1502822790,"timestamp_updated":1502822790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34261411","author":{"steamid":"76561198084334962","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":8714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1536,"playtime_at_review":1633,"last_played":1660374095},"language":"english","review":"super mario","timestamp_created":1502822132,"timestamp_updated":1502822132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34261133","author":{"steamid":"76561198188475828","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":8705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6861,"last_played":1622299640},"language":"thai","review":"หยุดอัพแพทได้แล้ว กูอัพแมร่งทุกวันจนจะเบื่อแล้วนิ ห่ากว่าจะได้เล่น อัพแพทมึงล่อแมร่งไปเกือยจะชั่วโมงแล้ว สัส","timestamp_created":1502821262,"timestamp_updated":1502821262,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501932621002197266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34260927","author":{"steamid":"76561198274095943","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":30778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15952,"last_played":1640726189},"language":"polish","review":"dobra gra polecam","timestamp_created":1502820524,"timestamp_updated":1502820524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34260873","author":{"steamid":"76561198287390862","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1556652812},"language":"russian","review":"hhh","timestamp_created":1502820358,"timestamp_updated":1502820358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34260654","author":{"steamid":"76561198357269218","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":17858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":825,"playtime_at_review":1504,"last_played":1660399814},"language":"english","review":"good game Nice thart u hear the heartBeat , i would make new charachters this game is Nice !","timestamp_created":1502819678,"timestamp_updated":1502819678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34260585","author":{"steamid":"76561198294153746","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":55980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33923,"last_played":1556649464},"language":"russian","review":"Те кто не играл в эту игру: не покупайте!
