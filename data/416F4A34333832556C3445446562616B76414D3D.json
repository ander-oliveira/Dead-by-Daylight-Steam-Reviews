Overall this game is pretty cool, I like the diversity in the characters in terms of genders, race, etc. I also like how there's both original characters and licensed characters from books/novels, movies, etc. However this game is not something to write to home about, I'm not saying the game is not terrible but I am saying that this game needs some major work done to it. I first want to begin with how the game can get a little based in terms of survivor perks and maps. As of right now, survivors have a huge advantage against killers, this can be because of the same perks survivors use all of the time, most survivors take this game very seriously so they play this game with their friends, hop in a VC and literally act like this is a jackpot tournament. That seems okay and all but the only problem is, those people usually end up with killers who are pretty bad at the game or just wants to have a casual mindset which leads me to my next topic, the matchmaking. Overall I say this game's matchmaking is the 2nd worst matchmaking I have ever seen, it used to be good before but they added this new system in which makes matchmaking a total pain for people who just want to have a casual mindset. Not only does this apply to killers, but sometimes to also survivors, in high MMR you will start to see one of the same 3 killers 6/10 matches: The Blight, The Nurse, and The Spirit. This can get really repetitive for you as currently when I am writing this there is 28 killers in Dead by daylight, however most of the community uses the same 3 killers all of the time. But not only does this happen to the survivor side but to the killer side as well, killers can start to see a repetitiveness in how serious the survivors they were matchmaked with are taking this game. Most of the time you may see friends in voice calls with sweaty perks, flashlights, offerings, etc. If you see this, your chances of winning are almost none so you might as well leave the lobby and queue up for another match, or you can take your chance and get looped around the map for 5 minutes by one survivor while the rest of them goes repairs generators. The last topic that I am going to cover is the community as a whole for this game. This game has a very toxic community, most of the time it's because of people who either got sacrificed as a survivor in the end game chat telling the killer how much they sucked at the game or for them to uninstall the game, etc. But some times you will even find that some twitch streamers for this game can even become toxic themselves to other twitch streamers, or even other players. This community is really toxic, but thankfully a good amount of players in this community are nice and pretty cool to hang out with. However this game's player-base is dropping pretty fast unfortunately for quite a lot of reasons, some of which I listed before, so don't be surprised if you get this game that this game has only a few thousand players online. This basically sums up what to expect in Dead by Daylight, by buying this game you will receive 'Internal suffering', 'Regret for buying this game', 'Lost of braincells', 'Rage', and more. I'm not forcing you to not buy this game, as I literally cannot do that. I am just advising that you be careful with your most likely hard earned money and really think if this is the type of experience that you would like to play. This game does go on sale quite often and sometimes even goes on a free trial so if you're not willing to pay full price for it, definitely go for a good deal or even wait enough to get your hands on a free trial.","timestamp_created":1654398290,"timestamp_updated":1654398290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116503332","author":{"steamid":"76561199054127436","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":60354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":13951,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1660601142},"language":"schinese","review":"fgsr gdsrgdrsg rdsagrdsa trg reaes g","timestamp_created":1654398141,"timestamp_updated":1654398141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116503302","author":{"steamid":"76561198141225086","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":261,"playtime_at_review":9524,"last_played":1660465058},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game where you can fight to escape from killers by doing generators or by finding the hatch at the end of the game as last survivor.

只有刀刀好。\n直到今年五月份，我才敢开始单排，最喜欢的事情是和屠夫绕一个模型绕圈圈，虽然这样不对，因为得联合起地形来才能活得更久，但是对我来讲可能太难了。\n最让我安心的车队是安妮和益达的，我永远记得安妮为了让屠夫不抱我在门口让屠夫把她撂倒了换她叉树上qwq，后面队友把我摸起来，我们都跑出去了。她说，她还能被挂，我再挂就死了。捂脸，贴心的让人感动。他们永远是最能溜的，让我也能安心的当个机皇，但是死掉的总不是我，我总是观战不了他们的精彩操作！有一点点可惜，只能欣赏他们事后的录屏回放。\n以及天天玩护士的狗menk，从开始还能活一会儿，到听见他二飞的声音摁钢筋就能躲，到他竟然会等钢筋了！！!,然后就越来越离谱，自定义都不乐意和他护士玩了，他也去闯他狗护士的天地了。以前大叔还不是个社畜的时候还能和menk损来损去，但是当他成为社畜杀鸡技术滑坡，就再也没有这种乐趣了。想当年，我闪手电都是和大叔学的！现在大叔看见屠夫都不敢吱声，确信。最想拉回坑的人是杰瑞，这家伙是我发现杀鸡博弈这个概念的纪念里程碑，虽然我一直都是博弈弱者，但是看大佬们博弈会觉得很有意思。虽然自己学不会，但是欣赏大佬的博弈还是赏心悦目 。\n还有转行去玩派派的阿枯和包砸，我不怕枯萎者的很大程度都来源于阿枯，自定义玩习惯了所以顺带着对这个屠夫都不怂了？\n虽然玩了一千多个小时，但我总是三天不玩屠夫恐怖程度就上升，单排的时候感觉偶尔能溜得更久，因为熟悉的队友不在，所以反而会独立思考的更周全了？因为和朋友们玩他们的存在总能让我感到很放松，甚至让我去扛刀的时候我开始挡队友的路拖后腿哈哈哈（不是故意的下意识做出来的qwq）。我也不知道为什么，有的时候能活好久，有的时候就秒倒。现在大概最喜欢欺负萌新枪手和萌新追追，枯萎者也喜欢，就喜欢每次滑膜甩刀甩不到我的样子~稍微会一点的我就毫无办法。特别是会倒车的屠夫，我总是反应不过来！双倒车那就更给我整不会了，哽咽。我就是妥妥的节奏点。现在最满意的是qte摁的越来越准了，最喜欢摁到完美。\n以及和刀刀自定义出场率很高的人类手电侠，人如其名的手电侠，一句话总结就是奥蒙德，拖拉机，缝，手电，下来了。太离谱了我不理解这我都能下来我是真的没有想到？\n还有深夜在某群里上了一个听说有两个人皇妹妹的车，结果真的每次死的都是他们，跑出来的都是我，就算都死了我也是最后一个死掉的qwq奇妙经历。\n最让我萌新时期深刻的时候是一次自定义，让我学会了有的情况下，及时负伤都得去救人，不然就更没有节奏，直接全盘寄掉。虽然现在我也不太会溜屠夫，也不擅长博弈，但是越玩就越发现，如果是想要上豆的话，就是双方给机会拉扯的过程。如果只是纯速修，没有人上树，没有救援分也不会上豆，屠夫要是直接把人类四挂减员，分也不会多高。要想长豆，必须得双方有更多互动，互相给机会？\n虽然杀鸡是个竞技游戏？一个人和四个人的，但是我玩游戏总是不能放弃个人情感，也没有那么强的好胜心（本来就弱）。我喜欢终局队友仍然坚持不放弃愿意来救人的勇气，喜欢他们调戏屠夫被一刀噶了带给人的快乐，喜欢在面对守尸但迫于某些情况没法救这样的困境而不得不放弃队友在门口疯狂爆点对屠夫做出的一点点小小的反击，或是配合的天衣无缝，或是毫无配合挨个葫芦娃送爷爷，生气也好，快乐也好，仍然在一起。这把的爱恨过了就过了，下一把会是新的旅程。我想，我最爱的大概不是杀鸡，而是陪我度过杀鸡时光的，奇妙相遇的人吧。\n说到杀鸡这个改版就来气，本来想着第一次过周年庆，正好好好肝血点把我最爱的钢筋自摸怀表咬根打击全部给三转了，没想到改版后这些主流技能全部削了，一个不剩！让我肝的有点生气，甚至想退坑，呜呜呜钢筋，没有你我怎么活啊呜呜呜呜呜。钢筋大概是杀鸡的灵魂了，感觉不会再有这么帅的技能了。萌新时期我还只会翻窗加速，自从强迫自己使用钢筋，没想到用出来是真的帅！哽咽，以后钢筋被削成那个鬼样子，再也欣赏不到那么帅的操作了，只让人觉得可惜！哎，生活还是要继续，杀鸡也得继续向前，希望它能一直是我美好的回忆。\n","timestamp_created":1654356659,"timestamp_updated":1656594940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116477196","author":{"steamid":"76561199225066610","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":222,"playtime_at_review":1828,"last_played":1659870207},"language":"english","review":"good

I've never had depression but I imagine this is what it feels like. Playing as survivor can be fun IF you get a fun killer to play against, most of the killers though are just boring, annoying, and not fun to play against due to their lackluster abilities which usually aren't even good. Playing as killer feels somehow worse than survivor, this may be due to the fact you're on a time limit as the more time you spend jerking off in the corner, the more time survivors are allowed to complete gens, you could play the game flawlessly as killer and survivor and there's a 50% chance you'll still fail, maybe because of teammates that find it Hilarious and absolutely thrilling to hide in lockers, scratch their ass and sniff it, and then lick their fingers or you'll play against god tier survivors on a shitty map where they can just clap your booty cheeks and proceed to 360 no-scope your entire family with a steel cap boot designed for midgets.
