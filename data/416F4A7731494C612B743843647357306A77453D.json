Pour résumer les choses en simple le but des survivants et de parvenir à s'enfuir de la carte en parvenant à allumer 5 générateurs parmis ceux disséminés à travers la carte et le but du tueur est de parvenir à sacrifier les survivants avant que ces derniers ne parviennent à s'échapper. \n\nDes objectifs simples à réaliser me diriez vous ? lorsqu'on lance sa première partie en tant que survivant tous confiant dans la réussite de notre évasion avec nos coéquipiers, puis la réalité nous rattrape on se rencontre qu'on est une grosse merde pour réparer les générateurs, qu'on est la première cible du tueur, et qu'on est incapable de le fuir, et on meurt dans l'incompréhenssion et la rage en se demandant pourquoi on à acheter ce jeu, voilà comment devrait se résumer votre première partie en tant que survivant dans ce jeu ( enfin pour la plupart :) ) . Alors certes il peut arriver vite que l'on laisse tomber dbd aprés quelques games peu fructueuses . Alors faut-il laisser tomber pour autant ? Et bien non car dans le cas de dbd ce n'est pas forcément le gain de niveau ou le fait d'avoir un meilleur personnage qui vous permettra de remporter votre victoire en tant que survivant ( même si cela aide un peu X) ) mais cela se baseras sur la coopération et l'expérience ce sont ces deux choses qui vous permettrons de faire la différence dans vos partie en tant que survivant on apprend à réfléchir comme le tueur, à faire les meilleurs choix pour survivre. Et à partir de ce moment on prend plaisir à jouer, bon certe qu'en on joue entre potes c'est encore mieux !!! \n\nEt pour le tueur qu'en est-il ? Et bien la même chose l'expérience fait la différence . Pour autant jouer le tueur et tout aussi amusant que de jouer le survivant, en pourchassant inlassablement vos proies dans le but de les sacrifiés une par une pour l'Entité. De plus chaque tueur à sa manière jouer qui lui est propre et c'est ce qui fait la force de jeu !\n\nAlors oui comme tout jeu il à aussi ces quelques défauts :\n- La communauté c'est un peu le noir et le blanc qui s'oppose d'un coté on trouvera des joueurs avec qui il sera super fun de jouer qui seront d'excellent alliés, ou encore qui feront preuve d'un bon fair-play ( je parle surtout des tueurs ), puis de l'autre coté on peut trouver des alliés inutiles ( Padamalgam hein, je ne parle pas des nouveaux joueurs mais des joueurs qui ne sont là que pour sauver leurs peau ou qui font que de la merde alors qu'ils sont de haut rang ), des tueurs avec aucun fair-play ( je parle surtout des campeurs ).\n- Certains tueurs ou certaines compétences qui déséquilibre complétement les parties ( Freddy juste Freddy ).\n\nEn bref ça reste un bon jeu que je recommande, très fun à jouer mais je conseille d'y jouer avec des potes pour que cela soit vraiment fun.","timestamp_created":1511660890,"timestamp_updated":1511660890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37606505","author":{"steamid":"76561198074462525","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13433,"last_played":1536160120},"language":"russian","review":"В такую помойку я ещё не играл","timestamp_created":1511660696,"timestamp_updated":1532022783,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37606407","author":{"steamid":"76561198310302977","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":782670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5311,"playtime_at_review":599983,"last_played":1660594008},"language":"koreana","review":"게임을 하면 살인마를 무서워해야하는데 이상하게 생존자가 탭댄스 추는게임.\n적당히 하기에 좋으나 과몰입 주의요망\n\np.s)저는 데바데 탈출을 못했으니 님들이라도 탈출하세요","timestamp_created":1511660601,"timestamp_updated":1613322159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54056549072265625","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37606385","author":{"steamid":"76561198209168835","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":72642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17092,"last_played":1656465976},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1] 6/10 [/h1]\n\nBem, Dead by Daylight (DBD) é um jogo simples que consiste apenas em 4 sobreviventes tentando sobreviver de um assassino, tendo que reparar 5 geradores para conseguirem abrir as portas, e irem embora. No entanto, o assassino (killer) tem o principal objetivo de derrubar os sobreviventes usando seus poderes únicos e especiais (cada killer tem um poder diferente), e colocar os sobreviventes em um gancho, para que uma certa entidade possa os matar.\n[i] Fácil? Simples? EM TESE, sim. [/i]\n\n[h1] Pontos fortes: [/h1]\n1. Cara, é super divertido de jogar, aprendendo mais e mais coisas com o tempo, formas de dibrar os killers, evoluir.\n2, Jogar com os amigos é melhor ainda\n3. Da pra você descontar a sua raiva jogando de killer, esmagando os sobreviventes\n4. Você pode comprar habilidades com os pontos que recebe jogando partidas (bloodpoints)\n5. As partidas, em média, são rápidas\n\n[h1] Pontos fracos: [/h1]\n1. O jogo tem muitos bugs, sejam eles visuais, ou que atrapalham a movimentação, etc.\n2. Eu acho o jogo super desbalanceado, e na maioria das vezes, sofro jogando de killer, pois, os sobreviventes precisam saber apenas os básicos dos mapas e terem sorte para as janelas e pallets spawnarem em bons lugares, que os killers estão [spoiler] fodidos [/spoiler], além dos itens dos sobreviventes serem SUPER APELÕES.\n3. Os desenvolvedores demoram pra arrumar as coisas do jogo\n4. A comunidade estraga o jogo com [i] facecamping [/i] (pesquise facecamping DBD, que você acha o que é), tunneling (focar 1 sobrevivente, etc)\n5. Pessoas super tóxicas\n6. Os desenvolvedores costumam lançar atualizações inúteis para o jogo, e, atualizações que podiam estar melhorando a expêriencia dos jogadores são encontradas apenas em longo prazo\n7. [u] O KILLER É O HOST DA PARTIDA [/u], sim, a conexão da partida depende do killer, ou seja, se a internet do killer foi de 1MB, provavelmente todos os sobreviventes vão ficar super lagados, quase impossível de jogar.\n8. [u] A CONEXÃO É UMA MERDA. [/u] O jogo funciona através de lobbies, ou seja, o killer cria um lobby, 4 jogadores entram, e se marcam como \"prontos para jogar\". O problema é que por mais que você seja brasileiro, não irão entrar apenas brasileiros e boludos no seu lobby, não, meu amigo, vão entrar [b] RUSSOS, ALEMÕES, JAPONESES, COREANOS, NORTE-AMERICANOS, ETC [/b], o que dificulta mais ainda ter uma jogatina decente.\n\n\n[h1] [b] CONCLUSÃO [/b] [/h1]\nO jogo é bom, por mais que muitas vezes você irá passar rages e muita raiva porque o seu time é [b] inútil, não tem noção, são trollers, etc. [/b]\nÉ super viciante, e com o tempo, você vai aprendendo a [b] lidar [/b] com os bugs, conexão e sociedade.\nOs desenvolvedores estão trabalhando em [b] [u] futuras [/u] [/b] atualizações para melhorar o jogo.\nCara, compre, se dedique ao jogo, ele perde a graça se você é ruim e não sabe o básico.\nVocê vai entender melhor tudo que eu disse na sua experiência.\nPesquise vídeos sobre o jogo para ter uma visão não tão teórica sobre o que eu disse.\n\n:')\n","timestamp_created":1511660581,"timestamp_updated":1511660581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695628106594085693","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37606245","author":{"steamid":"76561197996291406","num_games_owned":607,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1511658865},"language":"english","review":"Don't waste your time.

Danke.\n\nIch kann das Spiel zwar epfehlen aber es ist Momentan so, dass die Mörder immer als \"Camper\" bezeichnet werden sobald man 10 Meter um den Hacken rum läuft. Das ist echt schlimm und lächerlich. Man spielt das Böse was nicht für ihre Fairness bekannt ist und wird regelrecht geflamt und beleidigt nur am Hacken zu stehen und zu \"Campen\" was auch ein ziemlicher Nachteil ist, da man in der Zeit genügend Generatoren machen kann! Außerdem was soll man machen wenn bereits 2 Leute drum herum laufen um den Überlebenden runter zu holen und danach sofort zu heilen ? Soll ich weg gehen und somit wieder am Anfang stehen nur, dass sie bereits 1-3 Generatoren gemacht haben? Lächerlich Leute... wirklich Lächerlich. Der Killer soll wie in den Filmen einfach stark und Angsteinflösend da gestellt werden und es ist nur natürlich das er den längeren Hebelt hat. Team Play muss funktionieren dann gewinnen die Überlebenden, sonst nicht. Der Killer muss Stärker, Schneller, Tödlich und unfair sein... Meine Güte, sonst sieht man sich doch keinen Horrorfilm an oder ?\nDie Überlebenden sind zu op meiner Meinung nach:\n- Überlebende können sich gegenseitig heilen ohne Medikit\n- Sind 4-1 in der Überzahl (3-1 wäre ausglichener)\n- Haben starke, Konter Perks\n- Sobald man den Bogen raus hat, sind Überlebende dem Killer weit vorraus. (Taschenlampe zum Beispiel)\n- Selbst wenn man sie Nieder schlägt, sieht man den krabbelnden nicht (wird nicht Makiert)\n- Zum Größtem Teil sind die Maps für die Überlebenden ausgelegt und zum Nachteil des Killers (Sichtfeld, Geräusche wie die Tankstelle wo nur der Killer die Glocke auslöst)\n- Killer können nur mit einer Opfergabe sofort Töten (Geht dann nur eine Runde und ist SUPER SELTEN zu bekommen)\n- Das Töten eines Überlebenden dauert am Haken viiiiiiiiel zu lange (ca. 3 Minuten = Zwei Generatoren)\n- Die Überlebenden können, wenn stark dezimiert, instant eine Falltür zur Flucht nutzen\n- Nur überlebende können Items auf der Map nutzen und sogar behalten\n- Paletten muss der Killer vernichten um durch zu kommen und wird sogar betäubt wenn er dabei getroffen wird\nund es gibt noch ein Paar weitere Nachteile vom Killer. Klar er ist schneller, hat ein Paar Fähigkeiten aber... hey, das wird alles aus gekontert.

The bugs are the real killer though.  I was matched up and the game was on the loading screen just to be kicked out one too many times this time.  You might be in a group of 4 friends and one person might not load up forcing them to wait for the others to finish their game.  Also for some reason, you can't keep your same group.  After every match, you go back into single player mode and pressing \"Join a Lobby\"will have you join another group of 3 people.  You have to exit the screen, select \"Survive with Friends\", and reinvite your friends after every match.  \n\nThis game is just way too buggy.  You'll have moments of fun and moments of utter dissapointment becasue of a bug.  I never complain about bugs if it's an early release game but game has been out for well over a year.
