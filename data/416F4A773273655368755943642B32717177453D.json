I have played it long enough to finnaly make a \"Review\" on this game. Lets get into the basics.\n\n     This game is a survival game where there 4 survivors and 1 killer, the survivors must fix 5 generators and find the exit gate and escape. Each game you earn \"Blood Points\" You use these Blood Points to spend on the \"Blood Web\" (Level up system) Where you find perks to help you survive your matches. Each survivor has 3 main perks. 1st perk is level 30, 2nd perk is level 35, 3rd perk level 40. They are mostly OP and you can only get them on the survivor your playing based on what perks they have. The only way to share perks is by getting it in the blood web at level 30,35,40. Now what do I think of survivors? I think there really balanced because of the way you play. Do you want to play defensive do you wanna be the guy trolling the killer so the other survivors can get the gens done. Its about your play style and thats what I think of survivors. \n\n   The killer is the person who stops the game each with differnt bio's explaining why they are here to kill survivors. There are a bunch of ways to stop survivors from getting out. 1. The killer can obviously slap the survivors two times and put them on a hook (To kill survivor you must hook them 3 times or wait them out as there blood meter will go down) 2. Kick the gens to make sure they can't open the gates which gives you time to go hook some survivors 3. Just bait them out and kill them one by one. Each killers like survivors have 3 main perks depending on which person you play. These help you in matches to killer survivors.\n\n(Btw survivors can get the hatch if theres only one survivor left and they have done one gen)\n\n\n    Over all this game is one heck of a funtime to play with your freinds. Will you die? Will you make out? Bloody signing off peace!\n\n","timestamp_created":1537837187,"timestamp_updated":1537837187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44921374","author":{"steamid":"76561198098169299","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1537589480},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy piolon para jugar con amigos","timestamp_created":1537835450,"timestamp_updated":1537835450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44921364","author":{"steamid":"76561198118718974","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":33878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29228,"last_played":1658770989},"language":"japanese","review":"[h1]あの\"[b]本田翼[/b]\"さんがプレイしていると聞き始めてしまったのが運のつきでした…[/h1]\n\nこのゲームはハマると恐ろしいくらい時間を消費します。\n色んな方がレビューを書いていると思うのですが好評にしろ不評にしろ何百時間超えがザラにいます。\nそれだけ面白く文句があっても遊んでしまうゲームなのです。（500時間くらいやっても育成が終わらないのはどうかと思うけど）\n\nなんでDBDがこんなに面白いかというのはゲームシステムの秀逸さにあると思います。\n基本的に1VS4で戦うことになるわけですが、サバイバーとキラー側で見える情報量に差があります。\nこの情報量の差を推測でカバーしたりパークでカバーすることでうまく戦えるようになっています。（例えば：味方の位置がわかるようになる絆、共感、血族 キラー側：敵の位置がわかるようになるバベチリ、憎悪、怨恨）\n\n[h1]しかし！！！そんなゲームシステムを崩壊させる存在が1つだけあります！！！\nVCPTです！！！！[/h1][strike]なぜ開発はSWFを実装してしまったのか[/strike]\n\n仲間内で情報伝達ができるようになると一気にこのゲームはただのキラーいじめになります。\n元々1人のキラーに対して4人のサバイバーという人数差がある時点でいじめになりやすいのですが、ゲーム的にも圧倒することができるPTは更に厄介です。\nおそらく某兄弟の動画とかを見て始めた方は悪気なくVCをしているんだと思います。\nそんな人達に気づいてほしい。VCPTに苦しんでいるキラーがいることを。マッチングが遅いのはあなた達がVCPTであるが故に解散されているだけだということを。\n\n今はキラーは自衛するしかありません。おそらくこの先もそうでしょう。ただこのままだとPTを相手にするキラーは誰もいなくなるであろうことはわかってほしいと思いました。\n\nDSとVCPTを排除してからpretty good job so farを名乗ってくれ","timestamp_created":1537835401,"timestamp_updated":1537857153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583433151245117188","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44921069","author":{"steamid":"76561198129814483","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":114972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18233,"last_played":1654121566},"language":"turkish","review":"Mükemmel ötesi ve her gün oynayan biri olarak bahsedildiği kadar buglarla karşılaşmıyorum","timestamp_created":1537833755,"timestamp_updated":1537833755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487598299980163574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44920954","author":{"steamid":"76561198271870017","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1639840761},"language":"schinese","review":"相当硬核呢","timestamp_created":1537833055,"timestamp_updated":1537833055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44920920","author":{"steamid":"76561198031243120","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6340,"last_played":1640559931},"language":"english","review":"FIX FUCKING SPIRIT","timestamp_created":1537832884,"timestamp_updated":1537832884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531053423881530762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44920860","author":{"steamid":"76561198069515827","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":29693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29693,"last_played":1658519461},"language":"english","review":"Coming back to this game to give it another chance after a while, and.... yeah, it still sucks.

The UI is still hard to look at particularly with the objective points, but it has been modified so your eyes don't have to dart across your screen.\n\nThe Rift is being modified and the devs have planned to make it much less grindy, which thank god. Because it was atrocious. \n\nProps to them for listening because it really feels like they haven't been listening for a long, LONG time. Would I recommend the game again? No, not yet. I think the team still has a long way to go.\n\nEDIT 2/11/2021:\n(See above)\n\nI used to enjoy this game. Really, I did. I still find some enjoyment on it by playing with friends, hence why today I still boot it up. But alone? You would hardly catch me playing this alone.\n\nThis game has become atrocious within the last few years. Do you remember how it started rough and then got better? Yeah, we are back at it again. The game is always riddled with constant, frustrating bugs -- in fact, hilariously, our last Anniversary \"\"event\"\" had no cakes working for 2 goddamn weeks. The devs find a need to nerf or rework every killer in such a way that they are either ridiculously overpowered or ridiculously underpowered, even for killers that didn't need a change AT ALL. (Hillbilly) However, the game is so survivor-sided at this point, with devs refusing to listen to anyone but survivor mains, that more and more killers are ruthless and feel very justified in running perks like NOED, that make any match frustrating, or even tunnel and camp.\n\nOne of the saving graces of this game has ended up becoming the characters themselves, from survivors to killers the Tomes let you dwell better into their struggles and life up until the Entity took them in. This is done by navigating the Rift and accomplishing its goals, and comes with its rewards.\n(See above)\n\nThe community is riddled with toxicity from both frustrated survivors and killers who are greatly unhappy with this game, constantly throwing out insults at each other from the post game chat. Wait, you mean someone degraded you? You reported them? Yeah, the devs don't care. You can report all you want, because a killer exploiting a bug with proof on Twitter took more than 3 weeks. No, they don't offer any kind of support nor have ever said anything on it.\n\nBuy if you want a shit show or you don't really care and enjoy it anyway. Just enjoy it while you can, because I sure as hell feel like I took the time I had with this game for granted. Playing with friends is always an experience, especially if you are goofing around.\n\nBut man.\nThis game really reached the pinnacle of \"what NOT to do in a pvp game.\"","timestamp_created":1537819397,"timestamp_updated":1622455388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468164771795272827","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44918288","author":{"steamid":"76561198314636306","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":118380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34036,"last_played":1658865518},"language":"italian","review":"Is funny but there are a lot of bug","timestamp_created":1537818895,"timestamp_updated":1638053055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44918225","author":{"steamid":"76561198278054920","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1645994510},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo foda pra krl, se vc for cagão nem jogue kk","timestamp_created":1537818676,"timestamp_updated":1537818676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44917414","author":{"steamid":"76561198342665855","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9341,"last_played":1650817050},"language":"english","review":"It's good game, but sometimes he have many bugs.","timestamp_created":1537815388,"timestamp_updated":1537815388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52665179967880249","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44917298","author":{"steamid":"76561198309156570","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":49079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1646590046},"language":"english","review":"More way to kill and more way to escape this game deserve 9/10","timestamp_created":1537814889,"timestamp_updated":1560547805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44917156","author":{"steamid":"76561198043955134","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":18336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1677,"last_played":1651342609},"language":"german","review":"Macht Laune, auch wenn wieder mal, die Community Toxic as fuck ist.

Dies erfolgt durch die Reparatur von 5 Generatoren, diese ermöglichen die Ausgangstore zu öffnen. Dafür stehen sowohl dem Killer als auch den Survivern ein bunter Blumenstrauß von unterschiedlichen Perks und Items zur Verfügung. Falls es den Survivern nicht gelingt alle Generatoren zu reparieren und ein Surviver übrig bleibt hat man als Letzter die Chance durch eine Bodenluke dem Killer zu entkommen.  \n\n[b][i][u]Anmerkung zu meinen Erfahrungen[/u][/i][/b] \nIch habe in dem Spiel jetzt 2000+ Std. gesammelt und sowohl bei Killer als auch bei dem Überlebenden die höchste Stufe (1) erreicht. Somit sehe ich mich dazu in der Lage, hier eine triftige Bewertung vorzunehmen. Diese Anmerkung muss man machen da die beiden Spielbaren Seiten sehr am polarisieren sind und viele nur eine Seite betrachten.\n\n[b][i][u]Positiv Aspekte[/u][/i][/b]\nDas Spiel ist optisch sehr ansprechend und erzeugt eine gute düstere Stimmung. Das Spielkonzept würde ich unter revolutionär verbuchen. Die Entwickler geben sich Mühe das Spiel weiter zu entwickeln und Hacker/Modder/Glitcher fernzuhalten.  (nach 2000 Std. bisher nur drei Hacker gesehen). Schön gemacht finde ich es auch das Killer aus bekannten Filmen eingebaut wurden z.b Micheal Mayers (Halloween), Freddy Kruger (Nightmare on Elmstreet), Leatherface(Texas Chainsaw Massarce) und bringen auch viel Abwechslung bezüglich ihrer Spielweise ins Spiel. Hier unterscheidet man in 3 Typen Strategen, Stealth und Hetzer. Dead by Daylight ist dazu hervorragend geeignet um mit Freunden in einer Sitzung zu spielen. Ein Spielmodus \"Töte deine Freunde\" erlaubt es auch nicht vorhandene Perks auszuprobieren. Vor jeder neuen Erweiterung gibt es die Möglichkeit die neuen Features als Beta zu spielen. \n\n[b][i][u]Negative Aspekte[/u][/i][/b]\nMan kann kaum selber was in dem Spiel lernen außer die Karten selbst. Skill wird in erster Linie durch Perks und Addons bestimmt was ein super Nährboden für eine Tryhard und Trashtalk Community darstellt. Man könnte sie gleichsetzten mit der Community von GTA V und COD. Bei Anfängern passiert es häufig auf der Killerseite das diese nur einen Spieler fokussieren bis er tot ist oder am Haken stehen bleiben.  In der hohen Liga wird viel getryhardet und jede Aktion oder Handlung dafür sorgt, das die gegenteilige Partei toxic wird. Auch besteht kaum die Möglichkeit Perks so zu wählen, dass man andere Perks kontern kann. Die Zahl der negativ Effekte in dem Spiel ist sehr gering, es gibt also nur nützliche Perks und weniger nützliche Perks. Die egal wie man sie zusammenstellt, ihre grundlegende Eigenschaften behalten, das heißt man sieht immer wieder die selben nur mit positiv bestückten Metaperks. Dead by Daylight basiert also sehr stark darauf wie stark der Killer/Surviver sich mit Perks&Addons boostet. Freunde von seltsamen Hitboxen werden in diesem Spiel ihren Meister finden, mal trifft man den Überlebenden nicht obwohl er vor einem steht oder wirft die Axt durch einen durch und ein anderes mal ist der Überlebende ganz wo anders und wird trotzdem getroffen oder via Ruberband wieder zurück gezogen. Was ich auch als schwierig sehe ist, das ghosten, das nach dem Tod eines Spielers er in Echtzeit (nicht wie in CSGO Zeit versetzte zuschaut) die Positionen der anderen überlebenden und so auch die Position des Killers über Discord oder Teamspeak etc in echt Zeit durchgeben kann. \n\n[b][i][u]Wünschenswert[/u][/i][/b]\n1. Ein Perkroulettemouds um die Schwierigkeit zu erhöhen und OneManArmy builds bei denen man unendlich viele Hits tanken kann zu verhindern.\n\n2. Schnellere Behebung von Bugs im Spiel. Bei so ziemlich jedem neuen Chapter was alle 3 Monate raus kommt gibt es Bugs und diese werden meistens erst zum nächsten Chapter behoben wie z.B. das man sich auf der Karte festläuft. #Hotfix\n\n3. Mehr negative Effekte für Perks einfügen oder konter Möglichkeiten.\n\n4. Perks oder Spielmechaniken entwickeln, die effektiv etwas dem Genrush entgegensetzen können oder Gens nach dem treten schneller runterlaufen lassen.\n\n5. Ein Delay einfügen das tote Spieler nicht mehr Standorte in Echtzeit durchgeben können.\n\n6. Es sollte nicht mehr möglich sein Clone als Surviver zu spielen die das selbe Outfit tragen.\n\n7. Es sollte ein unterschiedliches Rangsystem für die Killer geben, da man bisher mit Killern die man kaum gespielt hat und die nicht dementsprechend ausgerüstet sind gegen Surviver  antritt die, die maximale Erfahrung und Perks besitzen. #Panzer gegen Steinschleuder.\n\n[b][i][u]Fazit[/u][/i][/b]\nDas Spiel wird immer Surviver bevorzugen schon aus rein kommerziellen zwecken, lieber ein Spieler weniger(Killer) als vier Spieler als Surviver. letztendlich  Verbessungsbedürftig, daher ein Daumen zur Seite.","timestamp_created":1537804664,"timestamp_updated":1636219588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590927183628082275","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44914440","author":{"steamid":"76561198846049686","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":37813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1467,"last_played":1570705724},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏的模式虽然只有一个  ，但是短期内是玩不腻的\n但是！！！！！！！！！！！！\n这里需要一个非常大的但是！！！\n这样一个游戏，如果还不能禁止掉那些开挂的人的话，还玩什么？\n当恶鬼都时时刻刻知道你在哪里，直接就抓人的话 ，那这个游戏还有什么存在的必要？\n我非常非常憎恶那些打游戏开外挂的人，如果可以的话，我希望那些开挂作弊的人一辈子被人没有出头之日，一辈子被人踩在脚下！","timestamp_created":1537804652,"timestamp_updated":1537804652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44914391","author":{"steamid":"76561198832062418","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1601213937},"language":"russian","review":"Свинка топ)","timestamp_created":1537804484,"timestamp_updated":1537804484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2seShuYCd+2qqwE="}
