There are many DLCs coming out that require additional money. I'm all about new things, new characters, etc. But they have created a revolving door. 1) new DLC comes out. 2) killers are overpowered (OP) and ruin the experience for everyone (sincerely, every comment is negative in the lobbies)  3) bad reviews come out, devs try to 'dumb down' the characters. Eventually making it moderately playable for those that don't pay $20 per minor download. 4) repeat from step 1. (Occasional step 5, make a \"special discount\" to get people to think this is a well thought out game.) \n\nIt's truly sad. This game came out with a great gameplay and idea, but it seems there is NO QA testing at all on this game. You will lose your status/rank from one day to the next. Aspects of the game don't work, there are glitches galore. The servers can't handle capacity, they will time out and you will lose perks and tools.\n\nBluntly, I love this game...and hate this game...it's a blast to play, when you're paired up with a killer/survivor team that is comparable in skills/abilities. But the devs don't actually seem to care about how the experience is, just about how much money they can make from these download packs that don't do any more than give you an OP killer and a mediocre survivor. I truly hope this game can go back to its roots and realize that people play this for fun, not to dominate others based on how much money they are willing to spend. If you have $100+ to spend on this game over the next 3 months, by all means, dive in. If you want to enjoy a competitive landscape, look elsewhere until these bugs and OP characters are remedied.","timestamp_created":1481449533,"timestamp_updated":1481449533,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28305841","author":{"steamid":"76561198099411349","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":27294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6833,"last_played":1648641184},"language":"german","review":"Mir persönlich macht es meistens viel Spaß - besonders durch neue Killer und kurze Jagdmomente ist der Aspekt des \"Horrorgames\" da (und auch wenn ich viele viele Filme des Genres gucke, waren Games nie meins.)~\nAllerdings geht es momentan irgendwie komisch in der Community zu.\nKiller campen, höhere Spieler provozieren durch Blödsinn wie teabagging und oft helfen Mitspieler niemandem.\nSehr schade!\n\nAußerdem wird neuer Content rausgebracht, obwohl es zig bekannte Bugs gibt :/ würde mir da mehr Support wünschen.\n\nDennoch macht es - besonders mit 1-3 Freunden - viel Spaß!","timestamp_created":1481449272,"timestamp_updated":1481449272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28305691","author":{"steamid":"76561198322632789","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":228196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"playtime_at_review":17121,"last_played":1660146069},"language":"spanish","review":"este juego es muy bueno para jugar con los amigos unas cuantas partidas","timestamp_created":1481448599,"timestamp_updated":1481448599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28305690","author":{"steamid":"76561198213755701","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":4569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":65,"playtime_at_review":2886,"last_played":1659527356},"language":"english","review":"This Game Is Hella Fun. \nPlaying As A Peson Or A Killer Is Great!\nLove This Game, And The DLC Is Cheap And You Dont Have To Buy It.","timestamp_created":1481448597,"timestamp_updated":1481448597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28305576","author":{"steamid":"76561198315085617","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":25596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3583,"last_played":1634231473},"language":"czech","review":"It is very good game.

Vets have a massive advantage over new players due to the fact that they have far more hours and thus more things unlocked.\n\nThe community is also somewhat unplesant, especially when you play as Killer against a group of friends.

Dont have most if not all of the DLC's? You are at a disadvantage. A serious one at that. AVOID THIS TRASH AT ALL COSTS. I mean that.\n\nNearly 340k reviews and out of those nearly 90k (roughly 1/3) are bad but the game maintains a very positive rating? How is that possible?\n\nThe slightest dissent of this game in the steam forums will result in a ban. They bring out the ban hammer on a regular basis to stifle criticism. Seen hundreds of people banned. I am one of them.\n\nThere are more reasons not to play this then are reasons to play this. Just read the negatives\n\n44 playable characters in the game. 70 million odd bloodpoints needed to get all characters to level 50. You will earn on average 15-25k BP per game that will last anywhere from 5 min to 30 min. How long do you think it will take you to earn the 70 million needed?\n\n6 million copies sold with only 40k playing at peak. This game is a revolving door where lots of people leave, once they figure out the imbalance, the MMO grind to get BP and see the bugs. Then new players take over their spots.\n\nMMR system was promised 2 years ago now. Since then they have released a stream of DLC characters and ignore any comments about the implementation of their MMR system. I think they have released 4 chapters now, or more, since the promise of MMR. What are their priorities? Sales, not decent gameplay.\n\nPlaying well and killing survivors too quickly WILL result in your rank going down. You are not allowed to kill them quickly if you want to rank up. You are supposed to \"play\" with them and give them chances. \n\nTrouble with that is that at high rank you dont even get that many chances to throw people on the meathook. So the actual playing of the game is counter to what the requirements are to rank up. Its a bad system. \n\nOn top of that the rift challenges open games up to all sorts of sillyness. People start off the game with the rift challenge in mind and not to get out. So they wont do gens needed to open the door as the challenge demands that they do 3 pallet slams with X character to get the reward. And this is game after game after game you get this crap. Solo player experience in this game is bad. All you do is die over and voer again while getting out maybe 1 in 10. If the others dont farm you first.\n\nHackers are all over this game. Same with cheaters that use voice coms in a game where you are not meant to use it. Teleportation hacks. Invincibility hacks.Does not stop them though as the easy anti cheat does not catch it.\n\nSolo player? Good luck. They buffed the killers to be able to deal with a 4 person crew using coms so solo que people get the shaft. Time and time again.\n\nAvoid this garbage at all costs. To even be able to be semi competitive you will NEED all DLC perks unless you are able to predict with %90 accuracy how people will react and move around the map. Have the 75 pounds, dollars, yen spare on top of the price of the game itself for all the DLC?\n\nDevs are incapable of balancing this game. Devs are incapable of fixing bugs that are left in and then called a feature later on.\n\nBugs are plenty. Sound bugs. Cant hear people you have slugged when they dont have a noise suppression perk. Cant heal people as the prompt wont show up. Characters get stuck on environmental objects. Perks randomly just dont work. Perks you dont even have equpped are granted to you. Aura's of players are shown with no perks. Sound bugs. Killer bugs are left to rot and stay put for years. But god forbid one of the most used surv perks gets bugged and made unusable. That will get fixed in a week.\n\nAt every step of the game you will face frustration. In your first game as surv they will pit you against a fully perked killer with 1000's of hours. As killer you will face fully perked surv's also with 1000's of hours that will run circles around you. This is intentional. Dev's have stated that they want you to feel frustrated and powerless. Dont like it? The dev's recommend you play something else. So do i.\n\nThere is practically nothing the killer can do when facing a 4 person voice com using squad that is halfway competent. Voice coms gives them so much info on where the killer is and what is he doing the other 3 can work on their objectives half asleep while holding mouse 1 button on a generator. Since you need to hook a person three times to kill them that means 3 chases and 3 hooks. They will just trade people on the hooks so you will get the hooks but never enough on one person to get the kill. This is how you can lose the game. \n\nSurvs have far too many second chance perks and things to waste your time. As killer you will spend most of your games literally running in circles around pallets and objects in the game. In circles my friends. Round and round. Sound like fun?\n\nJust avoid this garbage. Seriously. Dont get the game thinking you are going to be a badass killer. You are not. And killers are mostly there to provide survs with points the higher you go in rank.\n\nDont even think that this game is a hide and seek game either. That was 4 years ago. Since then they removed all ability to hide and intrduced tons of perks that give away your position. This is a running in circles sim.\n\nI only pop in now and then to see what this garbage has turned into.

Why not have servers setup for proper hosting and to allow EVERYONE who plays this game the ability to enjoy it with or without their friends and without the worry of being the only one disconnected and loosing valuable offerings.","timestamp_created":1481408708,"timestamp_updated":1481408708,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28297892","author":{"steamid":"76561198027253114","num_games_owned":493,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":976,"last_played":1572116268},"language":"english","review":"i think for a 4v1 this game is pretty fun and exciting!","timestamp_created":1481407913,"timestamp_updated":1481407913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28297414","author":{"steamid":"76561198003437857","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4765,"last_played":1625923360},"language":"koreana","review":"아직도 어떻게 하는지 모름","timestamp_created":1481406262,"timestamp_updated":1481422229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28297099","author":{"steamid":"76561198066366587","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":77343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":269,"playtime_at_review":26222,"last_played":1660577464},"language":"german","review":"this game sucks\n\nSee you in the fog!","timestamp_created":1481405234,"timestamp_updated":1484071928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501127839088439941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28297052","author":{"steamid":"76561198046378755","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2116,"last_played":1525484707},"language":"english","review":"Release practically unfinished game with progression breaking bugs and charge buyers for content that should have came with release.
