I have achieved the top known as \"Red ranks\" on both survivor and killer.\n\nIt's a horrible game don't waste your money. I'm not talking about the 20 dollars you have to pay for this incredibly buggy imbalanced game. I'm talking about extra money you have to pay for to get the best \"perks\" from other characters you don't even want to play to have remotely any fun in the game. The game is severely survivor sided if the survivors are friends playing together communicating on discord (which they normally are at higher ranks), and even when they're not if they know they're doing unless you're playing spirit, ghostface, (pay to play characters) or nurse (which is free, but in my opinion is very boring to play and the animations make me motion sick) you will lose. The objectives for survivors are too easy, and the ranking requirements for a killer are so incredibly demanding if not downright poorly designed. Most killers are punished for using their abilities in the ranking systems, and survivors have to do very little to rank up even if they end up dying its normally very easy. From a survivors perspective the game can be very frustrating expecially at lower ranks. A lot of the time if you're a skilled player you can do so well that you wont rank up because the killer didn't do well enough which doesnt make much sense. If they are relying on endgame perks or things that kill you instantly for examples (No one escapes death, or a mori) you will derank even if you worked very hard that game. (The killer will as well, because they are poorly designed items) You either get players who don't take the time to learn the game and sabotage your team or players who have been playing extremely long and are incredibly toxic to the killer and or teamates (who are all human beings).

It is horrible to start, and is \"supposed to be better later.\" You then seem to have to force yourself to enjoy the pain, and all of the crap that comes with it. I get the premise, and that at the core its the players that make it what is is and isn't, but there are so many things that just make it unfun. Friends will probably keep trying to get me to play some more, but I really don't recommend purchasing it for someone else. Starting out is very annoying, worse than games' startups.\n\nOh, and do the tutorial for both killer and survivor for 50k blood points. Will get you kind of started, I guess, since you didn't heed my advise.\n\nedit -\nI played the game some more. Don't queue up with friends initially, as it'll put you against people that play the game better. Start out on your own early on. Play a little of both the killer and a survivor, to get a better idea of how things work out. Every 13th the ladder resets, so be aware that better players will be ranked down at that time. \n\nSurvivor - Focus on repairing generators, and recovering people from hooks as you can. Try using Bond or Empathy from Dwight/Claudette so you can see where other survivors are on the map. Walking and sprinting leave scratch marks, which helps a killer find you. You can crouch down to walk to prevent the scratch marks.  Some killers have perks that will reveal you when they hook a survivor or knock one down. If you start hearing the killer's heartbeat shortly after someone is hooked, assume they have such perk. You can hide in a locker before someone is hooked to prevent the killer from seeing you.\n\nKiller - focus on learning the map. Players will try to loop you around obstacles, but ultimately, you control the map. Starting out as a killer was fun for me, but the longer queue times made it a bit harder to get started. I liked how there was more to do in a match as a killer, and how you control what kind of fun other people are having. If you already murdered 3 of the 4 people, you can always choose to let the last person live. Don't do this for tea baggers, though. They deserve to die.","timestamp_created":1571531619,"timestamp_updated":1574222996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55678727","author":{"steamid":"76561198291482795","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":38708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10851,"last_played":1656258042},"language":"german","review":"Pros:\n- gut zum zusammenspielen mit Freunden\n- abwechslungsreiche Killer mit jeweils speziellen Fähigkeiten\n- große Auswahl an erlernbaren Perks für die Überlebenden&Killer\n- Grafik ist schlicht gehalten, dennoch angenehm\n\nCons:\n- teilweise toxische Community\n- teilweise viele Bugs\n- viel Zeit zum grinden benötigt für die Perks\n\nZusammenfassend betrachtet eine Hassliebe, die mehr zur Liebe tendiert.

If I had to sum things up, the Dead by Daylight community is like one big overly competitive family that’s constantly trying to one-up each other while everything burns down around them. The game itself is crumbling beneath the weight of the devs overly ambitious ideas and you’re just left with a product that was full of potential but unfortunately is now going nowhere fast. \n\nThe gameplay itself is far from complex. If you’re a survivor your job is to loop the killer, do generators, save your teammates and escape. If you’re a killer, your job is to stall gen progression and kill everyone before they get out. It’s easy to play and get the hang of despite how impossible it might feel to hit skill checks or catch more than one person at first. The gameplay may sound basic as hell, but it’s extremely addicting. There’s nothing quite like it with as big a player base. Anything that could compete dies fast or suffers from severe game-breaking issues that the devs take too long to fix.\n\n                                          Now let’s get into why I can’t stand this game.\n                                                                          •   •   •   •\nIn a game reliant on hitboxes, the hitboxes are f*cked. Some killers are worse than others, and you’ll find yourself asking, “How did that hit!?” 99% of the time. Freddy’s lunge is ridiculous, and the devs need to either fix the Huntress or remove her altogether if they can’t code a hatchet hitbox properly. Honestly, the drop in Billy and Huntress mains would be so drastic if air didn’t count as your player. The window you vaulted? Yea doesn’t matter. Little did you know that window sill is now a part of you, and if the killer whacks it you’re taking a hit. You might be playing the skinniest character in the game but she’s actually more “thicc” than Jane and Clown combined. Dedicated servers were meant to be the ultimate fix to this, but it’s just made things worse.\n\nAnother issue would be “gen rushing”. Which is essentially all of the generators in the game going by too quickly and survivors escaping in five minutes, when it takes almost twenty sometimes for a killer to even find a match. Now, I’m not about to be an idiot and cry about people being “toxic” for doing the only objective in the game but it is a bit of an issue. While there are ways to slow this down and stall things drastically, it requires luck, idiots, OP addons, or a combination of all three. Even then, you still might see three generators pop before you down one guy.\n                                                                          •   •   •   •\nWhich leads me to say that balance, in general, is a problem. Some killers simply aren’t played because it doesn’t matter what you have or what map you’re on, you’re still in for a hard time unless you play unfairly. Killers rely heavily on addons and offerings to help tip the scales in their favor, however, this can result in unfair gameplay. Now, I’m all for getting rid of flashlight and insta meds if it means ebony mori gets a rework. Because both are unfair. I understand how long chases can go on, and when you finally down a guy only for him to be fully healed a second later it's frustrating as hell. However, ebony mori can take you out of the game in seconds. All it takes is being hooked once and the killer can kill you, which sucks because they typically camp your hook and wait for that moment to come. Usually, this just results in players leaving the match when they realize what’s happening.\n\nGenerally, however, people being AFK or DC-ing is extremely common in this game, I’m not even going to go too in-depth on this. All I’ll say is, to the AFK-ers: don’t launch the game if you’re not going to play it. Don’t get mad when the killer targets and hooks you first either and then proceed to dc or kill yourself because, “How dare they target me, the useless one!” As far as DC-ing goes, I get it, on both sides. It’s largely because of the MM and general balance issues. Killers are tired of toxic smurfs, flashlights, t-baggers, and SWF who put in Haddonfield offerings. Survivors are tired of being tunneled/camped out while their teammates do nothing, or they simply dislike the killer or offering. While DCs are technically kind of punished, the people still in the game are punished more than the people who left. Recently, however, many are unintended and just kick you out of the game for no real reason, which is one of the few bugs that come with dedicated servers. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems that with each patch that comes, new bugs stack on the previous because the devs tend to take forever to fix things, or they break more stuff in the process. Currently, we have survivors becoming sonic after getting smacked by the killer. How do you fix this? Lose the game and let the killer hook you or else you risk being accused of hacking. Myers is getting perma tier 3 without the addons or stalking. DS sometimes doesn’t work, or it gives you a second chance if you miss it the first time. Why is Dead Hard even still a perk at this rate? It’s been broken since the day I was born. Plague gets stuck sometimes and can’t vomit, Ghost face either can’t be revealed or gets revealed through pallets and trees. If two survivors have the same name when you hook one the status bar will go to the other. It’s ridiculous.\n                                                                          •   •   •   •\nFinally, DbD just gets stale. It’s the same game mode repeatedly. Events are nothing special and don’t add much of anything. Double BP, Moonrise, Summer BBQ, it’s all the same thing just with some nice décor and one extra meaningless objective like grab a lantern on your way out or do this special generator in particular. It’s just boring and uninspired. \n\nThis game is broken, buggy, and horribly unbalanced. No matter how many hours you see people clock into this one, I promise that your time and money are better spent elsewhere. This is one of the few games I’ve played that punishes you for being good and rewards you for being bad. Since the devs like to prioritize skins and licensed killers over a working game, I’d like to recommend the new killer they release to be themselves. Dead by daylight is dying, and with every new character they release they kill the game more.","timestamp_created":1571503568,"timestamp_updated":1571611515,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":416,"votes_funny":70,"weighted_vote_score":"0.746454298496246338","comment_count":132,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55673069","author":{"steamid":"76561198974108154","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49,"last_played":1599498474},"language":"russian","review":"top like onelove","timestamp_created":1571503460,"timestamp_updated":1571503460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55672796","author":{"steamid":"76561198006642205","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1571501587},"language":"english","review":"The game principle is fun - but it is horribly optimised.
