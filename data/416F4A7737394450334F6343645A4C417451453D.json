I got it under the recomendation of friends, waiting 4 months to finally play it for 2 hours to only find out the following:\n\n1. The game is horribly made and too damn loud. I turn my settings in game, out of game, and set set down to singal digits for me to just be able to tollerate how unberably loud this game is. \n2. any and all items I had that made the game remotely playable and somewhat fair, were all items I had to win and pay for. I can be fine with that, if it were not for the fact that the killers which you can just buy and get stuff with, were just always going to be better regardless of what I had or was sharing even in a custom game with people saying they were going easy on me.\n3. How annoying the display/ alert system is. I know its a horror game and all no game should be this furstating to play with the stupid alerts to have you do something appearing and then only giving you milleseconds to respond before you get damaged, are damaged, etc, etc.\n4. The killers are WAY too fast. Even with super rare speed perks and the killers having none, and holding my sprint key I was constantly dying because I could not get away fast enough to avoid anything.\n5. If I filled a bar and did something, that means it is done. Multiple times I struggled out of a Killer's grasp when I was being carried to a hook only to not get freed and was still hooked, and again even with perks to get myself all of the hook all attempts to get off of them resulted in me dying faster.\nI cannot express this enough, this is the WORST GAME ever to be made. I dont wanna pay money to play a game that if I want to even do SLIGHTLY BETTER I have to shell out even more cash to get it because game designers cannot make a balanced game and give it so you for free. These micro-transactions to give you new killers and perks that make you better as a player, and the only way you can be as good as them is to also pay for that is bad game design, and bad for players.  If any people who made this game are reading this, you should honestly be ashamed you made such a terrible game.

The game has had some real issues but they have been getting better and they are being worked on all the time. The biggest issue really is the community, and that's not something the devs can actually do anything about, that's something WE as the community are responsible for. \n\nWe have to encourage each other to be better and stop being so fucking whiny. Killer mains, play some survivor, see that side and see just how it is to be tunneled and camped. Survivor mains, play some killer, see that side and just how it is to have someone intentionally try to piss you off, switch to purple flashlights at the last second etc. Both the killer and survivor mains are biased and won't see to reason, but those are actually more a loud minority in my experience. Most of the community really isn't like that, most killers I face are fair and realize that the game is supposed to be fun for all of us. Most survivors I face don't teabag and click a flashlight at me every chance they get.\n\nBan Ochido from the consol version plz lmao\n\nEDIT: okay so first two games after writing this review and both the killers were shitheads... like, a Spirit camping me and the other survivor to no end when we had one gen fixed and two people rage quit, so no hatch even spawned and she.....
