We are changing the meta constantly now!! And changed how rank works!!\"[/b]\n\nIts a clear sign that the devs are not on the same page, and the players are not on the same page with the devs. Because we don't know what they're trying to do now, nor their goals with DbD. \n\n\nNow I love DbD, I have been playing it for a couple years now. Its by no means a BAD game. Its just being poorly handled imo. \n\nThe gameplay is solid, the gameplay loop is fun if you're just wanting to play this casually. \n\nNow where this all falls apart is when your Elo goes up even just a notch, you get matched with people who JUST WANNA WIN, and don't want a fun chase, they don't want a fun match. They will D/C and kill themselves on hook if they don't like the killer you're playing or going against. There isn't a slow climb to this elo, its legit after 3 good matches you get thrown into with people who have thousands and thousands of hours, and if they lose to you its the end of their life. \n\n\nThose are my gripes with the current state of the game, the game play is fine, the game isn't a buggy mess or unplayable.

Before I continue, note that 90% of my playtime was done as Survivor. \n\nLet me start with the pros to this game. If you are looking for a game you can sink countless hours into to leveling up all your characters and collect all teachables, then there will always be something for you to do, cause even after 600 hours I don't have all my killers to level 40 yet. \n\nThis game as survivor is easy to play, hard to master. The game for killer is hard to play, hard to master.\nThe game is constantly updated with new DLC and new cosmetics and also more recently with the Rift. New DLC is released every 3 months with one hotfix released about halfway between chapters. So the game doesn't stale very easily. There are so many perks that you can form into any build of your playstyle. The addition of crossplay has also been great.\n\nNow I know that wasn't many pros. Now for the cons...\n\nI don't even know where to start. The servers are very questionable. Killer hit detection has been a problem since the game has been out. The community is pretty toxic, every endgame chat is filled with it. Remember what I said about the game not getting stale? thats until you get your preferred roles characters perks all teachable, which at that point you should be red ranks. And at red ranks its just a sweat fest. It's hard to do any \"fun\" kind of build that doesn't include Meta Perks. The game is also pretty unreliable as a solo survivor. Once you get to that point of the game, there isn't much to do when a rift isn't around. The game experience also heavily relies on how the killer plays. Your match could be very unfun if the killer decides facecamp or tunnel the survivor off hook. That being said, it could also be very unfun for a killer to go against a 4 man SWF with one running Object of Obsession and the rest running DS Unbreakable and Dead Hard. Now recently the devs have announced changes to those very strong perks. So hopefully that makes things better.\n\nLike I started with this review, this game is very much love hate. That being said I do recommend it.  The idea of the game is very cool with licensed characters such as Micheal Myers and Freddy Krueger. The game is very exciting but not so much scary as it becomes more of a competitive game than a horror game. Which isn't a bad thing. This game is much better played with friends. If you would rather torture yourself and stress yourself to the max as killer, go for it. If you become a great killer though, it is indeed something to brag about.

Teammates are toxic and not even playing the game at all.\nMatchmaking takes forever if not the hitboxes are broken and everyone takes advantage of it by playing killer.\nToday I played about....30 Matches and I counted how many matches were toxic and how many were okay/friendly.\nThere were TWO matches who were good and friendly (winning not included)\nIn all the other games we had this one survivor who like 80% of the time kill themselfs instantly on hook if the killer catches them first or they farm you on hook in front of the killer for points and don't give a fuck about others or on how to play the game.\n\nThe MATCHMAKING IS A BIG JOKE\nIt normally takes FOREVER. The average time I waited the last weeks to get a match (during day, not nighttime) was around 10 to 15 MINUTES.\nWhile waiting in queue you're able to cook a whole meal. Maybe showering,\nbaking a cake, making pizza! \n\nAnother issue is the leveling.\nI made two level ups but instead of leveling UP I lost TWO ranks.\nHow is a bug like this even possible?\nEven though I won a lot of points to rank up there isn't anything happening making it even more frustrating to play.\n\nMost of the other games where survivors weren't the problem the killer will flame us because buggy lags  or other bugs.\nIf you play this game in the state it is NOW. YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT YOU DONT HAVE ANY RIGHTS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS BULLSHIT. Survivors aren't the cause of it. In the same game who he lagged ONCE we got hit through walls, paletts, WHOLE CARS and other stuff and won't even complain towards the killer because we don't even give him the fault. It's the developers. Toxic people everywhere. I mean they are in every game but fucking don't blame us for trying to enjoy this game even though there are MANY game breaking bugs.\nDead by daylight has bugs that are here with us since the RELEASE!!!!!!!! <- WHEN WILL THEY EVER FIX IT\n\nBut right now the game is in a position where I think I can't recommend the game for any players. You will get frustrated easily or randoms will flame you because they got out of bed with the wrong foot first.\nAlso you will get stuck in so many corners of the map. Or get hit over large distances /through walls/ cars because the hitboxes are broken. HOW CAN SUCH IMPORTANT FEATURES NOT GET HOTFIXED???\nLeaving the game almost unable to enjoy for almost a week now? Instead they change animations or other stuff thats not as important as making the game playable.\n\nThe events are for the RICH BITCHES OUT THERE. Pay money for the good and pretty/cool stuff or earn like the most shittiest and ugliest item you can get. For a survivor you don't even play. Oh and some charms who aren't even worth playing for. DO THE DEVELOPERS EVEN CARE FOR THE GAME ANYMORE OR ARE THEY JUST LINGERING AROUND FOR GRABBING CASH OUT OF THIS GAME? \n\n The developers don't even care about the complaints of the community EVER. The new HUD will be changed just because most of the people left bad reviews about the game. Most bugs won't get fixed for months or years even though the developers are most likely aware of them.\n\nEvery new patch destroys the game and makes it sometimes unplayable bringing back old bugs.
