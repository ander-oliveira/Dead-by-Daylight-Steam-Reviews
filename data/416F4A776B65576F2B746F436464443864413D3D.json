(Chamarei de Survivors e Killer daqui pra frente)\n\nO objetivo dos survivors é fazer 5 geradores que estão espalhados pelo mapa, abrir o portão e fugir sem ser pego pelo Killer, muito simples, certo? Errado! \n\nApesar do objetivo parecer simples, na prática é difícil, o Killer o tempo todo vai ficar enchendo seu saco, correndo atrás de você e dos seus amigos e colocando vocês no gancho, pra salvar seus amigos, você deve parar o que está fazendo, e o Killer pode quebrar o gerador que você estava fazendo enquanto você está fora. Você até pode deixar seu amigo morrer, mas as coisas vão ficar piores, acredite. Dead by Daylight depende muito de trabalho em equipe para que tudo dê certo.\n\nDo outro lado, temos o Killer, cujo objetivo é matar todos os 4 survivors e não deixar eles fazerem os geradores, também parece simples, mas nada fácil, afinal, você está sozinho contra 4 jogadores num mapa razoavelmente grande. E se os survivos forem amigos com comunicação, aí as coisas só pioram pra você, Killer.\n\nA princípio jogar de assassino é bem difícil, demora um pouco pra pegar o jeito e com certeza você vai se sentir humilhado algumas vezes quando os 4 sobreviventes fugirem sem você matar nenhum, mas acontece. Eu particularmente jogo muito mais de Killer do que de survivor e posso dizer, aprender a jogar bem de Killer é um saco!\n\nO sistema do jogo é bem simples de entender, temos uma diversidade grande de sobreviventes e killers disponíveis, sendo que cada um tem uma habilidade diferente, então, pra aprender todos demora um tempo. \n\nDead by Daylight também tem um sistema de Ranks, onde você começa no rank 20 e pode subir até o rank 1. Porém, de mês em mês os ranks resetam, ou seja, você terá que subir de novo se quiser se manter no topo. O que pode ser um pouco complicado, já que como eu disse anteriormente, você precisa de um bom time, se seu time for ruim, você consequentemente não terá uma boa pontuação e pode até cair do seu rank atual. Do lado do Killer, se os 4 sobreviventes forem muito bons e todos fugirem, você não vai ter pontos o suficiente para manter ou subir seu rank.\n\nO sistema de skills de Dead by Daylight é interessante por suas ensináveis, como eu disse, cada personagem tem uma habilidade, e quando você chega num nível alto com um deles, você pode ensinar as habilidades para outros, assim você pode montar um personagem só com várias skills de outros, e claro, fazendo sua própria build de acordo com seu modo de jogo. \n\nAlguns personagens são liberados por dlc, porém não acho isso um grande problema sendo que os personagens são bem balanceados, então, nada de pay to win. \n\nApesar de ser um excelente jogo, Dead by Daylight tem um grande problema: a comunidade. Os jogadores de dbd são extremamente tóxicos e isso irrita muito. Várias vezes aconteceu comigo de quando estava jogando de killer e matar todos os sobreviventes, vir alguém e me xingar no meu perfil da steam, mas isso é de menos. \n\nO maior problema dos jogadores tóxicos não são os xingamentos, e sim suas ações no jogo, desconectando da partida por exemplo. Assim, o Killer não ganha os pontos que deveria por matar o cara, e atrapalha muito o time dele porque estão com um a menos. É ridículo o comportamento da maioria dos jogadores desse jogo, não só na steam, mas também no PS4 e no Xbox.\n\nNo geral Dead by Daylight é incrível, porém, eu recomendo que você comece a jogar com um amigo, porque como eu disse, a comunidade é ridícula, mas não deixe de jogar apenas por isso, Dead by Daylight é excelente e com certeza vale a pena..","timestamp_created":1490304677,"timestamp_updated":1575141903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30692628","author":{"steamid":"76561198140279207","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":14941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8389,"last_played":1573506449},"language":"english","review":"Bought it to play with my brother. Purchased and downloaded the game. Queued for 20 minutes to get into a game. Game force-closed on my brothers computer. I quit out, and now I'm heading for a refund. \n\nGG. WP. Wait times and game stability scared me at least.\n\n********************************EDIT*******************************************\n\nOkay! I have rebought this game after several months.. Well that's a lie. The bitter taste left from my previous experience kind of made me want shred my SSD as I installed this game, but I waited. I was told the game was better and that every issue with the game had been solved.\n\nWell. I have to say the game (FINALLY GOD DAMN FUNCTIONAL) actually works pretty well. You can use several different approached to the game and enjoy gameplay by yourself or with friends. I personally have no tendency towards either as it's now really fun to play both.\n\nTHE WORST CURRENT THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE CAMPERS. THESE ARE THE GAMES WORST ATTROCITY. However it happens less recently so maybe they're addressing the issue. \n\nTL;DR NOW ACTUALLY PLAYABLE AND REALLY GOOD GAME. EXCITING. YOU'LL PROBABLY S!!T YOURSELF AGAINST MYERS.\n\n***************************************************************************************************************\n\n                                     NEW REVIEW 02/10/2017\nOkay, so leaving my third review for this game so far, a lot of mechanics have been changed and there's be a whole lot of improvements made. \n\nIn my opinion the game now has become unplayable again. \n\nI would understand if it was down to my computer, but I'm fairly sure it's not. I'm using a I7 7700k with watercooling, 1070 overclocked and have a tested build that can download a stream of data at 50-75 mbps. This isn't an issue of my computer can't handle it. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's look at what's wrong *CURRENTLY*. \n\nThere is an imbalance towards the killers favour now, however that's nothing to complain about, I get the logic the devs are going for. They want there to be two survivers and two killed survivers in each game. That's cool it adds to the game, make it more competitive, maybe it's been taken a bit too far in some cases (leatherface is frankly too OP and they need nerfing), but hey ever game has an OP character.\n\nNow that isn't what has made the game unplayable now in my opinion.\n\nWhat made the game unplayable in my opinion is the fact that the game couples you with people from all over the world, nothing inherently wrong with this, but after a few days of playing the game, I literally cannot play the game because I'm rubber-banding (pinging on the screen all over the place) because I have a 500 ping average for each game that I'm being put into. 90% of the killers I'm facing are from Russia / some other far away country, again nothing wrong with that, I truly do not mind it at all. But if I'm dying from jumping half way across the map when I'm fixing a generator or opening an exit gate and still having heavy heart beat despite the fact the killer just hooked someone from the other side of the map, something is seriously, seriously wrong with the game. If you need to make it so that UK players face UK players and American players face American players, do it. People would rather wait 5 minutes longer in a queue than play with 500-700 ping...\n\nI will still recommend this game, but if this isn't fixed soon I'm changing to negative. \n**************************************************************************************************************","timestamp_created":1490302341,"timestamp_updated":1506899749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50040745735168457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30692577","author":{"steamid":"76561198330905497","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":40358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":116,"playtime_at_review":16339,"last_played":1660416664},"language":"english","review":"Fun game but sometimes it does take some time to get into a match and there are some glitches here and there but altogether it's a good game","timestamp_created":1490302162,"timestamp_updated":1494777490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543726265430450439","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30692565","author":{"steamid":"76561198009506093","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2671,"last_played":1561840962},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful lobby.\n\nEdit:\n\nChanged to positive.

Survive with friends was fairly stable until the patch, then it became difficult to play at all as a survivor. Also, I experience freezing after the patch that wasn't occuring before. It is just a major pain to pay money and to like the game, when you can't get it to work, to have all these issues and them not be fixed for so long now.

You can play as the killer who needs to kill survivors and put them on meathooks or you can play as a survivor who needs to repair generators across the map so you can escape true the exitdoors. You have different characters with different perks and abilities.\n\nLet's start with the positive things.\nThe idea and how they made it is very good and I think that killer and survivor are balanced.\nIn the beginning the killer had to op perks (machinegun build) and survivor could use infinites but they fixed most of that which is pretty good. It's a very fun game for players who play alone or with friends. The bloodweb-system makes the game also interesting and makes you grind for bloodpoints so you can upgrade your character and unlock different perks, items, ...\n\nNegative things...\nThe matchmaking is still broken if you play \"survive with friends\". How more friends you play with, how longer it takes to find a lobby and get in a game. Once I had to wait an hour to play a survive with friends game. If you play solo the matchmaking works most of the time fine. And if you play as killer it takes around 5 minutes to get in a game.\nWhat they also need to fix is good servers. As many people know the killer hosts the game and if the killer has bad connection your whole game is ruined. The game has also a lot and I mean a lot... of bugs. I was just playing a chill game as a survivor and out of nowhere I get stuck in a three or I glitch in the ground OR my perks don't work. There were some bigger, game breaking bugs before but the devs fixed it. But still... it seems like every little update they do adds 20 new bugs into the game.\n\nMy conclution is: It's a very fun and addictive game but the devs need to keep fixing those bugs. They allready did a great job so I think this game is going to get bigger. I recommend this game for everyone even if you're not a horror player this game is still fun to play. You can try it out when there is a free weekend.

People will block you for doing scummy stuff. Community is becomming very toxic, everyone complains theres too many bugs, not a crazy amount of DLC, and as of today (3/22/17) the game piggybacks Steam for its matchmaking. This makes killers the host of the game so beware of region hoppers and bad ping. Playing with friends at any other time than midday is kind of a nightmare. Once the console port releases there will be dedicated servers, which in turn will fix Survive with Friends queue times. Small dev team does equal more time for updates. Overall the expereince ive had is a great one and i still love it. If you dont have patience, or have a temper, this isn't the game for you. If you can solo queue or stand waiting for a bit with a friend, totally worth.
