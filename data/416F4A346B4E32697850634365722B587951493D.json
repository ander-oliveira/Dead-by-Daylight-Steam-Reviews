I had high hopes when nice features like crossplay became a thing... nowadays its one questionable choice after the other. An atrocious HUD redesign makes finding things on the screen a chore- information is scattered all over the place. Previously timegated cosmetics that you had to grind for were given out to all players but in its place new \"limited\" cosmetics were added. The old double bloodpoint events are very rare these times. And if they happen, you only get x1.5 bloodpoints. Why are the devs so stingy when it comes to giving out bloodpoints? The amount of bloodpoints you used to get cant be compared to the game right now since so much new stuff has been added. Bloodpooints are capped to 1 million for no reason. You cant even properly prepare for a new chapter with these limitations. Grinding to unlock the perks and then leveling up every character to actually play them is way to tedious/borderline a mini-job with all the new characters. The developers in itself are another thing that limits this game pretty hard. Over all the years and with all the money they got from paid dlcs Dead By Daylight still only has ONE gamemode. One of the game designers (that shall be unnamed but look it up) said on his streams that very obviously overpowered perks are no problem meanwhile we cant have colourblind mode because it would give an unfair advantage. They backpedaled on this after a big community backlash but its super obvious that they balance the game purely on their on \"feelings\" (some devs have very poor gamesense) or raw statistics without acknowledging whats going on in the background or whenever the community is finally tilted enough to make some noise. Balance changes for perks that desperately need it happen way to rarely. Most of the time only a few numbers get changed anyway, why do only like 5 perks get changed each patch. Im not even calling for them to shake up the meta, just please for the love of god make some shitty perks a little less shitty. The new survivor movement looks ugly. Some killers still hit you all the way from India through windows. There are no new halloween or christmas events. Loading times for survivors makes me grow a beard. But no, rather nerf pig or add a scream and an overheat bar to billy amirite gamers? As long as sheeps buy the new \"content\" aka skins from them this will keep on happening. At this point the game is straight up downgrading and I feel sorry for all the content creators that have to stick with this burning mess because they need to pay rent.\nThe only thing I really like is that each map gets a little more uniquely with new designs.

First thing is bugs like pallets being dropped on killer but he still hits you and then he gets the stun or hitting someone through textures. Second thing are killers and I mean mostly the way how some of them play. You can meet in most matches a killer that after hooking you decided to camp next to you all the time or just go only after you in match and after killing you, he decided to hunt another - only one person. Killers are so annoying that even if someone is closer to the killer he will still go for you because he knows you are closer to dying.

The 4.50 update has completely ruined the game, terrible animations updates, lack of pallets in most new map updates leaving big empty areas of next to nothing. Not to mention the absolutely, not asked for HUD update that turns the game into what once felt not cluttered, to in your face all the time. A simple compromise to would have been to leave the old HUD as a choice and then see what most players choose. The Devs refuse to yet again listen to their player base and continue to update the game in a direction that continues to stem negativity. It's hard to ask for a positive community when this is what you get.\n\nUpdate: Verison 4.70, this patch has improved the game greatly, the map update was also quite nice compared to previous ones. The player animations have improved and perk changes have been a nice balance to making games feel pretty even sided. I do wish they would fix some of the pallet balancing that is still an issue, where it's either complete deadzones (Autohaven) or way to many pallets (The Game). Overall they're going in positive direction, just please no more K-POP/Anime killers.","timestamp_created":1612906533,"timestamp_updated":1620412069,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546486794948577881","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86295658","author":{"steamid":"76561198078012196","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":101308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1457,"playtime_at_review":73314,"last_played":1660602726},"language":"brazilian","review":"Viciante.","timestamp_created":1612906376,"timestamp_updated":1612906376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86295607","author":{"steamid":"76561199077753328","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3694,"last_played":1650907058},"language":"english","review":"Poopy Poopy shit shit.\n","timestamp_created":1612906292,"timestamp_updated":1612906292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86295606","author":{"steamid":"76561198830053353","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":49927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":130,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1659962317},"language":"german","review":"Super game.","timestamp_created":1612906290,"timestamp_updated":1612906290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86295572","author":{"steamid":"76561198018141378","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":79129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":411,"playtime_at_review":52283,"last_played":1660012251},"language":"english","review":"New UI and Animations are thrash.

Alle anderen Spiele sind davon unberührt, also was auch immer da gemacht wurde irgendwas läuft hier schief. Ich hab den Fehlerbericht schon mehrfach jetzt an Dead by Daylight gesendet, gibt ja dafür ne nette Funktion sobald es Abstürzt. Die UI für den Zuschauer Modus ist sehr unschön, denn jetzt muss man sich merken wieviele Survivor schon angeharkt waren und wie oft früher konnte man es sehen im Zuschauer Modus. Jetzt tappt man hier leider im Dunkeln. Bitte die Alte UI für den Zuschauer Modus wieder einbauen und die Bugs fixen dann ist alles wieder Topp. ;)\n\nUm mal kurz meine Hardware Details zu nennen :\nProzessor: Intel i7 auf 4,12 GHz \nArbeitsspeicher: 32 GB \nFestplatte: 250 SSD \nGrafikkarte: Geforce GTX 1070 Palit GameRock Premium Edition","timestamp_created":1612904002,"timestamp_updated":1624185962,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86293824","author":{"steamid":"76561198795625809","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":28086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5154,"last_played":1641192186},"language":"english","review":"this game is awesome","timestamp_created":1612903976,"timestamp_updated":1612903976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86293793","author":{"steamid":"76561197993796215","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":70977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":104,"playtime_at_review":51577,"last_played":1659805749},"language":"english","review":"The game is good, but the last patch just ruined while UI, now you need to have frog eyes to play it on a big screen","timestamp_created":1612903947,"timestamp_updated":1612903947,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470564365386962891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86293776","author":{"steamid":"76561199123202247","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":10,"playtime_at_review":1717,"last_played":1659552681},"language":"english","review":"u","timestamp_created":1612903924,"timestamp_updated":1612903924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86293668","author":{"steamid":"76561198775531277","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":53244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30495,"last_played":1659011735},"language":"czech","review":"rip old movement and now stretch res\n\nfy behaviour )","timestamp_created":1612903779,"timestamp_updated":1646776769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86293641","author":{"steamid":"76561199022974319","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3642,"last_played":1650225744},"language":"polish","review":"super gra, lubie jak umieram","timestamp_created":1612903738,"timestamp_updated":1612903738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86293549","author":{"steamid":"76561198124963476","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20347,"last_played":1649019314},"language":"english","review":"As of today, February 9th this game has received an insanely huge downgrade due to these horrendous animations as well as the mobile game UI that they added.
