It should not have left open beta. I do have a lot of time logged into it, but that's because I play with friends in private lobby's. It sucks that there's no way to play with friends in public lobby's as you get no rewards. \n\nThe game is also super buggy. We've had issues multiple times where people will load into the game as a T-Pose of a killer and their survivor model and it takes almost twenty minutes to load in. The killer then can't do anything to them because they're just a t-pose.\n\n\nEdit: So, I posted this review four years ago. I now enjoy the game quite a bit. I enjoy the game now and have several hours in it.

I have a lot of high hopes for this game, but there are A LOT of glitches. For example, sometimes the first time you get put on a hook, it's an instant kill, sometimes it takes several times on the hook to kill you. Sometimes the killer is nowhere near you and swings in the opposite direction of you and it magically hits you. Etc.\n\nIt would also be nice if the developers would make it so the killer has to be so far away from a person on a hook for the hook to drain life. Too often do killers just sit there and watch you on the hook without moving. It eventually makes the gameplay such that once you are hooked, your teammates just leave you and move on themselves because the killer is just camping next to you on the hook.","timestamp_created":1466565192,"timestamp_updated":1466565192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23697965","author":{"steamid":"76561198023114862","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":75672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2735,"last_played":1625955853},"language":"english","review":"This game will definitely grab you by the boo boo...

And is a very nice idea.\nWhen everything is working as its supposed to both survivors and the killers can have fun.\nCons; \nThe execution of the concept is laking and unbalanced.\nThe game is riddled with bugs both for the survivors and the killers.\nThe game seams to still be in the beta testing and we are the ones testing it for the devs.\nAs the killer you are not playing against survivors of your lvl. As a rank 20 (witch is the base rank you start od as on both sides) You are often stuck playing against players that are not only higher lvl then you but are ranked way higher then you. 1 being the highest rank possible. The same can be said about the killers. as a lvl 1 rank 20 i played against killers way to high lvl and rank then me.\nThe lvl is how you get perks with blood points and the ranks are how good you are considered by the game.\nYou are given more blood points the more you play with the victims, but they tend to escape if they know how to play.And help each other. If you tend to play efficiantly your are penlized by receiving less points. The fact that the killer whipes his blade after every successful hit is frustrating at best and the destabilizing effect of a wooden pallet barely falling on you is infuryating, considering you are a beefy brute that can swipe those said pallets with one foot.\nAll in all id wait for the bugs to get fixed and the balance to be worked out by the devs. \nI personally wanted this game to be good but i consider it ok at best. This is the kind of game i always wanted to play and i love horror movies. But as a survivor the only thing you get to do is fix generators to be able to escape. I wish both the killers and the survivor had other things to do to be able to win. Running around killing is fun for a while but gets boring after a day or two of play.

My thoughts changed rather quickly actually. Here's why: It's really boring if you don't have friends to play with, I mean, matchmaking is good but there's no interaction between the survivors.

Before even getting into a game, you have to deal with generally crappy servers, when you finally manage to get in, be prepared to jump back and fourth while being sling shot around the map. If this isn't infuriating enough, there is the blatent abuse of window hopping as survivers have no other means to combat the psychopath besides attempting to juke him, dodging out of his F.O.V. or spamming window vault until he eventually gives up. The rank system is also broken, the killer can simply just leave the game at the start and because you haven't aquired any score, you instantly lose a rank milestone. The game is in dire need of an overhaul... The concept as a whole is amazing, I haven't had this much fun with a group of friends in forever, this brings another cheif complaint to the table though. There is no way to group up with your friends and join a game. This should have been a core part of gameplay, but it was left out for reasons unbeknownst to me. This leads to people constantly swaping between lobbies in order to play together. This lobby hopping makes finding a game even more infuriating as it already is... Luckily, with the rather large playerbase there is as of now, the wait time to find said game is barley noticable at best. A minor pet peeve of mine, while it does not compare to the other aformentioned problems would be the lack of direction in choosing which survivor to play as. It seems to me that each survive excells at a certian task, medic, teamplayer, engineer, and runner. However, if this was left as an intentional feature, I can respect and admire that as many games have been lacking this sort of \"left on your own\" feeling, leaving you to discover the game as it goes on. A final note on this game would be the many, many, many, maaaaaannny hackers on this game as of now. While I understand that anti cheat systems have been in place since the start, they are near non-existant. Absoulutly nothing is to stop someone from doing the same exact thing that plagues payday, another title this company has released if i'm correct. Importing a save file with every perk and infinite bloodpoints breaks the game allowing the player to have a god-like advantage over any player, be it survivor or killer. This game has much potential, and it may be my bias against this game after having one too many bad games talking. Until balancing issues are fixed, which is understandable as this game was just recently released, I'd give this game a 6-7/10. It can easily be raised to an 8-9 with some work.

They plan on creating a fully fleshed out options menu for us along the way.\n\nBalance:\n\nSimply to say, if the game starts with a lower amount of players than the max then there will be less nessissary generators. Going down to only 2 being required to be turned on. The devs have said they are looking at the ranking system at the moment. But i am hoping they will make a ranked queue myself, so that people can be punished for disconnecting early.\n\nHonestly, this game is alot of fun. But it is incomplete at the moment. If you want a fun experience that will only grow over time (If the devs are being honest) Then get the game while it is on sale. It's a fairly inexpensive game for how much fun you can have killing your friends as the killer or enjoying a bit of running away like a scared child.","timestamp_created":1466548787,"timestamp_updated":1466548912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23694518","author":{"steamid":"76561198043689353","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":22176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1520,"last_played":1651685160},"language":"russian","review":"Я не люблю стелс игры, но эта прям зацепила.

Makes for a bad experience.","timestamp_created":1466540315,"timestamp_updated":1466540315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56951594352722168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23692224","author":{"steamid":"76561198028699790","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4703,"last_played":1613826495},"language":"turkish","review":"Rank 1 oldum, Prestij 3 oldum her perk açık herşey açık, ee ne kaldı geriye ? hiçbişey, oyun başta çok güzel ama sonrasında yapacağınız birşey yok jeneratörü çalıştır kaç bukadar","timestamp_created":1466540058,"timestamp_updated":1466540058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23692189","author":{"steamid":"76561198043492127","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1520039021},"language":"english","review":"Edited as of 11/10/16\n\nI haven't played the game much, not since the first content patch of costumes, simply because the game kept rubbing me the wrong way. But, observing the game through the eyes of other players in their videos or streams as well as looking at discussions on forum threads, I've come to some conclusions and applied my own opinion from my short time of play to them.\n\n1. Neither side truly gets what they want: This game's community is filled with lots of players who only play on one side, which creates tunnel visioned competition, though I cannot bring myself to say they are entirely toxic. A lot of it stems from a meta that each team follows that gets annoying to the opposing team. Surviors complain about hook camping, but killers say it's one of the few times they can actually get points and a valid fishing strategy. Killers complain about infinite juke spots, but survivors say it's one of the few ways to actually escape line of sight. What it essentially boils down to is that neither side is never getting what they want, which has led the devs to introduce very complicated mechanics to try and balance out the cries for changes. Expect salty players should you have a winning streak.\n\n\n2. Killers never really kill: This game names the killer as \"killer\". The tagline very much implies that death is the way to go. It is not the case; you get more points by being a nuisance, a harrasment. You can rank up as a killer by harrassing the crap out of survivors but not killing even one, and yet the screen will say \"Disgraceful Defeat\". It's very unfulfulling, especially since surviros will naturally make it as hard for you as possible (some to the point of being cocky). As for survivors, they don't have this problem at all in the right circumstance. In fact, they get one clear cut objective and all the time in the world if they are never seen (key phrase is \"never seen\"). However, when spotted once, you are essentially down unless you can use the environment to your advantage or if the killer is a novice. Mess up once, and your dead. Don't mess up and the round is stupidly straightforward and clockwork. So, you either get a boring round or a short loss.\n\n\n3. Very unforgiving for the \"not in\" crew: This applies to both killer and survivor. Having a ranking system directly implies that you will be matchmade with someone who will kick your ass, especially when they get perked up and have rare add-ons. This is very unforgiving for new players, as they won't be able to get enough points to rank up due to them being killed quickly or unable to kill quickly, which means they will be stuck at a low rank with no perks or add-ons to aid them in higher level play. And, at this point in the game's life, there aren't many newer, unranked players with no perks, so you'll usually be put into a group that knows what they're doing and you have to learn quickly or be stepped on.\n\n\nFor me, this game kicked me out as soon as I walked in due to its very high standards and skewed expectations. If you've played the game long enough or have a knack for this sort of game, then this will never affect you, because you are already \"in\". A lot of the salt threads in the discussion forums are people dealing with elite players that, sometimes, get elitist, survivor and killer alike. It is harshly competitive, and not something a casual gamer should look into. If you can't handle the competition, don't expect it to ever get easier.","timestamp_created":1466539947,"timestamp_updated":1478833258,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534768581390380859","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23692183","author":{"steamid":"76561197980488316","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1548245625},"language":"swedish","review":"Fix friend lobby pls !

I think this game has immense potential and premise, it's gameplay is surprisingly fun and unique, but the game is going to need lots more work before I think I can recommend it to any of my friends.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Unique gameplay. The gameplay present is fairly unique as far as I know, and it's a decent breath of fresh air.\n- Lots, lots of fun, *most* of the time. Running from a killer and being a killer are both lots of fun.\n- Despite being a repetitive game, it doesn't get very old very fast.\n- Atmospheric. Though the game becomes less scary the more you play it, the sounds of the game and general theme are fairly well designed and the brutality of being a killer and fear or being a survivor is definitely there.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Broken ranking system; ranking is way too hard to achieve, is too harsh, and worst of all, players can \"disconnect\" to protect their rank from falling if they start losing. A disconnecting survivor prevents the killer from getting XP for their kill, while a disconnecting killer robs all of the survivor's from getting any points. The ranking and leveling is extremely broken right now and easily abused.\n\n- Gameplay itself is very unbalanced as is right now and needs a lot of fine tuning. Right now, the survivors are much more powerful than the killer and can endlessly dodge the killer, being impossible to catch. Heavy balancing needs to be done for what are overpowered survivor perks, poorly designed maps, and weak killers.\n\n- Lack of variety. Only one gamemode, no singleplayer, only one way to play the game. Different variations and modes would/will give the game more flavour and longevity.\n\n- There many moments where the game just stops being fun because of certain exploits and gameplay mechanics. Killers camping hooks, and the helplessness of being a survivor, can sometimes get to you and sour the experience. This is more of a thing that will depend on you as a player; it will bother some, won't bother most, so take this into consideration.\n\n- I suspect this game isn't THAT well optimized yet. It's not overly terrible, but frames can spontaneously drop and lower, and the game is surprisingly graphics intensive despite not appearing to be THAT of a demanding game.\n\n---\n\nAs a whole, this game feels like an Early Access Game more than a full-product. Lots of balancing, fine-tuning, improvement in map design, and role tweaking will be needed before a fair and balanced playtime can be claimed. At $21.99 CAD, this game is even priced as an Early Access Game, though I appreciate it's priced at this level. At 20% off ($17.59 CAD), it's probably worth it depending on who you are.\n\nMy suggestion is to give the game a couple weeks or months. The developers have said that they will work on the game post-launch (here's hoping). If it improves, then I will wholeheartedly update my review to a positive, but I just cannot recommend the game for the stage it is in RIGHT NOW. Here's to hoping that updates will come. \n","timestamp_created":1466535379,"timestamp_updated":1466535379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542546391487121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23690611","author":{"steamid":"76561198030485943","num_games_owned":723,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":167989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":143,"playtime_at_review":80227,"last_played":1660076587},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco davvero divertente.
