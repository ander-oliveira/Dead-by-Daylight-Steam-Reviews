Devilishly skillful at the highest level, capable of flipping you between absolute elation and abject despair in the twirl of a hatchet; nothing is as satisfying as a last-gasp escape or a selflessly coordinated hook rescue. \n\nIt's striking just how unique and honestly bizarre the mechanics are, best explained by Keith Stuart: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-27-everything-i-learned-about-game-design-last-year-i-learned-from-dead-by-daylight\n\nWell-maintained and frequently updated competitive multiplayer, despite balance and ranking issues (particularly on the Survivor side, currently being addressed), with weekly dev streams chatting through it all. Highly recommended, dangerously replayable, and often terrifying.","timestamp_created":1530318862,"timestamp_updated":1564193522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43171930","author":{"steamid":"76561198054217596","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1530927223},"language":"japanese","review":"買ったはよいがマッチングしないので一回しか遊べていない。","timestamp_created":1530316306,"timestamp_updated":1530316306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476495474576950073","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43171629","author":{"steamid":"76561198280326994","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10359,"last_played":1653838831},"language":"german","review":"It´s

The best (and my favorite killer) was nerfed to shit and the 1 super OP perk killers NEEDED at the highest levels to even have a chance at winning was nerfed into the ground. As a result no one plays killer anymore constantly resulting in unfair matchups (which was already a problem because your rank gets reset every month, which is WAY too often). At its's current state I cannot reccomend this game to people. The only way to have fun as a killer now is if you were already an experienced killer and just smurf on survivors once every month. And even that can get messy since no one plays killer so you can end up with survivors that are so high ranked you get fucked anyway.

Well it's a sort of love hate relationship. It can be fun don't get me wrong buuut from a technical standpoint it's quite outdated. It's 2020 and the devs still haven't managed to give you proper graphic settings, they just give you their settings which in my opinion is just a shitty thing to do and also performance wise it's also not really that good, granted i don't have the best PC for it which is my fault for not beeing able to afford a good PC but here's the thing that confuses me. My PC can run Destiny 2, a gorgeous game with stunning graphics 60 FPS (30 when there is alot of action going on) no problem, so why does this piece of trash dip in frames everytime i just breathe the same air as another person near me? Again im willing to take part of the blame here for my not so strong PC but if they don't give me proper ways to get it to work then part of the blame goes to them too. Instead of just pumping out DLC after DLC and maybe reworking a map here and there they *need* to give the core game some proper settings. Phew now that i got that Rant about my System it's time for me to complain about some other stuff but i'll keep it short since yall got places to be. Balance is pretty much a mess since the devs like to listen to the beginners *cough* and survivor mains *cough* rather than the higher ranks *cough* and maybe stop their clear bias towards Survivors *cough*. Maps are pretty good in detail but again mostly balanced towards survivors. The community is just mostly a collection of not so pleasant people that would be better of without a keyboard, however there are some genuine nice people in them which i appreciate. There are microtransactions in form of cosmetics and a battlepass system which allows you to earn some cosmetics through gameplay which is cool ngl but it's mostly just recolors, i can also say that the prices for the cosmetics are WAAAY to high up, 15€ for the highest tier cosmetics (yes there a different tiers of cosmetics) and 10€ for the second highest tier. And lastly the Gameplay, why did i save the Gameplay for last? Well um i dunno really that's a bit of an oversight from me. Anyway the gameplay is this as a Survivor go find a gen, work on a gen for 80 seconds, move on to the next gen, if killer comes hide, if killer sees you run away and try to ''loop'' him on certain areas on the map. As killer go around the map, look for survivors, chase survivor, kill survivor (hopefully), repeat. That's it in a nutshell, there's alot more to it like mindgames and certain areas beeing stronger but this Review is already long enough and my name isn't Whitelight so im not gonna make this a 7 Hour Review. Anyway that's it for my Ted Talk, thank you all for coming and goodbye.","timestamp_created":1530296598,"timestamp_updated":1600631205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43164697","author":{"steamid":"76561198125971408","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":30236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4032,"last_played":1658768918},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good","timestamp_created":1530296533,"timestamp_updated":1594566666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43164655","author":{"steamid":"76561198194531267","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4608,"last_played":1647861359},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Баги исправляйте играю и немогу двигатса","timestamp_created":1530296410,"timestamp_updated":1530296410,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490748494863510132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43164567","author":{"steamid":"76561198384289135","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1643794472},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, заставляющая радоваться и горевать.

Man gewöhnt sich schnell dran an die kleinen einzelnen brutalen Szenen und ich finde es hat genau seinem perfekten Mittelmaß gefunden. Das Spiel kann sehr viel Spaß machen, besonders wenn man mit Freunden gemeinsam als Survivor antritt, dass heißt aber nicht dass das Spiel einem vor dem Rage modus bewahrt.
