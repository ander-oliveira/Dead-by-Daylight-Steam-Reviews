Зацепил меня и я постоянно только в этот режим играю.\nКонечно, бывают лаги, но в принципе они не сильно мешают играть.\nЕщё мне нравится, что есть много интересных дополнений, которые дают тебе новые карты для игр, выживших и маньяков. А также мне нравится, что можно своего персонажа менять и это происходит с валютой, которая существует внутри игры. Повышая свой уровень вы получаете валюту и можете её тратить на новые навыки персонажа или на новую одежду.\nЕщё один плюс заключается в том, что у каждого персонажа существуют свои персональные навыки, которые можно прокачивать и менять на другие, открывая их в паутине прокачки персонажа.\nТак что если вам нравится подобный жанр игр, то можете покупать эту игру.","timestamp_created":1639344539,"timestamp_updated":1639344539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105732019","author":{"steamid":"76561199072995094","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1641901634},"language":"latam","review":"eS BUENO!","timestamp_created":1639344479,"timestamp_updated":1639344479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105731690","author":{"steamid":"76561199219616042","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":274,"playtime_at_review":1181,"last_played":1660512292},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom para jogar com amigos","timestamp_created":1639344023,"timestamp_updated":1639344023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105731465","author":{"steamid":"76561199124018955","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":558,"playtime_at_review":3808,"last_played":1660504819},"language":"german","review":"Kann man irgendwo sehen mit wem man als letztes gespielt hat?","timestamp_created":1639343713,"timestamp_updated":1639343713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105731197","author":{"steamid":"76561199193391263","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":669,"last_played":1644127060},"language":"brazilian","review":"A good game to spend some time.","timestamp_created":1639343363,"timestamp_updated":1639343363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105731065","author":{"steamid":"76561198376861075","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":59615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54675,"last_played":1658820644},"language":"english","review":"It was a really good game, built on a solid idea, but developers are hellbent on making new content and more dlc's instead of fixing the abundance of issues present in the game.\n\nplease BHVR just instead of a new killer or something do a QoL chapter or two","timestamp_created":1639343190,"timestamp_updated":1647003601,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105730827","author":{"steamid":"76561198121873582","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":56681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47830,"last_played":1646605327},"language":"english","review":"I love this game honestly but I can't recommend it in its current state. Not only is the game still rather buggy though I'll be honest that will never be fixed. But the devs somewhat recently(months ago by the time of this review) added a \"skill based matchmaking\" system which only takes the bare minimum of information as skill(how many full sacrifices you get as killer and how many escapes as survivor) which doesn't properly calculate your skill in the games mechanics. But the worst part is probably just trying to play with this new matchmaking system. Its a bit of a mixed bag for people. Especially at first since its still trying to calculate your ranking but its gotten to the point for me where none of my matches on killer are fun at all anymore. Either I get completely steamrolled or I completely steamroll the survivors. And most of the time when I get steamrolled its the toxic players that insult you for no reason as well. Or I get people who I'm 80% sure are hacking but can't tell because its just subtle enough which is actually a big problem right now from what I've been seeing. Now if behavior fixes the matchmaking system and gets rid of the cheaters then I would recommend the game. Even more so if they doubled down on the toxicity and actually punished people for it like they say they will in the report system. But until at least the matchmaking problem is fixed I can't in good faith say to buy this game. For the first time ever since playing it this game has actually just emotionally drained me because of these issues and I can say without a doubt this is probably the worst state the game has been in.","timestamp_created":1639342890,"timestamp_updated":1639342890,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517422676086425781","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105730712","author":{"steamid":"76561198011193948","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":28683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":730,"playtime_at_review":4174,"last_played":1660469153},"language":"english","review":"Killing.

Short games. Each game usually lasts 10-15 minutes, which is nice if you don't have the time to commit to a long game.\n✅ Large variety of killers that have unique powers to master. There are common killer mechanics that all killers share. Also keeps games fresh as survivor.\n✅ Unique gameplay. Skills from other games don't readily translate to this game, which makes for a fun learning experience. Skill curve takes most hundreds of hours to master.\n\nThe game's not perfect however.\n\n👎 Killer can ruin experience of a single survivor by camping hook. This usually results in the other survivors escaping if they play accordingly, but that's little consolation for the camped survivor. Also requires camped survivor to waste their time by staying in the game while their team escapes; giving up rewards the killer and enables them to find and camp another survivor.\n👎 Killers and survivors can spend resources to bring additional tools to assist them in the trial. These give their side an advantage that can make the game feel less fair. So you may win some games you otherwise would have lost (and vice versa for your opponents) due to bringing stronger tools.\n\n😄All that said it's a fun experience and I'd recommend the game to anyone that's looking for a new game to try out. The one piece of advice I'd give is to play both survivor and killer in the beginning. Only killers can see survivor scratch marks, and only survivors can hear the killer terror radius and see their red stain.
