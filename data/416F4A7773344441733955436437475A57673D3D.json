Перки, предметы, дополнения, предложения, настраиваемый внешний вид ... Там есть много вещей: Аптечки, фонарик, Ящик для инструмента и карты. Дополнения сделают ваши товары еще больше: заживляют, ремонт быстрее и т.д. Перки используются для предоставления хороших положительных эффектов для вашего персонажа.

Моя конфигурация далека от хорошего, но я с 45-60 ФПС на среднем, что хорошо, потому что игра выглядит хорошо даже с этими настройками.

Prežívajúci hráči musia nahodit 6 generátorov a vrah ich musí obetovať skôr, ako ostatný opravia všetkých 6 generátorov a utečú cez bránu alebo ked žije len  jeden, tak môže použiť poklop na zemi ktorým utečie hneď a nemusí opravovat ostatné generátory(poklop je ale velmi tažke nájsť). Vrah nezabíja tým, že preživajúcich zabije na míeste, vrah musí 2x zasiahnuť hráča, aby hráča zranil a zložil na zem. Hráči môžu využívat okolie, takže môžu preskakovat překážky omnoho rýchlejšie ako vrah, alebo sa schovať do skrine, zhodiť blokádu , aby hrac spomalil vraha. Vrah nieje jeden, ale je jich niekolko, a určitě este pribudnú, každý má inú špeciálnu schopnost a zbrane ako napr. motorovka, volaka sekera... A teraz už odbočím od popisu účelu hry a prejdem k môjmu hodnoteniu, mna osobne hra strašne baví, ale kedze to je len týždeň von, má to máličko chybičiek. Časom to určite bude ešte lepšie. Tý, ktorý majú radi kooperáciu s týmom a tiež trochu nervov pri horrorovej hre, tak doporučujem.

Нужно постоянно спасать тиммейтов аутистов, ломать даже пустые тотемы и естественно как можно дольше водить манов, и в этом, пожалуй, заключается большая проблема. Основной смысл подобных игр всегда было спастись, а как вы это делаете уже дело случая, в дбд же на хайрангах эта основа основ просто рушится. И даже если вы умудритесь наскрести по капле/две в катках на 3-4 рангах, то не забывайте, что есть и тиммейты дауны / маны задроты, которые могут ливнуть или выпилиться за первую же минуту. На этих рангах ранний выпил = луз (лузом в данном случае становится отсутствие фарма капель, даже если вас закуканили, но вы были полезным, каплю всё равно дадут). Но дбд не предназначена и не сбалансирована для игры в 3 челика 5 генов или 2 челика 4-5 генов, т.е. если попадутся ретарды, то и смысла играть вам самим уже тоже не будет. А если вы умудрились словить таких мусорных сразу стриком в 2-3 катках подряд, то и желание качаться в ней в целом пропадает моментально.\n7 буб кемперов из 10","timestamp_created":1466329692,"timestamp_updated":1611422526,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23648290","author":{"steamid":"76561198042398993","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":43265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1150,"last_played":1630957528},"language":"hungarian","review":"Aki még nem vette meg de megszeretné annak írok itt egy kis értékelést a sajátos tapasztalataimból.\n\n-Megvan az a horror feelingje.\n-Csapatmunka az kicsit szegényes mert alig vannak olyan \"kedves emberek\" akik segítenek rajtad a bajban.\n-Tele van izgalmakkal pl: amikor kerget téged a gyilkos és el kell bújnod vagy kicselezned,\n\nAjánlom ezt a játékot nagyon jóó!","timestamp_created":1466329674,"timestamp_updated":1466329674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673971474170684814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23648254","author":{"steamid":"76561198170917714","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":54156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2740,"last_played":1569756953},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego en general esta bien pero le falta el poder jugar con un amigo solo en partida online con demas personas y que arreglen ese bug de que cuando matas a un superviviente no le puedes recoger (suele pasar cuando le tumbas cuando salta un obstaculo y tu lo saltas), se me ha nescapado asi muchisimos supervivientes porque no podia cogerlos del suelo y se arrasraron a la salida....","timestamp_created":1466329507,"timestamp_updated":1466329507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497311830520629883","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23648234","author":{"steamid":"76561198041095405","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":32741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9712,"last_played":1658416468},"language":"english","review":"Glad that in the end i did end up buying the game and honestly in my top 5 games right now, BUT every time i open the game all my stuff gets reset and i have to start all over again! i dont know if this is just a bug or if its part of the game!

Once they fixed that I was happy, because then I  could loop again. Which resulted in me Changing my mind and recommending this game again. But after the most recent update yet again, I've finally decided to keep my review of this game a negative one. \n\nThe biggest dead horse I'm going to beat here is a recent change that was for the worse. I tried to stay positive about this, and thought that it could be a good thing. That being the ever so persistent MMR system they added to the game. This is going to be my longest point so be ready because I have some choice words for this one. Buckle up and let me take you on my journey of the new system. \n\nNow, it was supposed to be that you win 50% of your matches or you get a 2k every game, with the game being a struggle every single time. Now normally this wouldn't be an issue you know? However this is made a huge issue by the fact that there is NO INDICATION THAT YOU'RE IMPROVING. \n\nNow Grave come on now, there's a grade system in the game! It tells you what your grade is right there! \n\nEXCEPT NO, YOU'RE WRONG. The grades are entirely cosmetic and have no bearing on your matchmaking pool, you have mmr points that are completely invisible and not shown to you. So you have no idea whether or not you're playing at a high or low MMR. Got camped and tunneled by a killer? Got ran by a god? You won't be able to tell what MMR you're at while doing it! \n\nNot only that, but it's a system that's not even working. Got destroyed by a rank 1 god nurse main that has 8k hours? Here's a guy who camps and tunnels and you best believe everybody is going to the basement with his agitation. After that? A rank 1 God billy. I'm losing a lot more on both sides, and it seems that the little tricks I learn here and there on both killer and survivor just don't matter. You're always going to have something cucking you over in the long run. Because I know for a fact that I shouldn't be matched with a David and Claude who can't run the killer for more than 20 seconds and then I buy time for them to 3 gen us while a trap is on my head from the Pig.\n\nNot only that but from what I've seen of the datamined info, they threw this System together in 2 weeks, said they worked on it for a year, and then threw it out there. The only condition for survivors to gain mmr is time and escapes. Which is not a measure of skill at all. You can be camped at the start by a leatherface and your MMR will fall because you should have just \" Survived more \"\n\nTbh I would gone on more, but I'll finish this soon.
