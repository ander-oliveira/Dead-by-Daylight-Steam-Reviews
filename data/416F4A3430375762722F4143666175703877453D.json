The game itself only has two ways to play which are as either as a survivor or as a killer, as the survivor your survival depends on you working with your teammates 99% of the time, unfortunately for me not only do they very rarely help with the objective, they also somehow can't distract or run the killer for more than 30 seconds normally. As a killer the game is easier because it does not require teammates to assist you, you just need to hunt down the survivors. However, even though it is easier to play as a killer it also more boring, because as previously mentioned, survivors can't run me for more than 30 seconds normally for about 90% of the time. The only way they can is if the map is more survivor sided or if they can actually use their brains, but like I said that's pretty rare. The game itself also gets more bugs and glitches and hackers more recently in the last 6 months than I have been seeing in this game for the past 3 years. Honestly to me the lack of communication is probably the worst part of this game as there is only a small text chat at the beginning and end of a game, but only if they are pc players which is becoming more rare as time goes on. I would literally NEVER RECOMMEND this game to anyone, and am sad to see the way this game went from when I initially played it","timestamp_created":1582167993,"timestamp_updated":1637546067,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63805066","author":{"steamid":"76561198392435869","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":22391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":302,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1660351566},"language":"english","review":"i think they did a pretty good JOB!","timestamp_created":1582167923,"timestamp_updated":1582167923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63805054","author":{"steamid":"76561198299825146","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":84881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1161,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1660554234},"language":"english","review":"I've played this game on both xbox and ps so when ever anyone asked for  a game that keeps you on your feet of could give you a good scare i always say dead by daylight even of you think it cant get better they then add a new update and it makes the fun come back from the blood hunt or the stranger things up date that added a new killer an two survivors.\n","timestamp_created":1582167897,"timestamp_updated":1582167897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63804816","author":{"steamid":"76561198022870266","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":40741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":150,"playtime_at_review":11786,"last_played":1660459355},"language":"english","review":"You will get cheaters in at least 1 out of 4 matches nowadays.

Now I mainly play the \"survivor\" area so I won't have much feedback for killer game play. All this aside let's get into this. \n\nSo survivors have to do generators to power the exit and escape. That's the main objective. If you play this game for the first time I'll let you know right now doing your objective will be difficult because of a game play mechanic called \"skill checks\". Skill checks do exactly how they sound like. You can't just plant yourself on a generator and space out (I'm speaking from experience), you have to place your indicator (thing) on one of the highlighted area whilst your indicator spins (think of reloading from gears of war, that mini game is the best way to describe it).I mention this because sometimes lag spikes (server's fault) will cause you to miss, which can compromise your game. Now this is doesn't happen a lot for me, so I don't think it's an issue, just an inconvenience. I will now move on to the big pros and cons.\n\nPros: \n1. This game is spooky! If you are a horror movie fanatic this is the game for you! \n2. Gameplay is just as good with/without friends. \n3. The perks as a whole. Perks are things you bring to the game that can affect you, or your teamates, or if you are killer, your enemies. A good example is a perk named Iron Will, which silences your grunts of pain as a survivor. Now these are just a few things that make this game great. Now unfortunatly, we move to the cons. \n\nCons: \n1. Some people (like in every competitive game) like to go out of their way to ruin your fun. This could be the killer only going after one survivor, even when the others are right in front of them. Also, when survivors tea bag it's not fun for a killer. \n2. Some perks are a little strong, such as a perk called \"No one escapes death\" makes people 1 hit. That is a strong killer perk, but like most other strong perks (survivors too, I'm not entitled) there are ways around these strong perks. However some of these require you to waste time, which is something you don't have a lot of. \n3. Not being queued with the other appropriate ranks. This happens way to often. You could be in a game as killer with survivors that have been playing since beta with teammates who are just as new as you.\n4. Long queue times. Queue times are super long, especially in high ranks, which makes the game feel super wait - heavy. There are killers who have been in queues for almost an hour or longer. Now I think they fixed the queue times, to make it shorter, but don't hold your breath. \n\nTo summarize: Dead by Daylight is a wonderful game, with really fun and unique mechanics. While it suffers from queue times, toxic players, and matchmaking, it makes a strong comeback with it's unique roster of survivors and killers. I recommend this game. Now I'm not some pro who's great at this game, I'm just an average Joe who happens to like this game. Take everything I say with a grain of salt, you might get a better experience than I do. so I thank you for reading this stupid review, and I hope this helps. You have a good day! :) \n","timestamp_created":1582156986,"timestamp_updated":1612135124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63799486","author":{"steamid":"76561198291791831","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":20390,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16774,"last_played":1597279747},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bão","timestamp_created":1582156575,"timestamp_updated":1582156575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63799327","author":{"steamid":"76561198096356115","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5509,"last_played":1581717349},"language":"japanese","review":"Fuck","timestamp_created":1582156248,"timestamp_updated":1582156248,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63799284","author":{"steamid":"76561198216729395","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1312,"last_played":1531478051},"language":"german","review":"Cooles Spiel man braucht halt Freunde dafür und die habe ich nicht..xD","timestamp_created":1582156166,"timestamp_updated":1582156166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63799138","author":{"steamid":"76561198013197010","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1625529562},"language":"english","review":"this game is bootyhole\n","timestamp_created":1582155784,"timestamp_updated":1582155784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63799126","author":{"steamid":"76561198306458964","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3616,"last_played":1657954561},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito legal","timestamp_created":1582155758,"timestamp_updated":1582155758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63798763","author":{"steamid":"76561198918663785","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":11642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":368,"last_played":1594354459},"language":"english","review":"very epic game","timestamp_created":1582154988,"timestamp_updated":1582154988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63798751","author":{"steamid":"76561198068930594","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1582157587},"language":"german","review":"Mega geiles Spiel, aber auf der PS4 find ichs noch einen tick besser:D Kann auch sein weil mein Pc ne Kartoffel ist xD","timestamp_created":1582154966,"timestamp_updated":1582154966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63798287","author":{"steamid":"76561198060048743","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":10565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5881,"last_played":1640587341},"language":"english","review":"I am recommending this game, but im on the fence about it.

I absolutely love horror, and the characters they have, but there are some critical aspects to the game that need some fixing in order to keep me coming back. \n\nFor the 10 dollars I spent, it was definitely worth it. Buying all the characters sucks, and it would be nice to earn points to purchase them maybe a little bit faster? Tallying up all the dlc this game could easily be 100 dollars. I dont know. I recommend the game, but like I said im on the fence for the longevity of the enjoyment you get from it.","timestamp_created":1582153862,"timestamp_updated":1582153862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63798220","author":{"steamid":"76561198799246902","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":15510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1991,"last_played":1645414782},"language":"english","review":"play \n","timestamp_created":1582153707,"timestamp_updated":1582153707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63798041","author":{"steamid":"76561198009347484","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3870,"last_played":1646621104},"language":"english","review":"so great!","timestamp_created":1582153325,"timestamp_updated":1582153325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63797840","author":{"steamid":"76561198402256625","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":183326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":573,"playtime_at_review":60091,"last_played":1660536392},"language":"english","review":"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","timestamp_created":1582152916,"timestamp_updated":1582152916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63797782","author":{"steamid":"76561198178924542","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":55700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":224,"playtime_at_review":40168,"last_played":1660578848},"language":"french","review":"Avec cette dernière MAJ, le jeu est injouable !

I really enjoyed it but after a little bit of time it just started to get boring. The killers they would add in felt unbalanced and hit boxes were just terrible, Sometimes i would be across the vault and i would get hit by whatever killer i would be against. This has just overall made the game a lot less fun for me and my friends who have all moved onto different more fun games.\n\nThe disconnect penalty is completely one sided. If you are disconnected on the loading screen you get it. If your internet dies you get it. If you get an in game bug and disconnect you get it. It punishes people who should not be punished. They had it once and got rid of it just to implement it again without fixing the problems that it already had. \n\nMatchmaking is bad with wait times. I dont even bother to play killer because of this! \n\nOverall i just dont recommend dead by daylight anymore which sucks because it would be such a good game if they had a better team to work on the game instead of one that just blindly ignores the community. There are plenty of other good games like this such as last year but sadly the creators of that game killed it by making it discord exclusive for a year.

juego.\nDead by Daylight es un juego multijugador en linea, donde las partidas son 1 contra 4 (1 asesino contra 4 supervivientes), estas partidas se juegan en diferentes mapas, donde la experiencia cambia notablemente y hace que cada partida sea única.\n\nEl objetivo de los supervivientes es reparar cinco generadores para restablecer la electricidad, y con ello poder abrir alguna de las dos puertas que se encuentran aleatoriamente por el mapa, y escapar, también existe otra forma de escapar, esta es abriendo una especie de trampilla que se puede abrir o bien con una llave, o esperando a que el asesino mate a todos los supervivientes y solo quedes tu vivo, de esta forma, se abre automáticamente.\n\nEl objetivo del asesino es atrapar a todos los supervivientes y colgarlos en una especie de gancho, que se encuentran por el mapa, hasta que el ente que allí habita decida matar al superviviente, cada superviviente tiene un máximo de dos fases de cuelgues antes de que el ente lo mate, y a la tercera el superviviente muere al instante:\n\n1ra fase: El superviviente es colgado y el ente no hace nada, pero la vida va bajando progresivamente. El superviviente tiene la opción de descolgarse por su cuenta (cosa que las probabilidades de que pase son bajas y la vida baja mas rápido intentando descolgarse) o que otro jugador lo descuelgue.\n\n2da fase: La segunda vez que el asesino te cuelga, el ente intentara asesinar al superviviente, pero este tiene la opción de aguantar apretando la tecla \"espacio\", la vida baja hasta un 50% y no hay opción de descolgarse, solo de que algún otro jugador te vaya a descolgar.\n\n3ra fase: La tercera vez que el asesino te cuelga, ya no hay opción de sobrevivir y el ente te mata automáticamente.\n\n \nJugabilidad\nBueno, aquí hablaremos sobre la jugabilidad que tienen los supervivientes y el asesino, recalcando ventajas y desventajas de cada uno.\n\nSuperviviente: Los supervivientes juegan en tercera persona, su objetivo como ya explique es reparar cinco generadores para restablecer la electricidad y escapar, pero tienen un problema, van a tener que reparar cuidando que el asesino no los descubra.\n\nVentajas:\n\nEl superviviente escucha latidos cuando el asesino se acerca, cosa que se van escuchando cada vez mas fuerte y mas rápido en medida que el asesino este mas cerca del superviviente, así le da tiempo a correr o esconderse.\n\nLos supervivientes pueden llevar items extra a la partida, que los va a ayudar en diferentes formas, por ejemplo: Maletín de herramientas, sirve para reparar mas rápido; Linterna, sirve para cegar al asesino y ganar unos segundos; Llave maestra, sirve para abrir la trampilla, entre otros objetos.\n\nLos supervivientes al ganar partidas pueden mejorarse algunas habilidades únicas que les dan ventajas sobre el asesino, como correr mas rápido por algunos segundos, no dejar huellas al correr, saber donde se encuentran tus compañeros heridos, etc.\n\nAlrededor del mapa hay \"palets\" que ayudan al superviviente a bloquear el paso al asesino, o aturdirlo, para ganar unos segundos y/o escapar.\n\nDesventajas:\n\nLos supervivientes son mas lentos que el asesino, cosa que si no encuentran algo para protegerse de el estarán acabados.\n\nLos supervivientes al reparar generadores, tendrán pruebas de habilidad, y si las fallan, explotara el generador, perdiendo parte del progreso de reparación que llevaban y revelando su posición al asesino.\n\nLos supervivientes al correr dejan marcas en el suelo por un par de segundos, que el asesino puede usar para rastrearlos y cazarlos.\n\nAsesino: El asesino juega, a diferencia del superviviente, en primera persona, a continuación veremos algunas ventajas y desventajas de él.\n\nVentajas: El asesino, al igual que el superviviente, tiene habilidades únicas que lo ayudan a poder rastrear y cazar a los supervivientes mas fácil, pero aparte de eso, cada asesino tiene una habilidad única, que hace que sea aun mas fácil matar a los supervivientes, por ejemplo: Poner trampas de oso, tirar hachas, correr mas rápido, ser indetectable y no generar latidos en los supervivientes, hacerse invisible, entre otras (aquí nombre habilidades de diferentes asesinos.\n\nLos asesinos son mas rápidos que los supervivientes, cosa que hace mas fácil cazarlos.\n\nLos asesinos tienen un oído muy agudo, esto hace que cada vez que un superviviente falle una prueba de habilidad en generadores, tire un palet al suelo o salte una ventana corriendo, le saldrá una alerta en el mapa de donde ocurrió cada acción y así el asesino sabe exactamente donde se encuentran los supervivientes.\n\nLos asesinos tienen la opción de patear los generadores para ir reduciendo su cantidad reparada, y así los supervivientes demoren mas en reparar los generadores.\n\nDesventajas:\n\nLos asesinos pueden ser aturdidos si se les tira un palet en la cara, cosa que aparte de ser aturdidos, tienen que romper el palet, perdiendo mucho tiempo.\n\nLos asesinos no pueden llevar objetos adicionales como los supervivientes.\n\n \nOfrendas\nLas ofrendas son objetos que pueden usar los asesinos o supervivientes antes de una partida y pueden cumplir diferentes funciones, la mayoría dan mas puntos de sangre en las partidas para poder subir de nivel habilidades, pero hay algunos que tienen poderes bastante fuertes, algunos ejemplos de los de superviviente: Hacer que hayan menos ganchos en la partida, hacer aparecer al asesino lejos de ti, que haya mas separación entre gancho y gancho, aparecer con todos tus compañeros de equipo. Y algunos ejemplos de los de asesinos: Hacer aparecer a los supervivientes lo mas lejos entre si, hacer aparecer mas ganchos en el mapa, la habilidad de poder matar con tus propias manos a un superviviente.","timestamp_created":1582134800,"timestamp_updated":1598288393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63787130","author":{"steamid":"76561198054671595","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23242,"last_played":1635791882},"language":"russian","review":"Я ПРОСТО ОХУЕВАЮ СУКА, ЕБАНЫЙ РОТ ЭТИХ РАЗРАБОВ, НЕРФ НА НЕРФЕ, БАЛАНС 0 !!!!!!
