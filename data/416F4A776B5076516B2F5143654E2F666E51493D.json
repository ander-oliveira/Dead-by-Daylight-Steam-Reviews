que voy a decir es va a ser mi (Opinión) sobre las horas que llevo y con lo que me encontré en este juego jugando solo con randoms o con amigos y jugando de killer\n\nes otro juego mas , donde va a ver gente troll o toxic@s etc .\nen este caso Dead by Daylight . por una parte de survivor que te farmea en la cara o se pone a trolear la partida para perder aveces o se le pasan como ninjas y no quieren aparecer en toda la partida para ayudar en algo.\n\npor otra parte de killer que directamente al primero que cuelga ya lo va a campear y tunelear aveces o si ve que le va muy mal en una partida y le estan rusheando los motores rapido al que atrape lo va a campear en la cara hasta que acabe muerto en el gancho etc\n\nque es lo que veo que escucho de la GENTE decir mucho \n Survivor : Camper . tunelero etc \nKiller : me rusheado los motores rapido . son Premades me van a trolear , gente toxica etc\n\npero que es lo que veo YO : exactamente lo mismo que dicen la gente . \"PERO\" en ningun lado dice que no se puede hacer tal cosa , en el juego no te dice que no lo podes hacer nada , asi que si se puede campear y tunelear y rushear motores y trolear al killer etc aun que mucho no les guste  .\n\npor algo hay perks en casos de camper o tuneleros \npor algo hay perks contra gente que son premades o rushear los motores rapido\npero uno nunca se sabe si en la siguiente partida les va a toca esa gente o no y siempre en la mayoria de los casos estan obligados a llevar esas perks por si acaso \n\nsi uno va a compra el juego y a va a aprende como jugarlo , una vez que ya sepa , va a jugar como esa persona quiera jugarlo a su modo por que le gusta asi , es asi de simple\n\npara mi el juego esta bien , los asesinos que hay y tanto de peliculas que son algunos y tambien de los survivors , pero si te toca esta tipo de gente en una partida no te pongas mal , yo lo tomo como un desafio cada vez que me toca esta tipo de gente y se aprende mucho la verdad para jugarles mejor tanto de que vallas de survivor o killer\n\npero como dice al principio , es mi (OPINION) y (LO QUE PIENSO) respecto con lo que me encontre en este juego y las horas que llevo jugando .\n\nlo unico

Be prepared to drop 15 - 30 extra dollars to unlock characters and perks you like.\n\nPros\n+Unique asymmetric game with depth on both sides.\n+Fun for casuals and sweaty casuals.\n+Lots of characters and perks to play with and learn. There are many recognizable characters from other franchises.\n+Start with some strong characters on both sides, and you can e v e n t u a l l y unlock characters/perks/many cosmetics with in game currency.\n+Fun community and lots of streamers to watch to get better.\n+Game gets frequent updates and has frequent events. The tomes (quest tree events) stay forever and can always be filled out for extra bloodpoints.\n\nCons\n-Game can be buggy and scuffed sometimes, which can be frustrating.\n-Not for e-athletes. The best strategies are often not the fun strategies, there is a lot of chaos, and there is a casual culture surrounding the game.\n-The grind is long, and can not be avoided. (no pay to skip). If you want to get into the meat of the game, be prepared to sink at least 80 hours. (Low level play is still fun, but you will be missing some perks you want.)\n-While you can grind out characters, there is a lot of grind in the game already. With the amount of time you will spend playing it is better to drop some money early and grind with the characters you like.\n-Many maps and other parts of the game are questionably balanced.\n","timestamp_created":1598407262,"timestamp_updated":1598407262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74918980","author":{"steamid":"76561198805158473","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3597,"last_played":1657470280},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo

But it's one of those games you can keep coming back to and it surprisingly never gets old. \n\nI played this game for about a month with a friend of mine but then I actually took the time to learn the game. I watched streamers and looked up builds for my survivor. I continued to play survivor until I felt happy about where I was on the ranking system. Then I began playing killer.\n\nPlaying killer is like playing a whole brand new game. Each killer is completely different from one another. I originally played Hillbilly in lower ranks, then I bought Myers because I was a fan of the Halloween franchise, then I watched Stranger Things and began to play Demogorgon. Each killer has a brand new feel to them and I praise this game over it. \n\nSome things I don't like about the game though is how long it takes for bugs/balancing to be patched in. It's a whole process with going to the PTB (Public Test Build) and sits there for roughly 2 weeks with barely anyone playing. Ranking/MMR is also an issue but I don't even know how to fix it in this type of game. \n\nOverall, I love this game and have recommended it to a number of my friends.

It's fun especially if you're knew. You may get scared a few times or it might get your heart racing but that doesn't last long. And then the game becomes more competitive and then you start to worry about metas an other BS. The game does keep adding cool and unique characters, especially the killers, since at the end of the day, survivors are almost just cosmetics anyways. Most fun through this game can be found through playing with friends. But if you end up liking killer more, than you won't have many of those. With the new addition of crossplay the game becomes much easier in higher ranks, since console players can't react as fast and can't turn and aim as fast either. Of course  you can always turn it off. But having the addition of cross play is nice if you have friends who are strictly on console. Overall, I enjoy my time with this game, and I always look forward to the new killers and survivors they add next, even if it may seem like they are running out of new killer powers.

(Je vous laisse deviner le résultat d'une partie face à 4 idiots avec \"Drôlement dur, Coup décisif, Sur la réserve & Adrénaline\"). \n\nOn peux vite énoncer les tueurs inutiles : La Légion, Leatherface (quand bien même s'il à été up par la suite) & Le Piégeur destiné à jouer un build centré sur la cave pour gagner avec un goût amer. Et les survivants qui déconnectent vous faisant perdre pas mal de points !\n\nLes autres tueurs hormis l'Esprit, Billy (nerf) et la Harpie peinent à s'en sortir. Cela dépend évidemment de votre style de jeu. Privilégier un build cancérigène de préférence, il ne faudrait pas varier son gameplay ! Quelle idée !\n\nJouer tout court c'est également compliqué par moment. Be Haviour se démène de nous inventer de nouveaux bugs à chaque mise à jour (ils en plaisantaient dans les écrans de chargement de l'événement Dead by Daylight 4th anniversary, c'est tout bonnement incroyable une telle incompétence après 4 années !)\n\nEntre les bugs de hitbox, l'action d'attraper les survivants pendant une action qui s'annule (et parfois vous rend immobile pendant le restant de la partie... ouais.)\n\nLes déconnexions soudaine ? Qui vous font perdre vos Offrandes & vos Items ?  Y'en a pour tout les goûts !\n\nLes reports ? Ce sont l'équivalent des impôts irl : on ne sait pas ou ils vont. \n\nIl est triste de voir une telle idée de jeu si mal exécutée. \n","timestamp_created":1598387035,"timestamp_updated":1598387035,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74907229","author":{"steamid":"76561198952152502","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":498,"last_played":1642199975},"language":"polish","review":",","timestamp_created":1598386749,"timestamp_updated":1598386749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74907128","author":{"steamid":"76561198180691297","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":68750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1656045482},"language":"english","review":"Just don't play this game.
