Should you help somebody or go safely towards your own safety?\nBoth being the survivor or killer is fun, and you can feel you`re pulse rising as the killer comes closer. \n\nThe game has a few problems with getting stuck at loading screen or freezing, don`t know why. Hope this will get fixed in a patch. \n\nThe game only allows you to invite friends in private matches, which is a shame seeing how great it could be (not always 5 friends playing the same game at the same time for me). Maybe having an unranked playlist would serve this purpose? \n\nAnyways, loving the game, even with the glitches and without ability to invite friends I`ll give it 8/10, 10/10 if it is fixed!\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n","timestamp_created":1467757906,"timestamp_updated":1467757906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24120420","author":{"steamid":"76561198048725682","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":19763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":813,"last_played":1658612904},"language":"english","review":"pen15","timestamp_created":1467757585,"timestamp_updated":1625699114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566326558589935303","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24120390","author":{"steamid":"76561198039600707","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1635710811},"language":"german","review":"Dieses Game macht als Killer unheimlich viel Spass :D Aber auch als Überlebender ist es immer wieder sehr spannend.  \nBin gespannt wie es sich weiterentwickelt. \nMuss nicht unbedingt mit Freunden gespielt werden, macht auch Fun mit fremden Leuten^^\nAuch für zwischendurch ist es gut geeignet.

Ihr spielt als Survivor gegen eure Mitspieler und gegen den Killer, besser kann man das nicht beschreiben.\nWenn ihr den Killer mehrere Minuten an Euch kleben habt, so kommt es auch vor dass gar kein Gen angemacht wird und wenn ihr dann auch nicht vom Haken gerettet werdet, dann tritt Euch das Spiel so richtig in den A., denn Punkte bekommt ihr dann auch nur mangelhaft, aber wen wundert das auch? Der Entwickler denkt sich, Randoms brauchen keinen Chat, keine Sicht auf die Mitspieler, keine Information, kein gar nichts mit Ausnahme gewisser Perks.\nEntweder ist das Erlebnis im Spiel ein \"Too Easy\" oder ein \"Impossible\", das kann auch auf beiden Seiten stattfinden, falsche Karte für den Killer und das kanns gewesen sein.\n\nDas Spiel ist per se äußerst intransparent in sehr vielen Faktoren, es wird mehr von Glück gesteuert, als von spielerischem Einfluss.\nZeitgleich erscheint es nahezu 100% garantiert, in einer koordinierten und erfahrenen Gruppe mit Voicechat regelmäßig zu gewinnen, da der Entwickler in einem so fernen Wald lebt, dass er sich dachte, Premades haben die selben Nachteile wie Randoms.\nEs ist absolut wahnsinnig sich auch nur in entfernten Ansätzen in den Entwickler und seinen Gedankengang hineinzuversetzen wenn man versucht herauszufinden was die sich dabei gedacht haben.\nDas komplette System bzgl. Punkten etc. ist die pure Idiotie der Entwickler welche komplett verkehrt auf dieser Welt leben, anders lässt sich nicht erklären wie so extrem unlogische Unstimmigkeiten in einem Spiel entstehen können, frei nach dem Motto: \"Ach ihr als Killer habt gerade 2-3 Survivor tot gecampt? 50 Punkte Abzug\" - genau genommen Who Gives a damn F*ck auf diese Punkte. Mit Rang 10 könnt ihr genauso gut 1 Hit Äxte auf Rank 1 Survivor donnern und diese kaputt campen wie ihr lustig seid, an so einem Problem arbeitet der Entwickler nicht.\n\nDas Spiel Prinzip an sich ist gut, nur der Entwickler ist außer Stande das Spiel in einen Zustand zu bringen, indem ihr fast immer Spaß haben könnt.\nWenn ihr einen Survivor zu lange chased, dann grüßen Euch neben Hassrede und sonstige  abwertende Grütze ständig neue Kommentare auf eurem Steamprofil und ihr werdet beständig als Frustablasser für das vollständige Versagen der Entwickler ran gezogen.\nIn Dead by Daylight bekämpft sich Unfair gegen fair, Nutzlos gegen Overpowered und eine Salzmine gegen euren Verstand an dem ihr Zweifel haben solltet weil ihr DbD spielt.\nEin normales Mittelmaß oder ein beständiges Erlebnis ist hier niemals gegeben, entweder springen die Gens im Sekundentakt an oder im Sekundentakt stirbt ein Survivor, ausgeglichene Matches hat man von 50 Spielen vielleicht 2 bis 3 Stück, der Rest wird alles von der katastrophalen Balance, dem kaputten Netcode, Addons, Mapdesign, Genplacement o.Ä. verdorben.\n\nEs scheint aus Seiten der Entwickler überhaupt gar kein Interesse daran zu bestehen, das Spielerlebnis abzurunden oder zu verbessern.\nBeständigen Spaß hat man nur als Killer in DbD, denn nur damit hat man tatsächlich zum großen Teil eine Kontrolle, die Kontrolle darüber einfach mal nen Rank 1 am Haken abzucampen und seine Punkte und den Rang in den Staub zu treten, auch wenn er Euch für 1-2 Minuten super lang gezogen hat, ihr sitzt als Killer trotzdem am längeren Hebel und die Bestätigung findet ihr dann in eurem Kommentarbereich eures Profils.","timestamp_created":1467730305,"timestamp_updated":1605005632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24110862","author":{"steamid":"76561198025892135","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2953,"last_played":1530434420},"language":"thai","review":"failed to connect to server  and   Bugs\n\nจอยห้องก็เด้งๆกดจนปวดมือหาห้องก็ยาก กดจอยห้องก็ยาก กดจอยห้องบ่อยๆค้างต้องออกเกม พอเจอห้องก็เด้งออก พอได้เล่นก็หลุดออกจากเกมมีอะไรดีมั้งชีวิต                                 ดีแค่ภาพสวยกับระบบเกม","timestamp_created":1467730288,"timestamp_updated":1467730288,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24110778","author":{"steamid":"76561198094590525","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":23185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13144,"last_played":1658787028},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos de suspenso y terror en multijugador que he jugado.
