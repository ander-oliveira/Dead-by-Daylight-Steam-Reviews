Tiene bugs, si, glitchs, si, jugadores \"especiales\",si, y pese a todo lo recomiendo. Por que? porque tambien tiene una excelente comunidad que me ha ayudado a entender y resolver los problemas mas frecuentes. \n\nEjemplos de estos problemas:\n1.- No encontrar partida rapido\n     Vivo en Mexico, y digamos que no hay muchos jugadores de Dead by daylight, pues facil me cambio de region y listo. Prove España, EU - Dallas, EU - Houston, y alli si puedes jugar cuando gustes, hay partidas todo el dia. Steam >> Parametros >> Descargas >> Region de Descarga >> elige la region que mas se te acomode. Aunque debes provar tambien que tal te van las partidas por eso del lag.\n\n2.-Bug al momento de buscar partida\nEl molesto bug dedarle a unirse a sala de espera y se pone la pantalla negra y palpitando el logo del juego. Bueno facil en lugar de darle en el menu principal a \"Ser un superviviente\" elejimos \"Sobrevive con amigos\" (aunque estes forever alone) y le das listo espera los 5 segundos y te buscara partida. Estos te reduce mas del 97.83% las posibilidades de que se bugueé buscando partida.\n\n3.-Los asesinos \"especiales\"\nAqui van los laggers, los friendly farmers, los team Survivor-killer, los bots, los campers, los cheaters en fin todos esos jugadores profesionales que requieren que el lag, un amigo, un programa o un glitch les de una ayudadita porque no pueden con los putos noobs (como yo). Bueno en partida se van a su perfil >> amigos >> jugadores  y ven el perfil del asesino (Lo normal), la informacion que nos importa es de donde es, los vac, y los comentarios, sabiendo la region podemos deducir si tendremos lag, si tiene vac pues ya vamos viendo por donde va la tirada, y una ojeada a su muro de comentarios nos dira alguna cosilla mas, despues de la partida si llega a ser algun killer de los antes mencionados solo lo bloquean y evitamos jugar con ellos en un futuro. Si es algo de nenas todo esto, pero los friendly killers le quitan todo al juego, los laggers no te dejan hacer nada bien, los team S-k son una pesadilla por mas que trates de escapar te jodera el survivor, los campers y los cheaters son como en cualquier juego una plaga, mejor evitarlos aunque es bastante reconfortante cuando les ganas aun con todo eso.\n\nCon estos 3 tips juego tranquilamente. Ya ustedes diran si les gusta el juego o no. A mi me encanta.\n","timestamp_created":1485783063,"timestamp_updated":1485783063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618111073970794678","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29585110","author":{"steamid":"76561198042042334","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":82,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1481985225},"language":"english","review":"Fun

iyi, çok.

Oyun yapımcıları ilk kez oyuncu kitlesini dinleyerek oyunu dengeleycek bir güncelleme getirdi. Dead hard'ı nerflediler (çok önceden yapılmalıydı). Survivorların çok fazla third chance perk'i var, bu durum dead hard ile birleşince çok daha fena oluyordu. Her hata yaptıklarında dead hard atarak işin içinden sıyrılabiliyorlardı. Ancak onlar bunu gördü ve perk'i reworklediler. Şimdiye kadar vermiş oldukları en doğru tercih olabilir. Ayriyetten Stranger Things dlc'si lisans sorunlarından dolayı oyundan kaldırılmıştı, alamayanlar üzülmüştü. Ancak yapımcılar oyuncu kitleyi gene dinledi ve dlc'yi geri getirmeye karar verdi.

It has the most balanced skill low to skill cap ratio of player to player I've seen with low tier killers going great against low tier survivors vise versa to high tiers. Sadly no dedicated servers but still holds up nicely. \n\nPro's: Developers still working on big updates and bugfixes.\nActive community.\nEntertaining and great replayability with skill cap always being able to be raised.\nA game reliant on player (survivor and killer) error encourages those to become as good as possibile keeping the community vast in it's skill level and abundent in players.\nThe game can geniuenly cause great fear to the survivors and satisfaction to the killer which creates a thrill in each game.\nThe soundtrack is great and each song fits perfectly to the situation(to the point where the song playing fits so well you don't even notice it at times{also a con check last con}.\n\nCon's:Many players complaining about balance issues likely due to map design and a perk or two.\nGame needs polish when it comes to some of it's core mechanics.(flashlights useless if killer knows to drop survivor instantly after brought to bleeding state)(Killers getting stuck in pallets)The list could go a bit further beyond than just this...sadly.\nThe soundtrack as said above is great but at times I feel it is playing too quietly for me to appreciate it and for it to do its job of installing fear into me as a survivor and make me feel truly unstoppable as a killer.(Hopefully a feature to increase and decrease the volume within a certain margin without muting it will be added) When listening to the soundtrack on youtube there are so many details shallowed out by other sounds that the real power the soundtrack delivers is missed.\n\nOverview: This game is a 100% worth buying and I don't regret a single hour I have put in.

Ever since my first few hours playing DBD on Steam I have played hundreds of hours of DBD on Playstation 4 as a purple/red rank survivor and green rank killer(yes I'm bad at killing I know). To this day I'm still playing it consistently with friends on PS4 and sometimes my siblings. Despite the bugs that are still annoying to this day this game is just plain fun most of the time. Your experience is different each match but generally it's pretty fun. You will have an occasional match with extremely toxic people who do shit like bodyblocking you or leading the killer right to you, but overall the matches are fun if you have competent teammates. I also have to give Behaviour credit for constantly releasing DLC. Some of the DLC is better than others, some of them were downright horrible[spoiler](*cough*legion*cough*)[/spoiler], but I appreciate that we get new content all the time even when said content isn't always good and may or may not have shit perks. This game has changed immeasurably since my review in 2017. It's actually slowly becoming somewhat balanced. It used to be bully the killer simulator every match where survivors would just point at the killer at the exit gate, tbag 30 times, and leave. But with all of the changes that have been made in countless updates killers actually have a chance to have a decent game. There are still toxic pieces of shit but there always will be and it's not half as toxic as it was back then. Without the constant bugs this game would be golden. If you're willing to deal with bugginess and a healthy dose of toxicity then chances are you'll have fun playing this game just as I did after graduating from rank 20. Don't write a review after only a few hours of playing like I did, your experience is much different at high ranks with competent teammates and once you learn to actually pallet loop and survive for longer than 10 seconds you'll start having fun. I remember playing swf with a few friends who were rank 20 and they were fucking amazed when I could pallet loop and survive a chase for longer than 5 seconds. They were calling me a \"champ\" through the mic even though I was only green ranks at the time and wasn't even playing that well, if that doesn't tell you how different your experience is in your first few hours as a rank 20 I don't know what will. I highly recommend playing swf because playing solo is like rolling the dice, you have no idea if your teammates will be good. To summarize:\n\n[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]\n- Fun and addicting once you can actually play\n- Devs constantly release new DLC including killers, survivors, maps, outfits, etc.\n- Great game to play with friends\n\n[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]\n- Constant bugs, when updates come out they just seem to get replaced by new bugs(to be fair the game isn't as buggy as it used to be, but it can still interfere with your gameplay experience sometimes)\n- Toxic players, although it's usually just a bit of tbagging and not people who are being total dicks\n- Long queue times that seem to take longer and longer the higher your rank is, sometimes I want to play a quick match and I end up just going to bed because the matchmaking takes so long\n\nThat just about sums it up. If you're new to DBD then you're lucky, it was way worse back then and despite the flaws you should give it a chance.","timestamp_created":1485748071,"timestamp_updated":1594968052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29578361","author":{"steamid":"76561198192769847","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":167239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148555,"last_played":1658266838},"language":"russian","review":"Чтожж игра снова актуальна.

Nearly every patch and DLC release pushed the game in a positive direction and it's amazing that the developers are able to do that. Considering this is an asymmetrical horror game, it is VERY hard to do so. As with most games, the community is slightly toxic at times. Many reviews state that this game is unbalanced and that everything is wrong with it. This is not the case. Most people who are saying those kinds of things have barely anytime in the game, and were not around to see what a true unbalanced and nightmare this game could be, as it was in 2016.

(Don't judge me she is 15) and she loved it. It was priced cheap so I got it to see if it would be fun to play. Usually I research games before purchasing, been burned a few times ya know. \n\nWe were going in blind.\n\nI wanted a single player mode or at least bots to let her play without having to go full multiplayer on our \"first\" game together because I was a little bit worried that there would be lobby chat that was too icky. You know what I mean, once the internet knows there is a girl on the other end of the line, some people perv out. So actually having no comms was a good thing for us. I know there is an after game chat but that is mostly used for \"gg\" comments or for whiny trolls to come out from under their bridges. ( hey trolls gotta eat )  \n\nNow I am so old school that when I downloaded Doom the first time it meant that I couldn’t get any calls on my landline and was only getting 2400 baud. If you don’t know what I mean you are young. Me, I am old. I played all the old FPS games (which we called doom clones) So I didn’t think I'd be too into this little horror game. Even though it plays first and third person.\n\nI loaded it just to make sure that the game played in both killer and survivor modes. I assumed there would be a single player mode or training levels but no. After a few min in game I realized I didn’t need it. Now that I saw how the game was set up I realized that I was actually interested in giving it a fair chance. But I bought it for her and didn’t want to spoil the fun of learning the game together. I was ready to hand the controls to her and I wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nHere is where things got interesting. \n\nI've talked about me so let me just say that my daughter is a happy person who loves her puppy and gives hugs to her parents just because. Now she doesn’t have the pigtails and skip to school like a suburban weirdo, but she doesn’t have black fingernails and write death poems either. \n\nSo think of well-rounded girl who so far has mostly played Mario cart on her Wii and who has a slightly unhealthy affection for Freddy Kruger. You know, normal. \n\nThings started off on the right foot when she first selected the hillbilly because he had a chainsaw. I think she said something about being like Ash from the evil dead, but maybe I just thought that myself. \n\nThe game isn’t perfect by a long shot. There is no matchmaking or servers that I can select from. There is no choice on which maps get selected for a match and when first getting started you have no powerups at all. But hey she doesn't know what isn’t there because she hasn't played this kind of game before. \n\nStarting a new multiplayer she was also worried that she would get killed quick. She has seen daddy play his games and that’s what it’s like being me online. (remember I'm old) but she did well and before the first game was even over she was having a ball. She was running around and taunting the survivors with a lil song she made up.\n“I’m gonna hit you with my hammer… I’m gonna kill you with my chainsaw.” It was hilarious.\n\nThe rest of the family was downstairs and they heard us singing and laughing. They wandered upstairs and took in the view of her singing a little ditty like it was just the most obvious thing for a hillbilly killer to do. Shaking their heads, they went back to episodes of friends or League of Legends or Minecraft while we went on slaughtering twenty somethings like it was hunting season.\n\nNow we both share the game and if you ever see big skinny out there in the dark, usually as Michael Myers.
