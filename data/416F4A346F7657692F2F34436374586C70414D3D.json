Dead By Daylight is a game that, by what I see from experienced players, is fun up until you actually get good at it. \n\nI'm only now at a point where I'm knocking on having multiple killers in level thirty and ranking gold in the monthly scoring system, and even now I'm starting to see the cracks in the system. Matchmaking occasionally throws me in with experienced players for whom DBD is a pure numbers game now. More Eve Online than a horror survival game. \n\nOn its face it's a fun game. It has some of that Sea of Thieves charm to how the developers seem like nice people doing their damndest to keep their broken game running as well as possible. As of this writing Nurse isn't playable purely because a small update made it so she'd get stuck in the floor and be unable to move.\n\nA problem that came up with The Twins at launch. \n\nIt's fun. The lore for killers can be a little goofy at times (in a good way). The problems arise from the player base being toxic for the sake of doing something new after logging too many hours. They want to have fun again, but the only way they can think to do that is pub stomp newer players and taunt them. I just got a match where three survivors did literally no objectives and just stood in a corner because they'd done the math and figured out my character couldn't carry all three of them to a hook, so if they used the right perks they could maximize the game's currency earnings without playing at all.\n\nAnd when called on it? They said they were \"making the game fun again.\" \n\nDBD is fun, but it demands you know when to log off.","timestamp_created":1644977508,"timestamp_updated":1644977508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.680425405502319336","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110331762","author":{"steamid":"76561198450380515","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11555,"last_played":1645598575},"language":"japanese","review":"キラーが好きでやっているがゲーム上仕方のないことだと理解はしているが、生存者側のパーティー時の対戦が精神衛生上あまりよろしくない。また、PS4番を長らくやってきたがPC版に移行したがデータの引き継ぎができないため、今までのパークスキン等が引き継げないのが心苦しい。\n日本人ネット民の特徴ではあるが複数人（パーティー等）になるとマナーが非常に悪い、精神衛生的に非常に問題、好きでキラー側をやっているわけで、こちらも生存者を友人とやる機会がありせっかく一緒にやっているのだから会話をしながらやりたい気持ちはわかるが、最低限のゲームプレイヤーとしてのマナー（フェアな戦い等）を厳守できるゲーム性が欠けていると感じる、そのため他の新規プレイヤーにおすすめできるゲームではないと感じています。","timestamp_created":1644975913,"timestamp_updated":1644975913,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537587165832519531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110331660","author":{"steamid":"76561199195475204","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1532,"last_played":1640809758},"language":"english","review":"I agree with the other's when they say the devs do not listen to the community, even though they most definently should, but when it comes to focusing on fun on here, I would say that the games pretty enjoyable with friends in customs or as survivors, always that tense feeling when the killer is chasing you which is pretty fun, 7/10 recommendation only because the competitive game play is pretty bad at the moment.","timestamp_created":1644975755,"timestamp_updated":1644975755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110330942","author":{"steamid":"76561199091711030","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":53092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":285,"playtime_at_review":39816,"last_played":1660600237},"language":"spanish","review":"Me encanta este juego, es muy entretenido y nunca me canso de jugarlo.

It's heavily unbalanced, the maps are terrible, a multiplayer 1v4 game that is terribly competitive, and just one of the worst gaming companies to have worked on a type of game like this. Not to mention one of the worst communities out there as it's filled with toxicity and arguing. 1200 hours I've wasted my life on this game, for the devs to just constantly ignore the fans, block criticism at any given moment, and never keeping their word with promises they constantly make. Killers they seem to just rehash old powers constantly getting almost nothing original. Survivors are all the exact same so not much excitement for variation over there unless you put perks into play. Speaking about perks and leveling them up, the grind is absolutely ridiculous and extremely not fun unless you like wasting hours upon hours of your life to play with a certain build on a certain character which you may not even be able to do for a long ass time because you'd have to wait for the shrine to update with 4 new perks and just pray that it has what you want. 1200 hours and still I have yet to get all perks on any killer or survivor.

Aż pewnego dnia koledzy namówili mnie do kupna tej gry, lubię klimat horrorów więc się ją kupiłem, szczególnie jak była wyprzedaż, dokupiłem sobie jeszcze Stranger Things DLC. Ze znajomymi grałem przez ok 10H, jednak gdy oni przestali grać, ja w tej grze się niemal zakochałem i oto przegrałem w niej prawie 300H.\nKilka słów:\nDBD to gra multiplayer horror. Sama rozgrywka wydaje się prosta, 4 ocalałych biega po mapie naprawiając generatory i musi uciec nie dając się złapać zabójcy. Gracze mogą się wcielić też w killera którego zadaniem jest łapanie i zabicie wszystkich oclałaych.\nPo raz pierwszy jak wszedłem do gry przywitał mnie samouczek, jest on naprawdę przydatny dla każdego początkującego surva i kilera. Dzięki niemu gracz poznaje na starcie podstawowe wprowadzenie do świata DBD. Jednak jego przygoda dopiero się zaczyna.\nGra ma system leveli i rang, przez co gracz ma jakiś cel aby dalej grać w tą grę. Przez co levelowanie postaci oraz wbijanie rangi za które dostaje się jakieś nagrody naprawdę się nie nudzi. Jednak przejdźmy do mechaniki gry. Sama gra techniczne jest naprawdę dobra, przyznaję zdarzają się bugi, niektóre śmieszne, niektóre denerwujące lecz to tylko gra jak każde inne, zawsze gdzieś się błędy znajdą. Pierwszy raz jak zobaczyłem tą grę to pomyślałem że skoro można grac kilerem to pewnie będzie o wiele lepszy niż ludki, ale tutaj jest inaczej. Gra pomiędzy graniem ocalałym a zabójcą jest moim zdaniem zbalansowana i wiem że niektórzy tak nie sądzą i biegają solo po mapie nie współpracując z drużyną, a to jest pierwszy krok do porażki. System umiejętności jest inny niż w innych grach horror, tutaj chociaż są postacie i każde różnią się tłem fabularnym można modyfikować na swój sposób. Mam tu na myśli szczególnie survów. Ocalali nie posiadają mocy ( o nich zachwile) jak zabójcy, zamiast tego mogą posiadać przedmioty takie jak Latarki, Apteczki itd. Każda postać ma 4 miejsca na umiejętność, przez co gracz może bawić się tworząc i łącząc perki dając ciekawe buildy na taktyczne rozgrywki. Sprawa wygląda inaczej z perspektywy zabójcy, ci zamiast przedmiotów mają \"moce\" dzięki którym zabójcy różnią się swoim gameplayem i dobieraniem umiejętności.\nJeśli chodzi o grafikę to nie jest zła. Ja gram na średnich ustawieniach i gra mi chodzi w 150 fpsach.\nPodsumowanie:\nDeath By Daylight to gra idealna do gry w późnie wieczory z kolegami, posiada swe plusy i minusy\n\nPlusy\n-fajny klimacik\n-fajny system levelowania\n-dobra grafika\n-wiele postaci\n-dobry system umieętności\n-ogarnięci developerzy\nMinusy\n-gracz musi nauczyć się grać metodą prób i błędów aby ogarnąć mapy, kilerów oraz samą mechanike\n-większość postaci można odblokować jedynie za prawdziwe pieniądze, aniektóre zbierając \"niebieskie odłamki\" wbijająć lvl jednak jest to bardzo czasochłonne.\nOcena:\n8/10","timestamp_created":1644954872,"timestamp_updated":1644954872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110315309","author":{"steamid":"76561198838572678","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":20755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":750,"playtime_at_review":8902,"last_played":1660546514},"language":"spanish","review":"ta shido\n","timestamp_created":1644954729,"timestamp_updated":1644954729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110315297","author":{"steamid":"76561198008359722","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":74746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3225,"playtime_at_review":60329,"last_played":1660598462},"language":"english","review":"Would suggest you to play with friends, if ur lonely maybe play killer or just try to have fun in the soloQ.

Не вижу смысла говорить особо конкретно о геймплее, т.к. всё уже давно сто раз сказано и до меня.\nА вот о чём больше всего хотелось бы высказаться, так это о комьюнити. А конкретно, о значительной группе игрунов на сурвах, которые придумали свой \"кодекс\" и бесятся, когда бессовестные маньяки смеют его не соблюдать.\nДля незнающих, вкратце: фейскемпить (стоять возле крюка с повешенным выжившим), туннелить (бегать за одним и тем же сурвом, пока не убьёшь его), использовать НОЕД (перк позволяющий ложить выживших с одного удара, после открытия ворот), играть за таких манов, как Охотница, Палач, Немезис и, конечно же, Медсестра - вот это всё вам НЕЛЬЗЯ. \nПочему? Ну, естественно, потому что тогда сурвы могут проиграть и не получат удовольствия! Ну, вы ведь для этого играете за маньяков, правильно? Исключительно, чтобы сурвам было комфортно играть!\nЭто им можно генрашить, токсичить с фонариками, лежать возле шкафчиков/окон, из-за чего их невозможно поднять и т.д. А вот вам можно только чуть-чуть побегать, половить палетки лицом и ослепнуть от фонарика, чтобы потом вам поприседали на воротах.\nЛадно, а теперь серьёзно. Обращаюсь сейчас к той группе индивидов, о которых говорил выше: запомните раз и навсегда, задача игрока на маньяке - убить как можно больше сурвов за раунд, используя любые доступные средства, и до тех пор, пока эти средства не нарушают правил игры (т.е. без читов и багоюза), он имеет право и будет ими пользоваться. Если вы не можете победить кемпера, то может, попробуете, ну, например, ЧИНИТЬ ГЕНЕРАТОРЫ, не? Чтобы когда ман отошёл от крюка на карте уже было 2-3 заведённых гена. Но нет же, вы лучше будете бегать, как #### вокруг крюка, и ловить от мана хиты, чтоб потом сдохнуть всей командой на 5 холодных генах, и орать в чате, что ман #### кемпер. Играть научитесь, тогда и проигрывать меньше будете и орать не придётся.\nИ то, что я говорил о генраше, токсичном поведении и т.д. - да, порой это бесит, но я не ору об этом в послеигровом чате, т.к. это не нарушает правил игры. Да даже против лежания под шкафчиками я ничего не говорю, хоть это и является багоюзом, но тут уж вина не на сурвах, а на разрабах, который этот баг уже столько лет пофиксить не могут.\n\nАдекватнее будьте. Хватит портить мнение о комьюнити.","timestamp_created":1644952006,"timestamp_updated":1644952843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110312368","author":{"steamid":"76561198807319842","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":71,"playtime_at_review":18482,"last_played":1660063431},"language":"russian","review":"Говно
