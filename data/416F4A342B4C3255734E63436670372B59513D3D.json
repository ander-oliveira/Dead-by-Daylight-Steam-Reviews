The whole idea of 4 survivors vs 1 killer works perfectly. For the most part the game is balanced enough to give either side enough opportunity to win. The killers are exactly what you would expect. They are unstoppable, unrelenting killing machines. The survivors are, as they should be, just normal people. No powers, no ability to really fight back other then maybe shine a torch in the killers eyes. The whole idea is that you need to work with the other 3 survivors if you want to make it, so going Lone Wolf mostly gets you killed.\n\nThe only main issue with the game is the lobby system. As a killer, you'll find a game in seconds. As a survivor you can normally find one without much issue. However, try to be a survivor with say, 1 or 2 friends and you're likely to spend up to 30 minutes having to recreate and invite to the lobby as the search system fails and kicks you back to the main menu constantly! So you best be prepared to put up with this unless you have a full group.\n\nIn short, great game but not without it's flaws.","timestamp_created":1474816337,"timestamp_updated":1474816337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25694167","author":{"steamid":"76561198052642198","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":623,"last_played":1562358516},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра по задротить можно.","timestamp_created":1474816327,"timestamp_updated":1474816327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446554869413375854","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25694088","author":{"steamid":"76561198049679472","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":17490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10791,"last_played":1600598643},"language":"russian","review":"Лучше подождать, пока разрабам не надоест пилить костюмы и займутся оптимизацией.","timestamp_created":1474816056,"timestamp_updated":1474816056,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534421026706695557","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25694066","author":{"steamid":"76561198076811459","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":114,"last_played":1473195759},"language":"english","review":"When this game gets stable and reliable servers it will definitely be worth the purchase.

Many. Many issues.\n\n[h1]Straight to the good points[/h1]\n\nFor 20 bucks you're getting a game that has a lot of content, a large playerbase(This game has never really seen less than 10k players in the year or more since it's release) and no sign of it really dying down in playerbase. It's also well supported no matter what way you look at it; free content with every paid DLC(New maps, perks and sometimes items or addons with the paid part being killers and survivors which have three unique perks each, perks which you can still technically unlock for free through the in-game shrine system). They occasionally fill gaps between paid DLC with free DLC(New killers and new survivors) as well as constant balance updates and fixes although there's a lot of things that still need fixing.\n\nAll very good and noteworthy qualities for any game especially at the price.\n\n\n[h1]Now, the bad...[/h1]\n\nThe reason you might not want to play after a certain point and the reason why there are so many negative reviews from players with 100+ hours of gameplay and why they're completely justified in their frustrations and complaints and right to give a negative review despite how much they've played:\n\n\n[h1]1. Toxic[/h1]\n\nThe game is incredibly toxic once you reach rank 10 for both survivors and killers. There is no clear way for you to lower your rank save for grinding losses(A loss results in a single pip loss where there could be five pips in a rank). Survivors will BM you as a killer, complain when they die or lose a friend to the killer, claim they'll report you and all sorts. Killers will BM survivors by hook camping, face camping survivors and tunneling survivors to ensure they get a kill no matter what. They'll wait by a hook, tunnel the player that's been freshly unhooked just to secure a kill.\n\n[h1]2. Ranking is terrible and may as well be nonexistent[/h1]\n\nRank is just a number. There is no ELO, there is no MMR, there's nothing. The number you have beside your name in a lobby(Your rank) is the pool of players you'll be up against. Considering ranking up is, quite literally, just grinding ranks you have a lot of varied skill levels in each rank and rank 1 is just full of the biggest mix of players you'll ever come across in a \"ranked\" system. It basically doesn't work, it never worked and all it does is funnel toxic players into a single pit where everyone ends up hating each other.\n\nIt's horrible. Frankly the devs need to rework it completely and add some form of MMR or ELO. They should have different modes to cater to those who don't want to deal with parties of players.\n\n[h1]3. Forced to play \"ranked\"[/h1]\n\nYou're forced to only play in ranked. There is no way to opt out of this. It would be fine if the game had an ELO system but it does not. It just has a number system. Whatever number you get for your rank is the pool of players you go up against. Survive with friends can also take advantage of how terrible the ranking system is by having a single rank 20 player in their group so they(rank 1 survivors) can play against lower ranked killers(Around rank 10).\n\nThe biggest issue with \"ranked\" and how uncompetitive it is, is the fact you can play it with friends as a survivor, friends who can communicate freely using Discord or Teamspeak. If you spend any amount of time in this game you'll quickly find out how incredibly powerful Survive With Friends(SWF) is to the point they can mess with the killer, each body block him and deny him from hooking survivors despite being right next to a hook as three of time line up to block the hook and soak up a hit until his target wiggles free from his grip.\n\n[h1]4. Survive With Friends(SWF)[/h1]\n\nSWF can play in any match they want. They can play ranked with a group of four survivors and have no penalty for it and no way to combat it.\n\nSWF never should have been allowed in the game with the freedom it has. Survivors have been nerfed into the ground because of how powerful SWF is against a killer. You've had what would be viable solo survivors turn to dust because the perks they use were far too overpowered when used with three or four people communicating over voice chat. There's been some really nice perks that have been completely ruined due to nerfs to the point they're unusable and the main reason was because they were abused by SWF.\n\n[h1]5. Lack of real casual and ranked modes[/h1]\n\nThere's a serious lack of a real ranked mode. The mode we have right now is basically casual, a mode where anyone can join and, really, there is no balance in who you go up against. There should be a real ranked mode which has a form of MMR and a far higher and extending ranking system beyond the 20 ranks which is currently in the game. SWF should not be allowed in this mode. The playerbase is there, it's big enough to separate the game into casual and ranked it just needs to be done and well fleshed out.\n\n[h1]6. Item and addon balance[/h1]\n\nThere's very little balance here. Some of the items go against the flow of the game completely and they can be stacked easily. For one there's an addon for a toolbox you can add to any toolbox you want, even a crappy common toolbox that allows you to pop a generator in less than 30 seconds of having started the generator. This addon is called Brand New Part. It used to be a one off use item you could use and instantly fix a generator, now it speeds up the repair speed by triggering constant skill checks on the generator which in turn boost the time it takes to fix the generator. If a killer doesn't have the perk \"Hex: Ruin\" the game will be over in five minutes against a group of survivors who know what they're doing and use addons like Brand New Part.\n\nThere's plenty of items and addons like this that give instant heals on worthless items(common medkits) or addons killers have that make it incredibly unfair to go up against(Nurse with 4 blinks in a row which is impossible to get away from if the player is good with her). These extreme addons seriously need toning down to improve the flow of the game and not make it a pain for the side that has to face this.\n\n[h1]7. The BIG Problem[/h1]\n\nAll of this can be and should have been fixed a long time ago, especially for a game that has sold over two and a half million copies on PC alone, has quite a bit of DLC that sells really well and has a very healthy and consistent population. This game alone saved Behviour Digital from the absolute mess that was Warhammer 40K: Eternal Crusade. That's speaking volumes about how well DbD has done.\n\nThey need to fix ranked. They need to add casual in place of the current system. They need to remove SWF from ranked play altogether and add MMR or ELO to the game so it's not a mix mash of skill levels where the more you grind the further you progress to rank 1. After they fix this they need to balance the game around the higher tier players and see how the flow of the game is. In any other game your rank is where you should be. Here? It's not. It's where you bothered to grind to. You have people with 1k or more hours playing against people with less than 50 hours play time. That's not balanced. Someone with 1-2k hours played has a distinct advantage over someone with a fraction of that time played. These match ups should never happen and they wouldn't if the devs fixed match making and ranked in general.\n\nAddons and things that go against the flow of the game should be removed. If there's an addon that can finish a game in five minutes the devs seriously need to have a look at it. If it's a case of it's just too powerful and can't be fixed or nerfed to be unrecognisable then remove it. At the very least these addons should be used with a minimum of rare items or higher.

A survivor can sacrifice their teamate to save themselves, or risk their own life to help the teamate and gain more points. Killers can stay near the body on the hook, which guarentees that person will die, but the rest of the survivors can get generators working quicker, or the killer can run around looking for another survivor to kill, but risk letting the hooked survivor be saved. It's really enjoyable.\n\nThe only real downside is everything matchmaking related. I can't host a match as killer and invite my friend (but also have randoms join, it only allows for private game, though that means 1v1).\nThe ranking system is great and all, but it doesn't work, so there is no point, why give really good players a rank when they get paired with new players, for example: I started playing killer, the first 2 games I got paired with new players like me, but after that I started getting paired with people that are rank 10 and below, I even had a game with a 1 and a 5 in it, like damn, how am I suppoed to kill them after only a couple of games experience?","timestamp_created":1474796681,"timestamp_updated":1474796681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25688260","author":{"steamid":"76561198312734168","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":32707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10154,"last_played":1656767362},"language":"thai","review":"น่าเบื่อพูดจริงๆ","timestamp_created":1474796515,"timestamp_updated":1586001104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25688167","author":{"steamid":"76561198262644712","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":135955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32051,"last_played":1656462129},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego con una Ambientación y jugabilidad bastante buena , es simplemente de esos juegos que no te aburres de jugar (si no te gusta el género , no).Algo que tiene de bueno el juego es que está Balanceado de ambos lados (Asesino y superviviente) aunqué aun faltarán algunas cositas por arreglar, en cuanto a los bugs desde el ultimo parche que han metido los bugs son pocos.\n\nAlgo a favor que tiene el juego es que puedes jugar con amigos , crear partidas privadas y de ves en cuando jugar con alguien de una partida anterior.\n\nPor lo que le criticaría al juego es el sistema de matchmaking , es rapido pero te empareja con gente de rangos distintos .\n\nPara todos los que se quejan de no encontrar partida , deberían probar en cambiar la región de descarga de steam.\n\nPor todo lo demas el juego esta bastante bien.","timestamp_created":1474796147,"timestamp_updated":1480409624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25688081","author":{"steamid":"76561198091474993","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":867,"last_played":1599976121},"language":"english","review":"The creepier or scarier, the better.
