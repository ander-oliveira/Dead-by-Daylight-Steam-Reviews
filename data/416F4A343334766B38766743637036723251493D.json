Even some of the people who review this game poorly have 2000 hours on this game. \nThis game isn't a hide and seek game rather it's somewhat more like a fast pace chess game. Instead of trying to hide from the killer, the more optimal way to play is by looping the killer and the killer chasing the survivor both attempting to use mind games and reading each other's moves. What this means is that there is certainly a skill based game.\n\nSome reviews complain about bugs, toxicity, and the fact that the devs seems to cut corners a lot. The first two are certainly true. There is always something broken in every update but there's never been a bug that has made the game entirely unplayable and it's rare for a bug to get close. For example, a common bug is sometimes survivors wont make grunts of pain but it either fixes itself next game or only affects one survivor (who doesn't have Iron Will). In terms of the devs, I can see where people see this but I feel like some people are just being overly critical. One example is breakable walls. Basically they are walls that killers have to kick in order to make a doorway they can walk through. Most people hate these and wish that the devs would get rid of them. However the devs keep adding them to new and old maps. On one hand yes, the devs haven't even acknowledge the hate for breakable walls but on the other hand, they are already being implemented and it would be a pain to go back and redesign maps to fit the removal of breakable walls so they are kind of here to stay.\n\nOne complaint that I do have is that to get the most out of this game, you need to buy most of the Chapter DLC. You can get the killers and survivors in the Chapter DLCs by just playing the game but it takes forever and you are stuck using not so great perks and only 3 out of currently 23 killers.\nIf you only have some money the DLCs I'd recommend to get are: \n- Leatherface (The Cannibal has the best perk in the game to unlock, Barbeque and Chilli) \n- Demise of the Faithful (The Plague is a pretty balanced killer and has some decent perks to unlock, notably Corrupt Intervention)\n- Curtain Call (The Clown is bad, probably the worst killer in the game but he has Pop Goes the Weasel which another great perk.)\n- Of Flesh and Mud (The Hag is a really good killer and has Hex: Ruin which is another strong perk.)\n\nLuckily for Survivors, all the survivors have no special abilities and most of the good perks are in the base game.\nIf you don't care about having meta perks and just looking for fun, here are my recommended DLC\n- Cursed Legacy (The Oni is a very interesting killer as his play style changes back and forth mid-game depending on your power state.)\n- Lullaby for the Dark (The Huntress is the only straight forward projectile based killer.)\n- Descend Beyond (The Blight is just a wacky killer and fun for both Killer and Survivor.)\n","timestamp_created":1618768501,"timestamp_updated":1618768501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90535842","author":{"steamid":"76561197988470090","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1738,"last_played":1652987738},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam grę w 100%!\n\nA teraz na poważnie...

If you want to have your day wrecked by someone in need of an ego-boost, play survivor. In the meantime, I'm going to continue to contemplate the appeal of the \"uninstall\" button after almost 1000 hours and 3 years. \n\nI will say one thing though: it is truly impressive that a team of devs can make patches so progressively bad that you wish you could go back to playing the previous bad release.","timestamp_created":1618767372,"timestamp_updated":1618767476,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90534656","author":{"steamid":"76561198968500906","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1649459673},"language":"english","review":"very fun game if you can moonwalk 360 lmao","timestamp_created":1618766887,"timestamp_updated":1618766887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90534316","author":{"steamid":"76561199070782823","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1623328458},"language":"russian","review":"rj","timestamp_created":1618766477,"timestamp_updated":1618766477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90534301","author":{"steamid":"76561199038430325","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":18883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":575,"playtime_at_review":2650,"last_played":1660601821},"language":"english","review":"Straight poggin ngl","timestamp_created":1618766450,"timestamp_updated":1618766450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512048184871673584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90534120","author":{"steamid":"76561198013906758","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":26859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":807,"playtime_at_review":5723,"last_played":1660571047},"language":"german","review":"Such Facecamp\nMuch Mori\nWould Die Again 10/10","timestamp_created":1618766213,"timestamp_updated":1618766213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90534070","author":{"steamid":"76561198095503906","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":44205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":50,"playtime_at_review":3245,"last_played":1659644175},"language":"russian","review":"моя малышка","timestamp_created":1618766154,"timestamp_updated":1618766154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90533938","author":{"steamid":"76561198827664351","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":25357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1657358199},"language":"english","review":"E","timestamp_created":1618765972,"timestamp_updated":1618765972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90533800","author":{"steamid":"76561199158090605","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":57,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1659563560},"language":"english","review":"Where to start, I first stumbled across this game a few years ago, I was watching Twitch and noticed a streamer playing it.

Pero primero quitamos la piel porque es muy dura.\nPonemos la panceta a fuego medio para que se vaya haciendo despacio.\nMientras tanto cortamos las verduras en cuadrados pequeños.\n¡No olvidamos de remover la panceta!\nAñadimos a la sartén con la panceta un chorro de aceite. A ser posible el de oliva.\nY añadimos las verduras.\nAñadimos 1 pizca de sal.\nY, a fuego medio bajo, cocinamos hasta que la cebolla, la zanahoria y el apio se ablanden.\nAñadimos la carne de ternera.\nHacemos el fuego medio alto y removemos muy bien.\nUna vez la carne haya cambiado de color añadimos 1 vaso de vino tinto.\nCocinamos hasta que se evapore el alcohol.\nAñadimos salsa de tomate o tomates troceados. Yo voy a utilizar los tomates que vienen enlatados enteros pero puedes utilizar la salsa de tomate que más te guste.\nUna vez que la salsa haya empezado a hervir hacemos el fuego bajo y ponemos la tapa pero dejando un hueco para que salga el vapor.\nLa salsa hay que cocerla de 2 a 4 horas. Con mucha calma. Si ves que se está quedando seca añade un poco más de agua o de caldo\nHe tardado en cocer cocer la salsa 3 horas.\nSalpiméntala a tu gusto.\nAñade la leche para equilibrar la acidez.\nLa salsa está lista.\nPASTA CASERA\nLa pasta la puedes comprar o puedes hacerla. Yo te voy a enseñar como hacer la pasta para la lasagna.\nTamiza en un recipiente 200 g de harina.\nAñade 1 pizca de sal.\nCasca 2 huevos grandes.\nAñade 1 chorro de aceite de oliva.\nRemueve muy bien.\nTermina de hacer la bola con la mano.\nEsta masa no hay que amasarla mucho. Solo integrar muy bien todos los ingredientes.\nLa tapamos y la dejamos en reposo unos 20 minutos.\nAntes de pasar la pasta por la máquina la estiramos un poco con rodillo. Para más información sobre cómo hacer la pasta casera te invito a que veas este vídeo.\nSi no tienes la máquina para hacer la pasta estírala con el rodillo.\nEl grosor de la pasta ideal es cuando empieza a transparentarse un poco.\nCorta las láminas en tamaño 10x12 cm. Me han salido 17 láminas.\nEn abundante agua con sal cocemos la pasta.

Whenever I dive myself into this world, I am always filled with both joy and fear at the same time, which is quite hard to explain, but in fact this is what makes this game so outstanding. Not so many games out there can do the same thing as thus game does. It is fun to play, and it is even more fun to play with friends. But I recommend playing the game alone cuz it will push your stress level to the max lol :D . When you play as the survivors, you will have that feeling of cowardice, and itimidation, the opposite to the killers, you will feel much more powerful and cruelly savage. In a word., this game is worth a penny, give it a go guys. The community here is also huge as well. I totally recommend this master piece. Only with one hour in the game, i can say that i am wholely into this. Get myself through a couple of tutorial stufff and some blood point investment, characters, outfits, etc.","timestamp_created":1618759147,"timestamp_updated":1618759441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ434vk8vgCcp6r2QI="}
