always felt like this game was in a hard space, because you have to constantly balance killers and the survivors. \nWith a group of friends it can be a really fun game (provided you don't get in a lobby with a killer cheating or abusing some absurd exploit with their set of skills)\n\nThough after steadily seeing less and less about changes and ignoring valid criticism about the current game state, Behavior Interactive have decided to further creep into the more predatory side of game development; and released that they'll be adding NFT's into the newest chapter. \nI can already see where this game is going and it breaks my heart because it was a staple game for me and my friends when we couldn't think of what to play.\nThis is so blatantly about money for them, that they'd hop on the money laundering trend too.\n\nAlso the only thing they've said on it so far is to give out 100k bloodpoints like that'll smooth it all over,\n[u]absolutely tone deaf and out of touch with the reality of its playerbase.[/u]\n\nValve has also stated that they wouldn't allow blockchain or NFT's to be sold through games or their platform so it'll be important to see how BI handles this(as well as see if valve holds to their word on the matter)\n\nTLDR: game was pretty fun with friends even if hackers/cheaters made it absolutely awful. \n          This touch into NFT's just shows that they'll use any means to take as much money \n          from you as they can so they can to cash out on the scam trend that it is.\n          I personally can't recommend giving Behavior Interactive any business

This game has it's genuinely satisfying moments, and it has the potential to be enjoyable. There is [i]some[/i] fun to be had in this game in its current state, although admittedly the fun moments are few and far between in its current state.\n\nHowever, the devs of the game do not care about what their players want. They do not care about making the game fair and balanced for both sides, and they certainly don't care about the longevity of their game. Every DLC has featured characters that were more and more unfair. There is an insane amount of powercreep in this game. This game used to have substance and actual content, and I had hope for the future of this game. Dead by Daylight has become nothing more than a money grab. No real effort has been put into this game in years. \n\nIn light of their most recent money-making scheme, a set of NFTs relating to the newest chapter, I've uninstalled this game, likely to never return. In doing this, they have shown that they truly do not care about their fans opinions. They have shown how far out of touch with both reality and their players they really are. I hope steam removes this game off their catalog in line with their recent policy.

In the past 5 years I've wasted about 2k+ hours on this game.\nI guess I can't say wasted, it was fun in the beginning. It really was, it was unlike any game I've ever played. It's been going downhill for arguably 2 years or so. I'm sure that changes depending on who you ask, but that's my take on it. \nThe Devs are money hungry. They genuinely don't care about the longevity of this game and it shows. Their greed WILL be the end of this game, and I'm sure you can guess why based on other reviews posted at this time. They really only care about getting new players, and those new players will quickly become \"old\" players and they'll be slapped with the hard truth that the devs do NOT care about your gaming experiences. Shitty hitboxes, 5 year old bugs, toxic players, constant DC's, a huge wave of hackers. I'm sure I'm missing many other points.\nBeyond the Devs constant excuses and blatant disregard for any helpful tips on this game, the community is very toxic. I'm not saying *everyone* is, but more often than not you will be met with pure toxicity and nothing else. \nIf you would have asked me 2 years ago if I'd recommend this game, I would say absolutely. Now I'm going to tell you to save your time and money. If you want fun matches for about 100-200 hours then go for it, the devs literally only care about the health of this game for new players so you'll be having a good time. But I wouldn't waste my time. I'm sad to say this game will end up in the graveyard of games in my library, but I guess they'll end up there in due time. \nI wish this game took a different turn. It had so much potential. But after their most recent stunt with NFTs, I can't trust this game or the company behind it anymore. BHVR single handedly ruined the trust of its players and many, many content creators/streamers who loved this game and gave them the benefit of the doubt for YEARS. \nHope this helps you chose to not get this game.","timestamp_created":1634598052,"timestamp_updated":1634598746,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":269,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.798493802547454834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101270453","author":{"steamid":"76561198079462091","num_games_owned":468,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":23411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19117,"last_played":1656616313},"language":"english","review":"dead by daylight WAS A good game, until they decided to release the hellraiser chapter and didnt tell anyone who bought it that they were unwittingly supporting NFT's that they were working for months on prior to release. a really shitty way of doing business and a really easy way to get rid of players","timestamp_created":1634598047,"timestamp_updated":1634598047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640541195869445801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101270366","author":{"steamid":"76561198153149784","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18518,"last_played":1647649687},"language":"english","review":"unsintalled after i heard they were doing nfts. very disappointed in the company, wish i could get a refund","timestamp_created":1634597865,"timestamp_updated":1634597865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539287149906158447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101270322","author":{"steamid":"76561198040617999","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6379,"last_played":1634572888},"language":"english","review":"The shitty MMR, SBMM and playerbase aside the devs going in supporting NFTs is honestly worse.\nI can deal with the toxic endgame chat, being called various slurs and tunnelled to death, but I draw the line at wankers supporting MLM for men.","timestamp_created":1634597775,"timestamp_updated":1634597775,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540850400924682617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101270307","author":{"steamid":"76561198041315009","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":15492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15164,"last_played":1658337937},"language":"english","review":"as if behaviour werent bad enough they now support nfts lmao","timestamp_created":1634597758,"timestamp_updated":1634597758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563647329807281494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101270293","author":{"steamid":"76561198353866599","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":15923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15899,"last_played":1658244443},"language":"english","review":"Take off the NFT bs and actually get a team who can fix your unbalanced, messy product","timestamp_created":1634597726,"timestamp_updated":1634597726,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541664302349090576","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101270292","author":{"steamid":"76561198083854069","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":33659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":3108,"last_played":1659933730},"language":"english","review":"I love the toxic drama of the game.

(and it could honestly only be a matter of time before they get stuff too, you never really know.) most survivors have a LOT of cosmetics too, usually at least a full page or two, especially if they aren't from a different property. as long as behaviour can easily make cosmetics for a character, they're going to do it. some characters get more than others, as they're more popular, but even then the less popular characters have a substantial collection. comparing this to killers, while only 1 killer lacks cosmetics that you can buy (freddy kreuger), not a single killer has as many cosmetics as the survivors with the most cosmetics. many have less than 5. nemesis, for example, launched with no cosmetics while his accompanying survivors, leon and jill, launched with 2 each. despite his frequent pick rate after release (due to the influx of new players that bought the resident evil dlc and the game at the same time), he only got a skin relatively recently, and it was just 1. meanwhile, leon and jill are receiving new cosmetics for christmas, which nemesis is not privy to. this is emblematic of the emphasis placed on what will get behaviour the most money. they release more paid content for the larger part of the playerbase, and make sure to do it at an incredibly rapid pace. skins are released faster than the patches for bugs, faster than hackers are banned, faster than new content that actually changes the gameplay. skins are THE priority for behaviour, and they rest above everything else. it also dabbles in frequent battlepass content, which is 100% cosmetic stuff, and that exclusivity and timed nature is a huge draw for paying customers. thus, dead by daylight is a money printing machine, and a very efficient one at that. according to some random website, behaviour's estimated annual revenue is 124.2 MILLION DOLLARS. dbd is really their only popular property, so the vast majority of that (theoretical) income is just dbd.\n\nlet's go back to talking about the gameplay. there is an immense skillgap among the players. the greatest killer mains can squish new survivors into the earth, and the greatest survivor mains can bully a new killer into literally quitting the game. it's very common for new killers to get recklessly tossed into games with top-rank survivors as the game decides their MMR (match making rating), and in turn, it's very common to see these killers delete the game off of their computer. it is intensely unfun to play badly against good survivors. at least if you're a survivor you'll just die and get into a different game, but survivors can hold the killer in a game for upwards of an hour, maybe more. the game caps off all matches at 2 hours, but that's still awfully long for a match that you're stuck in when you're having a horrible time. the game is set up to try its absolute best to prevent the killer from getting any more than 2 kills, since the supposed \"perfect match\" is 2 kills, 2 escapes. any time the killer gets more than those 2 kills, their MMR will skyrocket. this just isn't fun.\n\ndbd's biggest problem is that it is very difficult to have fun when you're losing. losing on either side includes a lot of being immobilized, whether that's sitting on a hook or getting whacked over the head with a pallet. this is the cardinal sin of a video game, as what most people want to do when they play a game is to be able to play the whole time that you're in a match. survivors don't disconnect when the killer finds them in their hiding spot, they disconnect when they get downed and are about to be hooked. killers don't disconnect when a survivor escapes them in chase, they disconnect when they get DSed and have to sit there for 5 long, painful seconds while everyone gets away. it's like everything is designed to be plain annoying, with so many things constantly stopping you from moving. dead by daylight is simultaneously insanely difficult to enjoy and insanely addictive. everything feels like it's just out of your grasp, and maybe if you keep playing you'll get it this time. and to be fair, winning is very satisfying. whether you were able to run the killer around for 5 gens with your knowhow of looping or got great results from your trap setups, when everything comes together at the end of the game and you make your opponent(s) suffer a crushing defeat, you feel incredible.\n\nin the grand scheme of things i don't have very many hours in the game. the best players tend to have 3,000 hours at the minimum, and i've seen people with over 10,000. people DO enjoy
