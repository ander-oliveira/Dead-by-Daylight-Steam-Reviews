Uninstalled till its fixed, maybe ill change my review then, but as of right now? Nah dont waste your money or your time.\n\nApril 9, 2021 Update.\n\nI uninstalled your game, after my last review. I told you I uninstalled it, and I wouldnt be back till you fixed it. I play with a few friends who took part in the last PTB before the new killer came out, and they said the movement and the such was better than it had been at you're last giant fuck up. So i re-installed, and gave it a try. \n\nNow I'm here. After once again, uninstalling your game. I have put over 1000 hours in your game, and a good deal of money. Enough is enough however. All i have dealt with is killer hit validation being garbage, Tunneling, and camping killers. You have done literally nothing, to fix these massive issues with your game. You THINK you do, but tbh, you don't. You only give a shit about new content, and dont get me wrong, everyone loves new content. But when you break your game so vastly in the process, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Its literally always 1 step forward, 2 steps back with you guys. You value players who have had 3 hours in the game, over players who have thousands of hours, and stuck with you through the bullshit. So when this game starts to die (Because it is) just know, that when you're making less, and less, and less, each month. This was the reason. You fucked the people that actually gave a damn.

    This review might be a bit lengthy because there is a lot to this game that I believe needs to be taken into consideration before, and while playing this game. I first bought this game when it first came out on PC (and boy was it a train wreck! Bugs was an understatement, you'de be lucky to make it into a match!) back in 2016, and since then, BHVR has made DRAMATIC improvements to the game which includes bugs fixes (a whole hell lot of em'), re-balances of many, many things, reworks of maps and characters, graphics updates, animations, and so on and so forth. Why am I starting my review with this? Because from my perspective from someone who has watched this game progress for so long, there is is TON of progress and effort that has been put into it to, not only keep it afoat, but attract new players to its ever growing development.\n    Before I try to sell any new players right away, hold onto your 20$ still because I want to be fair. There are, like with any game, downsides. With all of these updates to the game, there is going to be bugs, as well as new balancing issues that arise from it. Most large updates contain a plethora of bugs that come with it, some so bad that certain mechanics stop functioning. This can be troubling when you wish to get into the game and experience this positive change that they attempted to add to the game. However, giving it time, BHVR has shown that they do clean the bugs up after a certain period of time, so it is not left unattended. Now the new balancing issues that come into play. With reworks of maps, and characters and perks, sometimes the opposite of what the devs attempted to do (balance something) happened, and something feels a bit one sided. The relatively recent rework of the map \"Mount Ormond\" had me scratching my head. While the idea of reworking the large, dull, objectively Survivor-sided map was applauded, the rework felt as if it pushed the map further towards those issues. It looked different, but still PLAYED as a large, dull, arguably survivor sided map with perhaps less pallets now. There are other examples of this throughout the game.\n      As a new Player you may as yourself \"Would I want to play Survivor or Killer\"? And to that I would have to tell you, Both! The game allows you to play as both sides, and both sides give you two different experiences of the game, as well as the ability to use a ton of different perks. This, to me, is a really big positive for the game, as unlike the typical PvP game, it is Asymmetrical, so if you do better working with a team and co-op'ing, survivor is the way to go. If you don't synergize with other people as much, or would prefer to work alone, killer may be your style. This, however, can also lead to a flaw of the game, and that's balancing issues between killer and survivor. Because it isn't as simple to balance as a typical PvP game where the teams are balanced, so something could be as simple as lowering the damage, everything in this game that is perceived to be \"op\" or a problem is within the mechanics of the game itself and less to do with numbers, as well as how the players use these mechanics to be toxic. The basic job of a survivor is to finish fixing five generators that power exit gates so your team can escape and win the match. lots and lots of debate over time has been about the speed at which the gens are finished being done and whether its simply to fast for killers to keep up with. As a killer main myself, I have questioned this when 2 gens finish at the same time in a match i'm in, and just how I could have ever avoided that. \n     Killers can also have their balance issues. Ghostface, for example, has an ability that is notoriously broken for \"Exposing\" people (\"Expose\" is a proc in DBD that is inflicted on a survivor for a period of time, allowing them to be one shot) unless they look at him, but its janky. Very...very..janky. You could be looking right at him and he will still expose. Another major issue with the game mechanic that has less to do with the in-game stuff and more with the matchmaking itself. DBD has a ranking system, rank 20 being the start and rank 1 being the highest. The matchmaking system....basically doesn't function very well (BHVR has mentioned the matchmaking system many times, and that they are working on doing something about it. Remember, this game is not your average PvP, I gotta assume it takes a bit of time to figure something out for a game like this) so a rank 18 killer could match with rank 3 survivors and get destroyed. Not the most exciting new user experience. Overall would I say the balancing issues are a make or break deal for this game? No. And here's why. This game requires a TON of adaptation. It takes time, and learning to memorize all the noises, such as the noises killers make, the sounds of various progress stages of generators, how to identify different types of perks and add ons while you are in game, and once you get to the point of memorizing all these things, you start to learn how to use it to your advantage. If you are playing killer and you don't want to be gen rushed, pace yourself, and do lapse around the gens, chase people off, and if its taking too long stop the chase and parol the gens again. If you are playing survivor, identify what killer you are messing with, and try to escape them in a way that challenges that killer. These are what will not only minimize the balance problems but will make the game more fun in the long run because you force yourself to strategize and make decisions based on the circumstances of the match. And as far as matchmaking issues go, I won't lie when I say i've played against some potato High Rank survivors.\n    Most of what I wanted to go over is covered, but the last I wanted to add I made sure to put last because this right here is, honestly, the make or break deal for many people, even experienced players. And that is the toxic community. The various ways Players will share their toxic ways include, but are not limited to, T-Bagging, flashlight clicking, multiple flashlight stunning during animations, chilling at the exit gate knowing the killer can do nothing about it, Camping the hook (while a survivor is dying on it so their teamates can't save them), Tunneling down a survivor to kill them off right away, needlessly slugging, \"Head on\" (A bullshit perk) SWF's, ect ect ect....The game on PC does have an \"after match chat\" that people will shit talk with and that can get pretty narly...N-words galore. Console players certainly get their taste of toxic messages too. Overall, if there's anything that will get you to not play this game, its the community. \n   Ok, Here's the scene. You are in an Asymmetrical PvP horror game, you either play killer by yourself against 4, or you play survivor with mates against 1 monster. No matter who you play, your skin is thick with blood, bugs from past updates, and the toxic spewings of t-Bags and \"gg baby noob\", 3 gens finish at once, including the last one. whether it's music to your ears or nails on your chalkboard, Everyone scrambles to the exit gates. The rank 3 surv calmly opens the door as the two rank 18's hide in lockers while the killer stampedes their way there. They get the gate open just in time, and the rank 3 stalls the killer in the gate while the babies run past and escape. High rank 360's and t-bags while using Dead Hard right at the killer for those sweet I-Frames until the killer lands a hit and instant downs....Hex:NOED activates. Someone didn't do totems. Killer picks up dick high rank and hooks them with a deep seeded satisfaction. Everybody leaves the match feeling bittersweet. End scene.\n    Does that sound like hell? You may want to save your 20$ for a Nintendo game.\n    Does that sound like hell but your kind of into it? well my masochistic friend, this may be just the game for you.\n    If you got the patience and the will to handle this game, then i'll be seeing you in the Fog.\n","timestamp_created":1613503743,"timestamp_updated":1613503743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86825526","author":{"steamid":"76561199025706048","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":22210,"last_played":1659904846},"language":"brazilian","review":"daora","timestamp_created":1613503678,"timestamp_updated":1613503678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86825303","author":{"steamid":"76561198046869394","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":20448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":19482,"last_played":1659714849},"language":"english","review":"it was really fun at first, the scares. my heart pulsing while running from the killer within inches. and then becoming a killer main that doesnt kill and only hooks cause i just want people to have fun. in the end now, its just this abstract game that has everything but lootboxes it feels like now. \n\nbut the problems that persisted since i got this game to this day are just the lack of care from idk, the design team, the dev team, the people who own the studio. maybe all three. idk...they made alot of improvement over the years they really have but it still feels like theyre flipping me off and telling me to suck an egg with how htey do things. just a severe lack of connection with the community. \n\nplus some bugs still exist even after playing the game for years and i wish i could vote maybe if i were to recommend this game instead of just yes and no. and ill be saying no simply because after a few years of experience and hanging out with the community and reading the forums that i feel like while the game may be fun at first but youll probably end up in the same situation as i if you keep playing for long.  ignorance was bliss is all i can say...","timestamp_created":1613503442,"timestamp_updated":1613503442,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxZWT1vcCd5WbywI="}
