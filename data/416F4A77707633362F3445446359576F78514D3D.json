The game allows you to make countless mistakes, and as a result take countless blows to the face. Be aware taht some of the killers (Pig, Ghostface, etc), will scare the sh*t out of you at one point. You will probably scream, and then laugh. There are so many different killers in the game to go against, you may think you have everything \"figured out\"... then a wild Pinhead comes out of the blue and brings you down a peg (literally if they have a mori). The idea of a team based game where you can't communicate with your team is a daunting task at times;, but should you succeed it's like taking out Goliath as David. \n\nAS A KILLER: It's be prepared and be aware. Your first game is a lot of running around and learning which each sound is trying to tell you, but after you hunt down your first survivor it all starts to come together. I've only managed to play a few different killers so far, as they each have such unique kits available. I found myself obsessing over different builds for The Plague, and how changing a single perk could alter the way the entire match has to be played. In Dead By Daylight the focus is on customization of the killer for the players play style instead of the other way around, which can lead to some pretty crazy builds. \n\nTHE MAPS: The DBD team made damn sure to go above and beyond when it comes to the lore, which in turn made each map that much more thematic. I will admit to have a horrid sense of direction, which resulted in many losses, but thanks to the detail of each map I never run out of things to see. \n\nOVERALL:Dead By Daylight isn't just another killer/survivor game, it's THE killer/survivor game.","timestamp_created":1657909224,"timestamp_updated":1657909224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118863182","author":{"steamid":"76561198963932388","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1659657973},"language":"english","review":"kinda fun, kinda liked it, eh.","timestamp_created":1657907502,"timestamp_updated":1657907502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118863150","author":{"steamid":"76561199159881194","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5645,"last_played":1658264970},"language":"english","review":"its a fun game","timestamp_created":1657907469,"timestamp_updated":1657907469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118862912","author":{"steamid":"76561199149470049","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":10483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2790,"playtime_at_review":6070,"last_played":1660510009},"language":"polish","review":"tak","timestamp_created":1657907096,"timestamp_updated":1657907096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118862836","author":{"steamid":"76561198088042611","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1657911331},"language":"german","review":"what the fuck shit. das spiel st√ºrzt dauernd ab beim  starten!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1657906996,"timestamp_updated":1657906996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118862457","author":{"steamid":"76561198016355876","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":1827,"last_played":1659825659},"language":"german","review":"Eigentlich ein gutes Game aber das so viele Killer immer am Haken Campen oder Patrouille laufen zerst√∂rt das Game komplett.","timestamp_created":1657906457,"timestamp_updated":1657906457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118861103","author":{"steamid":"76561198175315690","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4445,"last_played":1658273533},"language":"russian","review":"–ï—Å–ª–∏ –≤–∞—Å –±–∏–ª–∏ –≤ –¥–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ, —Ç–æ –≤–∞–º —ç—Ç–æ –ø–æ–Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è, –∏ –Ω–µ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ–º –≤—ã –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç–µ.","timestamp_created":1657904550,"timestamp_updated":1657904550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118860882","author":{"steamid":"76561198006936527","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":136092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1031,"playtime_at_review":134655,"last_played":1660500962},"language":"german","review":"Hass Liebe.

You can choose to be a survivor who aims to survive by opening the exit games via fixing generators, or be a killer who slaughters people for fun. Both are equally valid and fun to play.\n\nWhat I like about this game is that this game is very fun especially with friends. Although the game does not have a chat feature during the actual match which can prove to be somewhat good and bad depending on the perspective. Perks are the most critical factors on different fields such fixing generators, saving people, cleansing totems, surviving or killing survivors. While the perk acquisition is a bit slow and steady, it encourages the players to farm for bloodpoints. Each game lasts within 5-30 minutes.\n\nThe game is also F2P friendly in terms of perks. You can purchase perks from the shrine of secrets in the event that you do not want to purchase a character, or you are saving iridescent shards. In the event you want to level up a character, there are a lot of opportunities to acquire bloodpoints in game through offerings or challenges if you are bored. There are also free stuff given to players as they progress in the game similar to battle passes. Payments are optional in this game and are only placed upon costumes typically, battle passes and auric cells. However, I believe that buying characters through auric cells/bundles using steam funds are reasonable in terms of pricing. I made a few purchases on the game already and I do not have regrets.\n\nThe only downside of the game I can find is that the match making is too long especially during dead hours depending on your location. As it reaches around 8pm onwards on my timezone, the matchmaking queue can reach up to around 5-10 minutes factoring on how late it is and on your location. If there is a way to optimizing matchmaking queues, that would be recommended. Overall 8/10.","timestamp_created":1657898589,"timestamp_updated":1657898589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118856080","author":{"steamid":"76561198965278717","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":52,"playtime_at_review":14641,"last_played":1660070670},"language":"english","review":"This

What a game. Over my 1.4k hours in this game I‚Äôve considered all the things that continue to keep me playing, and enjoying the game, as well as more negative aspects of the game. Here are a list of pros and cons to consider before playing this unique game:\n\n[b] Pro: [/b] DbD is unlike any other game. Ok sure there are emerging asymmetrical horror games such as prop night and VHS, but these have their own gameplay mechanics and don‚Äôt really compete with DbD IMO. If you‚Äôre the sort of person that likes to try new games or think you might like the asymmetrical horror genre, DbD is it. \n\nThe gameplay is unique and quite fun. Although there are more boring aspects of gameplay which involve holding a button on the mouse or standing still, the enjoyable aspects of the game such as looping/chasing are really fun. \n\n[b] Con: [/b] Some of the gameplay mechanics are stale. The same small handful of perks have been meta for years with minimal changes. However, a large number of perks are being reworked next patch, so the devs are showing that they‚Äôre at least willing to shake up the meta recently. Furthermore, the meta gameplay strategies of camping and tunneling for killers and holding M1 on gens is quite boring. Furthermore, every time a new patch drops, a dozen or so new bugs appear. Most of these aren‚Äôt game breaking and don‚Äôt affect the gameplay experience too much, although some can be bad and/or go unpatched for weeks.\n\n[b] Pro: [/b] DbD is quite enjoyable as a new player. DbD has a large roster of survivors and killers to play as/against, as well as maps to play on, and hundreds of perks to choose from. This is quite engaging as a new player and keeps the game interesting as there‚Äôs always something new to learn. Furthermore, the horror elements of the game are most interesting at the start.\n\n[b] Con: [/b] DbD is overwhelming for a new player. Although everything is pretty fun at the start, it‚Äôs also a considerable task to remember every perk and addon on each side, as well as each killer‚Äôs abilities. Furthermore, the grind in this game is extraordinary. Thousands of hours are required to unlock everything, although he devs are attempting to reduce this. \n\n[b] Pro: [/b] The people. There are some pretty cool people in the DbD community which I‚Äôve had the pleasure of meeting and playing with. I‚Äôve also had good chats with people in post-game chat. Playing the game with friends is enjoyable as you can play as relaxed or competitively as you like.\n\n[b] Con: [/b] Also the people‚Ä¶ Man this game is toxic, and I‚Äôve played league previously for 6+ years. Whether it's people flaming in post-game because you didn‚Äôt play a certain way, or people going out of their way to complain on your profile. Not an issue if you have thick skin and can laugh it off but there are plenty of children in this game. \n\nIn conclusion, although Dead by Daylight is far from a perfect game. Its enjoyable with the right mindset and good fun with friends. Excited to see the direction it takes over the coming years. \n","timestamp_created":1657862638,"timestamp_updated":1657862638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118835316","author":{"steamid":"76561198029707219","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":14294,"last_played":1660233552},"language":"english","review":"is gud","timestamp_created":1657860112,"timestamp_updated":1657860112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118835242","author":{"steamid":"76561199274138712","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":69,"playtime_at_review":1091,"last_played":1660455034},"language":"english","review":"love it.","timestamp_created":1657859965,"timestamp_updated":1657859965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118834905","author":{"steamid":"76561197960364492","num_games_owned":1412,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":107870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2026,"playtime_at_review":103106,"last_played":1660552086},"language":"english","review":"Since I started playing this game, my kids don't speak to me anymore.
