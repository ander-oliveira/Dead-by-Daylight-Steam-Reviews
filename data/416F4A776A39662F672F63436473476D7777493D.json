Many of the issues I am about to list are NOT commonly deal-breakers for people with whom I've discussed Dead by Daylight, so please read over this list rather than letting me scare you away.\n No Social Control\nThere is a near omnipresent theme in this game of players inflicting incredibly harsh, obtuse, and abusive language and general treatment upon other players regardless of identity, role, or performance. This signals an unhealthy community within the game, and the report system is present on only one screen throughout with no sense of feedback or follow-up. Typically, game developers take many measures to address this issue. Many online games offer statistics on the main menu displaying a number of banned players by week to show that work to clean away toxic players is actually happening, which discourages toxicity and instills faith in use of the report system. Some use more sophisticated report options allowing use of screen captures and automatically generated tags to include based on who and what you are reporting. And many games utilize automated detection of derogatory and threatening language to help find and filter out habitual offenders.\n No Social Cohesion\nThe feeling of being separated from other players and placed at odds with everyone, even fellow survivors, eventually brings out the worst in people. When you join a lobby as a survivor there is very limited time to chat with other survivors before the round begins to load, there is no voice chat, there is no way of communicating with the person playing the killer, and during the lengthy load screen that follows there is no chat at all. There is no obvious social reward for the effort of being nice to an opposing player and no system in place which would make you feel punished or unwelcome for harassing, griefing, or taunting. While the game by itself can be fun, social interactions are a big part of online games. By not facilitating communication and bonding experiences for players, and by segregating chat between players by platform (PC and console) and by role (survivor and killer), there is little chance for sharing in positive encounters. One way in which games facilitate more positive interactions is by offering differing game modes or objectives that break the pace and monotony of the usual gameplay and allows new players a chance to learn game mechanics they would otherwise neglect. Devs have normally approached this with goals like: maintaining the game’s overall character; using only (or mostly) currently present game mechanics; and presenting a new challenge with a reasonable learning curve. It’s like logs and exponents, same components with a fun flip for a new direction – hopefully one that feels more dependent on giving fellow players a “yes, and” rather than “tit-for-tat” mindset. One relatively easy example would be to take the tutorial levels and schedule a server to run multiplayer versions of the tutorial levels with chat enabled throughout so that experienced and new players may teach and learn but may progress independently without worry over being held back. This does not allow nor reward a tit-for-tat behavior, and can encourage a more “yes, and” attitude.\n Operant Conditioning\nWith nearly every attempt at playing as a killer you will notice that after the round is over, at least one of the survivors will type up a comment that makes it all too clear that you are not being perceived as a fellow gamer, but as an enemy. It does not matter what you did while playing as a killer. You may perform the role excellently or poorly, ruthlessly or playfully, but some one will almost always express ill will toward you once it’s over. And it’s not entirely their fault. Regardless of this being a game, they have little reason to believe you are here to have fun with them. The way their experience since turning on the game has put them on edge, denied them healthy socialization, and conditioned them to be at odds with you. Every visual and audible stimulus the game directs at them provides chemical rewards and punishments for behaviors, but they are only able to observe those behaviors through their own lens. There is no chance, no stimulus nor signal to make them associate any of this with the good will and intentions of other players just here to have a good time, nor to acclimate to the idea that, “no matter how terrifying this round is I am still just basically goofing around with potential friends.” The seemingly ironic lack of any opportunity to acclimate to these situations is pretty impressive, given that the game devs have hinted at possessing a basic understanding of this need with the perk “After Care.” Not everyone that plays this game can keep a reasonable perspective in the wake of the negative feedback and adrenaline, and that’s understandable. Sometimes people just need a warm and shiny reminder that this is just a game, and no one is actually trying to kill you.\n Clarity\nOver the five years since Dead by Daylight’s release I have seen only the slightest improvement in basic elements of presentation. This includes things like descriptive text that explains rules, perks, items, limitations, values, approximations, frequencies, etc, as well as the consistency of the language used to explain all of this. For example, you maybe looking over your items to try and decide what will be best for you during the next round, or trial, and you observe that all of the descriptions seem deliberately lacking. You often cannot tell if the effects of an item stacks with other items, and since they use words like “Moderately; Considerably; Charges” in place of the actual percentages and times you will have trouble sifting through the poor word choices to learn how to check if an effect is stacking or if it is bugged. In leu of using clear language there is a section available from the main menu that is basically a Players’ Handbook, it’s called Help & Tutorials, and if you want to understand what any of the expansive terminology means you will need this and deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki. The portraits to identify survivors provide nearly no detail to help you figure out who anyone is or what they are doing. After a round is over, there is no detail to tell you what character anyone was playing or what they did. There are also a lot of opportunities in the quotes provided under item descriptions for character backgrounds and game lore to shine through, but instead you usually get completely inexpressive or irrelevant quotes and expansions on undeveloped characters – like reading in-jokes on a billboard.","timestamp_created":1610777103,"timestamp_updated":1610777103,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480069339275360107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84770850","author":{"steamid":"76561198232405984","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1655095898},"language":"english","review":"Just DC when you see myers","timestamp_created":1610777102,"timestamp_updated":1610777102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84770750","author":{"steamid":"76561199088662740","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":45771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1659158633},"language":"english","review":"its, fun, challenging and lots of adrenaline","timestamp_created":1610776951,"timestamp_updated":1610776951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84770685","author":{"steamid":"76561198096552502","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":52001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18441,"last_played":1646652466},"language":"russian","review":"4 убийц и 1 выживший","timestamp_created":1610776847,"timestamp_updated":1610776847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84770252","author":{"steamid":"76561198264152052","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":17541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5563,"last_played":1655354281},"language":"english","review":"Came back to game after months, realized it is still just a 4 year old dragging their face across a keyboard to code hitboxes, close game.

Dead by Daylight...(or DBD for short) what can I tell you about this game?\nFirstly, if you're a loner, you don't have any friends, and you want to take that out on others by playing Killer here's a step by step guide on what you should do:\nStep One: Go to your nearest Medieval Fair and buy a [i]FULL[/i] plate of steel armor to protect you against the onslaught of Lipton teabags, survivor teabags, flashlight saves, pallet stuns, 360s, moonwalks and SFW groups all running DS, Unbreakabill, BT, Deadhard, Sprint Burst, Keys, Adrenalines, and maps.\nStep Two: Buy a large bag of potatoes, or better yet start your own potato farm and pepper farm with a deep fryer so you can make fries with the salt you will either deliver or receive playing either role.\nStep Three: Buy a custom made mug with the engraving of \"tears\" on the side just so you can stay hydrated when you are having yourself having to sweat just a little bit harder than the other guy.\nStep Four: Realize that this games servers will not always support your network even if you have a godly computer.\nStep Five: Realize that not all sfw want to cause you grief, not all Killers want to cause you grief and that if

get me wrong, I love this game. It is an amazing game. BUT there are many things you should know about it before you even think about buying it. \n\nMatchmaking: Its a joke. You will be placed with beginners and those that have played the game for 5000+ hours in back to back games. It \"resets\" every month, but that just means good players who don't play for a while will be lower ranks, not where they actually belong. \n\nDevs: They. Are. Ridiculous. They own the market on this kind of game, and they just refuse to try very much. The game is stuck on an update plan for every few months, but every update just brings unwanted changes. Sure, some things might get fixed, interesting things might get added. But there have been so many things that literally no one asked for, and we get stuck with it. The devs balance the game around statistics instead of in-game scenarios, and they also balance it around their poor playing skills. There are multiple clips out there of the devs playing badly, and then a buff or nerf comes out of it. And after they do all of that, they forget to fix any of the bugs.\n\nBUGS: It is spaghetti code. It doesn't make any sense. People's hair cosmetics will just float around. Killers will have game-breaking bugs. People will just float around the game. And some of these bugs are prevalent in the PTB. THE. PTB. That is the point of a PTB, to find and fix the bugs. But no, they just let it release. It's not like the players will find another game like it.\n\nThe rift: Its a battle pass. And let me tell you it is bare bones. The devs are afraid to even give you bloodpoints (the currency used to upgrade and better every character, you get millions), which aren't even that precious of a currency. They keep making a bunch of outfits that nobody asked for instead of fixing or balancing their game.\n\nToxicity: Everyone is toxic. You play as survivor, you get a toxic killer, play as killer, group of toxic survivors. And this isn't anything of the devs' part, I just think its important to know. With matchmaking being a blindfolded dart throw, the toxicity just makes the game even more miserable to play through.\n\nThey don't listen to their player base. They listen to numbers and stats. When a Perk is ridiculously unfun to play against, instead of saying \"hmm, unfun and easy to abuse when players are on comms? Maybe lets tweak it\", they say \"well whoever runs that perk has a good chance of dying, so its actually a bad perk.\" Absolute trash.\n\nIt takes forever to get the special currency to unlock new survivors and killers, and the prices are a bit high. Some killers you HAVE to spend real money on. This game is a mess. Maybe wait until they get their act together. BECAUSE I LOVE IT. I want it to succeed.

I could chase my friends and fuck around with them on maps. I love the designs of their own creations as well as how they take older killers and put them in a game. Unfortunately they've made this game almost unplayable.\n\nI heavily question their balancing team as they've not only made it harder for the survivors but have made it to where long time players no longer want to play. With these updates I feel as though they aren't paying attention to what their players want. \n\nWhere the Wraith had a shimmer to it that allowed those carefully watching to see him while he's invisible they now changed it to where he's almost completely invisible and you'd need the words best vision. They made the HUD more bulkier (In a game where you need to see a majority of your screen this is an issue) there was no need to fix it as it wasn't broken to begin with. They took out the matching system all together because it didn't work in the first place (A low rank killer getting nothing but high rank survivors shouldn't happen, same with low rank survivors getting a high rank killer). They made the auras even more unfriendly to colorblind people by making them harder to see all together. They've made it harder on all players and are failing at properly balancing the game. \n\nThey've come far from where they were before and no longer have the excuse of being an indie team. \n\nI highly recommend looking at the negative reviews of this game before buying. Many of these reviews have well thought out reasons as to why you shouldn't buy this game. \n\nThey also have a very sucky PR team and don't seem to care about the players at all.

  If you are considering purchasing Dead By Daylight. I must warn you that this game is NOT new player friendly for a variety of reasons. The most prominent being the game’s ranking system and perk system.\n   The game heavily favors the survivors over the killer, which is understandable. Survivor is the majority of the player base and if the majority of the player base is unhappy, you get League of Legends.\n\n   The perk system is the worst system for new players. At the time of writing this review there are over 120 perks to collect. Some perks are quite powerful, such as Hex: Ruin, Barbeque & Chili, and Decisive Strike, but the perks just mentioned are locked behind Downloadable Content that is priced around seven dollars. So, to have an edge or in some cases, even a fighting chance you need to shell out more money on top of the price of the game. This can be circumvented by the Shrine of Secrets which changes weekly and hold four perks: two for survivor, and two for killer. With the number of perks to collect getting the one you want is a low chance.\n\n   There is a grind to be able to do well within a match, after leveling for a while you will gain ranks, these ranks affect your match making on who you will face. To get the perks and the build you want, in the killer’s case, you will need to level multiple killers who all play differently. You will gain rank much faster than you will gain levels. Which will often left you feeling bullied at times from players who have simply put more hours and money into the game than you.\n\n   Remember the perks I mentioned earlier? Some important ones can taught to other killers or survivors, to be able to teach your perks on a particular killer say The Hag you will need to level their bloodweb up to about level 30 or above. Although this can be circumvented as all bloodpoints earned can be used in whosever bloodweb you wish so you aren’t limited to playing a particular killer or survivor until you’re burnt out on them by the time you get a build worth playing with.\n\nTLDR: Can’t recommend if you’re new to the game. It’s terrible for new players, unless you’re willing to shell out more money for it.\n","timestamp_created":1610756769,"timestamp_updated":1610756769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84757857","author":{"steamid":"76561198997619360","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":39666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":10,"playtime_at_review":4922,"last_played":1659825483},"language":"spanish","review":"es una mierda la nueva actualizacion, arreglen este juego de mierda loco, cagaron todo lo que esta bien en el juego, el fajador no se puede direccionar pero en videos si.

Её блятb придумал объёбaнный спидами свинопас после очередной др0чки на соседскую дочь. Она настолько выжимает жизненные соки, что на 2 день я стал педофилом, а спустя месяц я успел наложить на себя руки. Думаю, ещё через полмесяца я не просто наложу на себя руки повторно, но и начну бегать голым по улице, догоняя котов для увлечённого празднования их дня рождения. Не могу представить какое мракобесие творится в голове моего друга, у которого 1.5к часов...\nUPD:\nвот и стукнули мои 1.5к часов, теперь я имею полное понимание того мракобесия, что творилось у моего друга. Желание насиловать детей и бегать по улице голым оказалось только временным эффектом, теперь для меня нет большего счастья, чем наносить людям увечия. На днях увидел привлекательную женщину на набережной, и у меня сразу назрели на неё планы. Я следил за ней на протяжении 17 суток, я знал о ней буквально всё: от того, во сколько она ходит в туалет, до того где и какие родинки у неё есть. на 18 день я похитил её, это было не сложно, ведь весила она всего лишь 45кг 724г. Один удар камнем в переулке, через который она ходила на работу и дело с концом. Дома я использовал самые разнообразные инструменты для причинения боли, но делал я всё аккуратно, чтобы случайно не убить её. в ход пошло всё: ножи, трость, молоты, кулаки, младший брат. Я наслаждался каждым воплем, всхлипом, криком, но ей было не суждено найти спасения. За 1500 часов все мои соседи уже привыкли к тому, что в моей квартире какой-то умалишённый орёт. Казалось бы, дальше уже некуда, но у того самого друга уже 3к часов, и мне становится страшно...\nP.S \nПохоже моё тело начинает приобретать свой вариант морового скина\n","timestamp_created":1610747669,"timestamp_updated":1648715586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84751830","author":{"steamid":"76561199068087992","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1656298006},"language":"english","review":"me","timestamp_created":1610747498,"timestamp_updated":1610747498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84751661","author":{"steamid":"76561198067951563","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26873,"last_played":1640112767},"language":"english","review":"How is it that after every update Me and my friends have to verify file integrity and download more stuff?\nAlso from some tme I have to play on minimal setting, cause this game started to  stutter so much","timestamp_created":1610747273,"timestamp_updated":1620751720,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84751541","author":{"steamid":"76561199123615015","num_games_owned":513,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":3470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1479,"last_played":1656936142},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩简直刺激到没女盆友，自己撸了1分钟剁手买买买！","timestamp_created":1610747097,"timestamp_updated":1610747097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":39,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630110502243041992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84751382","author":{"steamid":"76561198191527119","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":133347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89748,"last_played":1657251944},"language":"english","review":"its a good game👍\nJane Romero Is Hot","timestamp_created":1610746870,"timestamp_updated":1655416402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj9f/g/cCdsGmwwI="}
