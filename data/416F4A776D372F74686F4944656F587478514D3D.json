maybe it's salt but my last game broke me woke me up from the allure of this game playing the role of a Horror Movie killer sounds great in concept but honestly all of the survivors have to be spawns of Sydney and Ash Williams because for the last few years playing as a Killer is a joke I've made it to Mid-High rank and while my hours aren't impressive in comparison to people who live on this game I think the ranks I've earned and nearly 200 hrs is enough for an online game for me to say I don't recommend playing this game if you're planning on being a killer main. I know I know the very famous perks are finally being nerfed however..it's not enough soon they will discover a new perk meta that lasts for the next 6 years and will abuse the hell out of

will say, any newcomers to the game may have to stick with this game to enjoy it fully. It can be frustrating if you don't know how to evade the killers, but man. The second you learn how to effectively survive chases, the game becomes 10 times more fun. The movement feels great, the strategy involved is super cool, and the more you play, the more fun this game gets.\n\n I play both killer and survivor, and honestly, I enjoy both equally. I tend to play survivor with friends, and killer when i'm alone, but both feel super rewarding to learn. When it comes to the killers, finding a character with abilities that suit your gameplay style is an amazing feeling, and it almost becomes second nature to use their abilities well once you learn them. So if you're on the fence,v you may not love it at first, but i assure you that sticking with this game is rewarding. Do some research on the perks, and different builds. and get yourself a head start. Great game.\n\n Oh and also, the devs care deeply about this game. Always listening to their playerbase, and frequently updating the game for the better. My only complaint is that i am a pig main. Please buff her.

When everything works there's literally no game like it--where else can you play as iconic film and TV characters like Ash Williams or Nancy Wheeler as you run away from villains like Ghost Face, Freddy Krueger, or Michael Myers? The premise might seem silly, but Dead by Daylight turns it into one of the most thrilling multiplayer experiences around, pitting one terrifying Killer against four hapless Survivors as they scramble to escape the map alive.\n\nAs the Killer, your job is to sacrifice the four Survivors to the Entity, the malevolent god in charge of the nonstop forced competition that is each \"trial\" in the game. And while you're outnumbered, the odds are heavily lopsided in your favour. You move faster, you have access to more immediate information, and, most importantly, you're the only one capable of dealing any damage. The Survivors can't do anything to harm you--at best, they can slow you down--while you're equipped with a wide array of offensive abilities.\nWith twenty different Killers to choose from (so far), there's no shortage of entertaining and diverse playstyles. The Hillbilly charges around the map with his chainsaw, the revving of the limb-lopping tool acting as a terrifying warning of what's to come. The Trapper discreetly leaves bear traps on the ground, catching any Survivors who aren't watching where they're going in a crippling vice of metal teeth. Silent Hill's Pyramid Head leaves a trail of horrible barbed wire anywhere he drags his giant blade, and he can send anyone who steps in it to his own special sacrifice areas.\n","timestamp_created":1658092524,"timestamp_updated":1658092524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118977869","author":{"steamid":"76561198352092159","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":36696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36696,"last_played":1658090570},"language":"russian","review":"Игра унылое Гавно, которое ни разу не изменилось за 6 лет своей карьеры. Наиграв 600 часов, осознаешь и понимаешь, что тебе не интересно гоняться за сурвами а-ля - карусель-карусель: это праздник для нас... тебе не хочется и нет желания обсалютно в это Гавно заходить, потому что смысла 0. игра была, есть и будет заточена под сурвов, и ни хуя вы с этим не сделаете, потому что так выгодно долбаебам разрабам. это скило-зависимая игра ни в коем рази. сдесь решают такие факторы как: карта, способности маньяка, наличие предметов у сурвов, знания сурвов, и их полная связь в дискорде. если эти параметры соблюдены... маньяку остается только сосать бибу, ибо очень редко и крайне тяжело что-то им сопротивопоставить, и геймплей сводится к одному всегда: догонялки около окон и поддонов. ВСЁ! игра себя исчерпала через год после выхода, теперь это не хоррор игра, а тупо соревновательный режим кошки-мышки. а нет, стоп... теперь уже и ЭТО ОТМЕНИЛИ. теперь вместо того, чтобы показать, какой конкретно ранг против тебя играл - это убрали. в угоду сурвам, я смею предположить, ио им всегда все не нравится... а разрабы идут у них на поводу, как портовые шлюхи. Ну и конечно, куда же без перков сурвов: крепкий орешек, часы, осколок, несокрушимый... и еще очень-очень много разного Говна, которое добавили разрабы, для их святейших сурвов. И ни хуя маньяк не сможет сделать таким сурвам, которые сидят в дискорде со стажем игры... Вывод следующий: хотите играть в эту ебучую кашу из помой, чтож дерзайте, но только за сурвов. ибо поверьте, играя за маньяка, вы будете только бомбить и испытывать серьезные психические головные боли, от тупости данной игры, в пользу сурвов. Игра сдохла лично для меня, и в эту парашу возвращаться смысла нету. Однообразно, скучно, не интересно, никаких различных нововедений или улучшений или разных режим игра не предоставляет, не имеет, и не сможет никогда. потому что таков унылый геймплей этой залупы. все что имеется это каждые 3-4 месяца: новый маньяк, сурв и если повезет карта. Пошла на хуй это помойка. и ох как жаль что нельзя удалить с библиотеки эту игру. благо можно ее скрыть и не видеть и не слышать и не вспоминать никогда о ней.","timestamp_created":1658092069,"timestamp_updated":1658092069,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118976871","author":{"steamid":"76561198076333049","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":91474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":639,"playtime_at_review":90635,"last_played":1660530977},"language":"english","review":"its pretty good i guess...\n\n-edit 19JUL22-\nThis game now blows for survivors...fun killer matches though...","timestamp_created":1658090578,"timestamp_updated":1658262410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118976842","author":{"steamid":"76561198915045771","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1078,"playtime_at_review":1913,"last_played":1660532213},"language":"english","review":"This game is such a fun game to play with friends, and even more fun by yourself. highly recommend","timestamp_created":1658090536,"timestamp_updated":1658090536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118976451","author":{"steamid":"76561199082155399","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1858,"last_played":1658092556},"language":"english","review":"nice game :)","timestamp_created":1658089982,"timestamp_updated":1658089982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118976250","author":{"steamid":"76561198874412958","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":36084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":438,"playtime_at_review":34176,"last_played":1660597692},"language":"polish","review":"grajac w te gre przeklinam wiecej niz w przeciagu miesiaca, spierdolone na leb hitboxy, dead hard, ktory nie dziala i palety, ktore kurwa nie dzialaja. tyle razy sobie obiecywalam, ze odinstaluje te zjebana gre i chyba czas najwyzszy, bo predzej dostane nerwicy niz sie bede dobrze bawic grajac w nia","timestamp_created":1658089718,"timestamp_updated":1658089718,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118975831","author":{"steamid":"76561198195806465","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1819,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1660586072},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta bueno","timestamp_created":1658089147,"timestamp_updated":1658089147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118975457","author":{"steamid":"76561199369569910","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":60,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1660346679},"language":"english","review":"10/10 \n\n","timestamp_created":1658088676,"timestamp_updated":1658088676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118975072","author":{"steamid":"76561199003928231","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2312,"playtime_at_review":4986,"last_played":1660455868},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite Co-op Games to play w friends!
