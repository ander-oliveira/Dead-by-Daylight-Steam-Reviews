It something you dont see all day. \nAsymmetic means that you play one of of two sides: \nYou can either play on a qualitatively inferior side with more people or you can play alone on the qualitatively superior side. You might have heard or read about the game being heavily one-sided and I agree, it is true. But not exactly all what you heard is true. Its not the one side or the other that is heavily one-sided. Depending on what rank you play you will have either an easy or a hard time. It also depends on your mates and the players you play against. And on top of that the game will change the moment a new Killer or Survivor comes out. So we have a flowing Meta that changes direction every few months.\n\nPlaying this game might make you cry and scream or laugh (maybe maniacly) but in the end it is a complex game that never gets boring or outdated. I played it for a few hours now (nearly 1,4k) and I know there are other people that played it more.... like... a lot.

Eso sí, tiene una de las comunidades más toxicas de los videojuegos, por lo que no se sorprendan a los nuevos de ser humillados y burlados por los jugadores veteranos, pero no se preocupen, cuando entiendan las reglas y armen sus estrategias, podrán regresarles la basura que les tiren.","timestamp_created":1649476048,"timestamp_updated":1649476048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.767224907875061035","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113555008","author":{"steamid":"76561198930444421","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1067,"playtime_at_review":6598,"last_played":1660485059},"language":"english","review":"SWF all the time with same builds tryhard, sweaty nothing more","timestamp_created":1649472670,"timestamp_updated":1656772425,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488033533096313477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113554918","author":{"steamid":"76561199116277515","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":43896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1098,"playtime_at_review":35737,"last_played":1660537001},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy divertido, solamente tienes que aprender las mecacinas y paciencia a mejorar","timestamp_created":1649472528,"timestamp_updated":1649472528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113554813","author":{"steamid":"76561198110171675","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":215110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212052,"last_played":1657923556},"language":"english","review":"After putting 3500 hrs into this account and 500 on a different account. I can positively say I would not recommend this game. After six years you would think they would fix some of the same issues from 2016. I will list some of my main issues down below. I am a content creator so that's why I have so many hours of the game. Dead by Daylight is not a good game and I would say not good for your health as well. There are only three reasons why you keep playing DbD. Hoping you go big on it, playing with friends which is fine or there's nothing else like DbD because all 4v1 have failed. Most of you guys have to understand there are a lot of new ones coming out this year like EvilDead, VHS, and Leatherface who all seem to be a better choice, and who knows what else is out there hiding. I feel BHVR has left a nasty taste in their fanbase and some are just blinded by a Stockholm Syndrome that seems impossible to do on a video game but BHVR has done it by giving cheap bloodpoint codes and really bad events with terrible free skins with twitch prime. My list below and why the game is bad.\n\n- Why is this game locked on 60fps? Why? because the game was built on a spaghetti coding and they cant fix it. You have to go the files and do it yourself but even that. The game still runs like poop.\n\n- Battle pass and events, While I was ok at a point with it but now it's just mostly reskins and the rift is so pointless and dumb. Do you remember how many AFK pig games you had? I came back after 5months of not playing and that's all I got. They don't know how to balance rift at all. I remember a time where events were cool like the Scorching Summer but no, we get pointless things\n\n- Bandaid fixes - BHVR over the years just made perks or a bloodlust type of thing to fix issues, other than fixing it they just put out a perk to bandaid it and now the game is really bad with how many perks.\n\n- The GRIND IS TOO LONG! as someone who has over 4k hours, and countless BP events, you would think I would be close to being done with things. Nope, BHVR wants you to suffer and make the grind longer so you play more. Smart tactic but a crappy way to treat your fans and not to mention there's no search bar to find certain perks and no mute bloodweb. It's a simple small request but it would take them 6 months to add it just like anything they do.\n\n- Hackers & Bots, I understand its hard to fix this type of issue but not telling your fanbase because your afraid on giving the hackers a edge is the dumbest thing ever. Wheres the transparency? Its because they dont want people to leave the game the numbers are dropping on steam like crazy. Do you remember when hackers were able to get in the contet creators lobby and write hateful stuff? OH YEAH IT TOOK THEM 5 years to add a profanity filter. Like wth.\n\n- No Streamer/Privacy Mode, the one they have in game is a joke, doesn't hide names in lobby or after the game. its pure laziness if you ask me, no delay button so stream sniper cant get into a game.\n\n- Every patch something breaks, I get it. its hard but dang it ima say it. BHVR are kings at breaking every patch than any other devs out there.\n\n\n- Long que times are the future, right now the game is at a point where if you're not playing killer you are sitting in a long que time, good luck trying to find games late at night with friends. Just shows that the killer side is just not fun and overwhelming. Could you just imagine if the game didnt have crossplay? Ughh\n\n\nand you thought I was going to talk bad about MMR? Honestly, I don't care for it, because either way the game is unbalanced so MMR didn't do much other than proving that BHVR doesn't know how to balance a game at a high level, I mean have you seen their dev team play the game?\n\n\n\nLastly, I hope a BHVR dev sees this. I loved your game. I believed in you guys, I was there at Pax East 2016 when you only had 10 people in line. You know it and I know. The only way to fix DbD is to start fresh because your coding is dog crap. Keep making your chapters to survive your game for another month or two but the time will come when more people will see the lies and greed you hold in front of you.","timestamp_created":1649472334,"timestamp_updated":1649472334,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":423,"votes_funny":44,"weighted_vote_score":"0.819522261619567871","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113554572","author":{"steamid":"76561199184748834","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7436,"last_played":1659205623},"language":"english","review":"Insidious

Repetitive gameplay which never seems to improve. The concept of the game has become old and unoriginal. It survives solely on introducing new franchises into the game as the developers seem to be half-arsed about making an actual fun experience at this point. The game continues to favour a toxic playstyle which includes face-camping - at no cost of the killer - while most survivors will, obviously, attempt to make a rescue, albeit there are no punishments for killers, or enough / proper traits for survivors to deal with this issue at most levels. Social interactions are often - as you can imagine - toxic for these same reasons, which is caused by the soulless state of the game.\n\nYour only solace is the fact that you will 'sometimes' have reasonable / enjoyable games. However, this is not a constant-factor - and thus the game fails to fulfill its purpose: Entertainment.\n\nInstead of introducing new killers - half of which you rarely (if ever) experience/meet - the developers should focus on new gamemodes. How about actual objectives - other than generators? Or how about a mode where you are 10 survivors against 2 killers? There are many options left unexplored at this point. \n\nNo. I do not recommend this game - even if you bought it, you would still have to pay an extra fee for some of the enjoyable survivors / killers - either for cosmetic reason, or their actual traits which affect gameplay. In truth - some of them should be part of the base game at this point, or at least make a rotation where some killers / survivors will be free to play.","timestamp_created":1649456499,"timestamp_updated":1649456499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113545500","author":{"steamid":"76561198067986893","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7577,"last_played":1650145588},"language":"english","review":"Fun, simple and puts you on the edge of you're seet","timestamp_created":1649455619,"timestamp_updated":1649455619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113545395","author":{"steamid":"76561199043082518","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":830,"playtime_at_review":45025,"last_played":1660495619},"language":"english","review":"game","timestamp_created":1649455424,"timestamp_updated":1649455424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113544973","author":{"steamid":"76561198134139074","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1178,"playtime_at_review":9931,"last_played":1660602707},"language":"german","review":"Das Spielprinzip macht sehr viel Spaß, sowohl als Killer als auch als Survivor. Es gibt ein paar kleine Bugs hier und da, aber über die kann ich hinwegsehen.\nDas eigentliche Probleme ist die extrem toxische Community. Wenn man solo spielt, gibt es in fast jeder Runde mindestens einen Spieler, der alle anderen manipuliert oder der Killer ist durchgängig am Tunneln oder Campen. Unglücklicher Weise, wird auch nichts gegen diese Spielstile unternommen, teilweise wird es sogar noch belohnt. Zwar kann man nach jedem Spiel andere Spieler reporten, aber das führt, wie in den meisten Spielen, zu nichts.\nInsgesamt sehr schade um so ein gutes Spiel, weil nichts gegen Probleme unternommen
