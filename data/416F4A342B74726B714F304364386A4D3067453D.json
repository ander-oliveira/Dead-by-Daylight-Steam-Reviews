They squander the money and failed projects like Deathgarden, and still haven't fixed core issues with the game since it was launched 3+ years ago.  On top of that, they are constantly breaking things that were working perfectly, like the audio, and then do absolutely nothing to fix it.  The engine update that they performed back in November 2019, broke so many things, especially the audio, and this game relies on audio for ~60% of the game play.\n\nInstead of wasting your money on this piece of crap of a game, spend it on something better.  In the end, you'll be much happier.  The number of players for this game continue to drop, and it's not to far from numbers indicating that the game is in a death spiral.

Dead by Daylight is horror multiplayer coop game in which 4 survivors try to escape 1 killer. They have to fix generators to escape but that will be hard because killer can easily find them. It is fun and I like that they added horror movie characters like Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Pig from Saw. Not all DLCs are great but my favourite is Stranger Things DLC, it is worth money. Game is worth full price but I would recommend you to wait until it is on sale because every time it is 8 euros and that is really cheap for quality of this game. Now downsides. A lot of killers are campers and a lot of players are toxic. There are a lot of bugs and glitches in this game that can lead to your defeat. Hit boxes can be really.. confusing and that MUST be fixed. Good game, I will rate it with okay/10.","timestamp_created":1569081884,"timestamp_updated":1603969751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55217053","author":{"steamid":"76561198069252628","num_games_owned":736,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":48843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":301,"playtime_at_review":46085,"last_played":1659581588},"language":"english","review":"\"sunk cost fallacy\"\nI learned that term from Josh Strife Hayes. \nEarlier I was sitting in queue for of course 30 minutes and I started to think \"Why do I still play this game?\" \nI don't necessarily enjoy playing the matches I do finally get into. The game is very buggy and unbalanced. Everyone is constantly pissed off and crying. And the only small bits of enjoyment I do get from the game is when I'm not playing it properly and am just messing with other players.\n But that's when it occurred to me. I play it because I've already invested money into the base game & DLCs as well as an unhealthy amount of playtime purely through the addictive rush of wondering how the next match will slightly play out differently than the other hundreds that came before it. The same rush I get when I play known to be terrible games like MOBAs and Battle Royales. And that's when I recalled a video talking about dying MMOs that sums up my experience with DBD perfectly. The devs do not care about the balance or well being of their game or players. They take MONTHS and in some cases YEARS to fix game breaking *features* while it only takes them less than a month to drop the next premium skin collection. \nI have made several reviews for this game flipping between YES and NO but every time I change it to YES, it's me just trying to cope with my already wasted money and time. Will I continue to play? Of course.

Dead by Daylight è di sicuro uno dei miei titoli preferiti: Non saprai mai come si svolgerà la partita, contro chi ti ritroverai contro, con quali persone lavorerai per fuggire dalla partita, se insieme o da solo e sopratutto, [b] Ci sono molti modi per personalizzare la propria esperienza di gioco[/b].\nLa possibilità di creare le più bizzarre combinazioni di competenze spinge il giocatore a provare, provare e riprovare il gioco con retrogusti sempre più diversi, e questo grazie anche all'uso di vari oggetti. L'uso di competenze e oggetti di conseguenza, possono cambiare il vostro stile di gioco e l'esito della partita! Vuoi essere il medico della squadra? Colui che ripara i generatori? L'esca? Con le competenze e un po' d'esperienza tutto si può fare.\n\n         [u] Ma le competenze non si limitano solo ai survivor [/u]\n\nFare il killer in mia opinione è molto più difficile che fare il sopravvissuto, poiché bisogna prestare molta più attenzione ai sopravvissuti dal momento che voi siete 1v4 ed il gioco sembra essere dalla parte dei survivor, ma da anche un esperienza di gioco completamente diversa. Ogni killer è dotato di un proprio potere come ad esempio il cacciatore con le trappole o il mandriano con la motosega, ed esso può essere modificato nei modi più svariati possibili tramite l'uso di accessori (come i survivor solo che il potere non ce l'hanno).\n\n[h1] Facciamo il punto!

Now anytime survivors get a semi decent perk it's nerfed into the ground because killers whine they mom doesn't love them if they don't get 4k every match. I have played killer too it's not hard to get a few kills each match using basic mechanics like tracking god forbid you learn to play people, I've gotten immensely better as a killer by learning to play survivor and how survivors think and act. I don't expect to survive every match or get kills every match but I like to have fun, but it doesn't become fun when you get tunneled or camped the whole match. Sure running a killer around is fun until they put hook spawns closer, made pallets spawn further away, add aura seeing perks for killers for just about everything, now several exit/exhaustion blocking perks god forbid I wanna escape can't use a window, or my lithe/dead hard/etc so now your only choice is to walk away from a killer that walks faster than you and is gaining bloodlust.\n\nKillers all bitch and whine and cry literally wanting to remove SWF (I hope they do remove it so it can kill the game and watch as killers wait even longer between matches). Stealth isn't a thing now really might as well run across the map, oh and all the mori perks those are awesome nothing like being killed instantly after your first hook (but decisive strike was op and apparently still is, and so was meddle of man now they are basically useless). Killer is ok but not a ton of skill is involved anymore when perks basically scream at you where someone is, a couple of tracking perks you'll see every so often killers run. I haven't really seen a survivor meta perk build I've seen some common ones but nowhere near as common as a killer meta. It's bullshit when damn near every killers runs same perk all the time you can basically count on altering gameplay around those perks, bbq and chili, noed (let's reward killers for not killing anyone all game but being able to escape one chase with Decisive strike was too much and apparently game breakiing). \n\nI don't play killer all that much because I prefer to play with my friends but playing as a killer isn't as hard as everyone makes it out to be playing as a survivor sucks ass sometimes you have a fair match with a few deaths few runs other times you get stomped, but it is common to get really shitty matches, where a killer tunnels and camps you so now you spend the entire match hanging from a hook and dieing only to be called trash at the end. I would get fun matches where all 4 players died and it wasn't so bad but now it's just shitty it's not even fun anymore.\n\nI've put a lot of hours in but I cannot take this game anymore it's becoming more toxic as the community grows larger, where all they want is to sell killer dlc and people bitch survivors didn't start on the hook for them. Hell survivors can be toxic too some are asshats to the killer (no looping isn't toxic it's our only defense what else do you expect you fucked stealth, the game can go from fun to boring as soon as a killer decides to be a douche), others sandbag you by running a killer over you, they drop pallets in your face so the killer can whack you, etc survivors aren't innocent but atm they have the shit end of the stick. I don't regret my early hours of play through as it used to be a fun game now I get FUN BUGS SUCH AS NOT GETTING TO USE ANY ABILITIES, INCLUDING E PERKS, AND OTHERS SUCH AS HEALING... ANYTHING, BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! STRUGGLING! That's all fun going into a match and being completely fucked over and losing a rare item or getting moried about instantly.\n\nFuck this game fuck the community it used to be good I still love this game it holds a special place as I've met friends through it and had many laughs but it's utter and complete shit now it's not fun anymore to be a survivor killer yeah esp cause you get to join in about bitching about survivors and suggesting how to nerf a survivors perks that don't let you get 4k, you can be a totaly douche nozzle and hold matches hostage!\n\nI don't recommend this game anymore don't give them anymore money play literally anything else. I may come off as a salty survivor but I've played killer I like tracking and stuff but it's not super prevalent most common now is just getting an aura around a survivor for just about anything (waiting on the one that shows you a survivor as they walk or breath), it's just trying to play with friends is ass anymore since most of the game is \"balanced\" (if you can even call it that) around a 4 stack but there is no voice chat or dedicated servers and even then it's ass. That fuckin killer with shitty internet, oh yeah that man is gonna have a field day with you his hits will register when you're clear across a map hopping a window and pallet stunning his ass! Fun right! When your perks activate but like don't that's so fun watching you activate a perk and it does nothing!\n\nRevised cause steams asking, it's still shit and still toxic it's the only game really that does this type of genre so it's addictive but it's still shit, it just has no competition.\n\nSteam asking again, no still whining killer mains even more surv nerf, I have played both sides and neither side was fun but ya devs lets over correct to killer side because they just cry all the time. I'm addicted to the game and I hate so, but I hope one of these times I uninstall it for good, don't waste your time. This game requires too much investment to not get steam rolled by a killer, 200 hours ahh look a baby player, I have 1k hours I still find people with way more hours than me.
