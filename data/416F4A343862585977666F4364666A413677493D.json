just have to let upcoming buyers to know that there is no way anyone in your party of four can be an AI. When you start a lobby, it has to be filled with real players, and it has to be four. Same with the hunter/killer, it cannot be AI. I have short playtime daily and the lobby queue is too long for me during my hours (there seem to be less player). If you are a very private player who just plays with very few friends and who do not like random player joining your game (I remember the L2d2 player trolls), this game isn't for you. You can't even customize your own campaign to just start a private match with just your buddy and you. It wont start. Unlike any multiplayer games I used to play in the past, there is no way a bot can fill the role of your team mate, the game wont start. Besides, I think this game is too much gore and psychological torture for me. I was only interested with the Resident Evil DLC. Nothing against the game, just enlightening people what the game is and how it operates so you know if what you are buying. If you like this game, sure it can be good most especially when you love PVP and just random play with random people. Again, the game wont start until the party of 4, and a killer is filled by real people. AI is totally absent in this game, besides in the tutorial. I think I'm just going to go back to shooting zombies after this refund. I hope the game description highlights the an important fact that \"AI is completely disabled in this game\".","timestamp_created":1625717593,"timestamp_updated":1625717998,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95302792","author":{"steamid":"76561198321873224","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":135490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129618,"last_played":1658417341},"language":"english","review":"it's good to play with your friends, mmk is broken","timestamp_created":1625717512,"timestamp_updated":1625717512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95302634","author":{"steamid":"76561198873379025","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3842,"last_played":1654310561},"language":"english","review":"Butt clenching probably one of the funnest games ive ever played.","timestamp_created":1625717257,"timestamp_updated":1625717257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95302503","author":{"steamid":"76561198811579619","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1626143780},"language":"english","review":"awsome game\n","timestamp_created":1625717079,"timestamp_updated":1625717079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95302378","author":{"steamid":"76561198156329948","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":832,"last_played":1652943519},"language":"english","review":"FYE","timestamp_created":1625716897,"timestamp_updated":1625716897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95301868","author":{"steamid":"76561198315883950","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1630584036},"language":"english","review":"chesecak","timestamp_created":1625716207,"timestamp_updated":1625716207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95301629","author":{"steamid":"76561198941450483","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10960,"last_played":1650564225},"language":"brazilian","review":"Joguinho pra ficar correndo do pedófilo... \nachei bom...

It's fun, but frustrating.\n\nAs someone who mostly plays soloQ survivor, this game isn't and never will be balanced to me. SoloQ survivor is likely the most challenging way to play this game - perks work better with teammates, knowledge is power and you get that with teammates, the killer only needs to worry about themselves but as a survivor you need to worry about 3 others and the killer. \n\nThis recent update (July 19th, 2022) has codified exactly what the developers want: a killer sided game. This update survivors got incredibly nerfed while killers got across-the-board buffs. It's frustrating. It can be demoralizing. The best way I can suggest playing this game is to run the perks you find joy in, and just \"go next.\" Sitting while spectating just to say a few mean words to the killer because you were tunneled out does nothing for you. Play the game, then just move on when you die.\n\nIt's a fun game, immensely fun if you're playing with a group of friends and can laugh and joke together. It can be frustrating, tilting, and demoralizing when playing SoloQ or with killer. But through all the bad, I have over 400 hours in this game and have no intentions of not playing it for 400 more, and all the negative reviews with thousands of hours are the exact same way.
