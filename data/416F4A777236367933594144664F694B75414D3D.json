You get to throw cool hatchets, or be a mad spirit, or have your face covered with nails and they run like chickens when they see you.

Well Dead By Daylight is the game for you! Regardless of what side you play on killer/survivor. There will always be a way to fill that 1 chromosome full of rage Pal. Once booting the game up for the first time you will probably think this game is \"scary\" and intentionally made to scare people. But BHVR haven't really made this \"Wonderful\" game like that. Instead Dead By Daylight is a game where you and 3 other survivors will search around the map they're in for generators. ( There is always 7 generators in each map) The survivors objective is to repair generators while hiding from the killer, The killers objective to hunt these 4 survivors and to brutally murder them, But the killer has to hit a survivor 2 times before they can hook them( First hit makes the survivor going into the injured state, The second hit will put them into the dying state on the ground) Once a survivor is downed the killer can pick them up and go towards the nearest hook( The hook system is once a survivor is hooked, They are put into the 1st hook stage which will mean the next time they're hooked they will be on second hook once on second hook that certain survivor will have the \"entity\" grab them and start trying to finish the survivor off, You will be challenged will \"difficult skill checks\" those skill checks get harder as your hook progress starts to degenerate). I am going off topic at this point, Ok so you are here for a game which will \"grind your gears\" as i have said previously. Yes? Ok after playing this game for a certain amount of time you will start to understand the concepts as \"camping the hook\",\"tunneling\" and proxy camping. all of those things are really annoying while playing as survivor, These tactics will cause certain players to throw insults in the end game chat. If you do respond to thou survivor while playing as killer they will start to mald and complain on how tunneling and camping or whatever you did is unfair. Usually the survivors that say this are either playing as Claudette Moral, Or Nea Karlsson, From my experience at least I find it funny when the survivors don't get a response from the killer, If you do not respond to them they will usually resort to tossing some Salt into your steam profile by commenting. Fortunately this can be prevented by having a private profile, Having a private profile makes those survivors even more salty on a rare occasion thou survivor will send you a friend request to hop into your lobby to sprinkle some salt into the lobby in-game chat.

Dead by Daylight is NOT beginner friendly and also fails to give players (killers and survivors) a clear overlook of the game. you literally have to teach most of the things about this game yourself or you watch 20 youtube videos to fully understand it. Furthermore i feel like the perk system is unbelievably shit. just unnecessarily complicated and the time it takes to get the perks you want is simply unacceptable. Also Dead by Daylight is basically pay to win because for a lot of perks you actually need to spend money unless you are willing to wait a few years so they can occasionally come up in the store (4 random perks, 2 killer and 2 surv, changes weekly). Ignoring the countless bugs, glitches and hackers, how much fun a round is depends A LOT on the other side. if i play killer i get toxic survivors who constantly teabag or click flashlights after jumping a window or dropping a pallet, when i play survivor i get camping and tunneling killers which isnt forbidden or anything but is extremely frustrating especially because the game makes it so incredibly easy to do so. Why do i need to waste an entire perk slot to protect the person getting unhooked to get instadowned again? the game is also too killer sided in solo q games and too survivor sided in swf's.\ntheres

tienes muchas mas ventajas como la velocidad de movimiento aparte de que tu eres el guachicoleador y como sobreviviente no le puedes hacer dano al enemigo xd, con amigos se disfruta bastante, las

The fun aspects rely a lot on how you and other players play the game, survivors can just slam the gens playing at peak efficiency to end the game asap, and killers can knock down every survivor, or camp every survivor to death, none of which are fun to deal with or play. The grind as well can be very annoying to deal with, especially as you unlock more things, only advice I can give to help with that is don't be afraid to spend your bp on tier 3 perks since that will take it out of the pool of things that can show up. Also if you know a game is already over and you're just waiting for the other people to leave, go ahead and break a few pallets your heal your team for the extra bit of bp.

There are far better games to play in both co-op & PvP categories \n\n\nhave on-and-off watched content on this game since it's early development, and finally gave it a try during the Epic free-for-all, before buying the game and migrating my info over to Steam. Played since late November 2021 \n\ngame has a very high learning curve, even after watching it for a long while. requires a HEAVY amount of time and grinding investment, even just to get the perks you want on the characters you want, as in this game has become a full-time job for almost half a year. even when you're playing survivor, the team mode, people still sabotage matches in that they sandbag (collab with the killer), or just flat-out cheat the game (doesn't matter how many times devs have done cheater-wipes, they're still very much present). so many perks, and killer powers and add-ons, are unbalanced to the point that many players only favor certain killers, and perk builds, so very little room for successful experimentation. rank only matters for getting monthly bloodpoint bonuses, mmr is a joke and a half that you no longer have any indicators to see if it's working or not. and even in Survive With Friends, which makes the game somewhat easier, people can still be toxic and ruin the thrills you want to have with your friends \n\nEven if you don't disconnect, game will still \"disconnect from host\" randomly, and you get the d/c timeout penalty regardless if it was the game's error or not \n\ndoesn't matter if you're killer or survivor, you will be sweating, you will be frustrated, you will have your buttons pushed, you will try your hardest and still lose a lot, and many fun, friendly, and/or good games are few and far between\n\nany pros?  Still an intense game of hide-and-seek & cat-and-mouse, all-in-one ; base concept and mechanics of the game are solid, just not it's execution ; game at least inadvertently teaches you how to manage anger and stress on a consistent basis ; and, of course, the few and far between fun, friendly, and/or good games that I hope to get and gamble my time for \n\nif it weren't for the fact that friends

The game play loop itself is very fun, but the ultimate failing of this game is the god-awful balancing.\n\nI have primarily spent my time playing killer, and I can confidently say after 126 hours, that you will only encounter about 5 fun games out of 100. I like the games where I feel like I am being challenged, but I still have a chance if I play it well. Unfortunately, this is not the case most of the time. The matchmaking in this game is so terrible, sometimes it will match you with people who have very clearly just bought the game and have no idea what they're doing - This is not fun, not for me as the killer, stomping them to the ground and I can't imagine it being fun for the survivors either.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, you will very often get matched with people who have dedicated their lives to this game. I've been matched with people who have played over 10k hours in this game, and boy let me tell you, it's not fun being stomped by good survivors either.\n\nThis leads me to another point, toxicity. This game has a massive issue with toxic players, who will constantly t-bag and emote at you to taunt you, and then proceed to write EZ in the end-game chat. Sometimes, they will even flame you for being bad, completely disregarding that you have a fraction of the hours they have played.\n\nI really wish I could recommend this game, because the core fun is definitely there. The developers just need to open their eyes and ears, and finally listen to their community. I am far from the only one who has these gripes with the game, it's wide-spread.\n\nI don't know if I will be playing this going forward, my life is too short for frustrating and unfun experiences. I will listen in on the announcements coming on the 16th, in hopes that the developers have finally decided to listen to their community. From what I have heard from the community, though, I should not get my expectations up.\n\nEdit after 73 more hours:\n\nSo, I got pretty good at killer. Too good, it seems. Now, all fun has been drained from the game entirely, now I face people with meta perks, bringing in toolboxes with brand new parts to just rush down the gens, leaving me time to do absolutely nothing. I haven't grinded out any of the gen-regression perks, so there is just straight up nothing I can do.\n\nI decided today that I will quit this game for my own mental health, it makes me more angry than it is worth. I sincerely hope this review will help the game get better, or at the very least help some people NOT try out this game if they're expecting a balanced experience.","timestamp_created":1652401866,"timestamp_updated":1653154786,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653258860111236572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115365615","author":{"steamid":"76561198436754252","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23349,"last_played":1658475004},"language":"koreana","review":"good game~~","timestamp_created":1652401392,"timestamp_updated":1652401392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115365516","author":{"steamid":"76561199143506882","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":212,"playtime_at_review":1048,"last_played":1660543316},"language":"english","review":"Its wicked fun!","timestamp_created":1652401206,"timestamp_updated":1652401206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr66y3YADfOiKuAM="}
