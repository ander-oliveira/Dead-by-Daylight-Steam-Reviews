Wow, times flies. This game is addictive, its fun, and when you first play its scary. There is a  learning curve, and because I watch way more Twitch plays than I play, I'm still on the newbie side of it. That's okay with me. I don't think you'll find a game like this anywhere. It draws out so many emotions from match to match, fear, anxiety, frustration, anger, and then sweet relief whether you're playing killer and manage to sacrifice everyone or you're playing survivor and manage to escape. The thing is, if you take your games very seriously, this might not be the game for you. The worse thing about this game is the community. The best thing about this game is the community. The community can be very toxic, demanding, obnoxious and trollish all in one game. They can also be helpful, altruistic, and capable.  It is better if you play with a friend or two when playing survivor. I recommend watching vids for some ideas when playing killer.

Some of them are bland at times, and over time they just become a series of shapes and obstacles, but to fresh eyes they can be genuinely disturbing and creepy. Some of them even offer environmental storytelling, like the shackles in Mother's Dwelling, the collapsed mine shaft entrance in Suffocation Pit, Freddy's claw marks on the walls in Badham, etc. And no matter what, the tension of going into the basement in each map is great. The sudden shift in the ambient sound and lighting, knowing there is only one way in and out, and its inherent riskiness is a fun element.\n\n-  The Lore. It's pretty interesting, and I genuinely wish there was more information on each of the characters. They are slowly adding more, but i'd pay money for a movie about each of the killers in a heartbeat.\n\n- The Gameplay. It feels awesome to escape by the skin of your teeth, or to find that last survivor just before they make their escape. Plus, the distant sound of that well-hidden bear trap catching someone is like a shot of dopamine.\n\n- The fact that there are licensed characters from movies available to play as! Michael Myers, Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, and more!\n\n- Regular updates and new content\n\n\n***The Things I Don't Like***\n\n- Holy shit the community can be toxic. Like Chernobyl levels of toxic, which is neat because one of the maps is set in the woods around Chernobyl, so that's kind of immersive. *MOST* of the time, people are pretty easygoing in aftergame chat, but it feels like about 1/3 of the time, you get someone who is absolutely DETERMINED to try and ruin your day. There is a chronic problem of Sore Winners. If you are argumentative, easily frustrated, or have a history of self-esteem issues or depression, disable the aftergame chat for your own sanity.\n\n- There is no way to effectively communicate with your team if you are playing as a solo survivor. You must resort to third-party voice chat, like Discord, in order to communicate at all, not counting the Point and Come Here emotes the survivors have.\n\n- Coordinated Survivor Teams are the other extreme from the point above. At times, the Killer has no hope of succeeding against a competent team that is able to communicate across the map. One person can serve as a distraction or report on the Killer's movement, and the other survivors can react as necessary. It flips the power roles and can make for a pretty un-fun game that didn't feel fair. \n\n- The Gameplay. Some mechanics are very easily abused and are subject to Dominant Strategy. If a killer focuses on a single survivor at a time and systematically eliminates each one, aka \"Tunneling\", there isn't a whole lot of counterplay against it. If a group of survivors all pile onto the same generator and get them done as quickly as possible, aka \"Gen Rushing\", there isn't much the killer can do about it. In both situations, about the only thing a player can do is try to salvage as many points as they can and hope the players in the next match stick more to the spirit of the game rather than their definition of \"Winning\".\n\n- Some of the best perks are behind a paywall. Individually, the DLC for this game is pretty cheap, but if someone is just starting out, you're looking about at the price of a brand new AAA game to catch up with everyone else in terms of characters and perks. There is a way to acquire these perks with in-game currency in the Shrine of Secrets, but the currency accrues very slowly and there are only 2 survivor perks and 2 killer perks available for purchase this way each week, and the ones up for grabs are NOT limited to the DLC characters. In several years, 2 of the best perks, Hex: Ruin and Barbecue and Chili, have been in the Shrine only once or twice each.\n\n- There are several killers which are viewed as OP, which in some cases can be a fair assessment. Several of the killers have extremely high mobility, which allows them to better patrol the map and surprise survivors. Some have one-hit down capability. Some require a survivor to make a mistake first that can then be capitalized on. This leads to another Dominant Strategy situation where in high-rank matches, people will naturally gravitate towards the Killers with the least amount of counterplay available, and Survivors will naturally gravitate more towards Gen Rushing, SWF, etc. Both of these factors contribute to one another and it has become a self-sustaining system. In Red Rank matches, the likelihood of playing against The Nurse, The Hillbilly, or The Spirit rises dramatically. You will almost never run into The Clown or The Pig at rank 1.\n\n- Perceived Developer Bias. The devs are constantly working to improve the game, but have demonstrated a visible bias towards survivor players, specifically towards newer survivor players. It makes sense mathematically, they make up 4/5 of the players in each match, and they don't want to frustrate new players out of ever playing the game again with a steep difficulty curve. However, they seem to have a certain amount of tone-deafness at times to the part of the community that tends to play Killer. For example, since the introduction of The Hag, her perk Hex: Ruin became pretty much *Mandatory* for high-ranked killers to use in order to give the Killer enough time to have a chance of winning the match. High-Ranking survivors are competent enough to finish generators very quickly, and Ruin was used to, in the words of Monto, Slow the game down, just a lil' bit, and give the Killers a fighting chance. The Killer community complained for a very long time about how fast the gens were being done, but the first action the devs took to address it was by completely changing how Ruin worked, and in their patch notes about the change, specifically said they had \"Taken a look at what made it so frustrating to play against\". This led many people to conclude that they were siding with survivors and not listening to the killers' claims, and treating the prevalence Ruin as the issue, not as a symptom of a greater problem. In their defense, the devs stated that they couldn't accurately compile data on gen speeds in high-rank games due to Ruin's extremely heavy use, and this was the first step towards trying to correct the overall issue. (Which they later took more steps to fix, such as making changes to the Survivor's Toolboxes, making changes to the perk Prove Thyself, etc.) The issue is the devs gave the impression that they were only listening to the lower-rank survivor players, and seemed to handwave what killer mains had been complaining about for a long time.\n\n- Expensive cosmetics. There are some *AWESOME* cosmetics for most of the characters, but the best ones clock in at about $10 a pop. There are some characters that you could probably end up spending over $100 on for cosmetics ALONE. Yikes.\n\n- Rage Quitting. For a long time, players disconnecting at the drop of a hat was a SCOURGE in this game. If a single survivor disconnected, it could pretty much sink the other survivors' chances of escaping, resulting in multiple disconnects. Killers were also prone to doing this, and both sides had a habit of doing it for purely arbitrary reasons. The devs introduced a penalty recently that prevents players from playing for X amount of time after disconnecting, with the time increasing with each subsequent disconnect. It's greatly improved the experience, but some people will still DC if they get upset. \n\n\nWith all of that being said, overall, i fucking love this game. There is a reason that with a fulltime job i have still managed to sink around 600 hours into it thus far. It's a great time and can work as a party game pretty well, and it is a great casual game. As with all things, there are people who take it *WAY* too seriously, but they are in the minority.
